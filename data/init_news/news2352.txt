As you gentlemen undoubtedly know Week 1 of the 2016 NFL season concluded with its usual and unusual fanfare roaring crowds jammed parking lots overserved fans heartfelt renditions of The Star Spangled Banner with some players kneeling others raising their fists and an entire team locking arms and several exciting games decided by just one pointWhile each contest this past weekend had its own series of questionable plays viewers were at least assured a baseline sense of accuracy and truth in the outcome Thats because theres a system in place to examine and confirm every score turnover or controversial play The NFL has tweaked its instantreplay rules over the years in an effort to offer a sense of transparency to fans casual fantasy players and bigtime bettors following the action in Vegas Although there probably always will be some plays that will generate partisan debate the NFL has basically brought factchecking into its games through the use of instant replayDoesnt the most important contest in the country deserve the same treatment After working in Silicon Valley for the past decade I have learned that digital technology can take democracy to a new level Today facts videos photos and public documents are all readily available online for anyone to see When presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared on last weeks primetime forum with NBCs Matt Lauer Americas collective BS detector started to sound  loudlyAlmost immediately the electorate and the media began to question whether the moderators of the upcoming presidential debates can hold the candidates to a basic standard of truthTherefore since the future of our country and the world is at stake I propose that the Commission on Presidential Debates change course and reform a clearly antiquated debate system and bring it into the information age Specifically I urge you as heads of the commission to leverage the technology built in this country by immigrants and the children of immigrants to perform realtime factchecking on stage during the debatesHere is my proposal During the first presidential debate on Sept 26 the moderator NBCs Lester Holt should go about his business as usual sitting in front of the candidates and posing questions  but be joined by a team of factcheckers from Factcheckorg a project run by the nonpartisan Annenberg Public Policy Center itself part ofDonald Trumps alma mater the University of Pennsylvania Just like in professional football games each side would be given two challenges The candidates could then use them over the course of the 90minute debate If one heard a lie during the others response he or she could press a button that would illuminate a red light at his or her podium Once the other side finished its response the moderator would allow the candidate who threw the red flag to explicitly challenge the statement at issueMembers of the factcheck team would then go to work to determine the veracity of the answer and relay their findings to the moderator If the challenger were to be correct then he or she would still have two challenges and the candidate whose statement was found false well would be shown to be a liar in front of the whole country If however the challenge were to be unfounded  and the speakers statement is determined to be factually sound  then the challenger would lose one of his or her challenges and be shown as illinformedThe candidates wouldnt be the only ones who could issue a challenge however Just like how the NFL automatically reviews plays during the last two minutes of a half the debate moderator and the factcheckers could weigh in on any possible mistruths after the closing remarks and make the call without a candidates being able to respondSo careful what you say Mr Trump and Secretary Clinton because under this scenario you would not have the final word  the truth wouldAlthough its no gameshow gimmick this new format would make for riveting political theater and has the potential to bring in more than the 100 million expected debate viewers Most important though those who tune in could expect to hear verifiable facts even if only on a few nightsI have bounced this idea off a few colleagues and business leaders and their response has been the same They love it but it would take way too long This seemed to be a fair point so I decided to test it I took the subject of immigration and the proposed Great Wall of Mexico I wanted to see what each candidates record or position was on securing Americas southern border Trump has changed and restated his proposed policy of deporting 11 million immigrants in dizzying fashion During his Fox News discussion with Sean Hannity his proposal to grant amnesty came back on the table Yet during his speech days later in Phoenix it wasnt Sourcing these facts required mere microseconds in a YouTube search It took me 075 seconds to find on Google what Secretary Clinton had said during her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention We will not build a wall A second search that took another 054 seconds however turned up a Senate roll call vote on Sept 29 2006 when thenSenator Clinton voted for what is known as the Secure Fence Act of 2006 This bill authorized the allocation of 7 billion to build and fortify a 700mile fence across all of Arizonas border with Mexico as well parts of those of California New Mexico and Texas So basically this factcheck took about 12 seconds of searching and a few more seconds of reading Given what happened last week at the Commander in Chief Forum hosted by NBC News my former employer in front of a live audience of veterans and families of veterans I decided to focus on the muchscrutinized topics of email servers and Iraq Secretary Clintons assertion that she took her use of the private email server very seriously and did exactly what I should have done stood somewhat in contradiction to what FBI Director Comey said on July 5 when he clearly observed about Clintons staffers There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information In other words if challenged Secretary Clinton would have lost this round of factchecking Trump has claimed that he was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the very beginning In this case I consulted Factcheckorg which described a Sept 11 2002 appearance by Trump on The Howard Stern Show when the host asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq and Trump responded Yeah I guess so The YouTube video of this segment is like the replay that clearly shows that the ball came out before the knee touched the ground  it doesnt lie Working in media and technology as we do here at Salon I fully recognize that this concept like any innovative idea needs betatesting A director at Factcheckorg told me Holding candidates accountable for making false statements is an admirable goal but live factchecking is a dangerous thing to do He cautioned I would be wary of it and in general use it only if the statement in dispute already has been thoroughly researched and proven clearly false Thats a high bar of course and perhaps thats just as well The 2016 debates are only a couple of weeks away and we have some more work to do to get this concept ready for primetime But an interim step could be taken immediately Both CNN and MSNBC have begun using a factcheck crawl at the bottom of the screen during their coverage of speeches This is a great first step one we would like to see the commission mandate for all the networks carrying the debates so that the viewing public could see the record set straight in real time I am not naive enough to think that these actions would stop the deceptive remarks but it would certainly make the candidates think twice about it  for once Note A phone message left yesterday to the commission was not returned
