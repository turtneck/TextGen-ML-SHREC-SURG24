WASHINGTON  President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage paid sick leave and universal prekindergartenInstead of Capitol Hill those victories happened in city halls state houses and county buildings far from WashingtonAt least six major cities  Chicago Philadelphia Pittsburgh Seattle Tacoma Wash and Washington DC  have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this years State of the Union Address Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage 17 states and six major cities have taken action including Los Angeles last weekObamas stateandlocal strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition Though previous administrations have appointed top advisers to listen to concerns of state and local officials the Obama White House appears to be the first to aggressively use those same channels to encourage them to adopt Obamas policiesIt is a change in the paradigm where we used to sit passively by waiting for elected officials to come to us We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate said Valerie Jarrett the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairsI think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate Jarrett said in an interviewObama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers so his persuasion is a form of soft power  the phone part of what Obama has described as a penandphone strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperationHes found fertile ground in Democraticrun cities such as Seattle where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since AprilPresident Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally Murray said That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle which often doesnt get the national attention East Coast cities do The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us We do other things beside ecommerce and coffee Murray saidTheres also resistance Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper Va and the director of the American City County Exchange a yearold initiative of the smallgovernment American Legislative Exchange CouncilRussell said states  not cities not Congress and not the president  should be the primary regulator of labor conditions Obama he said is hopskipping over the statesWith the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party he doesnt have the allies there that he used to Russell said To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising Its the only allies he really hasThe strategy has been more effective on some policies than others Since last September more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brothers Keeper initiative a commitment to help boys and young men of color But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January only a handful have moved in that directionThe stateandlocal strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year Fortythree million workers have no paid sick leave  43 million Think about that Obama said So Ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their ownThat pledge came with a 1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments which will begin to be awarded this summerObama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a Lead on Leave tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago Perez has been to Portland Ore Pawtucket RI St Petersburg Fla and SeattleTuesday Perez will be in Minneapolis which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this monthPerez said its a mistake to view the stateandlocal strategy as separate from a larger effort Our strategy is an alloftheaboveandthensome strategy he saidHe said Obama will continue to use executive orders as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to 1010 an hourWe want Congress to act and Im confident that its a when question not an if question But were also not going to wait around for Congress to act Perez saidAlthough focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obamas presidency state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017 That number which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordinglyThats nothing to sneeze at Thats progress Jarrett saidSan Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006 requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books according to A Better Balance a New Yorkbased legal advocacy group that tracks such lawsA year ago advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue said the groups copresident Sherry Leiwant After a White House Working Families Summit last year and again after Januarys State of the Union Address theres been an explosion of interest by state and local lawmakers she saidThe White House leadership on this issue has been huge Its had a real impact Leiwant said That influence on mayors or governors who are Democrats but havent paid a lot of attention to this issue or they want to be probusiness Democrats this gives them a lot of coverA Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone but while the government is divided at the national level the best strategy is to go to localities and statesA citybycity strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated Every state grants different home rule powers to cities  and even different powers to differentsized cities in the same statePhiladelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to privatesector workers but Pittsburghs law applies only to some nonunion city workers Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her citys effort a lot of momentum but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide lawTheres also pushback from the opposite direction Last month the Pennsylvania Senate voted 3712 to preempt the Philadelphia law taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governmentsThat bills sponsor state Sen John Eichelberger Jr said its untenable to have 2562 municipalities with different labor standards forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rulesPhilosophically I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda whether its liberal or conservative or otherwise he said Its just not the place to adopt these policiesObama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments said Matthew EshbaughSoha who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North TexasIm really struck by one why hasnt anybody thought of this before And two this could be a very effective strategy EshbaughSoha said At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and youre not able to break through the gridlock of Congress I think its ingeniousHes skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who dont support Obamas policiesJarrett said the effort is starting to snowball She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy As more cities and states have passed those policies its emboldened othersSuccess begets success she said What the evidence has begun to show is its not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay offIndeed Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013 But three weeks after Obamas State of the Union Address this year Nutter reversed courseWhat changed Nutter said the economy was better and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passedBill Greenlee the councilman who sponsored the measure said Nutter completely turned a corner on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union and if youre a Democrat and a supporter of the presidents agenda in general thats gotta have an effect Greenlee saidNutter did make a symbolic nod to Obamas influence in signing the paid leave bill He signed it with a pen Obama gave him  after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to 12 an hour
