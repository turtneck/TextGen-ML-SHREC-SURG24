Tweet Widget by MOVE People The Philadelphiabased MOVE family was horribly victimized by police in 1978 and 1985 The first atrocity led to the mass imprisonment of MOVE members the second assault killed five adults and six children and burned down a city block No cops have ever been punished but the MOVE 9 remain in prison and were this year once again denied parole They couldnt kill us that day so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons When You Speak Up for the MOVE 9 You Speak Up for Yourself by MOVE People This article previously appeared on Move 9 blogspot  The District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer The MOVE 9 Have been eligible for Parole since August 2008 After being in prison for 30 years We have repeatedly been denied In June of this year 2016  we were denied parole again  for a total of ten years past the time we should have been released One of the reasons the parole board gave to justify not releasing us is that we are a threat to the safety of the community This is not true People are not afraid of MOVE People Move People aint strangling people to death shooting people in the back It aint MOVE that killed a man in front of his fianc and four year old child MOVE is not drive by shooting or terrorizing folks in the community Its the community who is faxing emailing and calling the parole board asking for our release on parole It is the Parole Board and DA John Straub who continue to deny our release for no valid reason On August 8th 1978 hundreds of cops attacked our home at 300am in the morning trying to kill us They couldnt kill us that day so they are trying to finish the job in these prisons but understand John Straub and the Parole Board are not justified MOVE did not go out to the Polices house to do them harm The Cops came to our house because a judge sent them to our house to serve bench warrants for not appearing in court not for rape murder kidnapping or abuse but for not appearing in court for a civil matter Understand this hundreds of cops were sent to our home while we were asleep dressed in swat gear armed with all type of weaponry semi automatic weapons fire fighters smoke bombs tear gas a deluge gun a crane and a bulldozer to serve bench warrants for a housing code violation Move People aint strangling people to death shooting people in the back It was the Police who came to Moves premises They came armed to the teeth and in their frenzy to kill MOVE they killed one of their own and condemned us for it We are not making this up The evidence is clear The whole world witnessed the attack on the MOVE house May 13th 1985 where the house was bombed into a blazing inferno the six adults were shot and killed and the five children were shot back into the house by police as they tried to escape the burning flames where they died  These are proven Facts During the citys investigation hearing it was ruled that the cops used excessive force and the killings were wrongful deaths Those children were our children in that house that day yet not one cop or official connected to the bombing of our family were held accountable responsible for these deaths like the parole board is telling The MOVE 9 we have to take responsibility for a crime when the District Attorney never proved MOVE had killed a police officer We have no weapons charges and the judge admitted on public radio to the caller Mumia Abu Jamal a radio journalist at the time that he didnt have the faintest idea who shot the police officer Its a fact that world renowned forensic experts Dr Ali Hameli and Claus Speth ruled the deaths of the children HOMICIDES in a scathing report against the city submitted to the assistant District Attorney Joan Weimer but the grand jury did nothing Its time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice The Move 9 have spent almost 40 years in prison for killing a cop with no real proof The whole world saw the Philadelphia police murder our children and family and they have not spent a day in prison for it But what is the difference in these lives Does a MOVE child not bleed when they are shot Does a MOVE parent not feel pain when their baby is killed just because they are not cops or officials Does the murder of a MOVE child the pain of MOVE parent the heartache of a black persons suffering still fall on deaf ears like the slaves who cried out when their babies women and men were sold killed and whipped by slave owners Ask yourself Things may seem to have changed since those awful days but the mentality is still very much existing Just look around and listen Black lives Dont Matter Thats why these cops are getting away with killing Black Men Women and Children Thats why The MOVE 9 are still in prison almost 40 years for killing a cop and the cops responsible for killing 11 MOVE people five of them children are walking around like they are clean and without guilt Its the mentality that makes them feel nothing after killing people Because to them MOVE lives Dont matter Its time for everybody to start speaking freely in protest of all this free wheeling injustice People must understand this necessity of speaking out now We are asking for people to sign The Petition we have aimed at United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch demanding that The United States Justice Dept open up an investigation into the ongoing and wrongful imprisonment of The MOVE 9 People can sign the petition at Httpscausescom92454freethemove9  Speak out with the understanding that when speaking of MOVE you are speaking up for yourself It cant get better for MOVE without getting better for you Looking Forward To The May 2017 MOVE Conference In Philadelphia Ona Move
