As flames property destruction and violent confrontationsspread across West Baltimoreon Monday night state and federal authorities were quick to draw a distinction between rioting and socalled legitimate forms of protestI condemn the senseless acts of violence by some individuals in Baltimore that have resulted in harm to law enforcement officers destruction of property and a shattering of the peace in the city of BaltimoreUS Attorney General Loretta Lynchsaid in a statementThose who commit violent actions ostensibly in protest of the death of Freddie Gray do a disservice to his family to his loved ones and to legitimate peaceful protesters who are working to improve their community for all its residentsSimilarly Maryland Gov Larry Hogan on Monday argued that there is a significant difference between protestingand violenceThat declaration has become a common refrain in the aftermath of racially charged civil unrest When Ferguson Missouri erupted last year over the shooting death of an unarmed black teenagerand a grand jurys decision not to indict the police officer who pulled the trigger President Barack Obamadrew a sharp rhetorical linebetweenthose who just want their voices heard around legitimate issues and the handful of people who may use the grand jurys decision as an excuse for violenceBut scholars of American social movements say the distinction might not be so clear Instead they argue rioting is often what happens when marginalized groups feel they have no other outlet for expressing their grievancesWhat you have in places where rioting tends to occur is the longrunning abandonment by institutions said Justin Paulsona political sociologist at CarletonUniversity in Ottawa Canada Not that theyre fully abandoned its just the institutions you and I expect to make things run smoothly to make peoples lives better are actually turned against the members of these communitiesThe Kerner Commissiona panel established in 1967 by thenPresident Lyndon B Johnson to investigate the root causes for the race riots of the time  suggested as much initsfinal reportIneffectiveness of the political structure and grievance mechanisms was one of themotives fueling riots said the reportMartin Luther King Jr alluded to a similar point in a 1968 speech during which he said it would be morally irresponsible to condemn rioting without at the same time condemning the contingent intolerable conditions that exist in our societyThese conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative to engage in violent rebellions to get attention said King And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheardWilliam Darity Jr a professor of public policy at Duke University said police behavior seems to be the primary source of riots such as the ones whichoccurred in Baltimore and Ferguson as well as the unrest examined by the Kerner CommissionThe fact that police lynchings of unarmed blacks have gone on for upwards of 50 years without any significant steps to curb police behavior makes it clear that trying to protest through established channels doesnt make a difference he saidI am no great enthusiast for anarchy and chaos but I can also understand why at a certain point people say theres no point in behaving and Id like to put this in quotes legitimatelyRick Perlstein a historian who has written extensively about social unrest in the 1960s said a radical sense of dispossession fueled rioting both then and now In particular distrust of the police  and specific incidences of police violence  have often been a major precipitating factor he saidCitingan In These Timesarticle he wrote during the protests in FergusonPerlstein noted that violent encounters with the policeled to the 2015 Baltimore riot 2014 Ferguson riots 1964 Harlem riot 1965 Watts riot 1967 Newark riot and othersThe most recent riots in Ferguson and Baltimore have been much much less intense compared to their predecessors he said Police have become more effective at containing them and cities are not subject to the same demographic pressure they experienced during the Great Migration of the 20th century as AfricanAmericans moved enmasse from the South to northern citiesThere just arent that many places undergoing these kinds of ethnic and racial transitions said Perlstein
