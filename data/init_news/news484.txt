Public funding of elections  that is relying on tax revenue more than private donations to fund candidate campaigns  is a popular campaign finance reform proposal if one that many Americans dont fully embrace Public funding is often thought to free candidates from the burden of fundraising and reduce the influence of wealthy donors and special interests That all sounds good Who likes special interests after allNow new research shows that public funding has an unexpected consequence increased polarization That is public funding makes it harder not easier to elect moderate candidatesThat is the conclusion of political scientist Andrew Hall He focuses on state legislative elections and compares trends in the five states that implemented robust public funding programs  Arizona Connecticut Maine Minnesota and Wisconsin  to trends in other states Here is what he findsBelow is a graph showing the distribution of ideology NP scores in legislatures in states that implemented public financing the treated states and those that did not the control states The first group of states became more polarized after the implementation of public financing But no such change occurred during this time in the states that didnt implement public financingIn a more elaborate statistical analysis Hall examines the gap between Republican and Democratic legislators representing similar districts In a polarized legislature a Republican and a Democrat will tend to vote in very different ways even though they represent essentially the same constituents Hall finds that public financing increases this gap between the parties by 30 percentWhy does public financing appear to have this effect Hall argues that public financing weakens the influence of a maligned but moderating force in elections accessoriented interest groups Public financing reduces the funding supplied by these groups by over 20000 per race on average The problem is that these groups give relatively little to ideologically extreme legislators and much more to moderates Individual donors however have no such preferenceThis leads to a broader point about campaign finance and polarization Much of the debate over campaign finance is based on distinctions between good donors and bad donors Good donors are taxpayers in a public financing system Or in a privately funded system good donors are ordinary citizens sometimes called small donors Bad donors are political party organizations wealthy people political action committees and interest groupsThe problem is that if you want to reduce polarization this way of thinking about donors gets things exactly backward Small donors are a polarizing influence as Adam Bonica has shown Meanwhile wealthy people tend to be a moderating influence The same is true of many political action committees and interest groups The same is true of political party organizations as Brian Schaffner and Ray La Raja argue in this postThats not to say that there arent good reasons to favor public financing or small donors But favoring those things may also mean living with the tradeoff a more polarized and probably less functional politicsNote For a response see this followup post by Seth Masket and Michael Miller
