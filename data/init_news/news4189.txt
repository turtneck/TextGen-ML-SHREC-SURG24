Trump Suffers Bizarre Memory Disorder Says He Always Opposed Obamacare VIDEO By Karen Shiebler on October 26 2016 Oh hahaha That silly old Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is so so funny He doesnt seem to remember anything He doesnt remember what he has done  or what he has said  or what he believed or didnt believe in the recent past Now we have another example of Trump insisting that he said what he didnt say that he didnt say what he said and that he never believed what he said he believed Confused Yup We are too Mediate reports that Trumps memory about Obamacare is very murky too The candidate has been hitting the stump hard claiming that he will overturn the disaster of Obamacare In fact Trump has been claiming to anyone who will listen that he has always been against Obamas health care plan To listen to him you would think that the man had taken to the airwaves as soon as the Affordable Care Act was passed proclaiming that it would be the end of civilization as we know it Except that he didnt After it was announced the other day that insurance premiums are going to be increasing this year Trump pumped his fists and congratulated himself with his usual fervor He crowed to Fox News I think its a disaster and Ive been saying it from the time before they even voted for it I said this is a plan cant work its going to be a disaster He told Rush Limbaugh that  Obamacare is a disaster And you remember I called that from before it was approved I said This cant work because its just  the plan is no good The concept is no good Once again though the truth seems to have nothing in common with Trumps faulty memory In reality back when the law was passed Trump had not yet declared for the Presidency He went on the air with Joy Behar on the day in 2010 when the law was passed She asked him what he thought about the Act and he replied that he had mixed feelings Trump said that he hated to think about people being unable to get health care but he worried about the cost to businesses Then he commented on the President saying Its a pretty tough thing but yeah right now hes certainly looking like a hero So Um Mr Trumps memory is pretty damn shaky if you ask me It seems that he is either trying to desperately to revise reality in order to put himself in a better light or he is suffering from a very serious memory disorder See if you can make any sense at all out of this mess  Featured image via YouTube Screengrab  About Karen Shiebler Karen is a retired elementary school teacher with many years of progressive activism behind her She is the proud mother of three young adults who were all arrested with Occupy Wall Street To see what she writes about in her spare time check out her blog at Empty Nest Full Life Connect
