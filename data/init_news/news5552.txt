The uproar over Donald Trumps latest comments is a classic case of mediagenerated outrageAll over the newspapers all over the airwaves there is shock and horror that Trump would appeal to Russia to furnish Hillary Clintons hacked emailsThe lines seemed so obviously sarcastic to me as I watched Trumps presser from the Democratic convention here in Philadelphia that I didnt see the tsunami coming Maybe Im wrong but as a longtime Trumpwatcher thats how it came off to meBut think about the media coverage for a minute To believe that the Republican nominee was dead serious in urging an adversary of the United States to commit or complete an act of espionage against his Democratic opponent is to believe that Trump is clinically insaneAnd I do think many journalists and commentators view him as a bit unhinged Thats why this makes sense to them They think Trump is so off the wall that it seems perfectly plausibleOthers I believe dont believe Trump really meant it but they think he stepped in it with the remarks and are happy to bash him over itLook Trump says a lot of incendiary things His comments on Mexicans and Muslims and the like get him into trouble and are more than fair game for criticism But this one is differentRussia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing Trump said He added that the press would love thatTrump is a master of course of saying things that are just far enough over the line that he drives a story for days In this case it means keeping a focus on the 33000 emails that Clinton deleted from her private server as pundits and politicians debate whether he crossed a linesiphoning covering from the convention speeches by President Obama Vice President Biden Bill Clinton and othersTrump now says he was being sarcastic and we dont even know whether the Russians are behind the hackingWhats striking about the coverage is that it barely acknowledges that this could be an open questionThe New York Times headline Donald Trumps Appeal to Russia Shocks Foreign Policy ExpertsThere is simply no precedent for this A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalfThe Washington Post lead Republican nominee Donald Trump pleaded directly Wednesday with the Russian government to meddle in the US presidential election by finding and releasing tens of thousands of private emails from his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton  an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented maneuver in American politicsPoliticos lead Donald Trumps call on Russia to hack Hillary Clintons emails has shocked flabbergasted and appalled lawmakers and national security experts across the political spectrum with one saying it was tantamount to treasonIs it possible that Trump was being sarcastic That he was joking CNNs Carol Costello asked her panel The response was no and even if he was it wasnt funnyThis is why professional politicians avoid sarcasm to avoid uttering words that create an uproar But Trump delights in it which is why his supporters love him his detractors view him as reckless and the media can never seem to get enoughHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
