Saturday November 14 following a series of coordinated attacks in Paris the night before that killed scores of people ISIS has claimed responsibilityThree Democratic presidential candidates gathered in Des Moines Iowa for a debate that has been jolted by the terrorist attacks across Paris  which the French President has declared an act of war The mass shootings and explosions swiftly moved national security issues to center stage Saturday during a Democratic primary that has so far largely focused on domestic issues such as income inequality and controversies like Clintons use of private email during her tenure as secretary of stateThe twohour event which began on a somber note with a moment of silence to honor the victims of the Paris attacks also offered a crucial opportunity for Clinton to demonstrate the foreign policy qualifications she honed during her time as the Obama administrations top diplomat The relative inexperience of her rivals  Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley  was also testedBoth Sanders and OMalley seized on the foreign policy discussion to criticize Clinton for her vote in support of the Iraq War when she was in the SenateI would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq something that I strongly opposed has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of al Qaeda and to ISIS Sanders saidOMalley argued that the problem wasnt simply limited to Clintons vote for the Iraq invasion pointing to cascading effects that followedWe need to be much more farthinking in this new 21stcentury era of nationstate failures and conflict Its not just about getting rid of a single dictator he saidClinton meanwhile is certain to be criticized for pointing to the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 in defending her acceptance of Wall Street contributionsI represented New York on 911 when we were attacked Where were we attacked We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is she said I did spend a whole lot of time in their effort to rebuild That was good for New York it was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our countryThe Democratic candidates contrasted themselves against their Republican counterparts on the issue of the refugee crisis in the Middle East Though many GOP presidential candidates have said the US shouldnt accept refugees into the country the Democrats argued that its Americas responsibility to accept those fleeing violence in countries like Afghanistan and Syria with proper screeningCalling for as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine Clinton who has previously stated that the US should accept as many as 65000 new refugees said I do not want us to in any way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our countrySanders said that he didnt want to offer a magic number but that it was the United States moral responsibility to accept refugees in conjunction with its allies in Europe and the Middle EastOMalley also reiterated that the country should accept as many as 65000 refugeesIn one part of the debate that Republicans have quickly seized on no Democratic candidate used the term radical Islam to describe terrorism This phrase is preferred by Republicans who have accused Democrats of shying away from a forthright description of ISISI dont think were at war with Islam I dont think were at war with all Muslims Clinton said Cautioning against painting with too broad a brush she added We are at war with violent extremismSanders meanwhile said he didnt believe the exact term was importantThough much of the debate focused on national security in light of the tragic events in Paris Clinton also sparred with her rivals on hotbutton domestic issues like financial regulatory reform and gun controlProgressives and Wall Street reform advocates have consistently hit Clinton for her perceived closeness with Wall Street particularly as shes raised large sums of money from wealthy donors in the financial industryIve laid out a very aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street Clinton said touting a plan that she said targets not only the big banks but the shadow banking industry as wellAsked to react to Clintons answer Sanders shot back Not good enoughThe Vermont senator said he was the only candidate on stage who did not have a super PAC vowed to break up the big banks and said voters understand that any candidate who accepts contributions from special interests are influenced by them Everybody knows that he saidOMalley also hit Clinton for not backing the reinstatement of GlassSteagall the Depressionera law that split commercial and investment banking Wall Street reform advocates favor bringing back a modern version of the lawI wont be taking my orders from Wall Street OMalley saidLater in the debate Clinton went after Sanders for supporting a measure that she said gave immunity to gun makers and sellers labeling it a terrible mistakeSanders pushed back saying he has voted repeatedly for background checks for gun buyersThe issue of Clintons use of a private email server during her time at the State Department also surfaced but brieflyAs he did in the first Democratic debate Sanders said that he was sick and tired of discussing the controversy and that he would prefer that the media focus on why the middle class is disappearingLetting out a laugh Clinton said I agree completely I couldnt have said it better myselfAsked whether Democrats can feel confident that no other shoe will drop Clinton responded I think after 11 hours thats pretty clear  a reference to her daylong testimony on Capitol Hill where she largely avoided fresh negative headlinesA lot has changed since Clinton Sanders and OMalley met for their first showdown in Las Vegas last monthThere were five candidates on stage at the time Since then two have dropped outLast month the possibility of Joe Biden jumping into the race and upending the partys nomination process loomed large now the country knows that the vice president will not pursue another White House bidAnd Clinton has had fresh momentum heading into the debate After a strong first debate performance her poll numbers have ticked up and shes widened her lead over SandersAnd on Saturday it was clear that Clinton sought to distinguish herself as the candidate with the most experience on the global stage including in the war against terrorism This distinction will no doubt only become more stark in light of the terrorist attacks in ParisWhen the candidates were asked to describe a crisis theyve confronted that shows theyve been tested Clinton used the opportunity to remind viewers that she was secretary of state and adviser to Obama in 2011 when US Special Forces killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin LadenI recommended to the President that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justice Clinton said The excruciating experience she added really did give me an insight into the very difficult problems presidents face
