By Robert ParryThe United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a US presidential election has been manipulated or stolen The wise men of the system simply insist otherwiseWe have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering as in Election 1960 or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent as in Elections 1968 and 1980 or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges as in Election 2000Presidents Richard Nixon George HW Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991 Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy CarterStrangely in such cases it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing but the losing party and the establishment news media as well Protecting the perceived integrity of the US democratic process is paramount Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violatedThe harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders but that truth simply cannot be recognizedOf course historically American democracy was far from perfect excluding millions of people including AfricanAmerican slaves and women The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions such as counting slaves as threefifths of a person for the purpose of representation although obviously slaves couldnt voteThat unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800 In effect the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern nonslave ownersEven after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights the reality for black voting especially in the South was quite different from the new constitutional mandate Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a centuryWomen did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacksIndeed the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960 concentrated largely in Texas a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate Lyndon Johnson could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats the postCivil War party of white SouthernersHowever by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960Nixons Treason So by 1968 the Democrats once solid South was splintering but Nixon who was again the Republican presidential nominee didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance Nixon feared that  with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided  President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee Vice President Hubert Humphrey a decisive boost by reaching a lastminute peace deal with North VietnamPresident Richard Nixon with his thenNational Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South VietnamThough Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason  from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent In a Nov 4 1968 conference call  Secretary of State Dean Rusk National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus with Clifford explaining the thinkingSome elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual Nixon elected Clifford said It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interestsCliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt especially at the presidential level The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that processTo this day the major US news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968 despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin Texas In a puckish recognition of this ignored history the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their Xfile For details see Consortiumnewscoms  LBJs XFile on Nixons Treason The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason  top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in WashingtonNational Security Adviser Walt Rostow shows President Lyndon Johnson a model of a battle near Khe Sanh in Vietnam US Archive PhotoAlthough the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of electionyear dirty tricks the major US news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500000 American soldiers were in the war zone In part because of Nixons sabotage  and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968 See Consortiumnewscoms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate In effect Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality However even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974 he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper reappear as secondary players in the next welldocumented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaignReagans October Surprise Caper In that case President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election So this historical mystery has been Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October SurprisePresident Ronald Reagan delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan 20 1981 as the 52 US hostages in Iran are simultaneously releasedThe testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuverThat evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George HW Bush who was Reagans vice presidential running mateBy early November 1980 the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan 20 1981 his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of ReaganBolstered by his image as a tough guy Reagan enacted much of his rightwing agenda including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle ClassBehind the scenes the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran mostly through Israel what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inaugurationThenVice President George HW Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb 11 1981 Photo credit Reagan LibraryIn summer 1981 when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran he checked on their origins and said later in a PBS interviewIt was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some Americanorigin military equipment  This operation seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980 as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration And I understand some contacts were made at that timeThose early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the IranContra Affair with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist governmentWhile many facts of the IranContra scandal were revealed by congressional and specialprosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s the origins of the ReaganIran relationship was always kept hazy The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go thereA halfhearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on thenPresident George HW Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation In other words Bush who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran was entrusted with proving his own guiltTired of the Story By the early 1990s the mainstream US news media was also tired of the complex IranContra scandal and wanted to move on As a correspondent at Newsweek I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990 I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991PBS Frontlines The Election Held Hostage cowritten by Robert Parry and Robert RossHowever by fall 1991 just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation my exbosses at Newsweek along with The New Republic then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals went on the attack They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980 which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostagesAlthough the bogus NewsweekNew Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked it created a hostile climate for the investigation With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigationMeanwhile Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation deepsixing incriminating documents and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoenaYears later I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station Texas confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980 The US Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr in early November 1991 just as the congressional inquiry was taking shapeWilliamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations wasa cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town for purposes unknown Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov 4 1991Two days later on Nov 6 Beachs boss White House counsel C Boyden Gray convened an interagency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992C Boyden Gray White House counsel under President George HW BushAt the meeting Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the IranContra investigation The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George HW Bushs reelection campaign As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke put it  the White House goal in 1991 was to killspike this storyGray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session Whatever form they ultimately take the House and Senate October Surprise investigations like IranContra will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President Gray declared according to minutes  Emphasis in originalAmong touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time This is Partisan White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 197980 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findingsTimid Democrats But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victoryFormer Rep Lee Hamilton DIndianaThat would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context would not be good for the countryIn 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep Lee Hamilton DIndiana who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 199193 he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issueThe Bush41 White House did not notify us that he Casey did make the trip to Madrid Hamilton told me Should they have passed that on to us They should have because they knew we were interested in thatAsked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion Hamilton said yes because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigationIf the White House knew that Casey was there they certainly should have shared it with us Hamilton said adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure With the money and power of the American presidency at stake the idea that George HW Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was nave in the extremeArguably Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear Then Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but In the years since Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocentStill among the few people who have followed this case the October Surprise coverup would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed  that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored  and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major US media and mainstream historians are concerned For details see Robert Parrys Americas Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnewscoms  Second Thoughts on October Surprise Past as Prologue Lee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history The findings had clear implications for the future as well since the public impression about George HW Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son George W Bush in 2000President George W Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center Florida on May 9 2006 White House photo by Eric DraperIndeed if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and IranContra cases its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination let alone made a serious run for the White House And if that history were known there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000Regarding Election 2000 the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W Bush But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother Gov Jeb Bush and then on five Republican justices on the US Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidencyThe reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were countedHowever between the disputed election and the release of those numbers the 911 attacks had occurred so The New York Times The Washington Post CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House Surely telling the American people that fact amid the 911 crisis would not be good for the countrySo senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the socalled overvotes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the undervotes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines Overvotes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voterHowever instead of leading with Gores rightful victory the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurredFormer Vice President Al Gore Photo credit algorecomOn Nov 12 2001 the day that the news organizations ran those stories I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory In a story that day I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism They had hid the reality for the good of the country much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise caseWithin a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnewscom I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of thenTimes executive editor Howell Raines I got the impression that Barringer had been on the lookout for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bushwon conventional wisdomHowever this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier It was about the futureBy misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 911 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses The Bushwon headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004 For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House see Consortiumnewscoms  Gores Victory   So Bush Did Steal the White House  and  Bush v Gores Dark American Decade A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy there appears to be one common element after the stolen elections the media and political establishments quickly line up shoulder to shoulder to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twistedUS Supreme Court Justice Antonin ScaliaAl Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds as Justice Antonin Scalia said that a count that showed Gore winning when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush would undermine Bushs legitimacySimilarly Rep Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man in part because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powersthatbe that didnt ruffle too many feathersBut the cumulative effect of all these halftruths coverups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many wellinformed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times or in this case assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forestSo when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him many Americans choose to believe his demagogy But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000 He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin ScaliaRepublican presidential nominee Donald TrumpTrumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white peopleThere is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process Hes just not honest about what those flaws areThe hard truth is that the US political process is not democracys gold standard it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the votersInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the IranContra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s You can buy his latest
