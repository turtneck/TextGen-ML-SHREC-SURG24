The Wisconsin GOP primary suggests that no matter what the Republicans do from here on out they will anger some major faction of a fractured partyTed Cruz accomplished what he set out to do in the Wisconsin Republican primary beat frontrunner Donald Trump soundly winning most of the states delegates and raising the probability of a contested GOP convention in JulyBut Senator Cruzs big victory  he beat Mr Trump by 13 points 48 percent to 35 percent  doesnt prove that he is uniting the Republican Party as he claimed in his victory speech Tuesday night It merely demonstrates that the Texas senator is consolidating his role as the antiTrump in a presidential nomination race that has plunged the GOP into crisisThe Wisconsin exit polls tell the storyMore than half of Cruzs supporters and twothirds of Ohio Gov John Kasichs said they were scared of what Trump would do in the White House  a remarkable rejection of the leading candidate in the race write analysts for ABC NewsNotably among Cruzs own voters only a quarter were excited about what hed do as president  further suggesting that he garnered substantial antiTrump not necessarily proCruz supportGovernor Kasich underperformed in Wisconsin with only 14 percent of the vote but he remains adamant about taking his campaign to the convention as the only mainstream Republican still in the race The effect though has been to split the antiTrump votePerhaps more troubling for the GOP were responses to how Wisconsin Republicans would vote in the general election If Trump is the partys nominee against Democrat Hillary Clinton only 61 percent of GOP primary voters said they would vote for him 19 percent said they would vote for a thirdparty candidate 10 percent said they would vote for Mrs Clinton and 8 percent said no oneIf its Cruz vs Clinton in November only 66 percent of Wisconsin Republicans said theyd back Cruz 18 percent said theyd vote third party 6 percent said Clinton and 6 percent said no oneThese numbers are similar to national polling that shows a deep divide within the GOP between Trump supporters and Republican voters who oppose him Its also true that inevitably as Election Day nears many unhappy voters will surely end up holding their nose and voting for their partys nominee anyway Clinton in particular inspires revulsion among many RepublicansBut Trump is no mere Republican candidate The brash billionaire inspires rocksolid loyalty among a third of the GOP electorate including the firsttime voters he has lured into the process with his populist nativist message If Trump is not the nominee many of his supporters say they will abandon the party altogether  especially if they believe Trump is treated unfairly at the conventionOn the issue of fairness one exit poll question was particularly devastating to the Republican establishment If no one wins a majority of the delegates before the convention whom should the party nominate voters were asked A majority 55 percent said the candidate with the most votes in the primaries Only 43 percent said the candidate who the delegates think would be the best nomineeIn all likelihood Donald Trump will go to the convention with the most delegates Wisconsin doesnt really change that says Matthew Kerbel chairman of the political science department at Villanova University in PhiladelphiaIf Trump arrives at the convention without a majority of the delegates then it becomes easier to deny him the nominationBut the cost of denying him is to split the party says Professor Kerbel And the cost of not denying him is it becomes his party and Donald Trump becomes the face of the partyThat could have a profound impact on other Republicans on the ballotAmong general election voters Trump has skyhigh negatives Cruz and Clinton also have high negatives  but not close to Trumps Kasich argues hes the most electable and general election matchups bear that out but his path to the nomination through a contested convention is impossibly narrow Hell need to convince a deadlocked convention that a candidate who finished at the back of the pack deserves to jump the line His argument is electability  polls do show him performing better than Trump or Cruz against Clinton But Tuesdays exit polls showed electability held little sway with votersThe next test comes in two weeks with the New York primary  home turf for both Trump and Clinton who like Trump needs to overcome an embarrassing defeat in Wisconsin Clintons 13point loss to Bernie Sanders  56 to 43 percent  was nevertheless expected Wisconsins electorate is largely white and very liberal both playing to the Vermont senators strengths Trump also wasnt a good fit for Wisconsin both demographically and culturallyBefore Wisconsin New York polls showed both Trump and Clinton well ahead of their top competitors If either underperforms it will be clear that Wisconsin was a turning point Both will be damaged but still on track to head to their respective conventions with the most delegates The math at this stage in the race is almost impossible to overcome
