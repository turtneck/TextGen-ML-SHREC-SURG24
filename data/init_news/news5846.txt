 Your Most Honorableness October 30th 2016 I read in the papers and on the Internet that the Bundys and their cohorts were acquitted in your courtroom in Portland of all charges I also read that the defendants were not released I also read that their defense attorney while asking for the papers that would keep his clients in jail was attacked in your courtroom by the bailiffs and tasered on the floor after hed been gang tackled Is this your idea of justice Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird said that The courts are the great levelers I dont think that he meant the defense attorney should be leveled in the courtroom by government goons You numbnuts in the court system are losing all and I mean ALL of your credibility with the public We dont believe in your robes and badges and court orders and bits of paper demanding this and that We look at you as robbers You have all become a farcical dangerous and way too powerful You and I are the same age You should know better Sincerely
