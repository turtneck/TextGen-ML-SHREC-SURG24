House Speaker Paul D Ryans deepest ideological instincts were formed in the conservative movement of the 1980s You have to understand I come from the conservative wing of the party Im a movement conservative the Wisconsin Republican told a small group of reporters soon after becoming speakerThree weeks later Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy explained that his first instincts were to help get his endangered Republican incumbents reelected right down to scheduling votes on legislation Our majority will be maintained only if we do well in purple states McConnell said in a December interview with The Washington PostThat distance between two of the three most important Republicans in the nation is at the core of how Ryan and McConnell came to such different conclusions about what to do about the emergence of the other most powerful Republican Donald TrumpOn Wednesday evening 24 hours after Trump won the Indiana primary and knocked out his remaining presidential contenders McConnell released a tepid statement saying he would support the nominee By Thursday afternoon Ryan appeared onCNN to question Trumps conservative credentials on key policy positions lambaste his campaign of belittlement toward women and minorities and said he was not yet prepared to support TrumpRyan says he is not ready to back Trump deepening GOP divideThat RyanMcConnell split also explains a broader divide among Republicans here in Washington Much of the Republican political class is coming to terms with the inevitable  Trump will be their nominee  and figuring out how best to handle what they consider a bad situationBut for the idealists  some say ideologues  who came of age worshiping the Ronald Reagan doctrine of free markets strong national defense and an optimistic shining city upon a hill tone they cannot countenance Trump taking over what they still consider a conservative partyRyan 46 is very much in this wing of the party He cited his late political mentor Jack Kemp a 1980s congressman whose optimistic economic vision became a bedrock conservative principle in his declaration that Im not there yet in supporting TrumpTodays conservative intelligentsia has been so flummoxed by Trumps ascendancy because on so many issues he is squarely against Ryans worldview Trump is ready to start trade wars with China and other nations rather than support trade deals that Ryan himself helped craft as a committee chairman before he became speaker Trump has criticized lawmakers for considering sweeping changes to Social Security and Medicare the very issues that sparked the rise of Ryan when he released budgets with optimistic titles like Pathway to Prosperity that included radical changes in entitlement policyPerhaps the only thing they seem to share these days is a love of the media and the backandforth jousting it provides  yet Trump uses his TV appearances to advance slashandburn tactics with opponents while Ryan frequents shows to talk about a confident America with bold conservative ideas to help the poorA lot of Republicans want to see is that we have a standard bearer that bears our standards Ryan told Jake Tapper on CNNs The Lead ThursdayRyan tries to pivot from disheartened state of politics  without ever mentioning Donald TrumpWhats stunning to these Reaganworshiping disciples is that a lot of Republican voters dont want someone who bears Ryans standards Trump did not just win the nomination but he has quite simply routed the fieldThe man has won over 10 million votes said Josh Holmes a top political adviser to McConnell Thats more votes than any Republican ever in a presidential primaryLooking at that equation McConnell made a different highly tactical decision on Trump Sticking by his previous assurances he would support the nominee McConnell said that the businessman had some work ahead of him As the presumptive nominee he now has the opportunity and the obligation to unite our party around our goals McConnell said in a brief statementAdvisers to both GOP leaders confirmed that each side knew ahead of time what was coming Ryans and McConnells chiefs of staff David Hoppe and Sharon Soderstrom are close friends who first worked together in the 1980s They remain in close contact over each decision and did so this weekWhere Ryan saw Trumps ideological apostasies McConnell saw a simple reality that he needs to make the best of Trump no longer has any opponent and hes going to be the nominee collecting votes from tens of millions of Americans in NovemberIts time to figure out how those endangered Republicans  eight of whom are facing tough competition in states that will also be presidential battlegrounds  can appeal to middleoftheroad voters who will ultimately tip the balance in their races but also not alienate the Trump supportersMcConnell has never spent a lot of time wringing his hands about situations he cannot control Holmes said His job is to run the Senate and help his members and stay out of their way as they navigate their states politicsSome Washington insiders suggested that Ryans move gave endangered House Republicans cover to take similar positions and steer clear of Trump questions Instead Democrats said Ryan gave them the freedom to keep asking almost daily whether Trump had earned their vote a position that Rep Barbara Comstock RVa took Friday in her suburban battleground districtThis starts an alarm clock that will go off eventually Matt Thornton communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said By setting up the earn my vote standard Republicans are only begging the question OK what does that mean When will Trump earn your voteMcConnell considers himself an artful tactician who rarely hands his opponents a weapon to use against him Ever since Ryan began talking about drafting a bold agenda for Republicans McConnell has given polite public support without any assurances his candidates would support it lest some proposal be too far reaching for any of themBefore taking up measures Im going to be in consultation with my members and it is a fact that we have a number of members up in purple states this year McConnell said in DecemberRyan never held back promising early on a vision based on his upbringing under Kemp The conservative movement is beginning to concentrate itself on the fact that 2016 is everything and the best way to have the best outcome is to unify by applying our principles to ideas and offering an agenda So to me the best path to unify is to propose and offer an exciting agenda the new speaker told reporters back in NovemberIts just no longer clear which Republicans agree with the exciting agenda Paul Ryan wants to craft
