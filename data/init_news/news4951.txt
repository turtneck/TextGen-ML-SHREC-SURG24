Committee convened early Thursday and met late into the night to review the 42 rules governing the party structure and the selection of a presidential candidate The big undecided issue remains whether or not to continue binding convention delegates to the results of caucuses and primaries or to unbind delegates and allow them to vote however they wantAnother subject of talks which eventually collapsed with no resolution centered on whether to return the party to closed contests  meaning that only Republicans could vote in presidential caucuses and primaries A group led by Ken Cuccinnelli the former Virginia attorney general also wanted to make other changes to party operationsRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and several members of the partys leadership generally support the idea of reverting back to closed contests by awarding more convention delegates to states that hold closed contestsCuccinnelli said he proposed giving 20 percent more delegates to states that opted to hold a closed contest Priebus and his team considered the offer cut ultimately declined according to people familiar with the talksEd OKeefe and Dan Balz contributed to this report
