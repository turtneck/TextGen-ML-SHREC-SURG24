The former Florida governor appearing at a business roundtable here also called for a strategy to take out ISIS but did not go into specifics He mostly argued that the war started during his brothers administration helped create stability in Iraq and since been unraveled because of Obamas policiesThe focus ought to be on knowing what you know now Mr President should you have kept 10000 troops in Iraq said Bush whos expected to announce his presidential bid in the coming monthsIn December 2011 the United States withdrew its final combat troops from Iraq bringing an end to the nearly decadelong conflict that started under George W Bush The Obama administration asked for more troops to remain on the ground but negotiations with the Iraqi government did not ensure that US military personnel would be granted immunityJeb Bush argued that Obama could have kept the troops in and he could have had an agreement adding the United States had enough influence to be able to deal with the immunity issueHe made the decision to get out I dont begrudge him that It was a decision made based on a campaign promise he told reporters in New Hampshire It wasnt based on conditions in Iraq at the time and I think were paying a price for it Critics at the time warned that extremist elements would grow more powerful without a US presence and now Republican presidential contenders are pointing to the rise of ISIS as proof that the United States should have pushed harder to stay in Iraq In his remarks at the business roundtable  an event organized by New Hampshire activist Renee Plummer  Bush defended his brothers leadership during the Iraq war ISIS didnt exist when my brother was President Al Qaeda in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was President he said There were mistakes made in Iraq for sure but the surge created a fragile but stable Iraq that the President couldve built on and it wouldve not allowed ISIS He called for a plan to take out ISIS with help from other countries saying there is currently no strategic imperative to restore stability in Iraq Asked later by reporters what that strategy should be and whether it should include combat troops in the area Bush said he would rely on advice from military advisers We have ground troops in Iraq I would take the best advice that you could get from the military Make the decisions based on conditions on the ground not for some political purpose he said Whether we need more than 3000  which is what we have now  I would base that on what the military advisers say Panel Bush should have been prepared for Iraq question Panel Bush should have been prepared for Iraq question Bush struggled to answer questions last week about whether he would have gone into Iraq knowing whats known now about faulty intelligence that initially spurred military action After multiple days of unclear answers he ultimately said he would not have invaded in hindsight RELATED Can Jeb Bush escape his brothers legacy on Iraq His
