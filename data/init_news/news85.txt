With the shake of an EtchASketch Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the Republican Party on Friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality One only wonders why the former governor of Massachusetts neglected to focus on the growing problems the last time he held the title of GOP standard bearerAddressing a gathering of Republican National Committee officials below deck of the decommissioned USS Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego California Romney ticked off three priorities crucial to what he called the postObama era making the world safer with a more muscular foreign policy providing opportunity to all Americans and lifting people out of povertyIts a tragedy a human tragedy that the middle class in this country by and large doesnt believe that the future will be better than the past he said We havent seen rising incomes over decadesThe rich have gotten richer income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before under this president he addedRomney stressed his years as an LDS pastor a topic he and his campaign rarely broached in 2012 and described working with people who are very poor to help them get helpThe governor isnt the only potential Republican presidential candidate to embrace a more populist tone as wage growth continues to lag in an accelerating economic recovery Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush recently lamented that while the last eight years have been pretty good ones for topearners theyve been a lost decade for the rest of America Former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum has emphasized reconnecting with blue collar Americans Even diehard conservatives like Sens Rand Paul RKy and Ted Cruz RTexas paid lip service to the matter at the Heritage Foundation policy summit an annual gathering of conservatives in WashingtonWhile he may be sincere in his pursuit to eliminate poverty the notion that Romney would be the best candidate to lead his party in doing so is puzzling at best The former Massachusetts governor didnt have just one misstep that allowed Democrats and Republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy outoftouch plutocrat in the 2012 election  he had a dozen Heres just a brief samplingIm in this race because I care about Americans Im not concerned about the very poor We have a safety net there If it needs repair Ill fix it he said inelegantly following his victory in the Florida primary Im not concerned about the very rich theyre doing just fine Im concerned about the very heart of the America the 90 percent 95 percent of Americans who right now are strugglingCorporations are people my friend  of course they are Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people he said before the Iowa Ames straw pollAnd his infamous remarks about 47 percent of Americans My job is not to worry about those people  Ill never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their livesBut its not just the gaffes Romney embraced the Paul Ryan budget in 2012  a sweeping plan that if enacted would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor Millions of lowincome Americans benefiting from Medicare Medicaid and Social Security as well as other retirement funding would have been affected under a Romney presidency Added to his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies for the poor its not hard to see how Romney wouldnt be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president
