Ill be honest I dont like Hillary Clinton Personally theres plenty to admire about the former secretary of state Shes incredibly bright broadly experienced and undeniably competent Politically though she represents a broken system a system of capitulation and obfuscation Theres no point in denying thatI dont consider myself a Democrat though I vote for Democats almost without exception Gore Vidal once said that There is only one party in the United States the Property Party  and it has two right wings Republican and Democrat I tend to agree with that now more than ever And I suspect most people of the left do as wellIve felt the Bern for months and Ive felt it publicly If youve read any of my pieces on Sanders and Clinton you know exactly where I stand Bernie is the most authentic politician Ive encountered  at any level of government I had no illusions about his prospects of winning this race it was always a long shot Nor was I confused about Sanders ability to change government if he was miraculously elected Everything about our system is resistant to changeA Sanders administration would doubtless have been a disappointment for progressives given the systemic constraints But a Sanders presidency would have been an enormous achievement a signal of sorts His campaign win or lose is itself a muted miracle and a reason for optimism We now know a genuinely progressive movement is possible in this countryBut heres the truth Hillary Clinton is going to be the nominee Primary voters should still express their will and vote for Bernie so long as they can and Sanders should campaign until the convention but this race is effectively over The math is clear Yes Sanders is in a comparable position to Obama during the 2008 race but this isnt 2008 and he doesnt have nearly the institutional support that Obama hadProgressives dont want to hear that and I get it  I really do But its true nevertheless To win Sanders would need to secure roughly 72 percent of the remaining delegates with paltry support among crucial demographics demographics that catapulted Obama past Clinton in 2008 Its not going to happen And even when Sanders has won primaries or caucuses he hasnt won by large enough margins to alter the delegate mathThat leaves us with a regrettable  but nearcertain  choice in November Hillary Clinton or Donald TrumpIf thats how it unfolds Im voting for Hillary Clinton This really isnt a choice at all Trump is a leering huckster a firstrate con artist peddling hate to dunces A Trump presidency would be a victory for every noxious and regressive force in our body politic We also have no idea who he is or what he would do in office  thats positively terrifyingDespite the handwringing among progressives President Obama moved the country forward His triumphs were slowgoing and piecemeal but thats his way  and it worked The unemployment rate is 49 percent 137 million new jobs have been added over the last 69 months more Americans have health insurance coverage than ever samesex marriage has been legalized the American auto industry was rescued from oblivion two liberal seats on the Supreme Court were protected USCuba relations have opened up we have a peaceful nuclear deal with Iran were gradually shifting away from our reliance on fossil fuels and the country has enjoyed eight years of a dignified scandalfree administrationHillary Clinton if nothing else will preserve this progress She isnt leading a revolution and shes not going to usurp Wall Streets power  everyone understands that But neither will Trump Worse still theres no reason to suppose Trump can do the job He has no experience no platform no ideas and no respect for the office He cant be trusted on anything of import to progressives When you consider whats at stake no one on the left should prefer Trump to Clinton  this a point that Sanders himself concedes and its why hell surely endorse Clinton if she is in fact the nomineeA recent Wall Street JournalNBC news poll found that a third of Sanders supporters said they wouldnt vote for Clinton if she becomes the Democratic nominee I dont believe that will hold but consider for a second what might happen if it does To begin with it would likely hand the White House to Donald Trump Even if you reject Clintons positions on foreign policy and a host of domestic issuesas I do she is still preferable to Trump And if youre a progressive the fact remains Clinton reflects your values far more than Trump If you care about the Supreme Court which is a conservative judge or two away from denying women autonomy over their own bodies the choice is obvious If you care about raising the minimum wage or reforming the criminal justice system or addressing climate change or protecting voting rights the choice is equally obvious Our democracy such as it is can sustain a competent Clinton administration Nothing much will change but it wont descend into chaos either Progressives will have to wait for an Elizabeth Warren or some other candidate to emerge In the meantime though were staring a potential Trump administration in the face No one knows what the hell Trump is Hes practically an abstraction What we know is that hes uncorked all the racial and cultural bile this country has to offer and hes threatening to dump it at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue He must be stopped Sanders has proven that Democratic voters  and the country more generally  will respond to a FDRstyle populist someone unafraid to say what we all know about our corporate oligarchy Clinton isnt that candidate but she will hold the line far better than Donald Trump or Ted Cruz Sanders gave birth to a progressive revolt in this country and he moved the Democratic Party to the left It falls to his supporters to continue that movement beyond this campaign to keep the pressure on Clinton and other elected officials In November however there will be two names on that ballot and one is infinitely better than the other Thats the reality unpleasant though it is All the grumbling about voting against a candidate rather than for one or about the dolefulness of choosing the lesser of two evils is perfectly understandable  but it doesnt change a thing Politics is often about whats possible not whats ideal and this November is no different Trump is a combustible menace dont think for one second that he cant win a general election He absolutely can win and Sanders supporters staying home in protest will make it all the more likely If that happens our country becomes an international punchline the progressive movement dies in its infancy and much of what Obama has accomplished will be put in jeopardy And if none of that persuades you recall what happened in 2000 Make no mistake Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency that year Al Gore was a deeply flawed candidate but imagine how different the world might look had he won that year If the Bernie or bust crowd has itsway in November what might we say about Clinton 10years from now And how much damage  real and symbolic  will Donald Trump or Ted Cruz have done Think about that before you surrender to your purism
