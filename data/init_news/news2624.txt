CNN In any normal presidential election it would be hard to overshadow news that the FBI interviewed one of the candidates for three and a half hours about potential criminal behaviorBut in 2016 Donald Trump seems to be able to seize any news cycle  intentionally or otherwiseHis Saturday tweet of a graphic that included Hillary Clintons face a sixpointed star a pile of cash and the words most corrupt candidate ever drew immediate backlash for evoking antiSemitic imagery The image was posted 10 days earlier to an antiSemitic white supremacist message boardThe graphic realDonaldTrump tweeted yesterday was first posted on an antiSemitic forum httpstconlsH0ocvdV pictwittercomRfEB7bKGFmTrump on Monday morning initially addressed the controversy  again on Twitter  by blaming the dishonest media for trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriffs Star or plain starDishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriffs Star or plain starOn Monday afternoon the Trump campaign finally issued a statement on the matter  one that amounted more to a response to the Clinton campaign statement than an explanation of his tweetTrump rejected the Clinton campaigns accusations that his tweet was antiSemitic by slamming false attacks and insisting the star represented a sheriffs badgeThese false attacks by Hillary Clinton trying to link the Star of David with a basic star often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior showing an inscription that says Crooked Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever with antiSemitism is ridiculous Trump said in a statementTrumps statement did not address the fact that the campaign tweeted an image that had previously been posted on an antiSemitic white supremacist message board His statement also didnt explain where the campaign obtained the imageOn Monday night the Trump campaigns social media director Daniel Scavino filled in some details on what he said were the images originsThe social media graphic used this weekend was not created by the campaign nor was it sourced from an antiSemitic site Scavino said in a statement separate from Trumps It was lifted from an antiHillary Twitter user where countless images appearThe sheriffs badge  which is available under Microsofts shapes  fit with the theme of corrupt Hillary and that is why I selected it Scavino addedScavino also said that as the campaigns social media director I would never offend anyone and therefore chose to remove the imageTrumps stumbles were suddenly back in the spotlight on a weekend that would have otherwise focused on Clintons vulnerabilitiesTrumps prolific Twitter habit is once again forcing Republicans to confront questions about the temperament of the man they will soon formally nominate as their presidential candidate and his apparent unwillingness to forcefully reject the support of those with racist or antiSemitic views It also comes as Trump tries to manage a more disciplined campaign underscoring fears among some in the GOP that the businessman is unable to avoid selfinflicted woundsAdding to the fire is the Trump campaigns refusal to answer questions about the tweet its origin or whether anyone would be held accountable It simply deleted the tweet and replaced the sixpointed star with a circleThe Clinton campaign blasted Trumps tweet Monday as part of a broader patternDonald Trumps use of a blatantly antiSemitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough but the fact that its part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern Sarah Bard Hillary for Americas director of Jewish outreach said in a statement Now not only wont he apologize for it hes peddling lies and blaming others Trump should be condemning hate not offering more campaign behavior and rhetoric that engages extremistsIts not the first time Trumps own controversies have overshadowed Clintons as a result of the presumptive Republican nominees unforced errorsTwo days before Trump created a weekslong news cycle by accusing a judge of being biased because of his Mexican heritage Clinton faced one of the most damaging news items of her candidacy when the State Departments inspector general released a scathing assessment of Clintons private email useBut Trumps tirade on the judge his doubling down on those racebased accusations and the ensuing rift it provoked between Trump and newlysupportive Republican leaders eclipsed Clintons email woesShielded by the holiday weekend top Republicans in the House and Senate were quiet on Trumps latest controversyBut the campaigns refusal to show any sense of accountability when it comes to the tweet may only add to the stormThe first prominent Trump surrogate to address the controversy was not a campaign spokesperson or Trump himself but was instead Trumps recentlyousted campaign manager Corey Lewandowski who blamed political correctness run amok for the outcry during a Sunday interview on CNNs State of the UnionTheres no antiSemitism in Mr Trumps body not one ounce not one cell he told CNNs Alisyn Camerota adding later Not every sixsided star is a Star of DavidTrump on Sunday meanwhile refused to address the controversy over his tweet and sought to refocus scrutiny onto ClintonHe slammed a totally rigged system that likely will not bring criminal charges against Clinton and criticized former President Bill Clintons private meeting with the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch just days earlierHe then tweeted condolences on the passing of Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel But still no word about his use of an image circulating in antiSemitic circlesTrumps tweet Monday addressing the graphic may only serve to further extend the controversy drawing attention away from both Clintons email scandal and a news cycle this week that was expected to focus on Trumps imminent decision to pick a running mate before the GOP conventionTrumps latest trouble is especially loaded because its not the first instance of him tweeting or retweeting something linked to white supremacistsTrump has previously retweeted neoNazi accounts including one named WhiteGenocideTM In November he retweeted a graphic of false and racist crime statistics overstating the numbers of blacks killed by other blacksAnd amid a groundswell of support from white supremacists Trump and his campaign have been slow and even loathe to reject the support of those individualsWhen pressed by CNNs Jake Tapper earlier this year on the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke who continues to peddle in antiSemitic conspiracy theories Trump initially said falsely he did not know of Duke and would not disavow his support He would later do so and blame a faulty earpieceAnd when he was later confronted by CNNs Wolf Blitzer about antiSemitic death threats some of his supporters were directing at a Jewish reporter who wrote a profile about Trumps wife the presumptive Republican nominee refused to condemn those actionsI dont have a message to the fans Trump said when pressed on the antiSemitic death threats in an interview with Blitzer in May A woman wrote an article thats inaccurateNow questions continue to swirl around how his campaign obtained and decided to tweet a graphic that had circulated on a message board filled with antiSemitic conspiracy theories and neoNazi message boards  and whether he will repudiate the support of individuals who prescribe to that ideology
