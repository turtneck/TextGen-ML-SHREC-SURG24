Three things are inevitable in this life death taxes and conservative claims that we simply cant afford to give lowwage workers a pay boost Nobel Prizewinning economist takes on the latter inevitability in his New York Times column today seizing on recent developments to illustrate why arguments against wage increases dont withstand serious scrutinyTake McDonalds announcement this week that it would pay its workers 1 above the minimum wage per hour at the 1500 outlets owned and operated by McDonalds itself The move which still falls well short of what workers and their advocates seek affects 90000 workers but it doesnt apply to the 750000 workers employed by McDonalds 3100 American franchisees While modest in scopeMcDonalds move  coming on the heels of similar wage boosts by boldfaced names like Walmart and Target  suggests that maybe its not that hard to give American workers a raise after all Krugman writesWhile free market fundamentalists might retort that global competition will sink firms that boost worker pay Krugman responds by noting that most American workers are employed in service industries that arent exposed to international tradeWhat about technology Isnt it an unassailable maxim of modern economics that we can afford to pay larger wages only to highly skilled workers  ones who cant be replaced by machines As Mike Konczal wrote recently technology is but a small part of the larger inequality phenomenon The key factors he pointed out include tax policy the financialization of the American economy deunionization and the conscious political choice not to raise the minimum wageWhats more Krugman observes Workers are people relations between employers and employees are more complicated than simple supply and demand This truism is borne out in empirical evidence with comparisons of states that raised their minimum wages with neighboring states that didnt showing that higher pay does not mean fewer jobsSimilar factors explain another puzzle about labor markets the way different firms in what looks like the same business can pay very different wagesThe classic comparisonis between Walmart with its low wages low morale and very high turnover and Costco which offers higher wages and better benefits and makes up the difference with better productivity and worker loyalty True the two retailers serve different markets Costcos merchandise is higherend and its customers more affluent But the comparison nonetheless suggests that paying higher wages costs employers a lot less than you might think And this in turn suggests that it shouldnt be all that hard to raise wages across the board Suppose that we were to give workers some bargaining power by raising minimum wages making it easier for them to organize and crucially aiming for full employment rather than finding reasons to choke off recovery despite low inflation Given what we now know about labor markets the results might be surprisingly big  because a moderate push might be all it takes to persuade much of American business to turn away from the lowwage strategy that has dominated our society for so many years Theres historical precedent for this kind of wage push The middleclass society now dwindling in our rearview mirrors didnt emerge spontaneously it was largely created by the great compression of wages that took place during World War II with effects that lasted for more than a generation
