We Are Change Fierce battle for the city of Mosul continues to shock Iraq and the whole Middle East with no significant results The leading role belongs to the assault of the Iraqi army and Kurdish SelfDefense Forceswhich still lack experience and skillsto capture the city in the shortest timeHowever 500 elite commandos of the US Special Forces which had been transferred this week at Mosul should give new impetus to the assault US combatants are supported by Apache and Chinook helicoptersAccording to the Inside Syria Media Center  the US Special Forces are located at the forefront of Iraqi and Kurdish combat formations Military experts believe these combat conditions are atypical for the special operation forces which are aimed to carry out reconnaissance and other specific tasksElite combatants in Mosul actually perform the functions of infantry soldiers resulting in inevitable great losses which are going to be covered up and silenced by the Washington officials in the usual mannerAlthough the US officials have repeatedly stated Mosul should be liberated from terrorists to eliminate the Islamic State the decision to use US Special Forces looks unjustified at first glance However the protracted nature of the assault on the city is forcing the Pentagon to take extreme measures to complete the operation before the US presidential election Therefore the White House uses this situation first of all as a largescale PRcampaign to support the candidate of the Democratic Party Hillary ClintonIn this context it becomes clear why the US Government refrained from active struggle against terrorists for so long choosing an opportune moment strangely coincided with the end of the presidential elections in the United StatesLiberation of Mosul should also demonstrate to the world community the importance and crucial role of the American nation in the fight against the Islamic State It is even more regrettable in the light of the recent Wikileaks revelations which confirmed the United States and American tycoons role in the creation and funding of the Islamic State terroristsThe post US Special Forces Join Fight For Mosul appeared first on We Are Change
