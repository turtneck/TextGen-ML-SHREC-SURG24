Decembers job growth numbers are in and they make it official 2015 was the secondstrongest year for job growth since the 1990s and only slightly behind the big gains of 2014 Unemployment fell in 2015 from an already low 56 percent at the end of 2014 to 5 percent in December 2015 Wages grew 25 percent during 2015 which isnt a huge number but looks more impressive when you remember that inflation was close to zero for the yearSo what accounts for the second straight year of strong economic results The US economy is a complex system so it would be a mistake to point to any single factor as driving economic growth and job creation No one fully understands how and why economies grow And to some extent you could look at 2015s solid but not spectacular performance as the kind of thing that happens when theres nothing holding the economy backBut we can also identify several specific factors that positively influenced economic growth in 2015Shortterm interest rates fell to zero percent in 2008 and the Federal Reserve kept them there until December 2015 Lower interest rates tend to promote economic growth and job creation Some people believe the Fed should have done even more  earlier in the recession the Fed ran a series of quantitative easing programs to pump even more money into the economy which it phased out in 2014  but theres little doubt that the Feds decision to keep interest rates near zero percent for most of the year promoted faster job growth than an earlier interest rate hike would have doneIn December the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by 025 percent and signaled that it may increase rates further in 2016 That may create a drag on the economy this yearOil prices were high  around 100 per barrel from 2011 until mid2014 But then prices started to fall and they havent stopped since They were around 50 per barrel when 2015 began and theyve now fallen below 35 per barrelEnergy is an important input to lots of different products and services so cheaper oil and other fossil fuels like natural gas meant that everyone not associated with the oil industry had a bit of extra cash in their pockets in 2015Its hard to say exactly where that extra cash went  at least some of it went to boost peoples savings and pay down debt  but consumers also spent some of it on other stuff That provided a nice economic tailwind throughout 2015Since the Great Recession state and local governments have been tightening their belts Early in the recession this added to the magnitude of job losses later it partially offset job gains in the private sectorBut as this data from the Brookings Institution shows things started to change in mid2014 After years of shedding employees state and local governments started hiring againOverall Brookings estimates that federal state and local government spending and tax policies exerted a modestly positive effect on the growth of gross domestic product  thats after four years of spending cuts and tax hikes that Brookings argues imposed a net fiscal drag on economic growth
