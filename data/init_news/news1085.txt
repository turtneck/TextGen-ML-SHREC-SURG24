On Tuesday 33 US senators elected in November will be sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden  including 12 who are new to the chamber The class includes 22 Republicans and 11 Democrats a big reason why the GOP has a 5446 majority in the Senate overallBut heres a crazy fact those 46 Democrats got more votes than the 54 Republicans across the 2010 2012 and 2014 elections According to Nathan Nicholson a researcher at the voting reform advocacy group FairVote the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 678 million votes in winning their seats while the 54 Republican caucus members received 471 million votesHeres what that looks like in chart formThis doesnt mean that the Republican majority is illegitimate or anything like that Indeed after 2008 and 2012 the tables were turned Democrats got more Senate seats than their vote share suggested they should The problem isnt that the deck is stacked in favor of Republicans The problem is that the deck is stacked in favor of small states which receive equal representation in the Senate despite dramatic variance in population The Senate is a profoundly antidemocratic body and should be abolished
