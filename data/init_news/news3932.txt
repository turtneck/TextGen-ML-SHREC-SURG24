Washington CNN President Barack Obamas televised address on ISIS on Sunday night was meant to calm the publics escalating fears of terrorism to chide 2016 candidates about explosive rhetoric over waging war and the place of Muslims in society and to defend his own efforts to combat the extremist groupWhether it succeeded on any of those counts may depend where observers sit on the polarized US political spectrum But while it was largely a staythecourse speech rather than one that heralds swift or significant changes to the antiterrorism approach Obama has pursued throughout his presidency the President did make several proposals and highlight some evolution in how the United States will go after ISIS in Syria and IraqHe notably put the emphasis on Congress to take action on making it more difficult for terrorists to acquire guns in the United States and to enact changes to visa programs in the wake of the San Bernardino attack Obama also wants lawmakers to finally put the war against ISIS on firm legal footingHere is a look at the Presidents proposals  and the chances that they will actually happenWhat the President saidIf Congress believes as I do that we are at war with ISIL it should go ahead and vote to authorize the continued use of military force against these terroristsThe United States has spent more than a year pounding ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria from the air Obama has sent Special Operations forces to Syria and several thousand soldiers are in Iraq Now there are plans for the Pentagon to send a specialized expeditionary force to Iraq to target ISIS But officially this is an undeclared warThe administration has cited authorizations that permitted both the war in Iraq and the fight against al Qaeda to justify its actions but has repeatedly called on Congress to update its mandate to reflect the new threat from ISISBut it has not yet happened WhyDespite Obamas comments in his address the White House is not optimistic that Congress will move soon The administration introduced its proposal in February hoping to get a jump on the political season But like much else touching on the war on terror the presidential and congressional elections in 2016 are now weighing on lawmakersDemocrats running for reelection are wary of tough votes authorizing a new war that may upset the partys dovish grass rootsRepublicans dont like the Presidents proposal but they havent drafted their own version and punt by saying the administration already claims to have sufficient authority And theres a dispute over language The White House request for an AUMF lasting three years included a provision that prevents enduring offensive ground combat operationsRepublicans who want a more robust US effort and are wary of tying the hands of a possible future GOP president rejected such restrictionsHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday that the version of the authorization that the administration sent to Congress earlier this year would limit the military so it would have to be something differentWhat the President saidCongress should act to make sure no one on a nofly list is able to buy a gun  this is a matter of national security We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San BernardinoJust as the Newtown massacre and other mass killings did not budge the politics of gun control the same dynamic applies after San Bernardino  one reason why Obama is now framing gun control as a matter of national securityMaking it more difficult for a potential terrorist to buy a gun in essence would entail making it more difficult for everyone to buy a gunThats why diehard Second Amendment supporters in both parties are wary of the idea with many Republicans and Democrats unenthusiastic about a tough vote on guns in an election year  especially those from rural districts where gun rights are a potent issue for many votersIn fact even the day after the San Bernardino killings the Republicancontrolled Senate rejected a bill that would prevent people on a federal terrorism watch list from buying gunsHouse Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday told the Wisconsin State Journal in an interview that Obamas nofly list plan was a distraction saying many people ended up on such databases erroneously and risked losing their due process rights a concern echoed by some 2016 GOP hopefulsMcCarthy made it clear Monday that Republicans are not inclined to take up the proposal that the President pushed to deny guns to those on the terror watch list used by airlinesSome congressional Republicans want a judge to weigh in on whether someone should be on the list before his or her constitutional right to bear arms is taken awayObamas other gun control efforts have repeatedly hit a brick wall in Congress and he has frequently expressed frustration at his failure to do more despite ordering a series of executive actions His efforts to pass an assault weapons ban for instance failed in 2013The White House is preparing an executive order to expand background checks given its expectation that nothing will make it through legislativelyBut White House officials say the legal and administrative challenges are difficult to surmount and that the order is going to take some time to prepareAnd the President has acknowledged that wielding his own executive power cannot be as effective as action from CongressWhat the President saidWe should put in place stronger screening for those who come to America without a visa so that we can take a hard look at whether theyve traveled to war zonesObama also said that he had ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and State to review the visa program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country as a fiancee of a US citizenThe visa waiver program appears to be one rare area where there is bipartisan agreement on how to act The Paris attacks especially alarmed US security experts because of the fear that thousands of Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with ISIS And if those people have European passports they dont need a visa to enter the United States potentially making it possible for ISIS to easily dispatch operatives into the United StatesOne measure being considered in the House and likely to get White House support would ensure that nationals of Iraq Syria Iran or Sudan or those whove visited those countries since 2011 cannot travel to the United States without a visaInstead individuals from designated countries will have to be vetted through a more rigorous process It requires countries who participate in the visa waiver program to share counterterrorism information or risk being cut out And it also enhances screening for criminal activityThe bill is expected to pass with a big bipartisan vote in the House on Tuesday and may be added to broad government spending bills so has a good chance of being signed into law soonStill changing the visa waiver program is fraught with diplomatic complications Visafree travel to the United States is a prized privilege for many national governments and is strongly supported by the US tourism industry And changes to the program could also spark reprisals and complications for Americans who travel abroadIslam and the politics of 2016What the President saidWe cannot turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and IslamThis horse is already out of the barn Several prominent GOP presidential candidates  Donald Trump and Marco Rubio for instance  have declared that America is facing a civilizational war against radical Islam They have bashed Democrats like Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton for not using similar terminology arguing it shows they dont comprehend the nature of the threat or prefer to avoid offense rather than accurately delineate the enemyThe President and his former secretary of state argue that using such terminology stigmatizes every Muslim and actually plays into ISISs hands by making it seem like a legitimate representative of a great faithThis is a dispute that will continue up to the 2016 election and beyondWhat the President saidThe threat from terrorism is real but we will overcome it We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm usIt is not just Congress that Obama sees as frustrating his effort to combat ISIS The realities of the conflicttorn Middle East a region festering with sectarian hatred geopolitical gambits by major nations and a collapse of the political order that has been in place for a century are posing imposing obstacles to US strategyOn the upside the President can legitimately claim to have assembled a 65nation coalition to go after ISIS in a campaign that includes air strikes in Iraq and Syria that have killed thousands of militants covert intelligence work and an effort to choke the extremist groups financial networkBut there is a glaring reason why Obama has struggled to effectively sell his strategy It does not seem sufficiently broad kinetic or aggressive to accomplish the goal around which he built his speech  the ultimate destruction of ISISAnother factor weighing against a big change in strategy is the self imposed limit that Obama has placed on the entire enterprise He is staying faithful to his refusal to commit US troops to another major Middle East entanglement  citing the quagmire that developed after the Iraq WarThen there is the intractable nature of civil wars in Iran and Syria which have fractured both nations and allowed ISIS to build a vast crossborder terror havenEven if the air campaign against ISIS in strongholds like Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq succeeds  progress may be fleeting without a vast ground force to secure territory consolidate gains and allow space for the return of administrative politicsBut Western leaders with Iraq in mind have little desire or political backing to commit a vast land armySo they and 2016 presidential candidates spend a lot of time calling for regional Arab and other powers to step into the breachBut those governments are no more willing or able to thrust their soldiers into the cauldron either And many have goals in Syria that contradict US aspirations leading to inertia Then there is the influence of other powers involved in Syria like Iran and Russia  which may have common interests in defeating ISIS but are hardly on the same page as the USStill the administration says it is encouraged by the increasing role of allies like France and Britain in the military air campaign over Syria since the ISIS rampage on the streets of Paris last month that killed 130 people But due to the limited capabilities of its partners Washington will still do most of the heavy lifting in the air campaignThe administration has also touted recent German pledges to ramp up reconnaissance over Syria But at the same time Arab partners have stepped back Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now more focused on combating Houthi rebels in YemenThe White House is working with Turkey to seal the remaining 98 kilometers of unsecured border with Syria an effort that includes both Turkish and Syrian Arab forces hoping to cut the flows of foreign fighters into the Syrian civil war  and their return to EuropeIn the absence of a continued military campaign from the Sunni Arab states  which the US would like to see resume  the White House is hopeful those nations can capitalize on their relationships with opposition forces in SyriaSaudi Arabia is also hosting an upcoming meeting of different opposition groups that the US hopes can help pave the way for their participation in a political transition process that would see the eventual departure of Syrian President Bashar alAssad and a theoretical revival of the Syrian stateBut those incremental steps though significant are unlikely to paper over the fundamental weaknesses of the antiISIS fight
