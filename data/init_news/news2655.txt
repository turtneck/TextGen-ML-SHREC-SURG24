But by amplifying his charge that President Barack Obama doesnt love America former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appears ready to risk sullying the powerful mythology that grew around his leadership when he steadied and steeled the nation in the terrible confusing time after 911Since those fleeting days when he was a unifying figure Giuliani has more often dealt in waspish rhetoric and savage mockery  especially of a president he says has failedAmericas Mayor has gone rogue lashing out at Democrats and liberal orthodoxy on the war on terror and saying for example during the Ferguson controversy last year that the biggest danger to a black child was not from a white police officer but from another African AmericanThe latest firestorm over Obamas patriotism may complete Giulianis political journey from the center left of the Republican Party to the conservative jungles where Sarah Palin and Donald Trump roamRudy has devolved into this red meat Republican base ideologue who periodically seems to need self identification said Douglas Muzzio a political scientist at Baruch College and a New York City media commentator Maybe it is Rudy in his dotage where he has lost whatever boundaries he once had He sounds like a bitter old manGiuliani seems to be relishing his moment back in the spotlightBut hes also causing awkward moments for Republican candidates limbering up for a crack at the presidency in 2016  a fact the White House was quick to exploit on FridayIts sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly said Obamas spokesman Josh Earnest And the truth is I dont take any joy or vindication or satisfaction from that I think really the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani todayDemocratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz also joined in seeking to use Giuliani to frustrate the GOPs effort to short circuit controversies which could tarnish the partys imageNow is the time for its leaders to stop this kind of nonsense Enough she saidGiulianis blast delivered in a closed door Republican dinner and repeated in a media tour centers on a claim that Obama was not brought up to love his country like most AmericansIts a familiar charge from the conservative fringe that Obama is somehow different and doesnt view America as an exceptional paragon but is obsessed with apologizing for its failingsI do not believe and I know this is a horrible thing to say but I do not believe the president loves America Giuliani was quoted as saying by PoliticoAsked by Fox News host Megyn Kelly Thursday whether he wanted to apologize Giuliani replied Not at all I want to repeat itI dont feel this love of America Giuliani said I believe his initial approach is to criticize the United StatesGiuliani dug in further in an interview with the New York Times rejecting the idea that his remarks were born of racismI thought that was a joke since Obama was brought up by a white mother a white grandfather went to white schools  said Giuliani This isnt racism This is socialism or possibly anticolonialism said GiulianiFar from being chastened Giuliani who wore a conspiratorial grin on Fox News seems gleeful in the firestorm His behavior might be explained by a boxing maxim he was taught as a boy which may also shed light on his calmness on 911My father taught me  when you get hit in the face for the first time youre going to panic Giuliani said in an interview with Forbes magazine in 2011 Instead of panicking just accept it Stay calm And any time anybody hits you they always leave themselves open to be hitGiulianis actions may be both a glimpse at his political philosophy and reflect a decision to wade into the political echo chamber to solidify his standing among a certain group of conservativesHe understands political posturing he understands the effectiveness of rhetoric said Errol Louis a CNN political commentator from New York He clearly wants to play a role on the national stage I guess he has chosen the role of bulldog  go after the president attack him make wild accusationsWith a failed presidential campaign behind him and having been out of office for a decadeandahalf it may be that Giuliani sees his future on the conservative talk circuitTo the extent that Giuliani will be involved in the game moving forward it will be as a commentator or an analyst said Costas Panagopoulos a campaigns expert at Fordham University New York In order to do that successfully these days it helps to be controversial sometimes inflammatory I am not surprised that he has become increasingly forceful in his comments in the media He is convinced that will help himGiuliani has rarely been known to back down He was a Yankee fan growing up in Brooklyn a ruthless prosecutor who took on unions and the Mob and a hard driving Republican who ran a liberal cityWhen he awoke on September 11 2001 Giuliani was a polarizing figure with a large ego and a sharp tongue He might have purged New York street crime but was starting to grate on the citys nerves at the end of his second termWithin hours with a staggering display of calm purpose and leadership he had recast himself as a modernera Winston Churchill steadying and inspiring his people in their darkest hour His heroics were such that he became one of those politicians who become known by a single nameMarching up Broadway he grabbed a mike and told people to evacuate southern Manhattan He conjured up national resolve and resistance as a country waited hours to see its president out of sight on Air Force OnePeople tonight should say a prayer for the people that we have lost and be grateful that we are all here he said in a late night press conference 12 hours after the Twin Towers came crashing down in a toxic cloud of fire and ash Tomorrow New York is going to be here and we are going to rebuild and we are going to be stronger from beforeMaking Giuliani its Man of the Year Time Magazine said When the day of infamy came Giuliani seized it as if he had been waiting for it all his lifeBut he struggled to meet huge expectations His 2008 presidential campaign was a bust plagued by poor organization and his liberal views on social issues that conflicted with the conservative baseBut there was also a sense that he was playing the September 11 card too much Joe Bidens crack that there were only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 911 was funny because it bore more than a ring of truthThat was years ago now But while his years of elective office are behind him Giuliani still seems to pine for the political spotlight So he has every incentive to keep this row going as long as he can
