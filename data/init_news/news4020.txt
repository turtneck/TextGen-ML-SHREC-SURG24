AttheLibertarian Town Hallon CNN earlier this monththe Libertarian Partys presidentialcandidateGary Johnsonand his running mate Bill Weldmade a pitchto both NeverHillary and NeverTrump voters on the left and right of the political spectrum as the sane andprincipled thirdparty alternative for 2016And whether you agree or disagree with what the two former governorshad to say its hard to deny their likability  especially in an election where the two major party candidates are as thoroughly unlikable as Donald Trump and Hillary ClintonJohnson and Weld presumably have a better shotat appealing to NeverTrump conservatives than NeverHillary liberals or leftists whose political views align much more with the Green Partys Jill Stein but the former New Mexico governor did make a compelling pitch  superficially at least  to disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters at the Town Hall And whilepolls indicatethat themajority of the democratic socialistssupporters will vote for Clinton in November there is a minority faction that will be voting their conscience  and Johnson iscertainly in a position towoo some of these votersWith thisundoubtedlyin the back of his mind the libertarian candidatesaid that he and Bernie are similar on about 75 percent of whats out there from marriage equality and reproductive rights to the legalization of marijuana and the end of futilemilitary interventions overseas From an economic standpoint however Johnson admitted disagreementIf Bernie supporters are really looking for income equality I dont think that is something that government can accomplish Taking from Peter to rob Paul thats an equation that Peter really loves But if Bernie supporters are looking for equal opportunity I think that is something that can be accomplished  In politicsyou can definitely stand up for equal opportunityIt was a cogent response that included an acknowledgement that crony capitalism is alive and well  something that libertarians and leftists have long agreed on and equally object to But apart from this Johnsons economic worldview is diametrically opposed to Sanders egalitarianvision of social democracy and this should be enough to stop the latters supporters from voting for the formerIn the economic realm rightwing libertarians asopposed to leftlibertarians orlibertarian socialistsare essentiallyclassical economic liberalswho reject most of the social democratic reforms that were enacted throughout the capitalist world during the 20th century Instead of a mixed economylibertariansadvocate laissez faire capitalism and profess that even minimal stateintervention inthe economywilllead to tyranny orserfdom as the famouslibertarian philosopher F A Hayek put it in hisinfluential bookThe Road to Serfdom this didnt pan out of courseinstead it was the welfare state that likely prevented more radical assaults on capitalism in the WestIn his statement Johnson said that he doesntbelieve thatthe government canreduce economic inequality whichhas soared over the past forty years and equatedredistributive measures to theft Thisalone reveals thecandidatesdogmatic worldviewThesocial democratic reforms of the 20th century clearly demonstratethat wealth and income inequalitycanbe curbed within acapitalist economy andshouldbe if leaders want toachieve greatereconomic and political stabilityWhileJohnson is less fanaticalthan some of his party colleagues indeed he is consideredtoomoderate by many libertarianshe is still undoubtedly the most extreme candidate of 2016on economic matters He opposes corporate taxation supports privatized healthcare advocates eliminating the progressive income tax andreplacing them with a regressive consumption taxand is a proponent of widespread economic deregulation and privatization including theprivatization of prisonsLibertarianismmay sound good on paper  championing individualism andmaximumfreedom but in practice its laissez faire prescriptions would result in corporate tyranny the very opposite of freedom libertarians are so consumed with the threat ofstate tyranny that they seem unable to evenconsider the very real threat of private tyranny or asNoam Chomsky has describedittyranny byunaccountable private concentrations of wealthG A Cohen the father ofanalytical Marxismandnotable critic of libertarianism discussedhowprivate property actually inhibitsthe freedom of the ownerlessin his essay Capitalism Freedom Proletariat Private property like any system of rights pretty wellisa particular way of distributing freedomand unfreedomIt is necessarily associated with the liberty of private owners to do as they wish with what they own but it no less necessarily withdraws liberty from those who do not own it To think of capitalism as a realm of freedom is to overlook halfof its nature Now there was a timewhen the rugged individualism andminimal state interventionthat libertarians advocate could have conceivably produced a greater degree of freedom namely in a precapitalist preindustrial economy before the prevalence of wagelabor and the advent of multinational corporations when independent producersegyeoman farmersartisans etc whosoldtheir own commodities on the market or simply produced forsubsistencewere the dominant economic players Butin a modern corporate capitalist economyin whichthe richest 20 citizens control morewealth thanthe bottom halfabout 152 million people in America these notions are not only antiquated but inimicaltoboth freedom and democracy Thus a BernieSanders supporterwould have to begrossly uninformed to go from backing the democratic socialist senatorto a libertarian like Johnson Yes there are similarities between the two but their political philosophies are so antithetical to each otherparticularlywhen it comes topolitical economythat the single issues where there is some agreement are basically irrelevant Libertarianismis fundamentally opposed to theegalitarian and democratic values that Sanders represents
