Ive been involved in policy for three decades since AOL played a pivotal role in getting the nation online in the early days of the Internet Initially my focus was on commercializing the Internet expanding access and putting appropriate rules of the road in place In the past decade my focus shifted to encouraging progrowth policies that foster innovation generate jobs help startups and create opportunity I was proud to work with a Democratic president and a Republican House to help get the Jumpstart Our Business Startups JOBS Act passed four years ago and I have spent countless hours meeting with members of both parties on immigration reform patent reform and prostartup economic ideasDespite my active engagement on policy however Ive tried to steer clear of politics Ive avoided endorsing candidates or making big contributions to campaigns Ive wanted to be nonpartisan able to work with people on both sides of the aisle Indeed Ive been troubled by the hyperpartisanship that has defined our politics of late and by the resulting gridlock that has set in The United States faces many challenges but in my view our greatest threat may not be external forces but rather our inability to work together to move our country forwardSo my inclination is to continue to stay out of politics and continue to quietly build working relationships with both Republicans and Democrats Id prefer to be positioned as a builder of bridges and consensusBut Ive decided to make an exception this election I have concluded that I cannot sit on the sidelines this year At this pivotal time the choice is too importantIve decided to back Hillary Clinton for president for four reasonsFirst I think shed be better for our economy especially with respect to innovative technology and startups Donald Trump knows business but his campaign has been backwardlooking on the economy and oddly absent of ideas to spur creation of the jobs of the future Clinton understands what we need to help start businesses and will invest in education advanced manufacturing and basic research Shes not promising a return to a bygone era  shes focused on making our economy strong for our children and their children These forwardleaning policies are essential to ensure continued US economic leadershipSecond Clinton is right on immigration To win in the global economy our country must win the global battle for talent Immigrants dont take US jobs they create them More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by immigrants or their children Think how many fewer jobs wed have in the United States if these entrepreneurs and their parents had been kept out by a wall Trumps harsh policies will cost us jobs and his even harsher rhetoric will chase away immigrant families whose children could grow up to be the next Steve Jobs whose father was a Syrian refugee or Sergey Brin an immigrant himselfThird while Trump has been largely silent on technology issues facing the new economy Clinton has put forward an agenda that has won considerable acclaim among technology leaders She wants to appoint a chief innovation adviser expand science technology engineering and math or STEM education and more And she shares my view that its not enough to support a booming Silicon Valley  we need policies that promote the rise of the rest a spread of startups to all parts of our country We need to level the playing field so anybody anywhere has a shot at the American dreamFourth I agree with Clinton on the need to control the deficit Despite his populist rhetoric Trump wants to give huge tax breaks to people like me the very folks who have benefited greatly from the innovation economy while many others have been left behind In the process he would blow up our deficit and make the economy more unequal I agree we need to simplify the tax code but if we are going to give tax relief lets make sure it is in incentives for startups to grow and create jobsI think I get why Trump has been such a potent political force this year I am well aware that millions of people are angry about their prospects and fearful that the forces of globalization and digitization have left them behind I also recognize many are frustrated by politics and feel we need an outsider to shake things up But I dont think Trump is the answer for those people or for the countryI dont agree with everything Clinton has said and done I take issue with some aspects of her platform and I worry about her inclination to all too often view the government as the solution to problems If she becomes president Im sure there will be plenty of times I will disagree with her But for 2016 I believe Hillary Clinton represents the best choice for the United States  and our best hope to remain the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation in the world
