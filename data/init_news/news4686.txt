Print Speaker Paul Ryan blasted Hillary Clinton over the Friday news that the FBI is launching a new review into her use of a private email server while secretary of State In a statement released minutes after the news broke  the Wisconsin Republican reasserted his call for Clinton to be denied the classified briefings she receives because she is the Democratic presidential nominee Yet again Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame She was entrusted with some of our nations most important secrets and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information he said This decision long overdue is the result of her reckless use of a private email server and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved
