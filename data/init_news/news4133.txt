In the first debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Trump repeatedly relied on troublesome and false facts that have been debunked throughout the campaign Clinton stretched the truth on occasion such as when she tried to wiggle out of her 2012 praise of the Trans Pacific Partnership as a gold standard But her misstatements paled in comparison to the list of Trumps exaggerations and falsehoodsTrump once again asserted that the 2008 Clinton campaign was responsible for spreading the myth that President Obama was born in Kenya when that is false He claimed that thousands of American jobs will leave the country when Ford shifts smallcar manufacturing to Mexico but no one here will lose their jobs He also falsely claimed that he was against the Iraq War when all available evidence demonstrates that he supported it until the rest of the country began to turn against it in 2004 He also once again falsely said he started his business with a small loan from his fatherHeres a roundup of 23 of the most noteworthy claims that were made As is our practice we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts indebatesFord is moving its small car production to Mexico but the expansion will not affect US workersThe company has said that while production of Ford Focus models will shift to Mexico its plant in Michigan will build other larger vehicles Ford and many other automakers are finding Mexico more attractive for several reasonsThe cost of labor is indeed greater in the United States which makes producing laborintensive small cars in Mexico more profitable The United States also has advantages though  inexpensive electricity experienced technicians and access to sophisticated materials and equipment  often means building larger and more expensive cars is cheaper in this country our colleague Max Ehrenfreund wroteClinton exaggerates here We know of three years in the 1970s when he did pay federal income taxes But there were at least five years in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s when Trump did not pay any or nearly any income taxesTrumps tax plan would raise federal income taxes on more than half of Americas single parents and onefifth of families with children according to an analysis by Lily Batchelder a New York University expert on tax policy who formerly worked for Obamas National Economic CouncilWhile the Trump campaign called it pure fiction the rightleaning Tax Foundation has said the group was able to replicate her findings Kyle Pomerleau director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation posted on Twitter that Batchelders results seem reasonable to meMark Zandi a wellrespected economist did issue a report saying that if Trumps economic plans were fully implemented 35 million jobs would disappear incomes would stagnate debt would explode and stock prices would plummet But the report also said it was highly unlikely that Trump would get many of his plans approved by Congress even if it is controlled by Republicans because so many of his positions are so a departure from Republican principlesEven so the report said the US economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidencyHis report also saidthat if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans the economy would add an additional 32 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency Combined with anticipated job creation under current law that adds up to 104 million jobs But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress resulting in far fewer job gainsTrump cites an Internal Revenue Service audit as his justification for not releasing his federal income tax returns but the audit does not prohibit from releasing the returns Richard Nixon who started the tradition of presidents and presidential candidates releasing their returns did so in the middle of an auditMoreover Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009 which are no longer under audit according to his attorneyPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency Hillary Clinton has released three decades worth of tax returnsWhile Trump has not released the returns his long history of litigation has given the public a sense of what is in his returns Tax information made public so far show Trump did not pay any or nearly any income taxes at least five times in the past 40 yearsTrump is being misleading Tax experts say that tax returns provide insight about a persons finances in several key areasFirst the tax return reveals a persons annual income A persons net worth is not disclosed but voters would gain an understanding of a persons cash flow Second voters would understand the sources of a persons income such as how much comes from certain businesses speeches dividends capital gains and so forthThird a tax return would disclose how much a person gives to charity Mitt Romney gave almost 23 million to charity in 2011 while Bill and Hillary Clinton gave 3 million to charity in 2014 We know these figures because of information in their tax returnsTrump claims he has given 102 million to charity in the past five years but a Washington Post investigation found not a cent in actual cash  mostly just free rounds of golf given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles Trumps tax return would clear up exactly how much he has really given to charity  indeed whether he has given anything at allFourth a tax return would reveal how aggressive Trump has been on his taxes There is no blackandwhite approach to taxes there are many gray areas subject to interpretation especially regarding deductions Trump frequently suggests that he knows how to game the system so voters would learn whether he takes the same approach to his taxesFinally the tax returns would disclose what percentage of Trumps income actually goes to taxesTrump is right Clinton is subtly adjusting her words here when confronted with a question about her consistency on policy positionsBut the fact is she never used the word hoped Instead she was more declarative using the phrase gold standard when she was Secretary of StateThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing fieldshe said in Australia in 2012 And when negotiated this agreement will cover 40 percent of the worlds total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environmentTrumps companies have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection which means a company can remain in business while wiping away many of its debts The bankruptcy court ultimately approves a corporate budget and a plan to repay remaining debts often shareholders lose much of their equityTrumps Taj Mahal opened in April 1990 in Atlantic City but six months later defaulted on interest payments to bondholders as his finances went into a tailspin The Washington Posts Robert OHarrow found In July 1991 Trumps Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992 A fourth property the Plaza Hotel in New York declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debtPolitiFact uncovered two more bankruptcies filed after 1992 totaling six Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 after accruing about 18 billion in debt Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009 after being hit hard during the 2008 recessionWhy the discrepancy Perhaps this will give us an idea Trump told Washington Post reporters that he counted the first three bankruptcies as just oneTrump cherrypicks the increase in violence in Chicago but this is not indicative of overall crime rates which have been declining for years Moreover while Trump says stopandfrisk policies should be enacted in Chicago as it was implemented in New York City those policies have not been correlated withcrimeWhile violent crime overall has been declining for about two decades there was a sharp increase in the violent crime rate in 2015 Homicides have continued to spike in major cities this year though the rates remain far below their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s Law enforcement officials including the FBI have voiced concerns about the uptick in crime in 2015Criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time such as month over month or year over year An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years preferably 10 or 20 years of dataTrump praises stopandfrisk policies under former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani But itsdebatable whether the stopandfrisk policies had such a direct impact on crime as Trump suggests Crime is affected by many factors and New Yorks decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time Moreover crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office and it continued to decline for 14 years after he leftWe awardedThree Pinocchios to Trumps claim attributing stopandfrisk policies to the decline in crimeTrump also claimed that murders are up in New York That is incorrect Homicides in New York are down so far this year from the same point last year according to the New York Police Department But homicides did see an uptick in New York City in 2015 similar to trends in numerous other citiesDemocrats including Clinton frequently point out that people on the terrorist watch list can purchase a gun But the proposal that Democrats have made in Congress wouldnt ban such purchases automatically We have awarded Two Pinocchios to this claim for lack of contextSen Dianne Feinstein DCalif has introduced legislation to give authority to the attorney general to decide whether or not a suspected terrorist could buy a gun Anyone who was subjected to a federal terrorism investigation within five years of the attempted gun purchase would be flagged in the backgroundcheck system and the Justice Department would be able to review those casesThe government uses a reasonable suspicion standard to nominate and include someone in the Terrorist Watchlist which includes the nofly list Belonging to a terrorist organization or being listed on one of the watch lists does not automatically stop someone from buying a gun There has to be another factor that disqualifies the person from buying a gun under federal or state law such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration statusClinton is right that Trump emphatically urged the United States to remove Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi from powerHeres Trump in February 2011 urging an intervention on his video blog I cant believe what our country is doing Trump said Qaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people nobody knows how bad it is and were sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East and were not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and thats what it is Its a carnageTrump added Now we should go in we should stop this guy which would be very easy and very quick We could do it surgically stop him from doing it and save these lives This is absolutely nuts We dont want to get involved and youre gonna end up with something like youve never seen before We have go in to save these lives these people are being slaughtered like animals Its horrible whats going on it has to be stopped We should do on a humanitarian basis immediately go into Libya knock this guy out very quickly very surgically very effectively and save the livesThis is just totally falseWe have found no evidence of his early opposition to the invasion Trump expressed lukewarm support the first time he was asked about it on Sept 11 2002 and was not clearly against it until he was quoted in the August 2004 Esquire cover story titled Donald Trump How Id Run the Country BetterBut by the middle of 2004 many Americans had turned against the war making Trumps position not particularly unique In light of Trumps repeated false claim Esquire has added an editors note to its August 2004 story saying The Iraq War began in March 2003 more than a year before this story ran thus nullifying Trumps timelineWe have awarded this claim Four Pinocchios compiled a timeline of all of Trumps comments prior to the invasion in March 2003 and even a video documenting how this is a bogus claimTrump said he had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity prior to the invasion expressing his opposition to the war These appear to be private conversations Hannity told Erik Wemple Blog that Trump would watch the show and call after and we argued a lot about the war We should note that Hannity is one of Trumps biggest boosters and has never asserted that Trump made these private claims to him until recently even though this has been a constant source of controversy during Trumps campaign Hannity has also not offered any evidence to back up his claim that he and Trump had such conversations at the timeUpdate During the debate Trump also cited his January 2003 Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto as proof of his early opposition The day after the debate Fox News cited this clip declaring it backs up Trump on Iraq War opposition As ourtimeline shows Trump was not clearly against the war in this interview eitherOn Feb 18 2016 Cavuto replayed the clipand said it wasnt clear Trump was against the war then While Trump now says he opposed the Iraq war Cavuto saidWhen I interviewed him back in January 2003 couple of months before we formally got involved in Iraq he couldve left you with a different impressionCavuto saidthat in the January 2003 interview Trump was notbashing the president back then nor is he fully endorsing Iraq But he is saying some clear decision is required Meghan McCain appearing in the segment said in response He speaks now though like he was protesting with Code Pink in the street like he was adamantly against the war in Iraq Like he was this huge person in the media stage protesting against President Bush and going into IraqRegarding Clintons statement the key issue with the email controversy was that Clinton had a private server  not just a private email  and she never used her designated State Department email account which would have kept records of emails subject to requests under the Freedom of Information ActThe accuracy of Trumps claim depends on whether he is referring to her decision to use a private server or if he is suggesting that Clinton purposefully intended to mishandle classified information On the former point yes Clinton chose on purpose to use a private email server On the latter the FBI would disagreeFBI Director James B Comey has said Clinton was extremely careless in handling classified information through her private server Our colleagues Matt Zapotosky and Rosalind Helderman noted But Comey also has said that investigators found particularly lacking any intent on Clinton or her staffs part to mishandle classified information and that would undermine any possible criminal case against themClick here for our roundup of 14 factchecks about the Clinton email controversyHow can a federal agency the Immigration and Customs Enforcement endorse a candidate Trump is actually referring to the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council which is the union representing ICE officers In a statement released by the campaign National ICE Council President Chris Crane said it was the unions firstever endorsementTrump is basically right The trade deficit in 2015 was 762 billion according to the Census BureauClinton is correct Trump in May caused a stir when he suggested the United States should borrow more and renegotiate new terms later I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal Trump said on CNBC The comments caused angst in the financial markets as the US Treasury securities are considered the worlds safest investment precisely because the United States is at low risk of default Renegotiating the terms would be seen as a form of defaultTrump later walked away from his comments claiming he had been misquotedTo support the debunked notion that Clintons campaign originated birther rumors during the 2008 presidential campaign Trump pointed to these two examples But they dont add up to much of anythingJames Asher former DC bureau chief of McClatchy has said that longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal strongly urged him to investigate the exact place of President Obamas birth which he suggested was in Kenya McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya and the reporter found the allegation was false Asher said We reached out to Asher several times but did not receive a responseBlumenthal declining to elaborate further said in a statement to The Fact Checker This is false Period Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie and bears the responsibility for itSolis Doyle did say in a recent CNN interview that in December 2007 a volunteer coordinator in Iowa forwarded an email perpetuating the birther conspiracy Clinton made the decision immediately to let that person go Solis Doyle said in the interviewAs in the instance with the Iowa volunteer coordinator the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clintons staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim We found that theres no evidence that she or her campaign were pressing it very hard  though some of her supporters did perpetuate the claims in the bitter 2008 primary campaign against ObamaAs multiple independent fact checkers have affirmed in the years since neither the 2008 campaign nor the candidate ever questioned the Presidents citizenship or birth certificate Period said Clinton campaign spokesman Josh SchwerinTrumps mixes up a lot of things hereThe United States pays about 22 percent of the commonfund budget for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization But the volume of the US defense expenditures effectively represents 73 percent of the defense spending of the Alliance as a whole But that does not mean that the United States pays 73 percent of the costs of running NATOThe figure reflects the fact that United States as a world power projects its might across the globe Experts say it is all but impossible to calculate how much of overall US defense spending is devoted exclusively for NATO but there is little dispute that most members are not meeting their commitment to have defense expenditures should amount to 2 percent of each countrys gross domestic productAs for Trump patting himself on the back for spurring NATO to focus on terror hes kidding himself The plan was in the works long before Trump starting saying NATO was obsoleteThis data checks out according to research by the Brennan Center for Justice Nationally the violent crime rate has fallen by 51 percent since 1991 and property crime has fallen by 43 percentAs Clinton noted in her response the terms of departure from Iraq were originally set by the George W Bush administration The Bush administration signed a Status of Forces Agreement SOFA with Iraq in 2008 that established a deadline for the withdrawal of all US forces from Iraq by Dec 31 2011 But it was widely expected troops would remain after a negotiated extensionClinton as Secretary of State had pushed for some troops to remain in Iraq but the administration was not able to reach an agreement and so US troops left Iraq Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in his memoir pinned the blame on Obama To my frustration the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them Officials there seemed content to endorse an agreement if State and Defense could reach one but without the Presidents active advocacy Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki was allowed to slip awayObama meanwhile was pleased to be able to run for reelection in 2012 on a claim that no more US troops were left in IraqTo a large extent the Islamic State of today is simply an outgrowth of alQaeda of Iraq which emerged after the 2003 invasion of IraqAt best one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take over Clintons opposition helped contribute to the growth of ISIS also known as the Islamic State Islamic State certainly has become an important player in the Middle East taking advantage of the civil war in Syria and the disarray in the Iraqi government to claim vast areas of both countries In the past couple of years the groups activities have gathered attention in the United States it was only in 2014 that President Obama dismissed Islamic State as a JV teamClinton was Secretary of State when Obama made decisions that could be seen as contributing to the rise of the Islamic States but ironically she was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in Iraq and for intervening in Syria such as arming the rebels Both steps advocated by Clinton might have thwarted the emergence of the terror group Moreover Clinton was not Secretary of State when Obama all but ignored the Islamic State as it moved back into Iraq in late 2013But  and heres the irony  Trump criticizes Obama for a policy position he had advocated be taken even sooner than 2011 I would announce that we have been victorious in Iraq and all the troops are coming home and let those people have their civil war Trumptold CNBC in 2006 I just said announce victory get them home Lets say Victory Tremendous Have a big thing in the streets Then get out real fast before you get shot Lets get homeIndeed there are victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants including by those in gangs But there are two important data points to remember when Trump talks about thisFirst the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit Trumps description of aggravated felons whose crimes include murder US Sentencing Commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens whether they are in the United States illegally or notSecond illegal immigration flows across the Southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972 except for in 2011 The apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015 but still indicate an overall declineISIS does not control oil in Libya Trump has been called out before on this point but he keeps saying this false claimAs for keeping the oil in Iraq This is nonsensical The Bush administration invested a lot of diplomatic effort in assuring Middle Eastern allies that the United States was not invading because of Iraqs oil fields Moreover oil revenue was crucial to ensuring a functioning Iraqi state  which is why insurgents often targeted the oil sector in IraqIn any event seizing the oil of a sovereign nation after invading it would be considered a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions one of the cornerstones of international law as well as other international agreements Maybe Trumps staff should arrange a tutorial on international lawOur colleague Steven Mufson looked deeply at whether international law aside such a proposal was even feasible One expert said it was beyond goofyClinton is referring to this statement by Kellyanne Conway back when she was supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz the Texas senator Conway who now defends Trump with fervor told CNN on March 8 For Trump the debates are fought with peril The Trump victims The reason the messaging has gotten better is they are starting to talk about victims of Trump University
