In a speech Wednesday outlining his wouldbe foreign policy Donald Trump tried to sound presidential The Republican presidential candidate succeeded in sounding tough if contradictory But he outlined a foreign policy that isnt so different from that of Hillary ClintonTake ISIS for exampleTrump acknowledged in his speech the jihadist army that is slipping its tentacles into the West and promised that its days are numbered But Trump refused to provide any details of how he would fight ISISimplying he doesnt want to telegraph his brilliant strategy to the enemyThis is too clever by half Given that ISIS is rampaging in the Middle East and has massacred Americans there in Europe and right here in the United States its insufficient for a presidential candidate effectively to say yadda yadda Ill beat ISIS and provide no more informationFrankly it sounds like a teenager who has failed every quiz during the semester but implausibly promises to save the day by acing the finalThe reality is Trumps strategy to defeat ISIS is basically the same as that of President Obama and Secretary Clinton which is to say he has no strategy at allEarlier Wednesday Trump all but endorsed Obamas announcement that hell send 250 more troops to Syria saying I could agree with it but declaring he would dispatch them secretlyTrump doesnt know how to go beyond the ObamaClinton foreign policy of using gestures to appear be reacting to events without actually solving anythingEvidently Trump would also mirror Clinton on Russia Despite promises to regard Moscow with open eyes Trump observed Wednesday we are not bound to be adversaries and added I believe an easing of tensions and improved relations with RussiaThis is no different than the selfregard and conceit that led Clinton to offer the Russians a plastic reset button believing the force of her personality would change the Russians calculation of their national interestsWednesday in Washington Trump laudably called for containing the spread of radical Islam while observing that is not just a military struggle but a philosophical contesta reality that has eluded much of the US government since 911It seems like Trump is newly willing to borrow a few ideas from Ted Cruz and other conservatives who have been pressing these issues throughout the presidential campaign However the businessman undercut himself by saying he will stick with the Iran nuclear deal he allegedly disdains promising merely to implement it strictlyThere is no way to defeat radical Islam without ceasing the grand accommodation of the Iranian regime that Obama enacted as Secretary Clinton cheeredThe biggest takeaway from Trumps foreign policy speech should be that the only remaining candidate with a conservative Reaganesque foreign policy prepared for todays threats is Ted CruzTrumps speech was helpful for that reason aloneChristian Whiton is a member of the Cruz National Security Coalition He was a State Department senior advisor in the George W Bush administration and a policy advisor on the Giuliani and Gingrich presidential campaigns He is author of Smart Power BetweenDiplomacy and War Potomac Books 2013
