Joel Benenson is a worldclass worrier but he isnt especially worried about Donald Trump in the fallTrump isnt freaking out just Republicans these days Democrats panicked by the Manhattan moguls seemingly unstoppable rise in the primaries see him as an ocher ogre capable of undoing President Barack Obamas legacy and undermining the civility supporting American democracyTrumpphobia has infected many people in Hillary Clintons extended orbit  especially her notoriously jellykneed donors  and they are dutifully fretting over Trumps darkalley debate style his promise to napalm the Clintons with personal attacks and above all his magicalrealism appeal to angry Rust Belt whitesBenenson the Clinton campaigns bearded principal pollster and chief strategist cant even bring himself to pay lip service to Trump whom he sees as a oneman Democratic turnout machine and a turnoff switch to moderates in both parties His analysis of the 2016 landscape leads him to the conclusion that Trump has virtually no path to the presidency he wont say the same thing about Bernie Sanders and presents Clinton with renewed opportunities in purple states  especially North Carolina and ArizonaIndeed when I interviewed him for POLITICOs Off Message podcast on Friday the usually easygoing Benenson was in a tense and testy mood bracing for an uncertain battle against Sanders on Tuesday  lashing the Vermont senator for impugning Clintons character But when I mentioned Trump  specifically the developers claim he could swipe New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Ohio and the lot from the Democrats  his Charlie Brown cloud lifted instantlyIts not real a grinning Benenson said of Trumps repeated claim he can defeat Clinton or Sanders by wrestling away swingstate votersI dont see any state that Democrats have won five out of six times or six out of six times that Trump you know at face value poses a threat in I just dont see it said Benenson who was the top pollster in Obamas two successful presidential campaignsWhats the evidence of it The evidence of it theyve turned out a lot of people I think hes broken 50 percent in only one state right  If you look at the states that Democrats have won  in five out of the last six presidential contests it adds up to 257 electoral votes It means you only need 13 more to get to 270 if we perform that wayOther Obama alumni  including 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe  are basically on the same page although they think Trumps unpredictability coupled with Clintons innate caution as a candidate could cause unexpected problems Benenson said he hasnt polled extensively on Trump yet but he thinks Trump has so antagonized minority voters  and turned off moderate whites with his harsh rhetoric and chaotic rallies  that Clinton might exceed Obamas 2012 total of 332 Electoral College votesNorth Carolina which Obama won narrowly in 08 and lost by 2 percentage points four years later would likely be target No 1 in a ClintonTrump showdown Thats going to be a very problematic state for Republicans he said Now we played there in 2012 but not a lot The president didnt go into the state We let Romney outspend us 5to1It would be nice to have the luxury of focusing exclusively on Trump or better still concocting a game plan against Ted Cruz the Clinton camps preferred opponent But theres the small matter of clearing aside Sanders who has a frontrunners online fundraising operation and a terrierwithteethinyourleg competitive tenacity that could keep him in the fight until the conventionA couple of weeks ago Clintons team was very confident she was close to wrapping up the nomination But when I asked Benenson to look ahead to Tuesdays big fivestate contest he hit the basic talking points She was ahead by 215 pledged delegates a bigger lead in that category than Obama ever enjoyed in 08 And he demurred when I asked whether Clinton would emerge with a substantial net delegate gain for the night Substantial he said There are a lot of delegates Like I said if there are 867 out there  I dont know how well be measuring substantial by the end of the night and I cant forecast it because some of these states are closer than othersLike everybody else Benenson was a bit blindsided by Sanders stunning win in Michigan last week Brooklyns data team predicted a 5point Clinton win public pollsters had Sanders losing by three or four times that margin Moreover its no secret that he has struggled along with the candidate herself to sharpen Clintons sprawling competenceandpolicymastery platform into a compact inspirational bumpersticker message to compete with Sanders antiWall Street crusade Reports of friction between him and the Clintons have been overstated he told meYou know shes been on the road more and Im here more in New York and Brooklyn said Benenson the highestranking member of Clintons team who hadnt worked with her on previous campaigns But I think weve gotten to know each other more We talk very frankly She knows I speak my mind Im somebody who does and I think that works for her  I like it when were doing debate prep and theres a lot of backandforth and youre hearing her talk Shes often the one who comes up with the best things because they come from what shes believed for a long time and I think its a pretty powerful place to be I think this is a woman who knows who she is knows why shes doing thisBenenson is protective of Clinton and has not surprisingly cultivated a notinconsiderable disdain for Sanders and his sharpelbowed team Hes been in the free media been leveling very  and the whole campaign has been leveling very explicit attacks on Secretary Clinton Hes tried to impugn her character he said his voice rising to a near shout He does it all the time He does it you know in a way that has given him enough wiggle room to say No no Im not being negative but of course he is His whole campaignSanders criticisms of Benensons former boss Obama are especially galling Walk into the pollsters 33rdfloor office in midtown Manhattan and youll find a minimuseum full of firstrate 08 ephemera The conference room is festooned with Obama Wins newspaper headlines and a cardboard cutout of the 44th president stares back at you benevolently as you sit on the waiting room couchThe things he says about Barack Obama  It actually pisses me off  because its disingenuous Benenson said flashing real anger Dont stand on a stage in front of television cameras with millions of people when youre running in a Democratic primary and say hes a friend of yours and you work with himYou know Id like to remind everybody what he said when Barack Obama was under attack by Republicans running for reelection in 2012 when he called Obama weak a disappointment to millions of people and said he didnt have the backbone to stand up to Republicans he said suggesting Sanders is more comfortable slamming his allies than the common enemy I havent heard him say a word about George Bush Have you even heard him mention George Bushs name on the campaign trailThe contempt in many ways is born of familiarity Benenson like Sanders is an overachieving outerborough workingclass Jew who was drawn to progressive political causes early in life Both had peripatetic young adulthoods that didnt portend powerful futures on the national stage Sanders collegehopped abandoning his native Brooklyn for bucolic Vermont where he earned a living as a carpenter writer filmmaker and freelance gadfly before winning the Burlington mayors race as a socialistBenenson who looks a decade younger than his 63 years took an even more circuitous path He dropped out of Queens College just short of graduation to work in avantgarde theater Then to pay his rent he accepted an uncles offer to help run a beer distributorship in Crown Heights in Brooklyn And thats where he spent the night of the 1977 New York City blackout  staked out at the front door a shotgun borrowed from his girlfriends brother loaded on his lap Then he wanted to become a Yankees beat reporter which eventually led to a successful career as a political scribe for the New York Daily News He is a rarity in the mediasuspicious world of the Clintons Many of his oldest friends are reporters  Adam Nagourney of the Times Roger Simon of POLITICO Serge Kovaleski the Timesman whose disability Trump mocked at a rally and Obama message man David Axelrod who made his name at the Chicago TribuneLike Sanders who was arrested for participating in a civil rights demonstration as a student in 1960s Chicago Benenson had his own brush with protest and the police In 1970 a day after the Kent State shootings a 17yearold Benenson was in his words detained after joining a group of antiVietnam War protesters who blocked the heavily trafficked Long Island ExpresswayBut their paths diverged in ways that say much about the character of each man and of each campaign While Sanders spent most of his teens and 20s as an activist for socialist and student organizations Benenson was attracted to mainstream Democratic politics His hero was Bobby Kennedy and he casts the New York senators 1968 campaign as the hybrid of idealism and pragmatism currently embodied by his 2016 bossIn our interview Benenson started to talk about Kennedy matter of factly but he broke down as he described watching TV coverage of Martin Luther Kings assassination in his mothers Laurelton living room He remembers the image of Kennedy jumping on top of a parked car to address a seething AfricanAmerican crowd in Indianapolis What we need in the United States is not division Kennedy said What we need in the United States is not hatred what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another
