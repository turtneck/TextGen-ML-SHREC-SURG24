By Patrick J Buchanan October 29 2016 Should Donald Trump surge from behind to win he would likely bring in with him both houses of Congress Much of his agenda  tax cuts deregulation border security deportation of criminals here illegally repeal of Obamacare appointing justices like Scalia unleashing the energy industry  could be readily enacted On new trade treaties with China and Mexico Trump might need economic nationalists in Bernie Sanders party to stand with him as freetrade Republicans stood by their KStreet contributors Still compatible agendas and GOP selfinterest could transcend personal animosities and make for a successful four years But consider what a Hillary Clinton presidency would be like She would enter office as the leastadmired president in history without a vision or a mandate She would take office with twothirds of the nation believing she is untruthful and untrustworthy Reports of poor health and lack of stamina may be exaggerated Yet she moves like a woman her age Unlike Ronald Reagan her husband Bill and President Obama she is not a natural political athlete and lacks the personal and rhetorical skills to move people to action She makes few mistakes as a debater but she is often shrill  when she is not boring Trump is right Hillary Clinton is tough as a 2 steak But save for those close to her she appears not to be a terribly likable person Still such attributes or the lack of them do not assure a failed presidency James Polk no charmer was a oneterm president but a great one victorious in the Mexican War annexing California and the Southwest negotiating a fair division of the Oregon territory with the British Yet the hostility Clinton would face the day she takes office would almost seem to ensure four years of pure hell The reason her credibility or rather her transparent lack of it Consider Because the tapes revealed he did not tell the full truth about when he learned about Watergate Richard Nixon was forced to resign In the IranContra affair Reagan faced potential impeachment charges until exsecurity adviser John Poindexter testified that Reagan told the truth when he said he had not known of the secret transfer of funds to the Nicaraguan Contras Bill Clinton was impeached  for lying White House scandals as Nixon said in Watergate are almost always rooted in mendacity  not the misdeed but the coverup the lies the perjury the obstruction of justice that follow And here Hillary Clinton seems to have an almost insoluble problem She has testified for hours to FBI agents investigating why and how her server was set up and whether secret information passed through it Forty times during her FBI interrogation Clinton said she could not or did not recall This writer has friends who went to prison for telling a grand jury I cant recall After studying her testimony and the contents of her emails FBI Director James Comey virtually accused Clinton of lying Moreover thousands of emails were erased from her server even after she had reportedly been sent a subpoena from Congress to retain them During her first two years as secretary of state half of her outside visitors were contributors to the Clinton Foundation Yet there was not a single quid pro quo Clinton tells us Yesterdays newspapers exploded with reports of how Bill Clinton aide Doug Band raised money for the Clinton Foundation and then hit up the same corporate contributors to pay huge fees for Bills speeches What were the corporations buying if not influence What were the foreign contributors buying if not influence with an expresident and a secretary of state and possible future president Did none of the big donors receive any official favors Theres a lot of smoke and theres no fire says Hillary Clinton Perhaps but there seems to be more smoke every day If once or twice in her hours of testimony to the FBI grand jury or before Congress Clinton were proven to have lied her Justice Department would be obligated to name a special prosecutor as was Nixons And with the election over the investigative reporters of the adversary press Pulitzers beckoning would be cut loose to go after her The Republican House is already gearing up for investigations that could last deep into Clintons first term There is a vast trove of public and sworn testimony from Hillary about the server the emails the erasures the Clinton Foundation Now thanks to WikiLeaks there are tens of thousands of emails to sift through and perhaps tens of thousands more to come What are the odds that not one contains information that contradicts her sworn testimony Cong Jim Jordan contends that Clinton may already have perjured herself And as the fullcourt press would begin with her inauguration Clinton would have to deal with the Syrians Russians Taliban North Koreans and Xi Jinping in the South China Sea  and with Bill Clinton wandering around the White House with nothing to do This election is not over But if Hillary Clinton wins a truly hellish presidency could await her and us The Best of Patrick J Buchanan Tags
