Whether or not Christians should celebrate Halloween has been a controversial topic for decades Some view dressing up eating candy and enjoying the festivities harmless and innocent while others view it as an offense to their faith Americans spend nearly 69 billion yearly making it the second largest commercial holiday in the country As commercialized as the celebration has become many of its roots are completely paganist Is this a cause for Christians to avoid the entire celebrationThis is a time of year filled with debate but not necessarily politics Many Christians are convinced that Halloween is a satanic holiday while the rest of the world has found their sweet spot complete with costumes and candy Children and adults have the opportunity to dress in accordance with their imagination confirming from its haunted history to modern festivities this holiday is a big deal With decorations candy parties and costumes the average American spends up to 75 in the spirit of celebrationHalloween is the holiday that links the seasons of fall and winter Reportedly it originated with one of the ancient Celtic festivals an event where people would wear various costumes and light bonfires in hopes of warding off roaming ghosts However by the late 1800s Americans shifted the theory of Halloween into a holiday centered on community and fun events The focus for many has transitioned from witchcraft and ghosts to neighborhood celebratory events With the evolving of the focal point should Christians change their stance to celebrate the holidayDespite having at least partial roots from a Christian tradition the relationship between Halloween and Christians has long been complicated On October 31 1517 Martin Luther essentially started the Protestant Reformation in Wittenberg Germany when he nailed his 95 Theses to a door Many of the early Christian groups that came to America rejected this holiday as pagan The Protestant Reformation heavily influenced the Pilgrims Puritans Quakers and Baptists causing the great majority to frown upon it However that did not prevent Halloween from finding its way to American shoresIn the eighth century Pope Gregory III dedicated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs The holiday became widely recognized as All Saints Day The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve which later became Halloween The word hallow originated from the Old English word for holy and een is an abbreviation of evening As such Halloween represented the night before All Saints DayOver time Halloween advanced into a secular communitybased holiday branded by childfriendly activities that include costumes neighborhood trickortreating and more recently trunkortreating Along with a variety of pumpkinflavored foods Parties for both children and adults have become a very common way to celebrate the holiday Some Christians still choose to lock themselves indoors with the lights off but others have found freedom in their faith and are at liberty to decide when and how to participateIn multiple countries around the world as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder people continue to escort the winter season in with candycoated gatherings and a wide range of costumes Halloween is a celebration that allows people of all ages to participate Nonetheless the question remains Should Christians celebrateDue to the efforts of community leaders and parents Halloween has lost most of its illogical and religious undertones and is now more about imagination than spooky interpretation There is nothing sinful about a Christian dressing up and participating in fun nonthreatening celebrations As a result many Christians find no harm in dressing in costumes attending parties and festivals as well as allowing their children to participate in school and local activitiesBy Cherese Jackson VirginiaSourcesHistory HalloweenKidsville News Around the World  October 2015Grace to You Christians and HalloweenPhoto CreditsTop Image Courtesy of Billy Wilson  Flickr LicenseInline Image 1 Courtesy of Richard Vignola  Flickr LicenseInline Image 2 Courtesy of The Forum News  Flickr LicenseFeatured Image Courtesy of John Nakamura  Flickr License christianity  halloween
