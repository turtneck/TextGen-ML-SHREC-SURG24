When President Truman approved the use of the worlds first atomic bomb the weapon first had to be transported to the island of Tinian Stowed in the hold of the USS Indianapolis in July 1945 the journey from San Francisco took 10 days Flying time from the airfield to the city of Hiroshima clocked in at about six hours and the bomb itself fell for 43 seconds before explodingThese hours minutes and seconds of history will be front and center this Friday when Barack Obama becomes the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima Yet aside from anniversaries Americans dont think much about nuclear weapons today Perhaps it is the cultural hangover from the Cold War which often seemed to test the limits of how much fear societies could endure Perhaps with the bombing of Hiroshima passing from living memory weve simply lost the vocabulary for talking about the mechanics of midnight as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists famously christened the end of the worldInstead what is left is the absurdist shorthand the finger on the button What that cliched phrase means today is this The US president could order a nuclear strike on say Moscow and the 12 million inhabitants there would be incinerated about 15 minutes laterThe apparatus of calamity constructed over the past seven decades is more lethal now than it was in the summer of 1945 and it is far easier to use Its future is worth considering especially by those seeking the White House Today the United States has more than 7000 nuclear weapons Of those 2000 are deployed which means they can be launched on a 15minute alert on the authority of one human beingNine months after Obamas finger was first placed on the button he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in part for his stated goals of nuclear nonproliferation The administrations deal with Iran and its efforts to get more than a dozen nations to surrender bombgrade material are important steps toward checking the spread of cataclysmic weaponsAt the same time however the Obama administration oversaw the development of the B61 model 12 a new nuclear weapon that is small accurate and adaptable In truth this is what might be called a contradiction bomb It is the most expensive nuclear weapon project in history yet it is intentionally designed to get the least bang for the buck It is a nuclear weapon that looks and feels and can be used like a conventional smart bomb This ease  even plausibility  of use is what makes this weapon so dangerousThe Pentagon is also in the process of taking advantage of the already extreme accuracy of missile warheads by changing their fusing mechanisms so as to increase their ability to successfully destroy the hardest targets by a factor of three This program will vastly increase the killing power of the entire missile arsenal and in so doing create the appearance that the United States is preparing to fight and win a nuclear war against RussiaAmericans today have lots of pressing concerns  paying their bills paying their debts deciding whom to vote for The Atomic Scientists even changed their clock in 2007 to reflect the threat posed by climate change rather than just nuclear annihilationThe country meanwhile spent its Cold War peace dividend on decades of forgetting the stakes on trivializing the power of the presidency After all what really is an affair with an intern a torture program a terrorist attack on a remote embassy when theres an immediate and existential threat one push awayWhich brings us to Peak Triviality  Donald Trumps pursuit of the White HouseNot only did Trump not know the basics of the US nuclear triad the Pentagons land sea and air contingent of nuclear forces he also rejects nonproliferation a strategy fundamental to Western military thinking since Hiroshima Conservative military thinker Max Boot calls Trump the countrys top national security threat though surprisingly few Republicans publicly share that viewLest drawing attention to this topic be perceived as fearmongering consider this interview Trump sat for in March with Chris MatthewsTRUMP Look nuclear should be off the table But would there be a time when it could be used possibly possiblyMATTHEWS OK The trouble is when you said that the whole world heard it David Cameron in Britain heard it The Japanese where we bombed them in 45 heard it Theyre hearing a guy running for president of the United States talking of maybe using nuclear weapons Nobody wants to hear that about an American presidentTRUMP Then why are we making them nuclear weapons Why do we make themJust because one political party feels that Trump is the most suitable soul to command the worlds most powerful nuclear arsenal doesnt mean the wider electorate should lose sight of the stakesPresident Richard Nixon was famous for his madman theory of foreign policy whereby his administration tried to convince leaders of enemy nations that he was mentally unstable and thus not to be antagonized Should he win in November Trump will have to go to extraordinary lengths to persuade friend and foe alike that he is both predictable and worthy of trust The fate of nations may depend on it
