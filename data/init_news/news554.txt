President Obama said Thursday that he will keep 5500 US troops in Afghanistan into 2017 ending his ambitions to bring home most American forces from that wartorn country before he leaves officeThe presidents decision came after an extensive monthslong review that included regular discussions with Afghanistans leaders his national security team and US commanders in the field The move reflected a painful if predictable reality on the ground in Afghanistan where the Taliban has seized new territory over the past year as Afghan troops have taken over the vast majority of the fightingAfghan forces are still not as strong as they need to be Obama said Thursday morning from the White House explaining his decision  Meanwhile the Taliban has made gains particularly in rural areas and can still launch deadly attacks in cities including KabulThe Islamic State is making these Afghans long for the TalibanObama said he will also dramatically slow the pace of the reduction of American forces and plans to maintain the current US force of 9800 through most of 2016 The post2016 force will still be focused on training and advising the Afghan army with a special emphasis on its elite counterterrorism forces The United States will also maintain a significant counterterrorism capability of drones and Special Operations forces to strike alQaeda and other militants who may be plotting attacks against the United StatesThe revised troop plans came after Afghan forces were driven from Kunduz the first major city to fall to the Taliban since the war began in 2001 Two weeks passed before the Afghans with some support from US planes and Special Operations advisers took the city back from the Taliban Militants are now threatening other cities The bottom line is in key areas of the country the security situation is still very fragile and in some places theres risk of deterioration Obama saidThe president praised the Afghan government under the leadership of President Ashraf Ghani as a willing partner and he lauded the Afghan troops who have taken significant casualties Both were critical factors in his decision to keep US troops in the countryEvery single day Afghan forces are out there fighting and dying to protect their country Obama said Theyre not looking for us to do it for themThe president insisted that his decision to abandon his plans to bring home US troops was not a disappointment even as he acknowledged the nations war weariness after more than 14 years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq I do not support the idea of endless war he saidHis decision to keep troops in Afghanistan follows the surprising collapse of much of the UStrained Iraqi army last year under pressure from Islamic State militants Republican critics have charged that Obama withdrew troops too quickly from Iraq precipitating the collapse of the Iraqi army and the rise of the Islamic StateThe president did not mention the Iraqi failures in his statement from the White House White House officials said that the Iraq setbacks did not influence Obamas decision and that the two situations are not comparable because the Afghan government was eager to maintain a longterm US presence Such conditions did not exist in IraqAfghan officials on Thursday welcomed the move to keep 9800 troops in the country Its very positive in light of the continued problems that this region is facing said Mohammad Daud Sultanzoy a presidential candidate in 2014 who is now allied with Ghani Our security forces have shown the will and capability to fight but we still need the support of our allies especially the United StatesIn Ghazni province where Afghan forces are locked in a bloody fight with the Taliban Gen Sayed Malok called it a good decision at the moment but a temporary solution He called for a more robust effort to train and equip Afghan forcesThe decision is a significant departure from the exit plan that Obama announced in a White House Rose Garden speech in May 2014 In keeping with his promise to turn the page on the costly wars launched by his predecessor Obama said then that he would reduce the US footprint to about 1000 troops all based in Kabul by the end of 2016It is also a stark illustration of how persistent militant threats have stood in the way of Obamas promises to end the ground wars that have dominated US foreign policy since the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacksIn addition to a resurgent Taliban alQaeda appears to have staked out new ground in Afghanistan far from the groups mountain enclaves to the northeast Last week US forces began a major operation against alQaeda in Kandahar launching 63 airstrikes on militant training basesDavid Sedney a former Pentagon official who is a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the 2015 fighting season was the most massive fiercest yetThe Taliban are already signaling that next years offensive will be bigger and bloodier than this years The Taliban are bad Daesh is worse Sedney said referring to the emerging Islamic State presence in AfghanistanAdministration officials portrayed the decision as a natural extension of a strategy that was making progress rather than an indication that the presidents original plan had failed I dont think anyone ever intended that the job so to speak would be finished despite Obamas timetable said Lisa Monaco a senior White House official We always said that we would continue to have a presence thereAfter Kunduz Taliban is now targeting other Afghan citiesUnder the new plan the US military will retain bases in Kabul as planned but also have forces at Bagram air base and at bases outside Kandahar and Jalalabad the largest cities in Afghanistans southern and eastern regionsObama emphasized that Afghans would continue to take the lead role in the fighting with Americans providing advice and some counterterrorism support from bases outside Kabul These bases will give us the presence and the reach our forces require to achieve their mission he saidThe larger force of 5500 troops is projected to cost about 15billion a year or about 5billion more than the smaller 1000person Kabulbased force would have costDefense Secretary Ashton B Carter speaking at the Pentagon said the next president will probably need to make decisions about the longterm position of US forces in AfghanistanIs it going to be 5500 forever he told reporters I can only say this That is our best estimate now of what we should plan for and are planning for and budgeting for for 2017Although US deaths have fallen off dramatically in recent years the change may also mean more US casualties This year 25 American service members and civilians have been killed in the countryObama emphasized that the relatively small American military presence down from 100000 at the wars peak would not decide the wars outcome and he emphasized that peace talks offered the sole viable solution to the long bloody civil warBy now it should be clear to the Taliban and all who oppose Afghanistans progress the only real way to achieve the full drawdown of US and foreign troops from Afghanistan is through a lasting political settlement with the Afghan government Obama saidSudarsan Raghavan Sayed Salahuddin and Mohammad Sharif in Kabul contributed to this reportIn Afghanistan the art of fighting
