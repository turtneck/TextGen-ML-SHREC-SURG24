WASHINGTON  Despite leading a massive independent political operation and pumping untold millions into US elections billionaire Charles Koch is irritated at his extreme lack of influence in the Republican Party presidential primaryIn a candid interview over a lunch of tilapia and pulled pork sandwiches with the Financial Times Koch said he has presented the 12 remaining Republican candidates with a list of issues that he and his brother David care about  to no avail It doesnt seem to faze them much he said Youd think we could have more influenceKoch and his political operation announced they would spend approximately 889 million over the course of the twoyear 2016 election cycle This spending would not just cover electoral lobbying and other political expenses but also Kochs gifts to universities so theyll teach curriculum adhering to his libertarian economic philosophy and to likeminded nonprofit think tanks influencing and expanding policy debatesDespite all this promised spending both Charles and David Koch have declined to endorse a candidate in the primary  which may be why they lack influence Their refusal to endorse stems from a desire to save resources for the general election and avoid adding fuel to an internecine conflict within the party they most closely identify with But as Koch reveals in his comments to the Financial Times he veers far from Republican orthodoxy on some basic policy questions  notably foreign policyIn his own statements Koch has always adhered to a common libertarian position of nonintervention He criticized the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq under President George W Bush which was backed by congressional majorities in both parties at the time And now he is criticizing Republicans for their belligerence towards Muslims and a certain GOP candidates shortsightedness for proposing to carpetbomb land held by terrorist groupsWe have been doing this for a dozen years he said We invaded Afghanistan We invaded Iraq Has that made us safer Has that made the world safer It seems like were more worried about it now than we were then so we need to examine these strategies
