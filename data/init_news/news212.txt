Justices Anthony M Kennedy and Antonin Scalia were born in the same year chosen by the same president live on the same Northern Virginia street and in serving together on the Supreme Court longer than any other current pair of justices have many times voted the same conservative wayBut one issue  how the Constitution protects gay citizens  divides and defines the two like no other This weeks historic hearing on samesex marriage is both the logical extension and ultimate showdown in a decadeslong argument that so far Kennedy has always wonHeres what the fallout of a ruling could be in the various statesEach of Kennedys bold and lyrical rulings on behalf of gays  times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress he wrote in Lawrence v Texas  has been just as reliably followed by a meticulous and fiery denunciation from ScaliaThe court has taken sides in the culture war departing from its role of assuring as neutral observer that the democratic rules of engagement are observed Scalia answered in the Lawrence caseKennedy has written all of the Supreme Courts most important decisions on gay rights protecting the civil rights of homosexuals in Romer v Evans 1996 abolishing antigay sodomy laws in Lawrence 2003 and ruling in United States v Windsor two years ago that the federal government must recognize samesex marriagesEach was a steppingstone to the Supreme Courts consideration on Tuesday of whether the Constitution forbids states from prohibiting gay couples to marryIf the pattern continues and the court renders a landmark ruling favoring gay marriage it will likely once again be Kennedy whose words memorialize that decision and Scalia who will articulate the dissentIt is not a conflict everyone would have predicted for two of Ronald Reagans choices for the court Scalia ascended to the bench in 1986 and Kennedy followed 17 months later The two born on opposite coasts in 1936 are consistent comrades on issues important to corporate America and in dismantling campaign finance laws they see restricting political speechAfter Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr sided with liberals to declare the Affordable Care Act constitutional Scalia and Kennedy united with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr in a jointly written 65page dissent mocking the majority opinion and saying the entire act should be found invalidKennedy is often the deciding vote when the ideologically divided court splits 5 to 4 but in twothirds of those cases he sides with the conservativesBut if they often arrive at the same conclusion  one obstacle for samesex marriage proponents in the current case is Kennedys allegiance to states rights  Kennedy and Scalia could not be more different in how they view a judges roleTheir different approach to gay rights reflects their more fundamental disagreement about how to think about the liberties protected by the Constitution said Paul M Smith a Washington lawyer who was on the winning side in the Lawrence caseScalia believes the only freedoms that should be viewed as protected by the Constitution are those that have been protected under American law throughout our history defined at the most specific level Smith said Otherwise the people decideKennedy Smith said believes that each generation has the right to conceive of newer and broader forms of liberty that merit constitutional protection He sees history as a guide but not a straitjacketTheir battle is compelling said Allison Orr Larsen a William and Mary law professor because it brings to the forefront the theoretical question in constitutional law How should courts respond to change when interpreting the ConstitutionMichael Dorf a professor at Cornell Law School and a former Kennedy clerk said his former bosss decisions on gay rights were not constructed to lead ultimately to a decision on samesex marriage But they provided a foundation for how to view new constitutional rights if thats where the country movesScalia on the other hand champions the cause of originalism and Edward Whelan a former Scalia clerk and president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center said his former boss learned quickly that Kennedys judicial approach was not anything close to what Scalias isA basic tenet of originalism is that its not the role of judges to impose their own moral philosophies Whelan said Scalia understands the Constitution to leave the vast bulk of policy issues to the democratic processes and rejects the notion that its his role to read his own views into the ConstitutionIts worth remembering the differences among President Reagans choices for the Supreme CourtHe fulfilled his campaign pledge to name a woman to the bench with Sandra Day OConnor the pragmatic Arizona politician and judge who quickly became the courts centerScalias selection was celebrated by conservatives eager to see a new method of constitutional interpretation forcefully advocated on the courtKennedy was a compromise Reagans third choice for the seat he once hoped would be filled by conservative Robert Bork whose nomination was defeated in the Senate This was the Bork seat said Smith Things could have been much differentKennedys views Dorf said were those of a moderate California RepublicanAlthough he never ruled for gay rights as a lower court judge Kennedy expressed concern about the policy even as he upheld the militarys right to dismiss gay servicemen And Frank J Colucci a political science professor at Purdue University who has written a book about Kennedys jurisprudence recalled that Kennedy in a speech criticized the Supreme Courts 1986 decision in Bowers v Hardwick that upheld a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomyHe came about as close as you can as a lower court judge to saying it was wrongly decided Colucci saidOnce on the court Kennedy was able to say just thatIn the first gay rights case Romer Kennedy wrote for the majority in striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment After some cities in the state began passing laws protecting gays from discrimination in housing employment and other areas voters through a referendum approved the amendment precluding such government protectionsColorados amendment Kennedy wrote classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else This Colorado cannot do A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its lawsThat began something of a callandresponse on the issue Kennedy delivering the majoritys opinion Scalia replying with a scalding dissent read from the bench for emphasisThis court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members of this institution are selected pronouncing that animosity toward homosexuality is evil Scalia wrote in Romer I vigorously dissentIn Lawrence Kennedy got the chance to reverse the courts decision on sodomy and did Bowers was not correct when it was decided and it is not correct today Private homosexual conduct between consenting adults he wrote involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensionsOConnor wrote a concurring opinion to say the ruling did not touch on the matter of whether gays would be able to marryScalia wrote that homosexuals should be free to promote their cause through democratic means but many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business as scoutmasters for their children as teachers in their childrens schools or as boarders in their homeThey view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive he wrote The court views it as discriminationTwo years ago in Windsor Kennedy wrote that the federal governments refusal to offer the same government benefits available to heterosexual couples to legally married gay couples tells all the world that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy and humiliates their childrenAgain Scalia blasted the decision saying the majority was merely being coy in saying the decision did not address whether states are required to give licenses for samesex marriageBy formally declaring anyone opposed to samesex marriage an enemy of human decency the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition he wroteMost federal courts have taken Scalia literallyThe court agrees with Justice Scalias interpretation of Windsor wrote US District Judge Robert J Shelby of Salt Lake CityShelbys decision to strike a marriage ban in Utah was the first such ruling following Windsor and began the path that continues to Tuesdays oral arguments and will end with the courts decision in June40 years later Ive got the license and the faggot letterThe right finds a voice on samesex marriageGay rights religious rights and a compromise in an unlikely place Utah
