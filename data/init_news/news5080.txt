Black Turnout Soft in Early Voting Boding Ill for Hillary Clinton Jeremy Peters et al New York Times November 1 2016 AfricanAmericans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J Trump with Election Day just a week away snip The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play In North Carolina where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an almost surgical assault on black turnout and Republicanrun election boards curtailed earlyvoting sites black turnout is down 16 percent  White turnout however is up 15 percent Democrats are planning an aggressive final push including a visit by President Obama to the state on Wednesday But in Florida which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012 AfricanAmericans share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased  to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago The problems for Democrats do not end there In Ohio which also cut back its early voting voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland Columbus and Toledo has been down though the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on Sunday when AfricanAmerican churches led voter drives across the state snip The Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap especially in North Carolina and Florida by Election Day And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and collegeeducated women which have the potential to more than make up for any dropoff in black voting snip
