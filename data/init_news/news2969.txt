Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said after Thursday nights Fox News Republican debate thatformer Florida Gov Jeb Bush R might have come away a big winnerSpeaking withFox moderator Megyn Kelly shortly after the debate ended Krauthammer said the former Florida governor turned in a strong performance  possibly the best of the night out of all the candidates on stageI thought it was interestingly the best night that Jeb had in all of the debates Krauthammer said And I might even say I think he might have had the best night of the group in this debateHe was very strong He had one moment where he kind of flipped back to Marco Rubio on the question of immigration he saidKrauthammer was referring to a backandforth between Bush and Rubio on supporting a path to citizenship onfor immigrants living in the country illegallyRubio said that Bush used to support a path to citizenship  to which Bush said So did youBush then continued I think its important for people in elected office to try to force consensus to solve problems Theres never going to be a perfect bill  You shouldnt cut and run You should stick with it  He cut and runHe was referring to the 2013 immigration bill that Rubio cosponsoredWhat I found ironic here is it was kind of a reversal of that moment in one of the earlier debates when there was a tangle between Rubio and Bush and Rubio turned it very strongly against Bush Krauthammer said So I thought this was one debate where Bush did very well
