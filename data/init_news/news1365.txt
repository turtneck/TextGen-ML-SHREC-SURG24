Ted Cruz dominated the race for delegate seats at weekend Republican meetings nationwide further positioning the senator from Texas to wrestthe GOP presidential nomination from Donald Trump if the contest is decided on later ballots at the Republican National ConventionIn some instances Cruz supporters won delegate seats in states that Trump won meaning that in most cases they will be required to vote for the businessman on a first ballot But if Trump fails to win the nomination in the first round those Cruz supporters could switch to the senator on subsequent ballotsThe Trump campaign has assured supporters that it would begin performing better in such settings but it still seems more focused on winning most of the remaining 15 contests through June and securing the 1237 delegates needed before the Cleveland conventionTrump still has a commanding lead in delegates  845 compared with559 for Cruz according to the latest tally That is likely tobe padded on Tuesday when Trump is poised to win primaries in New England and the MidAtlantic Given Cruzs struggles to find traction in Acela Primary states hehas shifted his focus to Indiana which votes next month and is seen as the last best chance for the Stop Trump campaign to stop the frontrunnerCan Clinton and Trump ride to big victories in next weeks Acela primaryMaine hosted the marquee weekend contest inwhichCruz won 19 of the 20 delegate seats up for grabs The win sparked a feud with one of Trumps most senior Republican surrogates Gov Paul LePageThe governor claimed that Cruz reneged on an agreement that would have permitted supporters of the three presidential candidates to fill the delegate seats the contenders won in the March caucus That would have meant 12 seats for Cruz nine for Trump and two for Ohio Gov John KasichBut LePage said Cruzs team lied to us and broke the deal adding that David Sawyer a Cruz aide who was in the state helping the senators supporters get elected stabbed us in the back reneged on the unity slate and betrayed the Maine peopleAs we have seen throughout the country Cruzs national campaign is run by greedy political hooligans headded in a state posted on Facebook These are the same operatives in the Republican Establishment who worked for Mitt Romney to disenfranchise Maine delegates in 2012 They are using sneaky and deceitful operators like Sawyer to try to subvert the democratic process and take all 23 delegates I cant stand by and watch as Cruz and the Republican Establishment forcibly overrule the votes of Mainers who chose Trump and KasichBut Cruz aides said no agreement had been finalizedThe guys in the state that helped win the caucus made the decision not to back LePages proposal and put together their own slate said a senior aide to Cruz who wasnotauthorized to speak publicly about the dispute These are the people that represent the interests of Maine and were going to stand with the grassroots activists before we stand with establishment politicians like Govenor LePageDelegate tracker The race to the Republican nominationTrump deployed former neurosurgeon Ben Carson to woo Maine Republicans while Cruz sent former businesswoman Carly

awarded seven delegates Delegates are free to vote as they choose on subsequent ballotsIn Minnesota Republicans in three congressional districts elected Cruz supporters for each of the nine seats up

again failed to have his supporters winseats in South Carolina a state he won overwhelmingly Cruz grabbed a delegate in the 6th Congressional District a mostly Democratic area So did Kasich The third position went to a publicly uncommitted delegate who privately supports Trump according to Republicans familiar with the contest Trump gets all 50 votes on the first ballotThe arcane process of picking Republican delegates continues next weekend in Alaska Arkansas Arizona Delaware Missouri and Virginia The contests in Arizona and Virginia are expected to be most closely watched given that
