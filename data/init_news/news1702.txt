A white male gunman killed three people including one police officer and injured nine others Friday at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs The gunman has been identified as Robert Lewis Dear Its still not clear what the shooters motive was but its clear that he started his shooting spree at Planned Parenthood and stayed thereIts also clear that threats vandalism and violence against abortion providers and clinics have escalated since this summer when antiabortion activists released deceptively edited videos that accused Planned Parenthood of selling baby partsBack in September CBS reported that the FBI had noticed an uptick in attacks on reproductive health care facilities since the first video was released by the antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress CMP There were nine criminal or suspicious incidents including cyber attacks threats and arsons from July when the videos first came out through midSeptemberAn FBI Intelligence Assessment at the time found these attacks were consistent with the actions of lone offenders using tactics of arsons and threats all of which are typical of the prolife extremist movement Moreover the report said it was likely criminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against reproductive health care providers their staff and facilitiesLess than two weeks after CBS reported that another abortion clinic was firebombed in California It was the fourth arson at a Planned Parenthood location in as many monthsThe toxic rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood has dangerous consequences said Sen Dianne Feinstein in a press release at the time It sends a signal that using violence to close clinics and intimidate healthcare professionals and women is OK It is notSince 1977 according to NAF there have been eight murders 17 attempted murders 42 bombings and 186 arsons against abortion clinics and providersAbortion providers have seen an unprecedented increase in hate speech and threats since the CMP videos came out Vicki Saporta president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation said in a statement Friday Incidents of harassment at Planned Parenthood facilities increased ninefold in July when the videos came out over June according to a motion for preliminary injunction that NAF filed this month against CMP and its founder David DaleidenWe have been quite worried that this increase in threats would lead to a violent attack like we saw today Saporta saidIn an October feature at Broadly Callie Beusman interviewed Saporta and representatives from other reproductive health groups They all blamed the videos for an increase in violent rhetoric and actionSasha Bruce senior vice president of campaigns and strategy at NARAL told Beusman that while hateful and intimidating rhetoric against abortion providers is nothing new the intensity and the level is notable of late It is not common that you hear about three arsons in a row it is not common that you hear about this level of vandalism Bruce saidNotably the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood health center where the shooting happened is operated by Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains  one of the targets of CMPs videos One of the doctors featured in those videos was harassed by antiabortion activists at her home according to NAFs motion against CMPMajor prolife groups have condemned the shooting including National Right to Life Committee Americans United for Life Operation Rescue and Christian Defense Coalition David Daleiden of CMP the architect of the antiPlanned Parenthood videos also condemned the shootingsTo some prochoice advocates its ironic to hear these condemnations from Daleiden and from Operation Rescue in particular Operation Rescues senior vice president Cheryl Sullenger was once jailed for conspiring to bomb an abortion clinic The group has a history of extremist rhetoric against abortion providers for years the group protested Dr George Tiller who was shot and killed in 2009 and called him Tiller the Killer The man who murdered Tiller Scott Roeder was active on Operation Rescue message boards And Operation Rescue president Troy Newman who was recently detained and denied entry into Australia for his extremist writings is on the board of Daleidens Center for Medical ProgressShootings at abortion clinics are rare but attacks on clinics like vandalism and arson are common Incidents of harassment that dont rise to the level of criminal activity are so common as to be routine according to volunteers who escort womens health patients past antiabortion clinic protesters And they argue these minor incidents can escalate  after all Scott Roeder vandalized an abortion clinic shortly before he killed George TillerAlthough antiabortion groups may condemn this type of violence when it happens the way that they target and demonize providers contributes to a culture where some feel it is justifiable to murder doctors simply because they provide women with the abortion care they need said Saporta of NAF in her Friday statementVicki Cowart president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains cautioned on Friday that we still dont know the motive for the shooting But she also said that PPRM shares the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country
