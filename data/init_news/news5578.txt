Print Of all the weeks to turn in a late Follies post from your LU Football Commentary Service Weve already had two outcomes for our Inner Circle more below in case youre still in suspense But were also in a position to ask the eternal question if Cal and USC play and no one pays attention did anything happen FWIW USC won 4524 Another Storied Rivalry settled for 2016 Cal ballcaps back in the closet folks Next week CFB rankings to lampoon Tennessee whupped up on Jacksonville Thursday night in the pros As nature seems to have intended this year Get a defense Jags Inner circle The University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane 42 which beat Notre Dame 2827 on 30 October 2010 will be at Memphis Saturday for an American West showdown The Tigers are giving 65 but we think TU has a better shot than that Should be a good game Oklahoma holding steady at 16 hosts Kansas motto What difference at this point does it make on Saturday evening while laying a ridiculous 405 Has the betting fraternity been held in isolation for the last six weeks Kansas isnt nearly as bad as they were a year ago and Oklahomas defense couldnt stop a gumwrapper chain if it were barreling down the field Anything could happen but this is just the sort of situation where Oklahoma ends up struggling in the final 2 minutes to stay on top of a 3point lead Well believe 40 when we see it Oklahoma State gets to host 10 West Virginia pride of the Big 12 in Stillwater early Saturday As befits a ranked visitor facing a Gundy squad the Mountaineers are giving but not a lot  35 That said WVU could well find a way to rattle Cowboy QB Mason Rudolph Game by game the Mountaineers have tended to be a onetrick pony on defense this year but they keep finding the right trick to get the job done New 22 Navy will be squaring off with South Florida at RayJay in Tampa by the time this goes to post The 62 Bulls top the American East at the moment while 51 Navy leads the American West so there will be a lot of talk about a conferencechamp preview The Bulls scored 35 on Florida State in a wild earlyseason loss but just took a bad dive last game against Temple Theyre favored by 6 but Navys likely to cover Umm Well any minute now Navys going to start getting in the same hemisphere as covering Good grief Navys secondary just cant keep up with these guys Army will be in WinstonSalem to take on Wake Forest Saturday on the short end of 7 Wake could more than cover but Army took a drubbing from North Texas last week and will be out for blood Key week to see if this years Black Knights are for real Air Force  also coming off a painful loss to Hawaii heads to Fresno State Friday evening for the late game Falcons give 145 We think the Bulldogs will cover Virginia Tech  back at 25 for now knocked off Pitt 3936 in a rockemsockem slugfest last night in Pittsburgh Hardfought battle with major yardage on both sides but some intermittently impressive defense poking through as well See what you can do Hokies when you dont eat yourselves alive with penalties and turnovers Nevada  were happy to say has the week off New 19 LSU is off this week as well preparing for the rivalry bout with Alabama next week For all you offense fans out there TCU hosts Texas Tech on Saturday We personally are going to be extremely disappointed if the combined total points clock in anywhere south of 130 Toads give 95 Kansas State is off to Iowa State to see what the Wildcats can do with the 16 Cyclones bad habit of losing KState is 43 and a solid shot for a bowl bid  but still facing OKState Baylor rival KU and TCU down the stretch they really want to add to the W column this weekend Toledo is our other Thursday night winner because we just know they had a Great Learning Experience coming in second to Ohio last night 3126 for those with a thirst for data Apparently its been quite a while since the Bobcats won in Toledo Seemed to be all anybody could talk about Rockets go to 62 their biggest conference game at divisionleader and 20 Western Michigan will be Thanksgiving week and when they win that one they may just get another crack at Ohio for the MAC crown Wyoming hosts 13 Boise State and its a measure of the Cowboys improved performance this year that the Broncos are only laying 135 It wouldnt surprise us exactly for the Pokes to cover Top 10 1 Alabama is off preparing as any sensible team would to meet LSU New 2 Michigan heads to East Lansing for something theyve been wanting to do since 2012 win the Paul Bunyan Trophy back from Michigan State This is the year they can do it The Wolverines give 24 at the moment The 25 Spartans will play them tough of course but were figuring on Blue from out here in the cheap seats And who cares if the trophy looks like a manly mans Hummel figurine Theres nothing foofy about you know collecting In default of better options Clemson is cycling back through 3 and takes on 12 FSU in Tallahassee in the marquee slot on Saturday evening Tigers give only 4 even though the Noles havent been all that recently The one and only Paul Bunyan Trophy in play once more Image Wikipedia New 4 Washington is at 17 Utah giving 11 New 5 Louisville heads to Charlottesville with a gift of 33 for hapless Virginia New 6 Ohio State which owes us all an apology for upsetting the top 10 in this incontinent way hosts Northwestern giving 275 New 7 Nebraska will be at 11 Wisconsin facing the real probability of losing top 10 standing in their Storied Rivalry game not to mention the Freedom Trophy Which may be Just A Trophy but is discreetly attractive at least Badgers give 95 Why they fight Image UW Athletic Communications via Fox Sports New 8 Baylor is at Texas giving 35 and better watch its six 9 Texas AM hosts New Mexico State which makes for a meeting of Aggies but doesnt seem to have a lot of other merits AM is laying 435 Best of the rest We cant vouch in advance for the football but its always an exciting weekend when Florida 14 and Georgia meet in their Storied Rivalry to fight for the Okefenokee Oar 15 Auburn at Ole Miss might be kind of interesting Miami at Notre Dame holds possibilities featuring a tight 15point spread Arsh and the usual primo slot on the Notre Dame Broadcasting Channel The Okefenokee Oars glamour shot from its Facebook page Other ranks In FCS McNeese State hosts Abilene Christian for the Cowboy Homecoming on Saturday evening Abilene Christian is 17 and sucks royally but they are coming off their one win over Incarnate Word and McNeese has whiffed on some softballs this season But Go Pokes 70s and clear for the 6 PM game start In Div II Slippery Rock 53 heads to Clarion to take on PSAC rival Clarion U on Saturday The Eagles are 26 and have already had their obligatory losses to ranked powerhouses California U PA and IUP We dont want to say its cake for Clarion from here on but we do suspect SRU may be a tad more motivated Little Clarion PA pop 5000 is northeast of Pittsburgh and Slippery Rock and just southwest of the Allegheny National Forest where it will be in the 60s and clouding up something fierce for the noon kickoff In Div III RoseHulman  AKA The Bomb is now 62 and perched atop the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference after the epic win over Franklin The Fightin Engineers host Bluffton U OH in Terre Haute on Saturday in a game that could be a showstopper The Beavers come in 61 41 conference and although they lost to Franklin they beat RHITs archrival Mt St Joe in September Fight hard Engineers 70s and overcast for the 130 PM kickoff Christopher Newport  now 52 after the owwie at Frostburg State could do itself some major good hosting Salisbury U MD for Homecoming Saturday night Salisbury 61 is second in the NJAC behind Frostburg but also ranked 17 in the Coaches Poll See how easy Vault Salisbury and Wesley which CNU beat a few weeks ago in the NJAC and maybe surge back into the top 25 Well its a goal Topping out at 70 with clear skies for the 4 PM game start Merchant Marine has the week off Pros Our Redskins lead us off Sunday morning playing Cincinnati at the ungodly hour of 630 AM PDT because theyll be at Wembley Stadium in London Bengals give 3 New Orleans hosts Seattle 25 in the godlier early slot San Diego and Denver are going to get right back on that horse in Sports Authority at Mile High and wed like to see the Broncos do something with their 4point give this time They did wallop the Texans for what thats worth Dallas has a big one coming up Sunday night hosting Philly in Arlington The 5point Cowboy advantage isnt completely unjustifiable Steelers have the week off Monday night gives us Minnesota 45 at Chicago
