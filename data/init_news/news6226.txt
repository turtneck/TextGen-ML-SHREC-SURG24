Last year a white male Princeton undergraduate was asked by a classmate to check his privilegeOffended by this suggestion he shot off a 1300word essay to theTory a rightwing campus newspaperIn it he wrote about his grandfather who fled the Nazis to Siberia his grandmother who survived a concentration camp in Germany about the humble wicker basket business they started in America He railed against his classmates for diminishing everything hed accomplished all the hard work hed doneHis missive was reprinted byTime He was interviewed by theNew York Timesand appeared on Fox News He became a darling of white conservatives across the countryWhat he did not do at any point was consider whether being white and male might have given himif not his ancestorssome advantage in achieving incredible success in America He did not in other words check his privilegeTo Robin DiAngelo professor of multicutural education at Westfield State University and author ofWhat Does it Mean to Be White Developing White Racial LiteracyTal Fortgangs essayindignant defensive besidethepoint somehow both selfpitying and selfaggrandizingfollowed a familiar script As an antiracist educator for more than two decades DiAngelo has heard versions of it recited hundreds of times by white men and women in her workshopsShes heard it so many times in fact that she came up with a term for it white fragility which she defined in a2011 journal articleas a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable triggering a range of defensive moves These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger fear and guilt and behaviors such as argumentation silence and leaving the stressinducing situationWhen the Black Lives Matter movement marched in the streets holding up traffic disrupting commerce and refusing to allow normal life to resumeinsofar as normalcy means a system that permits police and vigilantes to murder black men and women with impunitywhite people found themselves in tense conversations online with friends and in the media about privilege white supremacy and racism You could say white fragility was at an alltime highI spoke with DiAngelo abouthow to deal with all the fragile white people and why its worth doing soSam AdlerBell How did you come to write about white fragilityRobin DiAngelo To be honest I wanted to take it on because its a frustrating dynamic that I encounter a lot I dont have a lot of patience for it And I wanted to put a mirror to itI do atypical work for a white person which is that I lead primarily white audiences in discussions on race every day in workshops all over the country That has allowed me to observe very predictable patterns And one of those patterns is this inability to tolerate any kind of challenge to our racial reality We shut down or lash out or in whatever way possible block any reflection from taking placeOf course it functions as means of resistance but I think its also useful to think about it as fragility as inability to handle the stress of conversations about race and racismSometimes its strategic a very intentional push back and rebuttal But a lot of the time the person simply cannot function They regress into an emotional state that prevents anybody from moving forwardSAB Carla Murphy recently referenced white fragility in an article forColorlines and Ive seen it referenced on Twitter and Facebook a lot lately It seems like its having a moment Why do you think that isRD I think we get tired of certain terms What I do used to be called diversity training then cultural competency and now antiracism These terms are really useful for periods of time but then they get coopted and people build all this baggage around them and you have to come up with new terms or else people wont engageAnd I think white privilege has reached that point It rocked my world when I first really got it when I came acrossPeggy McIntosh Its a really powerful start for people But unfortunately its been played so much now that it turns people offSAB What causes white fragility to set inRD For white people their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people about moral or immoral singular acts and if were good moral people we cant be racist  we dont engage in those acts This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over timethat we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not doingIn large part white fragilitythe defensiveness the fear of conflictis rooted in this goodbad binary If you call someone out they think to themselves What you just said was that I am a bad person and that is intolerable to me Its a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good moral peopleThe goodbad binary is also what leads to the very unhelpful phenomenon of unfriending on FacebookSAB Right because the instinct is to unfriend to dissociate from those bad white people so that Im not implicated in their badnessRD When Im doing a workshop with white people Ill often say If we dont work with each other if we give in to that pull to separate who have we left to deal with the white person that weve given up on and wont addressRD Exactly And white fragility also comes from a deep sense of entitlement Think about it like this from the time I opened my eyes I have been told that as a white person I am superior to people of color Theres never been a space in which I have not been receiving that message From what hospital I was allowed to be born in to how my mother was treated by the staff to who owned the hospital to who cleaned the rooms and took out the garbage We are born into a racial hierarchy and every interaction with media and culture confirms itour sense that at a fundamental level we are superiorAnd the thing is it feels good Even though it contradicts our most basic principles and values So we know it but we can never admit it It creates this kind of dangerous internal stew that gets enacted externally in our interactions with people of color and is crazymaking for people of color We have set the world up to preserve that internal sense of superiority and also resist challenges to it All while denying that anything is going on and insisting that race is meaningless to usSAB Something that amazes me is the sophistication of some white peoples defensive maneuvers I have a black friend who was accused of online harassment by a white friend after he called her out in a harsh way What do you see going on there RD First of all whites often confuse comfort with safety We say we dont feel safe when what we mean is that we dont feelcomfortable Secondly no white person looks at a person of color through objective eyes Theres been a lot of research in this area Crossracially we do not see with objective eyes Now you add that hes a black man Its not a fluke that she picked the word harassed In doing that shes reinforcing a really classic racist paradigm White women and black men White womens frailty and black mens aggressiveness and danger But even if she is feeling that which she very well may be we should be suspicious of our feelings in these interactions Theres no such thing as pure feeling You have a feeling because youve filtered the experience through a particular lens The feeling is the outcome It probably feels natural but of course its shaped by what you believe SAB Theres also the issue of tonepolicing here right RD Yes One of the things I try to work with white people on is letting go of our criteria about how people of color give us feedback We have to build our stamina to just be humble and bear witness to the pain weve caused In my workshops one of the things I like to ask white people is What are the rules for how people of color should give us feedback about our racism What are the rules where did you get them and whom do they serve Usually those questions alone make the point Its like if youre standing on my head and I say Get off my head and you respond Well you need to tell me nicely Id be like No Fuck you Get off my fucking head In the course of my work Ive had many people of color give me feedback in ways that might be perceived as intense or emotional or angry And on one level its personalI did do that thing that triggered the response but at the same time it isntonlypersonal I represent a lifetime of people that have hurt them in the same way that I just did And honestly the fact that they are willing to show me demonstrates on some level that they trust me RD If people of color went around showing the pain they feel in every moment that they feel it they could be killed It is dangerous They cannot always share their outrage about the injustice of racism White people cant tolerate it And we punish it severelyfrom job loss to violence to murder For them to take that risk and show us that is a moment of trust I say bring it on thank you When Im doing a workshop Ill often ask the people of color in the room somewhat facetiously How often have you given white people feedback about our inevitable and often unconscious racist patterns and had that go well for you And they laugh Because it just doesnt go well And so one time I asked What would your daily life be like if you could just simply give us feedback have us receive it graciously reflect on it and work to change the behavior What would your life be like And this one man of color looked at me and said It would berevolutionary SAB I notice as weve been talking that you almost always use the word we when describing white peoples tendencies Can you tell me why you do that RD Well for one Im white and youre white And even as committed as I am Im not outside of anything that Im talking about here If I went around saying white people this and white people that it would be a distancing move I dont want to reinforce the idea that there are some whites who are done and others that still need work Theres no being finished Plus in my work Im usually addressing white audiences and the we diminishes defensiveness somewhat It makes them more comfortable They see that Im not just pointing fingers outward SAB Do you ever worry about recentering whiteness RD Well yes I continually struggle with that reality By standing up there as an authority on whiteness Im necessarily reinforcing my authority as a white person It goes with the territory For example youre interviewingmenow on whiteness and people of color have been saying these things for a very long time On the one hand I know that in many ways white people can hear me in a way that they cant hear people of color They listen So by god Im going to use my voice to challenge racism The only alternative I can see is to not speak up and challenge racism And that is not acceptable to me SAB Yes and racism is something that everyone thinks theyre an authority on RD That drives me crazy Ill run into someone I havent seen in 20 years in the grocery store and theyll say Hi Whatve you been doing And I say I got my PhD And they say Oh wow what in And theyll go Oh well you know People just need to As if theyre going to give me the onesentence answer to arguably the most challenging social dynamic of our time Like hey why did I knock myself out for 20 years studying researching and challenging this within myself and others I should have just come to you And the answer is so simple Ive never heard that one before Imagine if I was an astronomer Everybody has a basic understanding of the sky but they would not debate an astronomer on astronomy The arrogance of white people faced with questions of race is unbelievable
