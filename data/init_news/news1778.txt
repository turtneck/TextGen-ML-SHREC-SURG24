Donald Trump has a goto response whenever someone asks whether the angry impulsiveness he displays on the campaign trail befits a US president  whether voters should trust him with his finger on the trigger as the question is often phrasedHe opposed the 2003 invasion of IraqThats always his answer And it proves according to Trump that behind the bluster is a man of sober judgment who wont rush the country into a war it will come to regretThe problem with Trumps logic is that in 2002  before the invasion  he actually said he favored going into Iraq We learned this Thursday night when BuzzFeeds Andrew Kaczynski dug up an old interview Trump gave to shock jock Howard Stern of all peopleIn the interview which took place on Sept 11 2002 Stern asked Trump directly if he was for invading IraqYeah I guess so Trump responded I wish the first time it was done correctlyThis is a good get It shows that once again Trump is selling revisionist history to his backersBut its also probably unlikely to change the minds of many peopleThe GOP frontrunner has said that he was against the invasion so many times over the course of months that it is cemented as truth for those who support him Until Thursday night there hadnt been much reason to doubt Trumps version of events because there had been scant evidence to contradict himAnd even now its likely Trump backers will look at this comment and think He was put on the spot and didnt give a strong answer maybe he hadnt thought it through yet and maybe he came to oppose it laterThis what Trump does He strategically picks claims that are difficult to factcheck In this case it took months for someone to find the interview with Stern which  having been conducted outside the mainstream news media  was tucked away in a place that journalists wouldnt immediately think to lookBuzzFeed appears to have been on the case for a while In September after Trump said during a debate that he was the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq Kaczynski wrote that theres no record of Donald Trump being against the Iraq War before it startedTrue enough But finding no record isnt the same as finding proof to the contrary which BuzzFeed didnt turn up until Thursday Others have tried to factcheck Trumps Iraq invasion opposition too but they always seemed to be groping around for a way to prove a negative  that the Manhattan billionaire didnt state his antiwar position as loud and clear as he claims todayProving a negative is always difficult and often unconvincing Theres always a chance that youll miss somethingThats what happened in November when the media tried to debunk Trumps assertion that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the collapse of the World Trade Center on 911 The mediawas left to prove that something Trump says happeneddidnt happen Reporters did their best but all Trump needed to vindicate himself among supporters was to turn up a few clips talking aboutsmall groups of celebrating MuslimsIt didnt matter then that Trumps original claim about 911 was a wild exaggeration And it almost surely wont matter now that his supposed opposition to the Iraq invasion appears to be revisionist history
