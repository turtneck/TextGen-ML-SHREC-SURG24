Its debate season where social media has brought political spin into real time favoring speed over contemplation and risking a hardening of polarizationRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the spin room after the first presidential debate against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at Hofstra University on Monday Sept 26 2016 in Hempstead NYThe next big debate of the 2016 campaign is a day away and preevent spin is in full gearHeres how it goes Our guy is great and your guy cant help your nominee whos hopeless Reverse the names rinse and repeatThe spin will go on in real time via social media and email while Gov Mike Pence R of Indiana and Sen Tim Kaine D of Virginia duke it out Tuesday night in the campaigns one and only vice presidential debate And after its over efforts to sway the media narrative and ultimately public opinion will continue perhaps for daysImagemaking has been around since the beginning of the Republic but in the era of social media the art of spin may be changing in profound waysConsider Walter Podraziks class on mass media and politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago The day after the first TrumpClinton debate he asked his students what struck them about the spinSpin They didnt need to stick around for that they told Mr Podrazik They had already experienced it via Twitter Facebook and other shared messaging in real time while the debate unfolded he saysThe before and after spinning is likely to be with us forever but its the during part that has changed the game thanks to social media For those who enjoy realtime commentary experiencing a debate solely within ones own socialmedia ecosystem may point to a hardening of the ideological silos that people inhabit  and perhaps a hardening of political polarizationResearch shows that we tend to interact on social media with people who are kind of like us says David Redlawsk a political scientist at the University of Delaware Newark and author of the book How Voters Decide We dont get overly challenged on our beliefsThat may be no different from oldstyle socializing  at the Rotary Club or the womens club or the neighborhood corner hangout But more than ever with major political events social media has brought analysis and spin into real time favoring speed over contemplation and setting in motion a narrative that can be hard to changeAt the same time social media can have a democratizing effect Anybody can jump in with a pithy comment or observationPerhaps Podraziks students are a harbinger of the future  a world in which a presidential debate ends and is immediately followed on TV by  regularly scheduled programing not pundits offering analysis and partisans trying to shape impressions of what just happened And at the debate venue itself maybe theres no more spin alley the place where reporters go for a postgame scrum with candidate surrogatesNo spin alley in fact was one recommendation last year by the Annenberg Working Group on Presidential Debate Reform The spin room is a tired ritual that adds to the spectacle and cost of the debates and takes away from the real purpose  to get the candidates to hash out the issues of the day the groups report said And besides the spin is already happening via email and Twitter the report added echoing Podraziks studentsThe Commission on Presidential Debates saw things differently and kept the spin room  and the live audience and all the hoopla Which fit right into Republican nominee Donald Trumps planAs he did after many of the GOP primary debates Mr Trump headed straight for the spin room after Mondays debate a first for a majorparty presidential nominee But thats Trump the onetime reality TV star If theres a limelight he wants to be in the middle of it  no matter how well or not he did in a debateSo clearly its too soon to write off the old way of experiencing political debates After all a recordbreaking 84 million people watched the first TrumpClinton debate on TV  and not everyone of course was simultaneously checking the blizzard of instapunditry available onlineTV is still more important than Twitter and Facebook says David Greenberg author of the book Republic of Spin That may not be true in 20 years But for now the average citizen interested in politics is going to watch the debates on a TV channel and will be at least somewhat interested in what the anchors and pundits have to sayMany people too are curious what the candidate spinners have to say And as long as the ratings are there the networks will keep showing it  not because we believe it lock stock and barrel but because its part of the process says Mr Greenberg an associate professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick NJViewers know that its spin he says because its presented as suchWere capable of arguing with it criticizing it and seeing through it if its phony or cynical and applauding it if its done in the service of the candidate we like and we think its effective Greenberg says So people arent easily duped by these argumentsStill there are those who argue for just tuning out once a debate is overI basically tell people after debates shut the TV off says Kathleen Hall Jamieson director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia Get off social media and ask yourself What was important to you What did you learn that mattered to you before all this other stuff crowds out your learningOf course anyone who did so last Monday night would have missed the unprecedented spectacle of Trump and his entourage descending upon the spin room All the online polls say I was the big winner he boasted Thats about as spinny as it gets instant online polls are notoriously unreliable Morereputable polls showed Hillary Clinton winning bigAnd those arguing for the abolishment of the spin room might well find a reporters revolt on their handsFirst came Don King the boxing promoter clutching an Israeli flag and wearing a button with Donald Trumps face the size of a sandwich he reports Then Omarosa the Apprentice star arrived in a lowcut dress and took selfies with the fans Mark Cuban  the businessman Dallas Mavericks owner and Clinton supporter  recounted the joys of sitting in the front row of the debatePerhaps it was more side show than real show Though some actual information was imparted Mr Cuban said hes not running for president Trump said he felt the moderator NBCs Lester Holt had done a great job a view that soon changed And hordes of campaign surrogates and party officials made their points to reporters the standard fare of any spin roomFor reporters who have a hard time getting the campaigns to return phone calls its a chance to grab facetime and a comment from a harried aideBy the next day the story had already evolved Alicia Machado the Venezuelan beauty queen whom Trump had fatshamed 20 years ago  an episode raised by Clinton during the debate  became the center of attention and remained there for days Debatenight spin was soon old news Now the Machado story dominates memories of the debate just as Khizr Khans speech at the Democratic National Convention about his slain soldierson and Trumps subsequent attacks on the Khan family became a defining moment of that eventAs with the conventions presidential debates have built up a lore of their own And on occasion postdebate commentary has shifted the perceptions of the outcome In 1976 when President Ford debated Georgia Gov Jimmy Carter initial polls suggested Mr Ford had won Then the media highlighted Fords remark about no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and Mr Carter and the media hammered him on it Ford soon had to respond and is forever remembered as having misspoken at that debateToday perceptions in social media of how Trump and Clinton did in their first debate  that Clinton trounced him  tracked with the assessments of pundits and pollsIt was kind of hard to come to any other conclusion says Greenberg One does have to trust in free speech andthe ability of people to make judgmentsBy weeks end Trump had engaged in a sort of antispin via social media  a middleofthenight tweet storm attacking Machado that has only harmed Trumps image further And therein lies the irony in the role of social media in the 2016 campaign No amount of spinning  on social media or otherwise  can undo what Trump does to himself when he decides to rage on Twitter at 3 oclock in the morningThen quickly enough another big story pops Trump tax documents leaked to The New York Times showing a 916 million loss in 1995 that would have allowed him to avoid paying taxes for 18 years And its on to another spin cycle  both the oldfashioned kind and on Twitter
