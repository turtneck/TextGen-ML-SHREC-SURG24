WASHINGTON  For four months the Republican Party and its many presidential hopefuls have laid into likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over donations to a family foundation That these attacks contradict the GOPs broader stand on campaign finance  and call into question their own weighty burden of donor conflicts  hasnt troubled them at allSen Rand Paul RKy called contributions to the nonprofit Clinton Foundation thinly veiled bribes The nation cant afford the drama represented by those donations according to Sen Marco Rubio RFla Former HewlettPackard CEO Carly Fiorina asked Clinton to explain why contributions to the foundation dont represent a conflict of interest And the Republican National Committee has made the donations a central part of its campaign against ClintonIn embracing this critique of the Clinton Foundation Republicans are investing in a view of money in politics that they have otherwise rejected in recent years that spending money to gain influence over or access to elected or appointed officials represents a conflict of interest or an appearance of corruption or could even lead to outright corruptionSince 2010 the conservative Supreme Court majority has rejected this argument as a reason to regulate campaign finance in their Citizens United McCutcheon and WilliamsYulee decisions Most leading Republican federal officeholders now take the view that spending of any sort on campaigns should not be impeded by legal restrictions as fears of corruption are overblownSo the critical piling on Clinton Foundation donations creates a problem for Republicans especially those running for president If contributions to the foundation a 501c3 entity not involved in political campaigns create a valid source of corruption concern then what are we to make of the hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed donations to 501c4 nonprofits that have worked to elect Republicans over the past three electionsSince the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision opened the door for unlimited corporate union and ultimately individual spending on elections Republicans have maneuvered to use socalled dark money nonprofits to fund large portions of their electoral efforts Dark money spending on federal races exceeded 400 million in the 2012 presidential election and 200 million in the 2014 midterms with the vast majority of those dollars going to aid Republican candidates according to previous analysis by The Huffington PostThe public is not privy however to the sources of funds fueling a large part of the Republican electoral apparatus and a smaller part of Democratic efforts Party leaders and wealthy donors have increasingly worked through nonprofits that are not required to disclose their funding sourcesRepublicans including those now running for president defend dark money groups as a means to protect what they argue is the First Amendment right of donors to engage in political activity without retaliation Perhaps that retaliation would come in the form of stories informing the public about how those donors are seeking to influence public policyThe very limited record on dark money shows that those funding these groups  just like those funding super PACs which must identify their donors  include many highpowered corporate and individual interests with wellconnected lobbyists in search of favors HuffPost reports have found that dark money groups tightly connected to congressional and party leadership both Democratic and Republican have received large sums from pharmaceutical insurance banking and online payday lenders seeking specific policy changes while retaining lobbyists previously employed by those very leadersFormer Florida Gov Jeb Bush has his Right to Rise Policy Solutions which is playing an increasingly important role in his notyetdeclared superPACcentered presidential campaign Rubios advisers run the Conservative Policy Solutions group in collaboration with an affiliated super PAC And potential candidates like former Texas Gov Rick Perry former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal are all running around the country fueled by funding from undisclosed nonprofit groupsIn 2012 Walker faced a recall election after labor unions in his state rebelled over legislation gutting public employee union rights His recall campaign coordinated with a band of nonprofit political groups led by the Wisconsin Club for Growth to promote Walker and his policies in a positive light Walker aides worked closely with the outside groups and the governor directly raised undisclosed contributions for the effortJohn Menard Jr considered the wealthiest man in Wisconsin was another big donor to the saveWalker effort The billionaire owner of the chain store Menards gave 15 million to the Wisconsin Club for Growth according to a report by Yahoo News During Walkers term in office Menards company received 18 million in tax credits from an economic development corporation led by the governor He also received help in his battle with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as Walker defanged the watchdog agencyThe same failure to see their own conflicts applies to candidates elected since the Citizens United decision precipitated the dramatic rise in dark money Both Paul and Rubio were elected to the Senate in 2010 with 23 million and 27 million respectively in allied spending by groups that do not disclose their donors including the Karl Rovefounded Crossroads GPS and the US Chamber of CommerceThanks to its bankruptcy filings it is known that forprofit Corinthian Colleges made contributions to Crossroads GPS While the dates and amounts of those donations are still hidden Rubios strong support for Corinthian is wellestablished In 2014 he pleaded with the Department of Education for leniency for the company as it faced a fraud investigationNo one doubts that huge sums of dark money will again be spent supporting presidential candidates in the 2016 election While the public will be able to consider whether the corporations billionaires and foreign governments that contributed to the Clinton Foundation would hold undue sway over a Clinton White House they will not even know the identities of those pouring in the secret donations
