President Obama announced Thursday he will keep 5500 US troops in Afghanistan beyond 2016 in a stark reversal from earlier pledges to end the war on his watch  though Republicans still questioned whether the residual force will be enough to support Afghan forces and US alliesThe decision follows months of appeals from military leaders to extend the drawdown timeline And it marks an acknowledgement that despite claims Al Qaeda is on the run militants continue to pose a serious threat to the countryObama originally had planned to pull out all but a small embassybased US military presence by the end of next year But military leaders argued the Afghans needed additional assistance and support from the US to beat back a resurgent Taliban and hold onto gains made over the last 14 yearsUnder the new plan the administration will keep the current force of 9800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year then draw down to 5500 troops in 2017 at a pace still to be determined by commandersWhile Americas combat mission in Afghanistan may be over our commitment to Afghanistan and its people endures Obama said at the White House in announcing his decisionThe president stressed that he does not support the idea of endless war but said Afghan forces are not as strong as they need to be and the Taliban have made gains leading to a very fragile security situation in key areas of the countryHe called the new plan the best possibility for lasting progress in Afghanistan while saying the US mission will not change even after 2016Concerns about Afghan security were reinforced when Taliban fighters took control of Kunduz late last month prompting a protracted battle with Afghan forces on the ground supported by US airstrikes During the fighting a US airstrike hit a hospital killing 22 people including 12 Doctors Without Borders staff and 10 patientsUS commanders have also expressed concern about Islamic State fighters moving into the country and gaining recruits from within the Taliban And on another front the US military launched a major operation against two Al Qaeda camps in Kandahar earlier this month one of the camps reportedly was almost 30 square miles The operation included dozens of airstrikesRepublicans welcomed Obamas decision Thursday to keep more troops in the country to deal with these threats  but questioned whether 5500 troops would be enoughI am pleased that President Obama has decided to keep US troops in Afghanistan to perform the right missions beyond 2016 both in and outside of Kabul Sen John McCain RAriz chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a statement However I am concerned that the number of troops will not be sufficient to perform the critical tasks being set for them counterterrorism and continuing to train and advise our Afghan partners The bottom line is that 5500 troops will only be adequate to conduct either the counterterrorism or the train and advise mission but not both Our military commanders have said that both are critical to prevent Afghanistan from spiraling into chaosRep Peter King RNY told Fox News there was no way Afghan forces could have tackled the Taliban if all US forces withdrew This was a disaster waiting to happen he saidBut he called the presidents compromise plan a containment strategy and questioned whether the small number would be enoughWhile this new plan avoids a disaster it is certainly not a plan for success Rep Mac Thornberry RTexas chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said in a statement He also criticized the president for threatening to veto defense legislation that provides their pay benefits and the authorities they need to get the job done  in reference to an ongoing dispute over a defense authorization bill that would bust budget capsUS officials have been hinting at the policy shift for weeks noting that conditions on the ground in Afghanistan have changed since Obamas initial decision on a sharper troop withdrawal timeline was made more than two years ago The White House has also been buoyed by having a more reliable partner in Afghan President Ashraf Ghani who succeeded the mercurial Hamid Karzai last yearThe narrative that were leaving Afghanistan is selfdefeating Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday during a speech at the Association of the US Army Were not we cant and to do so would not be to take advantage of the success weve had to dateAsked Thursday if 5500 troops is enough Carter said We did a lot of homework on this He maintained that the troop presence along with continued financial assistance and training for the Afghan military are the ingredients to continue the prosecution of the missionThe troops staying in Afghanistan beyond next year will continue to focus on counterterrorism missions and training and advising Afghan security forces officials said They will be based in Kabul and Bagram Air Field as well as bases in Jalalabad and KandaharThe presidents decision to keep the US military in Afghanistan beyond his tenure thrusts the conflict into the 2016 presidential race The next president will become the third US commander in chief to oversee the war with the options of trying to bring it to a close maintaining the presence as Obama left it or even ramping up US involvement in the conflictOfficials said discussions on staying in Afghanistan longer began during Ghanis visit to Washington in March The top US commander in Afghanistan Gen John Campbell recently presented the president with a range of options calling for keeping more troops thereOfficials said NATO allies had expressed support for extending the troop presence in Afghanistan but they did not outline any specific commitments from other nationsObama campaigned for the White House on a pledge to end Americas involvement in the two wars he inherited Iraq and Afghanistan Now hell likely finish his presidency with troops back in both countriesThe president did withdraw all US troops from Iraq in late 2011 a moment he heralded as a promise kept to a warweary nation But the rise of the Islamic State drew the US military back into Iraq last year to train and assist local security forces and launch airstrikesObama announced the end of the Afghan war with similar fanfare last spring saying it was time for the US to turn the page on more than a decade of deadly conflictsIn March at a press conference with Ghani he said The date for us to have completed our drawdown will not changeThe Associated Press contributed to this report
