Most are familiar with the Jaywalking quizzes Jay Leno regularly did on the streets of Universal Studios They often included American civics questions The answers were often laughably pathetic Unfortunately they are representative of the general citizenrys knowledgeAccording to studies byAnnenberg Public Policy Center only about a third 38 percent of Americans can name the three branches of Americas government executive legislative and judicial much less explain what each doesAlso surprisingly only 32 percent of Americans could correctly identify the US Constitution as the supreme law of the land according to the Xavier Center for the Study of the American Dream According to this same study only 32 percent of Americans knew how many US Senators there were 100 and only 29 percent knew the length of a US Senators term in office six yearsVoter turnout for the 2014 national election was the lowest it has been since World War II according to the United States Election Project In a country that is supposed to be thegold standard for democracy this is simply unacceptableWhy is this happening One reason is the lack of emphasis put on civics education in our educational curricula Voters dont vote because they dont understand the process or the power that comes from their votesThese jarring facts are why I have been actively involved in Utahs successful effort to pass the American Civics Education Initiative in Utahs recently concluded legislative sessionIf you dont know it takes four balls for a walk and three strikes for a strike out in baseball its not likely youre a baseball fan If you dont know the basics in American civics youre not likely to be interested in votingThe American Civics Education Initiativeis simple in concept Students must pass a test from the 100 basic facts of US history and civics taken from the same test all potential citizens must master before becoming American citizensThis legislation now enacted in Utah as well as Arizona Idaho North Dakota and South Dakota allows students to take the test any time during their high school career and as many times as necessary to pass By using this wellestablished test and the study materials that are already easily available online for free this legislation has nearly no implementation costsSome 91 percent of immigrants applying for citizenship pass the civics test on their first try I recently attended a citizenship swearingin ceremony at Liberty Park in Salt Lake City an appropriately named place for this inspiring event New citizens swore an oath of allegiance to our Republic dedicated to life liberty and the pursuit of happinessI saw firsthand how excited these new citizens were to become Americans as well as the sense of pride they had in having passed the test They knewtheir stuffUtah high school students will now be able to share in that satisfaction of accomplishment As I travel around Utah to meet with students I see how bright enthusiastic and capable they are I hope that they are also inspired to participate in our democracyWhen leaving Independence Hall at the close of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 Benjamin Franklin was asked Well Doctor what have we got  a republic or a monarchy Franklin responded A republic if you can keep it The question is how do we keep itOur republic depends on an informed engaged citizenry When so many of our fellow citizens dont know how our government works  and even fewer vote  power becomes concentrated in the hands of the few We put the bedrock concept of We the People at riskIf our students dont know how our democracy works and who we are as a people their participation ourgovernment will continue to wane We cant risk that As Representative Steve Eliason one of the sponsors of Utahs law aptly said during the legislative debate The American Civics Education Initiative is chicken soup for our ailing civic soulUtah has taken an important first step in helping bolster American civics education Legislators across the country need to follow suit and pass similar American civics education legislation in their own states Only then will the phrase We the People live up to its original intentJonathan Johnson is the chairman of Overstockcom Inc and the cochairman of the Civics Education Initiative in Utah
