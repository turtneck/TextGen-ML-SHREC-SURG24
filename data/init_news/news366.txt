CNN A pair of convicted killers who escaped from an upstate New York prison may have headed across the border to Vermont fearing the pressure of an intense manhunt in the neighboring state authorities said WednesdayNew York State Police Superintendent Joseph DAmico said authorities are looking behind every tree under every rock and inside every structure for fugitives Richard Matt 48 and David Sweat 34 The pair made a brazen escape over the weekend from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora The search  now in its fifth day  involves more than 400 law enforcement officers The state is offering a 100000 rewardIn a news conference outside the maximumsecurity prison about 20 miles south of the Canadian border  Vermont Gov Peter Shumlin said the search area had expanded to his state based on information the inmates believed New York was going to be hot and Vermont  cooler in terms of law enforcementVermont state police vessels and additional troopers will conduct patrols on Lake Champlain which cuts across the states In addition searches will include campsites and public campgroundsWe have information that would suggest that Vermont was discussed as a possible location New York Gov Andrew Cuomo said at the same news conference If they are headed toward Vermont Vermont is engaged and Vermont is mobilized and we are working hand in glove and we will be coordinating several times a day to make sure every lead we have every piece of information is sharedUnder an agreement with Vermont New York state troopers will be allowed across state lines if needed officials saidBut DAmico said authorities had no hard information the men had left New York stateLaw enforcement personnel were going doortodoor in both homes and seasonal residences and conducting checkpoints in hamlets and towns surrounding Dannemora Cuomo said the inmates may have gotten a head start of several hours before the manhunt beganThese men are nothing to be trifled with Cuomo saidFor the first time since the escape law enforcement officials acknowledged publicly that a woman who worked with the convicts in the tailoring shop at the prison may have played a role in the elaborate breakoutDAmico without elaborating said Mitchell had befriended the men and may have had some sort of role in assisting themShe has not been arrested or charged in connection with their escape nor has anyone else The source added that Mitchell is cooperating with police having provided information as neededHer cell phone was used to call several people connected to Matt according to another source with knowledge of the investigation Its not clear who made these calls when they were made or if Mitchell knew about themMitchell went to the hospital this weekend because of panic attacks according to one of the sources By then authorities had discovered during a 530 am Saturday bed check that Matt and Sweat had escapedMitchell has worked at Clinton for seven years as an industrial training supervisor according to Jennifer Freeman a spokeswoman for the New York State Comptroller Her salary was 57697 a yearMitchells son Tobey Mitchell told NBC News his mother was in a hospital Saturday evening because she was having severe chest pains and she was concerned about that He added that his mom who works at the prison with her husband worries a lot about everything but strongly challenged suggestions she had done anything wrongShe is not the kind of person thats going to risk her life or other peoples lives to let these guys escape from prison he saidHis wife Paige Mitchell told CNN on Wednesday that 95 of what is being said about her motherinlaw is not trueThey dont have the facts to prove this she said This is just slander and rumorPaige Mitchell said she believed Matt may have persuaded her motherinlaw to contact people for him who knew about artHe was interested in art Paige Mitchell said of Matt Her heart was in the right placePaige Mitchell denied that her motherinlaw was to be the getaway driver or helped provide the power tools used in the escape Saturdays hospital visit stemmed from the fact that Joyce Mitchell is a very nervous person she saidRural area is rough and can be deadlyIf the escapees did indeed have a designated driver imagine their horror when they popped out of a manhole sometime late Friday or early Saturday and found no accomplice waitingThat must have been just a complete panic on their part  Now what Where are we going to walk to  this small rural area  said CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes a former FBI assistant director Its going to be hard to hide day or night for very long and they wouldnt have been prepared to deal with the elementsTheyd have to find food water and money while also trying to get their hands on weapons or a vehicleThat would put every family in that rural area in extreme danger Fuentes said If theyre feeling like cornered animals out there they are going to do something drastic to try to ensure their physical survival and their continued freedom out of that prisonWithout any help like a getaway driver someone who escapes from Clinton can easily get lost said Jeff Hall who teaches at the City University of New York and did his dissertation on northern New York prisonsThe environment is formidable said Hall who grew up near the Dannemora prison where his father worked Its rough terrain and if youre not familiar with it it can be deadlyWarning Tell police if you spot anything unusualThe first came in Dannemora after midnight Friday about five hours before authorities discovered the men had escapedAnother focus is about 40 miles southeast in Willsboro a town of about 2000 people along Lake ChamplainThats where a resident spotted two men overnight Monday walking in a torrential rainstorm on a rural road Willsboro Town Supervisor Shaun Gillilland said As the witness car approached them they took offBoth reports could be false leads as often happens in manhunts Former US Marshal Service regional commander Lenny DePaul said he thinks its important that people be on the lookoutStill authorities are clearly focusing on the rural swath of New York near Vermont and the Canadian province of QuebecMatt and Sweats escape was so extraordinarily complex that experts say the two must have had helpUsing power tools they cut through a cell wall that included a steel plate maneuvered across a catwalk shimmied down six stories to a tunnel of pipes followed that tunnel broke through a doublebrick wall cut into a 24inch steam pipe climbed through the steam pipe cut another hole so they could get out of the pipe and finally surfaced through a manholeAside from the mystery of how they got the necessary power tools many wonder how they could have used them without detectionThe hole in the cells steel wall suggests they used a cutoff wheel ironworker Ernesto Ernie Peuelas said But using that tool would have produced a loud sound and detectable odorTheir time on the lam is also remarkable Most escapees in New York are captured within 24 hours according to data compiled by the state Of 29 inmates who fled between 2002 and 2013 only one was free for more than two daysEscaping from detention happens thousands of times each year federal statistics show But most are from minimum security facilities where prisoners just walk away In 2013 there were 2011 cases of prisoners who escaped or were absent without permissionSweat was serving a life sentence without parole for fatally shooting and then running over Broome County Sheriffs Deputy Kevin Tarsia in 2002Matt was convicted for kidnapping a businessman for 27 hours and  when he didnt comply with his pleas for money  killing himTorture is probably an understatement Lee Bates who drove a car carrying one of Matts victims told CNNs Anderson Cooper of the 1997 killing He said Matt shoved a knife sharpener in his victims ear broke his neck and then dismembered the bodyDespite his violent past Matt is capable of getting others to help him Bates said
