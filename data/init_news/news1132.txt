Throughout Barack Obamas presidency Republicans in Congress have deployed a strategy that has worked remarkably well for them oppose obstruct and sabotage the Obama administration at every turnThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a oneterm president Republican Sen Mitch McConnell then the Senate minority leader said in 2010A few months later McConnell acknowledged that Republicans had decided to deny President Obama any bipartisan support not because they necessarily opposed each and every initiative but to hurt Obama politically We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals he said Because we thought  correctly I think  that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisanThis strategy led Republicans to adopt largely unprecedented tactics of obstructionism and sabotage But no matter how far they went there was one line they always avoided crossing undermining US foreign policyThat line is now being crossed Republicans driven by earnest policy disagreements with Obama over his approach to Iran are bringing the tactics they used to undermine Obamas legislative agenda into the previously sacrosanct realm of foreign policythe GOP are blazing new trails in politicization of foreign policy  and debasement of their institutionsRepublicans are overtly sabotaging not just Obamas Iran policy but also his constitutionally enshrined authority over foreign policy This is unprecedented If the trend continues  Republicans have already extended their efforts to Obamas relationship with Israel  it endangers not just US policy toward the Middle East but the very way that the United States makes foreign policyThe possible implications for the United States and its role as global leader should worry Americans of every political stripeUntil now for all the tactics of obstruction Republicans used against Obamas legislative agenda they generally treated foreign policy as sacrosanctThey got close only once before when they threatened to block Obamas 2010 nuclear disarmament treaty with Russia But they backed down when foreign policy graybeards from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell told them to knock it offRepublicans after all tend to prize Americas role as the worlds sole superpower They see this as crucial to the future of the United States and would not put their own partisan political goals ahead of it Even if they disagree with Obamas execution of foreign policy and would say so openly they refrained from sabotaging him in the way they had on domestic policy Until the Iran talksRepublicans are earnestly alarmed about the Obama administrations effort to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran They believe Iran is negotiating in bad faith and will exploit any deal to further its nuclear program Though many analysts find this argument unpersuasive it is a valid position and its fair play to oppose the Iran deal on those grounds But that opposition has grown into something much bigger than that and with consequences beyond Iran policyRepublicans joined by some Democrats tried for months to pass new economic sanctions on Iran The aim was clear to kill the negotiations humiliating Obama on the world stage in the process The US is offering sanctions relief to Iran as part of any deal By passing new sanctions while the talks are still ongoing Congress would send the message that the president is not actually in charge of foreign policy and that the US cannot be trusted to uphold its word Iran would have little choice but to walk awayRepublicans have not been able to pass new sanctions Democrats and even a number of Republicans have seemed unwilling to so openly embarrass their own president on the world stageThe moment the line was crossed came on January 8 when McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner took matters into their own hands They secretly arranged for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who also opposes Iran talks and has a famously poor relationship with Obama to speak to a joint session of Congress urging them to kill the negotiationsEven Fox News was outraged here was a foreign ally going behind the presidents back working with an opposition party to undermine the sitting president of the United States And Republicans were helping him do itWe are sailing into uncharted waters Robert Kagan a prominent foreign policy hawk who worked in the Reaganera State Department and later on John McCains foreign policy team wrote in an alarmed Washington Post oped Bringing a foreign leader before Congress to challenge a US presidents policies is unprecedentedKagan warned that in some ways the even greater danger was that such tactics could well become routine After next week he wrote it will be just another weapon in our bitter partisan struggleAfter Netanyahus visit Republicans went further still Fortyseven Republican senators signed an open letter organized by superhawk Sen Tom Cotton to Iranian leaders hinting that they could blow up any deal between the US and Iran if they disapprovedCongress violates the Constitution by hosting the speechThe mere act of senators contacting the leaders of a foreign nation to undermine and contradict their own president is an enormous breach of protocolBut this went much further Republicans are telling Iran and by extension the world that the American president no longer has the power to conduct foreign policy and that foreign leaders should assume Congress could revoke American pledges at any momentIrans ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal Sen Cotton told Bloomberg View that any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own perilA foreign leader reading this letter  whether he or she is Iranian or not  is learning that you are better off walking away than trying to negotiate in good faith or bad with the United States of AmericaBetween the Netanyahu invite and the Cotton letter the GOP are blazing new trails in politicization of foreign policy  and debasement of their institutions David Rothkopf the CEO of the Foreign Policy group and a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peacetweeted Ive cleaned up the abbreviations common to TwitterIn some ways it looks like Obamacare all over again Much as Republicans attempted to stop or subvert Obamacare by undermining the institutions responsible for passing and implementing it they are now seeking to stop or subvert the Iran negotiations by weakening US foreign policy itself And much as their brinksmanship and obstructionism on Obamacare exacerbated the partisan polarization that has broken Congress they are now risking similar damage to the ability of the worlds lone superpower to conduct its foreign affairs  well beyond just Iran policyThere are legitimate policy disagreements over Iran negotiations in Washington so the line between principled policy opposition and unprincipled partisan sabotage can be blurry It may help then to examine how Republicans new approach is damaging a US policy that should be less controversial support for IsraelThe bipartisan consensus on Israel goes back decades Republican leaders by inviting Netanyahu to Congress behind Obamas back and by pressuring members of Congress to side with Netanyahu against their own president are both exploiting and endangering that bipartisan consensusRepublicans hope is that by forcing members of Congress to choose between Israel and Obama Congress will side with Israel and thus against Obama But the risk is that some will side with Obama and against Israel  many Democrats signaled as much by refusing to attend the speech  and that support for Israel will thus become an increasingly partisan issueAs proIsrael becomes increasingly coded as a Republican issue rather than a bipartisan one it will likely help Republicans win certain races but it will substantially erode the consensus on Israel and thus risk eroding US support for Israel If you earnestly care about Israel and about the USIsrael relationship then this trend should alarm youA premise of Republican meddling on Iran and Israel is that Congress has a right  indeed a responsibility  for oversight of some aspects of US foreign policy This is true and Sen Cottons letter points out as an example that the Senate will have to approve any formal treaty between the US and IranStill Congress role in foreign policy is constitutionally quite limited For over 200 years the president has been designated as the sole organ of the nation in its external relations and its sole representative with foreign nations as founding father John Marshall put it in an 1800 speech that the Supreme Court codified into constitutional law in 1936The idea of what became known as the sole organ doctrine is that the US government needs to be a single unified entity on the world stage in order to conduct effective foreign policy Letting the president and Congress independently set their own foreign policies would lead to chaosThere is disagreement over where constitutional law draws the line between what role Congress is and is not allowed in US foreign policy But it seems awfully clear that House Speaker John Boehner going behind the presidents back to negotiate with the Israeli leader violates at the very least the spirit of constitutional limits on CongressIndeed a number of constitutional legal scholars  some of them quite conservative  have questioned the constitutionality of Republicans actionsDavid Bernstein of George Mason University wrote at the Washington Post that Boehners invitation to Netanyahu violates constitutional norms that have been observed for generations and was contrary to the separation of powers He explained Direct diplomatic relations with foreign governments are exclusive in the executive Boehner disobeyed thatAnother constitutional scholar Michael Ramsey put it more simply Congress violates the Constitution by hosting the speech The point is not that John Boehner is going to be dragged before the Supreme Court  he wont  but that Republicans crossed a line that wasnt just a matter of protocol but of strict and meaningful constitutional limits in how foreign policy is conductedAnd that was before Sen Cotton and 46 other Republican senators wrote the Iranian leader to tell him to disregard President Obamas promisesIts worth pointing out there is a law specifically prohibiting US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without official permission and thus interfering in the foreign policy of the United States Called the Logan Act its named for a state legislator who corresponded with French officials in 1798 without his governments permission because he disapproved of US policy toward FranceCotton is not going to face prosecution for violating the Logan Act No one is ever actually prosecuted under the measure legal scholar Peter Spiro wrote recently Its more a focal point for highlighting structural aspects of foreign relations And thats the point the letter goes way beyond the legally articulated limits on Congress role in foreign policyThe spirit of the Logan Act like the sole organ doctrine is meant to enforce the idea that the president is in charge of foreign policy Its not supposed to be like legislation where Obama and Congress fight it out on a somewhat level playing field Its meant to be unified Republicans by trying to change that are undermining the very premise of how US foreign policy is supposed to workThe greatest harm should Republicans continue this trend would be to the ability of the US president to credibly conduct American foreign policyEven if you agree with Republicans that Obamas Iran talks are a bad idea the fact that Republicans have gone beyond opposing a deal to overtly undermining US foreign policy should worry you Republicans are now freelancing their own foreign policy conducting shadow diplomacy with both Israel and Iran dividing US foreign policy against itselfWho a foreign leader might reasonably ask is really in charge in Washington How can I risk negotiating with the US when Congress might sabotage any deal we strike How can I make difficult politically painful concessions to the US if Republicans might end up pulling out the rug from under me How much can I really trust the US to uphold its word How safe a bet is working with the AmericansOne of the central lessons of this dysfunctional era in American politics is that one sides overreach quickly becomes the other sides tactic If youre a Republican you should ask what you will think if these practices are normalized What will you think when Democrats in Congress employ these tactics to undermine a Republican administrationThis is not to say that the world will shrug off American leadership the US is still the Earths most powerful and important country But foreign policy is won or lost on the margins more often than you might think International agreements can succeed or fail with just a smidge more or less trust between the parties A major US foreign policy challenge this century will be competing for regional influence with powers such as China and Russia If youre say the foreign minister of Myanmar trying to decide whether to throw in with China or with America you are going to be a little less likely to hedge toward the US if you think its foreign policymaking apparatus is fundamentally brokenThroughout Obamas presidency Republicans have frequently warned that he is projecting insufficient strength or will to maintain Americas global standing It seems odd then that their answer to this is to publicly undermine and humiliate the president  and thus sacrifice for shortterm partisan gain the American resolve and leadership they see as so important for the worldWATCH Obama on his foreign policy goals  The Vox Conversation with
