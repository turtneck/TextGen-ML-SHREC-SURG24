posted by Eddie Each one of us has been told about our ticking biological clock but those in their 30s or 40s who are hoping to have kids probably think having a baby is just not possible anymore Well it is but with a few risks But after hearing the story about a 70yearold who gave birth you now have the perfect comeback to whoever says your lady parts are slowly reaching its bestbefore date A 70yearold woman named Daljinder Kaur in India has become the worlds firstmom to give birth to a son using invitro fertilization IVF Despite two failed pregnancies before the third time was the charm giving her a boy she named Arman Whats more is its been years since Daljinder had her menopause the end of a womans menstrual cycle in life so theory has it that Daljinder used an egg from a younger donor although this has not been confirmed Studies by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG say that although medicine has endless phenomenon a womans chances of fertility does reduce as they age This usually occurs by the early30s and plummets faster by their late30s The reason for this is because a woman is born with just one to two million eggs and they are lost gradually with each menstrual cycle till it finally ends By the early 50s when menopause begins on average there may be just around a thousand eggs left But IVF and other assisted reproductive procedures is usually taken up as a solution to this especially women who are suffering from infertility and want to improve their chances of getting pregnant So heres how IVF works An egg is taken from a woman and fertilized using a mans sperm outside of the body The embryo is then placed back inside the womans womb with the hope that she will get pregnant The agelimit for allowing IVF and such procedures in the US is those in their mid40s or 50s In addition women in their 40s are usually impregnated with donor eggs from women in their 20s and 30s to increase their fertility chances Statistics suggest that women for all ages recorded who used donor eggs had a 50 success rate and gave birth However a 70yearold is stretching it a bit making Daljinder one of the oldest women on the planet to give birth This is despite the fact that aged women have a lower blood flow to their uterus making it close to impossible to conceive and sustain a babys life through the pregnancy It could also take a huge toll on an older womans body and put their heart at risk as it would be unable to handle the blood flow for their own body let alone a baby Oldage also comes with its classic creaks from high blood pressure to diabetes and weak bone structures So could Daljinders case change the face of fertility possibilities as we know it As a fellow mythbuster maybe But the oldermom trend is on a rise such as 50yearold Janet Jackson who is now pregnant with her first baby as well as Halle Berry who gave birth when she was 47 And hearing from the woman who made history herself Daljinders says she is doing well and feels blessed to hold her own baby Whoever said motherhood is timeless has probably found a whole new dimension of meaning to it now Source
