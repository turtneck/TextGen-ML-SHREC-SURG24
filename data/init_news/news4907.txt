Today an ever increasing number of earthquakes in the United States may soon bring the country to ruin as geologists journalists and politicians say Via UsualRoutine The University of Washington has already presented seismological charts showing a gigantic geological rift that stretches across the central states of the US from north to south and marks the region of a possible split of the North America continent in two As it has been reported by geologists for the first time this anomaly was discovered in 1960s when scientists found a strange underground rupture along the Lake Superior that would run south The discovery surprised American scientists back then since there were no mountains in that area Following studies showed that this anomaly was stretching across the whole continent resembling in its form and shape the giant cracks in the east of AfricaIts been reported that the tectonic plate beneath the southeastern regions of the United States is being fragmented by the layers of earth above it which may be the cause of future earthquakes in the Washington area and other cities on the east coast where basically no preconditions for the emergence of aftershocks according to Live ScienceAccording to Berk Biryol from the University of North Carolina in recent years the Washington area and the areas around other large cities in the east of the country faced a pretty intense seismic activity which at first puzzled seismologists since the east of the country is residing on a stable continental crust that must prevent any earthquake from occurringIn recent years the relationship between fracturing and the mounting number of earthquakes has been brought to light by the US Geological Survey USGS that would note that the number of earthquakes in the US has increased drastically over the last six years In fact it expects an abrupt increase in the number of seismic events in some regions of the country where fracturing is being used including Oklahoma California Texas Kansas Colorado Ohio Alabama and New MexicoBut the split in the United States is not being predicted by the USGS alone since the recent seismic political events aggravated the growing discord within the US society in the wake of the US presidential campaignWestern journalists are sounding the alarm  Americas youth is now fascinated with the concepts of socialism and communism According to the poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation VOC a half of all Americans under 35 years would love to be represented by a socialist president Politicians who profess capitalist views doonly receive the support of 42 of the younger American generation This explains the spectacular rise of DNCs Bernie Sanders which would most certainly become the next president if Hillary didnt use her wealth and connections to replace him as the sole Democratic candidateThe German newspaper Tagesspiegel points out that this election campaign undermines the belief that most Americans share the idea about living in a democratic and constitutional state The newspaper notes that theres been a lot of speculations about the possible armed resistance to the US corrupt government system lately no matter how unlikely the future postelection violence may look nowThe latest poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University shows that only 40 of potential voters strongly believe in the peaceful transfer of power after the US presidential elections With six in ten viewing the candidates unfavorably Clinton andTrump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in ABCPost polls dating to the 1984 election This ABC NewsWashington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone in English and Spanish among a random national sample of 1165 likely votersThe level of antipathy towards the two main presidential candidates in terms of party affiliation has also been at staggering level with 97 of Trump supporters despising Hillary Clinton and 95 of Hillarys loathing the Republican presidential candidateIts no wonder that theres been a rapidly increasing number of petitions on the separation of various states which refer to the Declaration of Independence where the Founding Fathers explicitly stated that any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it To date the petitions on the separation from the US have been filled by a total of 40 states Texas that is viewed as the last bastion of conservatism has already gathered more than 100 thousand signatures under its petition for obtaining the status of an independent state Behind it are Louisiana Florida North Carolina Alabama Georgia and TennesseeTherefore aside from the major geological rift that may soon hit the US theres a deep social and political rift to be observed which may in case of loss of all confidence in the existing political system result in a major outbreak of violenceEarth has already witnessed the existence of two supercontinent  Rodinia and Pangaea First the former continent formed about 800 million years ago until the latter one appeared some 600 million years later Scientists expect that in the future a new supercontinent will be formed that has it own name already  Amasia This continent will be formed out of the modern North America and Asia notes the NatureWho knows maybe before Amasia even emerges we will witness a new state or even two that would replace the US
