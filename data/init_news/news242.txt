TheWall Street Journals Adam Entous dropped a huge story Tuesday morning Israel acquired classified US information while spying on the Iranian nuclear negotiations and leaked the stolen information about the emerging deal to American lawmakers in an attempt to sabotage the Obama administrations outreach to TehranThis isyet another disaster for USIsrael relations But thats not because Israel acquired classified US information which honestly isnt that surprising Whats really outrageous is that Israel used the information in a deliberate attempt to manipulate American politicsNo one should be shocked that Israel was spying on the talks A certain degree of espionage is pretty par for the course in world politics even among allies Indeed as Entous story repeatedly makes clear American officials expected Israel to snoop on them In fact according to Entous the US found out about the Israeli spying because it was already spying on IsraelBut there is a real scandal here and thats Israel using stolen intelligence as part of a deliberate campaign of messing around with American partisan politics Thats why the White House is angry It is one thing for the US and Israel to spy on each other It is another thing for Israel to steal US secrets and play them back to US legislators to undermine US diplomacy a senior US official told EntousIf Entous reporting is correct the Israeli government used the leaked information to help Republicans build support for new sanctions among Democrats which would be necessary to overcome Obamas vetoIsrael was using stolen information to help Mitch McConnell and John Boehner foment a Democratic rebellion against the presidentThis is the same reasonIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech to Congress about Iran infuriated so many Democrats this month The problem wasnt that Netanyahu was invited to Congress its that the speech was coordinated with Republicans behind the presidents back in a deliberate attempt to undermine his Iran policyThe spyingbriefing allegations suggest the speech was part of a much broader campaign to help Republicans pass new sanctions a particularly dangerous move by Netanyahu at a time when Israel isat risk of becoming a partisan issue in AmericaAllies really arent supposed to do this sort of thing Playing partisan domestic politics  and doing it with classified information no less  positions Israel as the Republican Partys ally not AmericasThe fact that Republican interests line up with Israels in this case doesnt justify crossing these linesNone of this is to say the Netanyahu government has to just sit down and accept an American Iran policy it opposes Its perfectly within bounds for Netanyahu to publicly oppose the ongoing negotiations in which international powers are seeking to limit Irans nuclear capabilities in exchange for relief on its crippling economic sanctions Its fine for Netanyahu to lobby the French who havean important role in the negotiations to push for more stringent limits on Irans nuclear program Thats all normal international politics
