As the polls tighten in the last few days of the presidential election campaign its interesting to see the reluctant GOP establishment start scurrying back into Donald Trumps fold Apparently prominent Republicans are all making the bet that that the partys nominee will at least come close enough to make it necessary to back him lest they be blamed for his failureThe most famous of those whohave reendorsed Trump after walking away when he was cratering is Jason Chaffetz theHouse Oversight Committee chair who probably secretly hopes Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will win so he can run his endless witch hunts in front of the cameras but felt it was necessary to back Trump just in case Chaffetz is also likely to throw his hat into the ring for speaker if theres a rebellion against Paul Ryan which is a real possibilitySen Deb Fischer of Nebraska Rep Scott Garrett of New Jersey Rep Bradley Byrne of Alabama and Sen John Thune of South Dakotahave all come creepingback to Trumpafter initially dropping their endorsements in the wake of the grab em by the pussy tape Even Trump skeptic and beloved Beltway conservativeHugh Hewitthas now decided to run with the packIts been a tough time for Republican officials and elite conservative pundits and thats understandable Theyve just discovered that their voters have a different interpretation of conservatism than they thought they did The elites define Reagans famous threelegged stool of conservatism as economic conservatism social conservatism and defense conservatism which they would further describe as a belief in small government family values and patriotism all dressed up in fancy philosophical paeans to freedom the founders and theConstitutionTrump has shown that the base of the party also believes in those three pillars but Republicanshave stripped away the intellectual veneer that made them socially acceptable and laid bare that the three legs actually represent racism sexism and nationalism Economic conservatism is simply a way to stop the federal government from spending money on the wrong people Social conservatism is simply a way to keep women in their place And defense conservatism is a chauvinistic belief that America is for Americans and foreigners had better watch their stepElites had always known that many Republican voters held these views but they thought that over time these ugly impulses would gradually fade away and become more ideologically abstract Infamous GOP strategist Lee Atwater explained how he expected this to evolveYou start out in 1954 by saying Ner ner nier By 1968 you cant say nier  that hurts you Backfires So you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff Youre getting so abstract now that youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites And subconsciously maybe that is part of it Im not saying that But Im saying that if it is getting that abstract and that coded that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the otherTheRepublicans didnt do away with it It just went underground And all that coding and dogwhistling and abstraction was eventually seen as political correctness and their voters came to hate it A new Pew Research Center poll was released this weekshowing that whatever hope the GOP elders have that they can return to the previous status quo where everyone pretends the partys base cares about tort reform and the capital gains tax is not going to happen The best they can say is that Republicans are deeply divided Pewstates the following About twothirds 65 of Republican and Republicanleaning voters think their partys presidential candidate does represent the core principles and positions the Republican Party should stand for while 31 think Trump does not Among Republican voters conservatives are far more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans to think of Trump as representative of the Republican Partys principles While threequarters of conservative Republican voters see Trump as representative of what the party should stand for only about half of moderate and liberal Republicans 52 say the same That divide manifests itself in many different ways with the people who didnt vote for Trumpin the primaries showing a stronger dislike for the Republican Party as a whole Trump voters seem to like the party just fine now that Trump has defined what it stands for How this plays out after the election should be very interesting Obviously if Trump wins it will be a huge triumph and well likely see a quick consolidation under his leadership But even if he loses it wont be possible to put the genie back in the bottle no matter how hard the Never Trump types try Trump hadonly a couple of deeply held political beliefs that he brought with him into the campaign Hes long believed foreign countries are laughing at America and he wants to make them stop And he has always wanted to let police take the gloves off and enforce law and order Everything else in his platform from birtherism to the border wall and from torture to terrorism he got from conservative media According to New York magazines Gabriel Sherman his earliest advisers going back to 2012 were the notorious trickster Roger Stone who is steeped in wingnutism and rightwing lawyer Sam Nunberg I listened to thousands of hours of talk radio and he was getting reports from me Nunberg recalled What those reports said was that the GOP base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration Obamacare and Common Core While Jeb Bush talked about crossing the border as an act of love Trump was thinking about how high to build his wall Now Trump has Breitbarts Steve Bannon in his ear with the altright agenda much of which sounds familiar as well These ideas have all been swirling around rightwing media for years while the political establishment was holding seminars on Atlas Shrugged and fetishizing the budget deficit ConservatismisTrumpism and has been for a long time Socalled conservatives just werent listening
