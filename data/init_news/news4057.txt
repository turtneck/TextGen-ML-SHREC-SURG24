Ted Cruz looking for a shakeup in the 2016 race as Donald Trump moves steadily closer to the Republican nomination on Wednesday announced former GOP primary rival Carly Fiorina as his choice for running mate should he win the party nodThe move was immediately dismissed as an act of desperation by the Trump team but Cruz  while acknowledging it is unusual to announce a running mate so early  defended the decision He claimed nobody is getting to 1237 delegates the number needed to clinch the nomination and voters should know what they will getAfter a great deal of time and thought after a great deal of consideration and prayer I have come to the conclusion that if I am nominated to be president of the United States that I will run on a ticket with my vice presidential nominee Carly Fiorina Cruz saidCruz together now with Fiorina was trying to fight Trumps narrative that the race is effectively over after the frontrunner swept five primary states on Tuesday But Fiorina in accepting Cruzs offer said shes ready to fightIve had tough fights all my life Fiorina said Tough fights dont worry me a bitCruz made the announcement in the critical primary turf of Indiana which votes next Tuesday Speaking at an afternoon rally in Indianapolis Cruz announced his decision to cheers and chants of Carly Carly while touting the former HP CEOs credentials and life storyThe theoretical pairing represents a diverse ticket  offering the possibility of electing the first Hispanic president and first female vice presidentThis is a choice that you are telling the American people that This is an individual that I trust and more important this is an individual that you can trust to lead this country no matter what might happen Cruz saidBut for the time being Fiorina will hold the odd position of being a vice presidential candidateinwaiting  as Cruz continues to lag far behind Trump in the battle for the GOP nominationEven Fiorina would have to be elected by delegates at the convention As for Cruz hes already been mathematically eliminated from clinching the nomination before the convention and is relying on the prospect of a Cleveland floor fightA highly visible Cruz surrogate the former HP CEO recently handed over her tax returns to the Cruz campaign for vetting CNN reported Tuesday and her name immediately surfaced when Cruz teased a major announcement Wednesday morningCruz said Wednesday that he and his family had grown so close to Fiorina that she often sings to his young daughters  a skill she showed off during her speech  and also exchanges texts with the young girlsAnd Carly may be the first vice president in American history to have an impressive fluency with hearts and smiley face emoticons Cruz saidTrump leads Cruz in pledged delegates 954562 but Cruzs strong ground operation has elected many delegate allies to the Republican Convention in July Cruz believes the battle will proceed to a contested convention where he hopes to triumph once some pledged delegates become unbound and are free to switch their votesTrump on Wednesday morning dismissed the notion of Cruz tapping a running mateFirst of all he shouldnt be naming anybody because he doesnt even have a chance Trump said Naming Carlys dumb because Carly didnt do well She had one good debate  not against me by the way because I had an unblemished record of victories during debates  but she had one victory on the smaller stage and that was itIn a statement later Wednesday Trump criticized the move as Cruz only trying to stay relevantWhile most presidential candidates wait until they have the nomination sewn up to announce a running mate Cruzs selection of a vice presidential candidate in April  while hes well behind in delegates  followed a pattern of somewhat unconventional campaigning including an early embrace of Trump and kicking off his campaign without first forming an exploratory committeeFiorina began her career working as a secretary and receptionist but quickly rose up the business ranks and was named in 1999 as the chief executive officer for HewlettPackard becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 companyOf all the people who didnt make it far in the race she was one of the best about laying out her plan talking about who she is and her accomplishments said Doug De Groote a fundraiser for Cruz based near Los AngelesOn her website Fiorina describes her tenure at HP as having saved 80000 jobs during the worst technology recession in 25 years But her time at the helm also drew criticism for alleged deals with Iran brokered through a subsidiary and the laying off of 30000 employees In 2004 Fiorina left the company after the board of directors forced her resignationHer career as a political candidate began when Fiorina tried to unseat California Sen Barbara Boxer during an unsuccessful 2010 bid Boxer on Wednesday mocked the suggestion of Fiorina as Cruzs running mateThe best way to describe that ticket is mean and meaner she said He wants to throw people out of the country and she threw thousands of jobs out of the country Perfect matchIn May 2015 Fiorina announced her candidacy for president and quickly became known as a feisty critic of Hillary Clinton and a strong defender of the prolife community Planned Parenthood immediately panned Fiorinas Wednesday pairing with Cruz asthe most loathsome pair of antiabortion extremists in AmericaHer early debate performances were lauded by many critics however she never gained traction and suspended her campaign after singledigit finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire She endorsed Cruz in early March and has appeared often with him on the campaign trailWhen asked about being Cruzs vice president in early March Fiorina replied Lets win the nomination firstThough she eventually threw her support behind Cruz Fiorina also attacked him when she was still a competing candidate She termed him one of the ultimate insiders and called him too divisive in January She also criticized Cruz for saying one thing in the drawing rooms of Manhattan and another thing in the living rooms of IowaFox News Ed Henry and Serafin Gomez and The Associated
