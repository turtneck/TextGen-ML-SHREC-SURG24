PHILADELPHIA  In the same city where the framers met to craft the Constitution Democrats triumphantly chose Hillary Clinton as their White House nominee Tuesday night the first woman to ever lead a major political party into the general electionIf there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch let me just say I may become the first woman president but one of you is next Thank you all I cant wait to join you in Philadelphia Thank you Clinton proclaimedClintons fierce primary rival Sen Bernie Sanders was the one who put her over the top pulling a procedural move that allowed him to give her his delegatesIt was an emotional day as Clinton supporters anticipated the historic moment and Sanders supporters faced realityIt is with enormous pride that I cast my vote for Bernie Sanders the Vermont lawmakers brother Larry Sanders declaredSeveral other party leaders and speakers addressed the convention but the crowd came alive when former President Bill Clinton took the stageClinton took Democrats through his life with Hillary by telling stories about her as a wife and mother while reminding them of her credentialsShes been around a long time She sure has And shes sure been worth every single year shes put into making peoples lives better I can tell you this if you were sitting where Im sitting and you heard what I have heard at every dinner conversation every lunch conversation on every long walk you would say this woman has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything Clinton said of his wifeShe always wants to move the ball forward That is just who she is Clinton continuedNow that they have a nominee Clinton supporters hope to use the party planks to bring the Sanders faithful back into the foldEven though the climate is not as liberal as Sanders supporters would like here in Philadelphia Democrats approved their most liberal platform which stands in stark contrast to the platform passed by Republicans last week in ClevelandHeres what you need to know about the visions and values of Americas two political parties Its a tale of two paths  two futures for America with two political platformsIt really kind of gives a roadmap for the partys principles said Teege Mettille a DNC delegate from WisconsinOn nearly every issue theres a distinction between the Democratic and Republican Party platformsWe produced by far the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party Sanders proclaimedOn abortion Democrats turned their backs on 40 years of policy as they call for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment  a law signed by President Jimmy Carter that prohibits the use of federal tax dollars for abortionIts a move that alienates one in three Democrats according to Democrats for LifeMichael Wear a former faith adviser to President Barack Obama calls the move disappointing and misguidedI think the decision we have to make is whether we will continue to be an open tent welcoming the people who disagree on such a core moral issue as the sanctity of life or whether were going to become a more strident closed off frankly less inclusive party Wear reflectedOn other social issues the differences in the platforms are vastThere are things that are written in that platform that have never been written in there in the history of the party Brandon Weathersby with the Democratic Party of Wisconsin saidRepublicans call traditional marriage the foundation for a free society and acknowledge traditional families as ideal for raising healthy kids who are less likely to get in troubleThe Democratic platform however calls for expanding rights for LGBT AmericansOn the environment Democrats call for a carbon tax while Republicans oppose itOne of the things that we thought was really amazing  even though were here as Hillary Clinton delegates how proud we were that you could hear and see Bernies voice in that platform to be the most progressive platform in our lifetime that the Democratic Partys every passed David Mettille a Wisconsin delegate saidSanders backers represent a growing gap between Democrats and Republicans on IsraelEven though the platforms include similar language about Israel both parties oppose efforts to delegitimize Israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions movementRepublicans take it further calling the BDS movement antiSemitic and call for legislation to stop actions that limit commercial relations with IsraelDuring the drafting of the Democrats platform debate about Israel caused so much passion that police had to wade into the audience as activists shouted down delegatesSen Sanders backed a measure to end the occupation of Palestinians Liberal activists also called for the rebuilding of the Gaza StripIt is apparently the most progressive platform weve ever had but its far from what we wanted Hillary Keys a Sanders supporter saidKeys says this is only the beginning Theyre leaving Philly to focus on electing the most liberal candidates they can to every office from dog catcher to presidentIn this election more than ever before Americans have a clear choice between two very different visionsIts also a time when Christians have a chance to make a major impactTheres an anxiety in our culture It should be the Christian voice that is not echoing the despair but offering a voice of possibility and the love and a future in Christ and a security in Christ Wear said
