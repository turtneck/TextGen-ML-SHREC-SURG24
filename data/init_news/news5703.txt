Dear AmericaWhether you voted for Trump or not surely you can join me in admitting the past few years have been devoid of optimism Weve been pessimistic on the economy on the social foundation of our country our standing in the world our concern over potential for war our healthcare our jobs and generally speaking our futureFor some of you Barack Obama may be a likable character While many of us believe hes corrupt and wrong in his way of thinking its understandable that many of his voters found him to be generally likable For those who do the truth is he betrayed you He betrayed all of usHis healthcare law was sold to you as a law that would make healthcare affordable and wouldnt change the plandoctor you have Most of us are now finding that was a lie Were losing our plans and doctors and costs are skyrocketingHis economic policy enriched the mega rich while crushing jobs His environmental policy has pumped billions of our dollars into the pockets of special interests killed off jobs and did absolutely nothing for the environment His tax policy is painful If you pay taxes you know this to be the caseHe spends money like it grows on trees For him its not an issue He lives in the high castle and will never have to worry about money But you and I Yeah its an issueHe dragged us nearly into world war with Russia He collapsed the Middle East in a way that has rippled across the globeWe can disagree on issues but surely we can agree this hasnt been a good situation Something has to change Hillary Clinton wasnt going to change anything She was going to take Obamas burning agenda and throw gasoline on itWe now have an opportunity Donald Trump has his flaws We all have concerns about it No secret there But his plan is something we should all get excited about That is of course provided he actually follows through with itTrump is likely to relax tensions with Russia Hes likely to pull back our nonsensical involvement in the Middle East Hes likely to repeal and replace Obamacare Hes likely to initiate a tax and economic policy that WILL invigorate business growthFor businesses Trump has a plan that will help create spenders And for consumers his plan will help us earn and retain more financial stabilityThis is a good thing Its good for liberals conservatives and independents Its good for AmericaNot long ago there was a time when Americans were optimistic hungry for success and excited to work hard for it Weve exiting a period of time where that mentality has been nonexistent Were entering a time where it can exist againWeve got a mess on our hands There is much work to do to clean it up But it can be cleaned up and we can flourish as a result of itThat is if we unify and optimistically strive for success as a nationIts time America Its long overdueLets make America great againEric Odom
