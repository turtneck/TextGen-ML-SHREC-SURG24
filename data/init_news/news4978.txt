All this time of thoughts and reason Now this country is full of treason This earth goes up It also goes down Mostly this life feels hellbound Do we question this crazy human race On this long crazy day please engulf me with mace Time was this and that was now Come on humans show us how All we want is to deal with time One of you can not even blow my mind This way that way which is clear Double the facts and I will drink beer Seeping peeping on the line Throwing rowing in due time Life is full of different ways To you all please have a great day This is about the struggle in life and we can all overcome this by being happy
