Email CNN made it official Monday firing commentator Donna Brazile shown for giving Hillary Clinton questions in advance of debates with Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries The avidly proClinton network was virtually forced to sever ties with Brazile by the new revelations from the latest WikiLeaks dump of John Podestas hacked emails Podesta the longtime advisercronyfixer for Bill and Hillary Clinton and currently chairman of Hillarys election campaign has now seen over 39000 of his emails released by the WikiLeaks hacktivists and they have been very revealing indeed exposing the corruption dirty tricks and criminality of the Clinton political machine  Brazile a veteran Democratic Party hack has been serving as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee DNC since July when thenDNC chair Rep Deborah Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign in an email scandal that exposed Wasserman Schultz and other DNC officials blatantly taking sides with Clinton and sabotaging Sanders in violation of DNC rules to maintain neutrality in primary campaigns As the Podesta emails reveal Brazile was involved in those same ethics violations extending to violating the rules for the televised debates The Commission on Presidential Debates CPD which sponsored the debates states on its website  All debates will be moderated by a single individual and will run from 9001030 pm Eastern Time without commercial breaks As always the moderators alone will select the questions to be asked which are not known to the CPD or to the candidates However that obviously was not the case as Brazile was providing Team Clinton with a headsup of debate questions in advance The first Brazile email to leak out concerned the televised CNNTV One Town Hall event on March 13 of this year The day before Brazile sent an email to Clintons director of communications Jennifer Palmieri saying shes worried about HRC Hillary Rodham Clinton facing a question on the death penalty The subject heading of her email was Re From time to time I get the questions in advance Here is the email as provided by WikiLeaks On Mar 12 2016 at 439 PM Donna Brazile     wrote Heres one that worries me about HRC DEATH PENALTY 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty 31 states including Ohio still have the death penalty According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty since 1973 156 people have been on death row and later set free Since 1976 1414 people have been executed in the US Thats 11 of Americans who were sentenced to die but later exonerated and freed Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty Sent from Donnas I Pad Follow me on twitter donnabrazile The following day on the CNNTV One Town Hall comoderated by CNNs Jake Tapper and TV Ones Roland Martin Hillary Rodham Clinton was indeed asked a question about the death penalty by audience member Ricky Jackson  and HRC had a scripted answer ready and waiting We the public did not find out that the game had been rigged until months later when WikiLeaks released the incriminating email on October 11 Nevertheless even after the WikiLeaks release most of the establishment media ignored the BrazilePodestaPalmieri skullduggery in favor of bashing Donald Trump over unsubstantiated sensationalistic charges of sexual harassment For nearly two weeks Donna Brazile was allowed to wave off the email evidence with diversionary tactics and charges that the emails are fabrications by WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence However on October 20 Brazile was skewered on Fox News by a relentless Megyn Kelly who refused to let her weasel her way through another interview Not that the DNC chair didnt try Brazile kept going to script using every diversion she could muster to avoid answering the direct careful questions put to her by the Fox anchor She tried the Christianpersecution diversion As a Christian woman I understand persecution but I will not sit here and be persecuted Brazile told Megyn Kelly She tried the poisoned fruit diversion Podestas emails were stolen Youre so interested in talking about stolen material youre like a thief that wanna bring into the night the things that are in the gutter She tried the motormouthrepetition diversion the total innocence diversion and much more It was still more of the same patently absurd denial and rehearsed propaganda by Brazile when Kelly confronted her with the undercover video stings of top Democratic dirty tricks operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer who were caught redhanded boasting of rigging elections and admitting to inciting violence at Trump rallies  Incredibly Brazile insisted to Megyn Kelly that I always play straight up and Im going to be straight up with you However it was painfully clear by the end of the Fox interview that straight up Donna Brazile is as weasely and deceitful as Crooked Hillary It is noteworthy that during her Fox News interview when Megyn Kelly repeatedly asked her where she got the advance debate questions Brazile fatuously insisted that she had never received any questions from CNN She continued repeating the same lines even when Kelly asked her directly if the questions had come not from CNN itself but from Roland Martin the former CNN commentator who now works for TV One and comoderated the Town Hall event In the same email thread of March 12 cited above Brazile responded to a reply from Jennifer Palmieri Brazile told Palmieri Ill send a few more debate questions Though some questions Roland submitted That would seem to be a very solid clue that Roland Martin was the source and Brazile was the conduit to Podesta and the Clinton Campaign Politico reporter Hadas Gold reported on October 12 that Politico had obtained an email of March 12 from Roland Martin to CNN debate producers with the identical death penalty question that appeared in Braziles March 12 email to Palmieri Whats more it was Roland Martin who introduced Ricky Jackson the preselected prescripted audience member who asked the rigged question about the death penalty As Gold reports Martin initially denied that he had shared his questions with anybody However after being confronted with the fact that Politico possessed email evidence to the contrary he began walking the denial back to more ambiguous ground Media Uncomfortable but not Outraged  Deceit Propaganda Continue In an October 13 interview Jake Tapper said he has tremendous regard for Brazile but said the WikiLeaks revelation was very very troubling Its horrifying the CNN anchor said Journalistically its horrifying and Im sure it will have an impact on CNN partnering with this organization TV One in the future The following day on October 14 CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas stated that CNN hadnt given Brazile the debate questions in advance and announced Brazile had resigned from the network CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions prep material attendee list background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate Pratapas said in a written statement We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor The October 30 WikiLeaks release contains another BrazileDNCPodesta debate revelation concerning the March 6 debate in Flint Michigan where Democrat Party operatives and their media allies have transformed lead poisoning into a false national issue with which to clobber Republicans The ClintonSanders Democratic primary debate was hosted by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper See the full debate here  The event was held in Flint at Clintons request as she herself pointed out during the course of the debate A Brazile email from March 5 of this year to Podesta and Palmieri is entitled One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash Her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint Braziles email goes on to alert Hillarys debate coaches Sure enough the lead poisoning question came up on cue and HRC slammed in another easy homerun answer Yes many in the proClinton media industry are uncomfortable with the WikiLeaks revelations but judging from their continued overwhelmingly slanted coverage the discomfort comes from being exposed not from being disgusted with the serial cheating and lying of the Clinton camp and their media allies There has been precious little outrage expressed by the proClinton mainstream media elites of the kind and volume that would have gushed forth if the same rigging had been perpetrated by the Trump Campaign There have been no mediaorchestrated calls for TV One to fire Roland Martin nor for the DNC to fire Donna Brazile nor for Hillary Clinton to fire John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri The BrazilePodestaPalmieri debate emails are damning but arguably not as serious as the many other revelations concerning the Clinton familys rampant criminality on national security matters such as Uranium One and the paytoplay wheelingdealing at the HRC State Department and the Clinton Foundation However the WikiLeaks emails released thus far have shown an alarming willingness and ability of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her DNCBig Media allies to rig the election debates And the ones weve seen may be only the tip of the iceberg If this is the case in the primaries are Donald Trumps charges about rigging the November 8 election really all that outlandish as the proClinton media choir would have us believe Related articles
