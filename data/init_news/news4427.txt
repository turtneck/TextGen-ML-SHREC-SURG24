MOSCOW  Tens of thousands of people marched in the sleet Sunday through central Moscow to mourn slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov gunned down just steps away from the KremlinI wasnt planning to go to the rally initially I had no faith in them said Tatyana Shakhova a young demonstrator holding a sign that said propaganda killsBut Nemtsovs killing crosses all the lines she said I have no faith that the organizers of the murder will be foundNemtsovs death is a critical turning point for Russia said one of the rallys organizers Gennady Gudkov a former member of parliament who was kicked out in 2012 because of his opposition activity Either something starts getting better in this country or it could go the way of more political assassinations and repressionsRussian President Vladimir Putin whom Nemtsov staunchly criticized in the past condemned Fridays killing and took personal control of the investigation Russias Investigative Committee on Sunday pledged to award 3 million rubles about 50000 for valuable information about Nemstovs deathUp to 100000 people turned out for the march according to Gudkov after the location was changed from the outskirts of Moscow to the center of the city Moscow police which often downplay the turnout for opposition rallies put the crowd at 44000Demonstrators holding Russian flags and portraits of Nemtsov marched from the KitaiGorod subway along the southeastern wall of the Kremlin to the bridge by Red Square where Nemtsov was slainThe march was initially planned as a protest against Russias involvement in Ukraine and the resulting economic crisis Nemtsov who reportedly had been gathering evidence that Moscow was arming and aiding proRussian rebels in eastern Ukraine was to speak at the rally But organizers on Saturday canceled the demonstration to instead hold a march of mourningNemtsov 55 who served as first deputy prime minister under the late president Boris Yeltsin was shot four times in the back from a passing car as he walked with a female friend across a bridge Friday night the Interior Ministry said At least seven shots were fired by several assailants His companion was not hurtThe hunt for his killer continuesInvestigators said Sunday that they were again questioning the woman Ukrainian citizen Anna Duritskaya the Associated Press reported LifeNews a television station with ties to the security services said Duritskaya told investigators that she was in shock and could not remember what the killer looked like or the car he was inAt Sundays march thousands of Russian tricolor flags peppered the gathering which was an unusual display for opposition protests Volunteers handing them out explained that the flags had been usurped to represent only the government in power and it was time for people to take back the flags to represent the countryWe decided on the flags spontaneously We wanted to move away from politics toward something that unites us Gudkov said Also Boris Nemtsov was a patriot of RussiaRussian flags intermingled with Ukraines colors of blue and yellow as many demonstrators spoke out for peace between the two countriesRussia and Ukraine must be together said Dasha Ilyasova who carried a joined Russian and Ukrainian flag with a black ribbon to commemorate NemtsovA good person was killed she said If it was a bad person or a person who supported Putin he wouldnt have been killedUS Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had no intelligence on who was behind the shooting We hope there will be a thorough transparent real investigation not just of who actually fired the shots but who if anyone may have ordered or instructed this or been behind this Kerry said Sunday on ABCs This WeekThe theme of Sundays protest was propaganda kills in reference to a propaganda campaign on Russian television that termed Kremlin critics traitors and fifth columnistsRussian state media turned nationalist in the wake of Ukraines proWestern coup a year ago and Russias move to annex Ukraines breakaway Crimea While Russia has persistently denied sending troops and arming separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine Russias media have staunchly supported the fight against Kievs new governmentA proKremlin rally on Feb 21 included demonstrators calling for a purge of the fifth column a slogan remembered with fear following Nemtsovs slaying But there was doubt that Nemtsovs death would change the status quoI think public sentiment will only escalate Neutrality has disappeared There are people for or against and they are irreconcilable said Mark Feigin the firebrand lawyer who defended the Pussy Riot protest singers and Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko who was captured by proRussian fighters and is imprisoned in RussiaSavchenko who is accused by Russia of being involved in the death of two Russian reporters in Ukraine has been on a hunger strike for 79 days to protest her imprisonment While Nemtsovs murder wont change public sentiment Feigin said he hoped the rally could help his defendantUnwillingly Nemtsov became part of a cumulative effect that could lead to a political decision that could free Savchenko he said
