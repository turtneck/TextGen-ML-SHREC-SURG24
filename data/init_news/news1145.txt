Reince Priebus the beleaguered and balding Republican National Committee chairman was asked a few days ago about his maneHow much gray hair do you think youre going to have by December CNNs Jake Tapper inquiredGray is fine the party boss replied I just want to make sure I have hairAlternatively he could try a WhigThis could be the first time in 160 years when a major American political party splits and Priebus the young technocrat from Wisconsin brought in to improve the Republicans infrastructure is in over his headThe Whigs were essentially undone by their inability to agree on slavery the attempt to satisfy both sides with the Compromise of 1850 caused Northern and Southern Whigs to part Though the current situation is quite different Republicans are now split by their own moral dilemma whether to embrace as their nominee a man who stands for isolationism and ethnonationalism and who disparages women and minorities Priebus is preaching party unity above moralityLets scrap the GOP and start overIf the party accepts Trump it could consign itself to political oblivion by antagonizing women minority groups and immigrants If it accepts Ted Cruz instead it risks a riot by the Trump populists and the loss of all but farright voters And if Priebus and his fellow Republicans try to rally around a mainstream figure such as Paul Ryan they could salvage the party in the long run but would risk alienating the majority of this years GOP votersWell Priebus said in a radio interview Thursday with former Republican senator and Trump booster Scott Brown I havent started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet but Ive certainly considered itIn fairness there is no good option for Priebus now except perhaps to resign if Trump secures the party nomination His defenders point out that each time he disagrees with Trump the criticism only emboldens Trump supporters as it was likely to do again after Priebus said Monday that the Colorado GOP conventions decision to award all 34 delegates to Cruz was not a crooked deal as Trump chargedBut Priebus failed to act to stop Trump when he could have or to coordinate Republicans to clear the field for a mainstream alternative And now he compounds the damage by sticking with the same moral neutrality and happy talk of GOP unity that allowed the situation to developAfter the Jan 14 debate in which Trump said he would gladly accept the mantle of anger and traded charges with Cruz about their constitutional eligibility for the presidency Priebus tweeted Its clear weve got the most wellqualified and diverse field of candidates from any party in historyIn the Feb 13 debate Trump blamed George W Bush for the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and said Bush lied about Iraqs weapons of mass destruction Trump Cruz and Marco Rubio took turns calling one another liars and Rubio ridiculed Cruzs Spanish skills Our wellqualified  experienced candidates continue to put forth serious solutions to restore prosperity  strength to America Priebus tweetedAnd after the March 3 debate in which Trump spoke about the size of his genitals Priebus tweeted that Republican candidates are the only ones offering the course correction voters overwhelmingly wantPriebus sounds like a fortune cookie when he says the impossible is always possible with unity But unity behind bigotry My conservative colleague Jennifer Rubin notes that Priebuss position requires moral vapidityThis all might have turned out differently if Priebus and other Republicans in positions of responsibility had turned against Trump sooner In January he called the Trumpdominated debates a good thing for our party He said he was 100 percent sure he could rally the party behind either Trump or Cruz He has since praised Trump for bringing millions of new voters to our partyWith 4 in 10 Republicans saying they wouldnt get behind Trump in a general election its clear he would lose the party more votes than he gains But Priebus is still talking like a fortune cookie With unity the impossible is possible with division the possible is impossible he informed Brown in Thursdays radio interviewPriebus spoke about the wonder of his role Its unbelievable to be in the middle of history that will be talked about forever he saidBut history is unlikely to remember kindly a Republican chairman who turned the party of Lincoln over to a populist demagogue or to an ideologue loathed even by Republican colleagues Hopefully those twin menaces will be enough to wig out Priebus  before his Republicans get Whigged outRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
