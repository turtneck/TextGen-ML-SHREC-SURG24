Michael DAntonio is the author of the new book  The Truth About Trump The opinions expressed in this commentary are hisCNN America seems to be catching onto the flaws of Trumpspeak  the GOP candidates method perfected over decades in the public eye of winning attention and creating an illusion of unbounded successPolls in key swing states and nationally now show him well behind Hillary Clinton and some of his rhetorical tricks like the use of people are saying to spread falsehoods while avoiding responsibility for them have become popular memesStill anything can happen with nearly three months left to go in the election So its instructive to look at the five elements of TrumpspeakThe media record is littered with moments when Donald Trump appeared to set a new mark for outrageousness that even he couldnt surpass Then came another day and a new bizarre performance The current example of the presidential candidate at his Trumpiest is the argument that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founder and cofounder of ISIS2 The art of the false claimAlthough Trump routinely attacks the press for its supposed bias he consistently promotes arguments with little basis in fact and no specific sources With phrases like many people are saying and Im hearing Trump manages to insert unsubstantiated notions into the electoral discourse without taking responsibility for the messages hes sendingTrumps innuendo had no basis in fact When he spoke the presidents short form birth record had been released by officials in Hawaii and there was no mystery about his college years Nevertheless Trump built a following with this method and continues to use it4 Im a winner even when Im notHow is it that someone who cares so much about numbers as represented in his business record and ratings comes to declare himself a winner in ways that can be so readily refuted Its possible that the template was established so long ago that its an ingrained habitWhen I interviewed Trump he told me more than once that in his youth he had been the best high school baseball player in New York State In those years the Empire State was home to several future major leaguers and at least one future Hall of Famer The players who competed in big city leagues played against the toughest opponents Trump played for a tiny school that squaredoff against other small schools in Upstate New York The chance that he was the best is practically zeroWhy does he do itGingrich cited the comments about Obama and ISIS as an example I know what Trump has in his mind but thats not what people hear said Gingrich In a rare case of selfcorrection Trump explained that he was practicing sarcasm when he linked Obama to the founding of ISIS He offered the same explanation when he mused about how Russian hackers should muck around in Clintons email accountsTrumps excuses like his behavior resemble what one might expect from a bullying child who is caught tormenting a sibling Any adult who has ever interceded in this kind of conflict knows to expect to hear I was only kidding and Cant you take a joke from the kid who is doing the harm In Trumps case of course the childishness does harm to the country as a whole and as the case of Tur suggests poses a real threat to specific individualsTrump is the same person he was as a boy When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now Im basically the same Trump once told me The temperament is not that differentHaving studied Trump intently over the last three years I would agree that hes the same person he was as a child but I would peg the exact date to the summer between seventh and eighth grade It was then that his parents exasperated over his behavior sent him away to a military academy because they couldnt handle him There he was plunged into a cruel and often violent environment where grown men trained young men by smacking them around In the meantime his four siblings were comforted in the luxury of the Trump mansion peacefully attended by domestic help and educated at posh private schoolsTrump was by his own admission an outofcontrol child and he says that he needed the discipline he got at the military academy I agree but I dont think the discipline took This is what the more sober minded elders of the GOP Gingrich included are discovering now Trump is still the unruly child who will not be tamed The chances of him accepting discipline now at age 70 after a lifetime of accumulating wealth power and attention are slim to none
