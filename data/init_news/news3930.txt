This is an example of Donald Trump managing and the type of leadership he will bring to the presidency in November Manafort said in an exclusive interview with CNNs Chris Cuomo He also understood that winning isnt enough that its about how you win and how much you winManafort told CNN I work directly for the boss a notable departure from the usual workflow at Trumps 2016 operation where most campaign staff answer to campaign manager Corey LewandowskiManafort joins the Trump campaign as a contested Republican convention becomes more likely Trump suffered a critical loss to Texas Sen Ted Cruz Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary However the strategist says he is confident the Cruz campaign will hit a rough patch allowing Trump to win the 1237 delegates needed to win the nomination outrightUtah and New York are two different states he said By the time we get to California the momentum is going to be clear and Ted Cruzs path to victory will be in shambles Donald Trump has 746 delegates to date of the 1237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright meaning Trump would have to win the remaining 61 of delegates up for grabs RELATED Donald Trump looks to dominate New York Manafort is also optimistic Trump will block Cruzs chance of winning on the first ballot if the convention is contested You got to understand what the game is If the game is a second third or fourth ballot then what hes doing is clever but on the first ballot it is meaningless Manaforts experience in campaigns goes back to the 1976 contested Republican convention  Trumps hiring of Manafort fueled speculation he was replacing campaign manager Corey Lewandowski However Manafort insists there was no internal shakeup I listen to everybody he said I view my job as making sure people get to understand and meet Donald Trump
