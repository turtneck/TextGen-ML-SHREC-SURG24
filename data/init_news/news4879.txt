A couple of days before Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by nearly 50 points David Plouffe eased back in his chair at an anonymous Capitol Hill hotel and declared that the woman he helped defeat in 2008 had oh a 98 percent chance of beating Bernie SandersHe felt pretty pretty confident about her odds against Donald Trump too predicting she could win by an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points But Barack Obamas puckish intensely competitive former campaign manager arguably the most successful Democratic strategist of his generation offered a whothehellreallyknows shrug when asked to offer a similarly precise estimate of Clintons odds of beating TrumpI dont think we know yet and I think all of us should have learned by now not to get out over ourselves with Trump Plouffe told me during an episode of POLITICOs Off Message podcast in which he offered farranging opinions on Clintons selfdefeating tendency to doubt her own staff Trumps role as an Uberlike disrupter and Bill Clintons notquiteObamalevel status in the presidential pantheonMy sense though is this that he could completely implode Plouffe said of his favorite topic  Trump  tacking on a massive caveat So you say well how could someone you know really ferociously and viciously attack the last former Republican president and get into a worldwide verbal tango with the pope and come out OK Well he did  The Trump thing is a living breathing growing organism There are no rules for how you deal with itPlouffe the archetypal nodrama Obama adviser credited with implementing Obamas delegatehoarding strategy eight years ago has been informally advising Clinton and her staff as needed Last year POLITICO reported that he had quietly met with the soontobecandidate at her Washington mansion tracing her steps statebystate and offering counsel on how to avoid the rending internal dissension that helped scuttle her race against ObamaPlouffe several people in Clintons Brooklyn headquarters told me speaks regularly with campaign manager Robby Mook despite a demanding executive post at Uber that demands he travel almost constantly Mook was checking in with Plouffe daily  sometimes multiple times a day  during Clintons narrow and bitterly won victory in the Iowa caucuses they told me Part of the problem he has identified is the sheer number of people the Clintons talk to on any given day and the unerring certainty that each had in the quality of their own advice compared with what Mook and his team offeredAnd here is where the 48yearold Delaware political marketing whiz  who was trying to be as tactful as possible in his public dispensing of criticism  described what he believes to be the biggest danger to Clinton as she grinds through the primary headlong into a bellowing fullsteam TrumpI think you build your team and you stick by your team and you run said Plouffe Its got to be very hard for the Clintons Theyve been on the scene for decades So any time things go wrong they have dozens of people you know in their email box and probably calling saying Told you so Youve got to do this Youve got to do this  Youre going to have your valleys and thats always a test And if the thing you do is sow internal tension and allow voices from the outside to really I think affect the campaign in a negative way you may not winEarly on it seemed as though the Clintons were headed to the same dark place they inhabited for much of 2008 Both were in a sour questioneverything mood in the days after her microscopic victory in Iowa when it was clear Sanders was about to deliver a humbling and decisive win in New Hampshire There was talk of accelerating a reevaluation of staff that had been expected after Super Tuesday or after she secured the nomination Some in Clintons orbit even floated the nonstarter idea that Plouffe abandon his lucrative Uber gig and jump aboard the campaignDespite the fingerpointing Clinton decided to stay the course and was rewarded with gamechanging victories in Nevada and South Carolina  and Plouffe hopes she doesnt get itchyscratchy when things go south as they inevitably will in a general election fight I think what you do need to figure out whether its one voice Plouffe said of the campaigns overall strategy  and please do away with Clintons propensity to summon the clans for 10to20person conference calls anytime things go wrong he urgedThere has to be  you know theres the big call and the big meeting and then theres the real meeting and the real call he added You cant make decisions with 10 people Its impossible So youve got to figure out and you know the question is who is she talking to And listen theyve got enormous talent Joel Benenson pollster and strategist Mandy Grunwald Clinton admaker and allaround adviser adman Jim Margolis Jen Palmieri communications director  These are supersmart people So I dont think its necessarily you know is there a missing person from the outside  youve got to commit to somethingThe test he says will come during the general election when some old Clinton hand panics and demands that either Hillary or Bill scuttle Mooks strategy to address some crisis real or imagined There will be moments when theres some bad bull public poll that comes out that shows them tied in Pennsylvania and with all due respect Ed Rendell will call and say Youve got to abandon Virginia and come here for three daysAt this point Plouffe is almost certain Trump will be Clintons opponent He says its already too late for Republicans to consolidate behind Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz even assuming one or the other would drop out in a fit of suicidal altruism From here on out Trump basically needs to not implode Remarkably this is completely in his control If he can land the plane he wins Plouffe saysWhile he professes to be alarmed by the developerturnedrealitystar in his capacity as an American citizen he gets a little giddy not a natural Plouffian state of being at the process of reverseengineering The Donalds Teflon candidacy If you end up with a TrumpClinton matchup that will be one for the ages  and one hes pretty sure though not entirely convinced shed win in a walkI think thats a likely possibility that Hillary Clinton could beat Donald Trump by an unheard of margin nationally of 6 to 10 points he says But if thats not the case and hes competitive where hell be competitive is in the Upper Midwest in the Ohios the Wisconsins maybe Pennsylvanias of the world  maybe Iowa and Minnesota even potentiallyPlouffe is quick to say From an Electoral College standpoint I dont see a Trump path but hes equally quick to say the greatest threat posed by Trump is his unpredictability Plouffe is a guy who likes to make a plan and stick with it and Trump makes that a near impossibility Trump is a wild card and you just dont know he addsThe greatest danger is that the public continues to give Trump license to change his positions any time he likes with minimal recrimination and that will allow him to take popular stances outside the narrow confines of GOP orthodoxy Plouffe thinks hell show openness to taxing the rich nod toward the reality of climate change even recognize some federal government role in providing health care to the poorThe idea of deconstructing Trump appeals to Plouffe but the aspect of his old job he misses most is playing around with the numbers He thinks Clintons greatest advantage is a sophisticated datagathering operation capable of targeting voters one by one in swing states undermining Trumps scattershot populist messagingPlouffe comes by his numeracy naturally His father a Massachusetts native was a physics major who joined the Army and rose to the rank of captain where he worked in intelligence and Plouffe earnestly says that he cant talk about what his dad did before retiring and taking a job with DuPontThe son inherited the fathers love for math  he fondly recalls solving calculus puzzles as a kid  and like many political pros he grew up a baseball boxscore fanatic and later a devotee of Sabermetrics But he was also a passionate fan and like many kids in Delaware followed the Phillies as a young boy and idolized their Hall of Fame thirdbaseman Mike Schmidt As any one who has ever worked with or against him knows Plouffe is also very very competitive As a preteen he merged all of his passions into an obsession with a 1970sera board game AllStar Baseball that combined probability cards with the names of his favorite players and the thrill of pure chance  in short all the elements of modern politicsYet for Plouffe politics is ultimately about loyalty in his case an abiding loyalty to Obama thats apparent even as he dives enthusiastically into a role as public Clinton booster and private unpaid adviserHis old competitive instincts toward Clinton have been mostly but not entirely suppressed He speaks glowingly of her toughness and smarts But when I ask Plouffe if he regrets playing hardball with Bill and Hillary Clinton in South Carolina he grins Not one bit he says Not one bitWhen Plouffe compiles his list of consequential presidents over the past century the purpose is to place Obama near the top he ticks them off one by one Well clearly Franklin Roosevelt  Maybe you throw in the combined KennedyJohnson years  and then Barack Obama I think on that level  and Reagan of courseBill Clinton was a very good president he replies very good
