People who dont believe that unauthorized immigrants in the US should be given legal status tend to emphasize that it would be unfair to immigrants who are in the US legally  because they deserve a reward for settling in the US the right wayBut what if the legal immigration process is itself unfairA new study by researchers at MIT and Brown University suggest that might be whats going on  unintentionally They looked at applications for employmentbased green cards among immigrants who were already in the US What they found was that in the standard approval process Latin American immigrants were much less likely than average to get approved  and Asian immigrants were more likely But when the government went through a slower but more complete approval process the disparities disappearedFor this study the researchers Emilio J Castilla of MIT and Ben A Rissing of Brown evaluated the phase in an application for an employmentbased green card where the US Department of Labor has to approve or deny the immigrants labor certification for a particular job These applications get filed when a company decides to take an immigrant whos almost always already in the country on a temporary visa  like a work visa or student visa  and sponsor him or her for a green card which would let him or her stay in the US permanently and eventually apply for citizenship So this is the phase in the process where temporary immigrants can get approved to become permanent onesTechnically this is supposed to be evaluating the immigrants wouldbe employer not the immigrant him or herself In order to get the immigrant labor certified for a green card  or any work visa  the wouldbe employer has to prove that they tried to find a US citizen to fill the job but failedOne thing that isnt supposed to be a factor in the application is the immigrants country of origin But even when the researchers controlled for as many variables as they could  from the temporary visa that an immigrant held in the US when he filed the greencard application to the skill level of the job  they found that approval rates varied widely from one nationality to the next 905 percent of Asian immigrants were approved for labor certification But only 668 percent of Latin American immigrants wereThe regional disparity even showed up in immigrants applying for the same type of job Immigrants from Asia seeking employment as restaurant cooks are 416 percent more likely to be approved than immigrants from Latin America all else being equal the researchers write Its a problem for highskilled workers too Asian immigrants werent any more likely than Canadians for example to get approved to work as computer software engineers but Latin American immigrants were over 25 percent less likelyThe biggest problem with the study the government agents looking over immigrants applications could see each immigrants educational background but the researchers couldnt That could be a huge factor explaining the variation maybe Latin American immigrants are simply less educationally qualified for the positions theyre applying forBut the study indicates that cant be the whole story For example the researchers looked at immigrants who were already on H1B highskilled visas 99 percent of whom have a bachelors degree or higher but were applying to upgrade to green cards Among that group Asian immigrants were still 11 percent more likely than Canadians to get approved for green cards  and H1Bholding Latin American immigrants were 20 percent less likelyTheres also previous research showing that government officials profile immigrants based on their countries of origin In one study in which officials were asked to look over fictional visa applications the author said that region of origin was being used strongly as a criterion of a visa applicants desirabilityMost of the time the DOL makes decisions based on basic information about the immigrant the job and the employer as well as evidence of the employers failed attempt to recruit US citizens 90 percent of those cases get approved and theyre typically approved or denied in under 4 months But in a few cases  thanks to a process that is partly random and partly not  applications are audited and agents take a more indepth look at an immigrants background and the requirements for the position In those cases only 57 percent of applications are approved  and it takes about 2 years to come to a decisionAccording to the new study audited applications had one big advantage over nonaudited ones the disparities in approval rates between immigrants from different regions disappeared That might indicate that whatever is happening to favor Asian immigrants and disfavor Latin American ones in the quicker process is unintentional since government officials dont appear to think theres good reason to be more suspicious of Latin American applicantsThe studys authors suggest an easy fix making it impossible for an official to see an applicants country of origin just like officials arent allowed to see applicants ages or sexes If this really is a significant problem however its not something that changing the process in the future will be able to fixIf the government is really making it harder for Latin American immigrants currently in the US legally to get green cards through their employers theyre unfairly forcing Latin American immigrants to make the difficult choice between leaving the country theyve been living in for years and staying in the US after their visas expire In other words the governments approvalrate problem might be driving more legal Latin American immigrants to become illegal
