American immigration officials frequently choose to detain LGBTQ immigrants  even when their own evaluation system recommends release putting them at significant risk for sexual abuse new documents provided by the Center for American Progress showOf 104 immigrants who told an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that they were afraid of being put in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity between October 2013 and October 2014 81 were placed in detention anyway according to records obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act requestThese detentions appear to violate ICEs policies for how unauthorized immigrants living in the US are treated after theyre apprehended by immigration agentsThe government doesnt have to detain every immigrant whos apprehended even if its seeking to deport him or her Instead it can release an immigrant under virtual supervision like an ankle bracelet or simply under the supervision of a lawyer and tell him or her to show up in court for a deportation hearing Because many LGBTQ immigrants might qualify for asylum in the US since theyd be persecuted due to sexual orientation in their home countries its particularly likely that theyd show up to court to make their asylum caseAccording to ICE immigrants whod be vulnerable in detention because of their sexual orientation or gender identity are recommended for release unless the law requires it  and officers arent supposed to overrule that recommendation unless they have a very good reasonI feel very confident that when someone is processed when we have the information about their vulnerabilities and we can put that into the system were making good decisions one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told VoxICE claims its done a lot to improve the treatment of LGBTQ immigrants since President Obama took office in 2009 But given the risk of sexual abuse in detention advocates are saying it makes no sense for ICE to be putting LGBTQ immigrants in detention at all except in extreme casesThe fight over LGBTQ detention is just another round in a battle between the Obama administration and immigration activists that stretches back to 2009 Advocates complain the administration isnt doing enough to protect unauthorized immigrants especially vulnerable immigrants like children families and LGBTQ individuals The administration keeps putting out policies telling ICE agents to use their judgment and protect vulnerable immigrants but advocates say that agents dont follow throughBut theres also a difference of principle between the administration and advocates For the administration the goal is making detention safer for LGBTQ immigrants Advocates are asking why are they being detained at allPrison rape is a tremendous problem and its an especially tremendous problem for LGBTQ inmates The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of sexual assault in prisons and jails in the US found that 119 percent of LGBTQ men and 94 percent of LGBTQ women had been sexually abused by another inmate and 6 percent of LGBTQ men and 3 percent of LGBTQ women had been assaulted by a guard For comparison only 1 percent of straight men and 36 percent of straight women said theyd been sexually victimized by another inmate only 2 percent of straight men and 14 percent of straight women were abused by a guardIts harder to get data on sexual assault in immigration detention but indications are that its no less of a problem there A Fusion analysis of a 2013 government report about sexual abuse in immigration detention found that even though transgender immigrants made up only one of every 500 detainees they accounted for one of every five cases of sexual assault the Government Accountability Office was able to confirm In a majority of cases the government wasnt able to determine whether an assault had happenedJournalists and advocates have repeatedly uncovered stories of LGBTQ immigrants who suffered repeated abuse in detention  particularly transgender women who are placed in detention with men In January advocates started a campaign to demand the release of Nicoll HernandezPolanco a Guatemalan transgender woman who was put into detention after she came to the US to seek asylum HernandezPolanco reported that shed been routinely groped by guards and referred to as it and that she was put in solitary confinement for insolence when she tried to stand up for herself She was released from detention in early MayThe Obama administration has put effort into developing new policies to improve detention conditions and they put special emphasis on their efforts to improve treatment of LGBTQ immigrants They emphasize that they have a zero tolerance policy for sexual abuse in detention facilities and that an immigrant should not be put in solitary confinement just because of gender identity or sexual orientation And they take great pains to point to a detention center in California that has a special unit for gay bisexual and transgender inmatesTo decide whether to detain an individual immigrant ICE goes through an evaluation called the Risk Classification Assessment RCAThe evaluation collects a lot of details about the immigrants case weighs them according to a computer formula and then generates an automated recommendation about what ICE should do with herThe automated recommendation isnt binding  ICE officials can decide to override it But the agency stresses that its a useful tool to help individual officers adhere to the departments priorities and properly implement prosecutorial discretion In some cases federal law requires that an immigrant be detained  in those cases ICE still runs the risk evaluation but uses it to figure out how the immigrant should be detainedOne of the instructions to ICE officers administering the evaluation Ask the individual if heshe fears any harm in detention based on hisher sexual orientation or gender identityBoth ICE and advocates stress that a lot of LGBTQ immigrants probably dont want to out themselves after theyve been taken into custody The evaluation is only as good as the data we get one ICE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Vox So its almost certain that far more than 104 LGBTQ immigrants came into ICE custody between October 2013 and October 2014 But only 104 were willing to acknowledge it or understood the question being askedHeres what happens when an immigrant acknowledges that he or she is afraid of detention because of gender identity or sexual orientation according to the ICE official if US law doesnt require them to be detained the RCA will recommend that the officer process them for release That release could come with conditions or could involve other monitoring like an ankle bracelet  but its definitely not a recommendation for detention If federal law does require that an LGBTQ immigrant get placed in detention ICE says it will use the evaluation to make sure shes put in a facility that will protect her from sexual abuseThe problem is that isnt what the data shows at all According to the records obtained by the Center for American Progress in 81 of the 104 cases where an immigrant said he or she feared being put in detention because of sexual orientation or gender identity ICE detained him or her anywayIn almost twothirds 64 percent of the 104 cases it appears the automated assessment didnt even make a recommendation The records obtained by CAP show the result of the assessment as Officer to Determine  which according to a DHS Inspector General report about detention means its entirely left up to ICE officials to decideICE maintains that its evaluation always produces a recommendation and its just a question of whether the officer follows the recommendation or not When I asked the ICE official about cases in which the risk evaluation makes no recommendation the official replied The RCA always produces a result It always produces one either to detain or not to detainBut the data shows ICE officials had a lot more leeway to make decisions than that And most of the time they didnt use that discretion on behalf of the immigrant In twothirds of the cases where the automated evaluation made no recommendation  in circumstances where again ICE says it should automatically recommend release  agents chose to put the immigrant in detention Thats about the same rate as the general immigrant population according to the Inspector GeneralDespite what the ICE official told Vox in only six of the 104 cases did the risk evaluation recommend that an LGBTQ immigrant get released But in four of those cases according to the FOIA data ICE overruled that recommendation and detained the immigrant anywayICE maintains that the way it treats immigrants with special vulnerabilities such as LGBTQ immigrants hasnt changed since it put the automated evaluation in place in 2012 It doesnt appear to have been following those policies from October 2013 to October 2014 But that doesnt necessarily mean the agency isnt started following them nowICE says the formula it uses to make an automatic recommendation is an evolving tool What officers are supposed to do hasnt changed instead theyve changed the automated system so that its more in line with the instructions that ICE agents haveIn particular ICE says it made some big changes to the risk evaluation at the beginning of 2014 so that ICE stopped focusing so much on detaining people who might run away and focused more on detaining people who were dangers to public safety As a result when it comes to all detainees  not just LGBTQ immigrants  ICE officials went from overruling the evaluations recommendations about 20 percent of the time in 2013 to less than 8 percent of the time in 2014Theres no way of knowing how many of the 104 LGBTQ immigrants came in in the last few months of 2013 before the evaluation was changed And theres no way of knowing whether immigrants who are taken into ICE custody now are getting released more often But ICE wont say that the older data is unrepresentative and isnt releasing new data to show theres been a changeAnd it maintains that the basic way the evaluation works  always recommending that someone get detained or released and recommending that LGBTQ immigrants get released whenever the law allows it  hasnt changed since the system was put in placeSo in order to trust that ICE is getting it right now advocates would have to assume the agency knows it was screwing up before and just wont admit it
