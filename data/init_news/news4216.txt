When we ask who rules the world we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states primarily the great powers and we consider their decisions and the relations among them That is not wrong But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleadingStates of course have complex internal structures and the choices and decisions of the political leadership are heavily influenced by internal concentrations of power while the general population is often marginalized That is true even for the more democratic societies and obviously for others We cannot gain a realistic understanding of who rules the world while ignoring the masters of mankind as Adam Smith called them in his day the merchants and manufacturers of England in ours multinational conglomerates huge financial institutions retail empires and the likeStill following Smith it is also wise to attend to the vile maxim to which the masters of mankind are dedicated All for ourselves and nothing for other people  a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war often onesided much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the worldIn the contemporary global order the institutions of the masters hold enormous power not only in the international arena but also within their home states on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of meansWhen we consider the role of the masters of mankind we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the TransPacific Partnership one of the investorrights agreements mislabeled freetrade agreements in propaganda and commentary They are negotiated in secret apart from the hundreds of corporate lawyers and lobbyists writing the crucial details The intention is to have them adopted in good Stalinist style with fast track procedures designed to block discussion and allow only the choice of yes or no hence yesThe designers regularly do quite well not surprisingly People are incidental with the consequences one might anticipateThe neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy but they have aroused opposition as well most prominently in Latin America but also in the centers of global powerThe European Union EU one of the more promising developments of the postworld war II period has been tottering because of the harsh effect of the policies of austerity during recession condemned even by the economists of the International Monetary Fund if not the IMFs political actorsDemocracy has been undermined as decisionmaking shifted to the Brussels bureaucracy with the northern banks casting their shadow over their proceedingsMainstream parties have been rapidly losing members to left and to right The executive director of the Parisbased research group EuropaNova attributes the general disenchantment to a mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders who in principle at least are subject to democratic politics to the market the institutions of the European Union and corporations quite in accord with neoliberal doctrineVery similar processes are under way in the United States for somewhat similar reasons a matter of significance and concern not just for the country but because of US power for the worldThe rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention it sets aside the public which often fails to accept the approved role of spectators rather than participants assigned to it in liberal democratic theory Such disobedience has always been of concern to the dominant classes Just keeping to American history George Washington regarded the common people who formed the militias that he was to command as an exceedingly dirty and nasty people evincing an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these peopleIn Violent Politics his masterful review of insurgencies from the American insurgency to contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq William Polk concludes that General Washington was so anxious to sideline the fighters he despised that he came close to losing the Revolution Indeed he might have actually done so had France not massively intervened and saved the Revolution which until then had been won by guerrillas  whom we would now call terrorists  while Washingtons Britishstyle army was defeated time after time and almost lost the warA common feature of successful insurgencies Polk records is that once popular support dissolves after victory the leadership suppresses the dirty and nasty people who actually won the war with guerrilla tactics and terror for fear that they might challenge class privilege The elites contempt for the lower class of these people has taken various forms throughout the yearsIn recent times one expression of this contempt is the call for passivity and obedience moderation in democracy by liberal internationalists reacting to the dangerous democratizing effects of the popular movements of the 1960sSometimes states do choose to follow public opinion eliciting much fury in centers of power One dramatic case was in 2003 when the Bush administration called on Turkey to join its invasion of IraqNinetyfive percent of Turks opposed that course of action and to the amazement and horror of Washington the Turkish government adhered to their views Turkey was bitterly condemned for this departure from responsible behavior Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz designated by the press as the idealistinchief of the administration berated the Turkish military for permitting the malfeasance of the government and demanded an apology Unperturbed by these and innumerable other illustrations of our fabled yearning for democracy respectable commentary continued to laud President George W Bush for his dedication to democracy promotion or sometimes criticized him for his naivete in thinking that an outside power could impose its democratic yearnings on othersThe Turkish public was not alone Global opposition to USUK aggression was overwhelming Support for Washingtons war plans scarcely reached 10 almost anywhere according to international polls Opposition sparked huge worldwide protests in the United States as well probably the first time in history that imperial aggression was strongly protested even before it was officially launchedOn the front page of the New York Times journalist Patrick Tyler reported that there may still be two superpowers on the planet the United States and world public opinionUnprecedented protest in the US was a manifestation of the opposition to aggression that began decades earlier in the condemnation of the US wars in Indochina reaching a scale that was substantial and influential even if far too lateBy 1967 when the antiwar movement was becoming a significant force military historian and Vietnam specialist Bernard Fall warned that Vietnam as a cultural and historic entity  is threatened with extinction  as the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this sizeBut the antiwar movement did become a force that could not be ignored Nor could it be ignored when Ronald Reagan came into office determined to launch an assault on Central America His administration mimicked closely the steps John F Kennedy had taken 20 years earlier in launching the war against South Vietnam but had to back off because of the kind of vigorous public protest that had been lacking in the early 1960sThe assault was awful enough The victims have yet to recover But what happened to South Vietnam and later all of Indochina where the second superpower imposed its impediments only much later in the conflict was incomparably worseIt is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect That seems incorrect to meAgain the invasion was horrifying enough and its aftermath is utterly grotesque Nevertheless it could have been far worseVicePresident Dick Cheney secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld and the rest of Bushs top officials could never even contemplate the sort of measures that President Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson adopted 40 years earlier largely without protestThere is far more to say of course about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs But with such nontrivial caveats as these let us nevertheless adopt the convention at least as a first approximation to reality Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as Chinas rise to power and its challenge to the US and world order the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe the global war on terror American hegemony and American decline and a range of similar considerationsThe challenges faced by western power at the outset of 2016 are usefully summarized within the conventional framework by Gideon Rachman chief foreignaffairs columnist for the London Financial Times He begins by reviewing the western picture of world order Ever since the end of the cold war the overwhelming power of the US military has been the central fact of international politicsThis is particularly crucial in three regions east Asia where the US navy has become used to treating the Pacific as an American lake Europe where Nato  meaning the United States which accounts for a staggering threequarters of Natos military spending  guarantees the territorial integrity of its member states and the Middle East where giant US naval and air bases exist to reassure friends and to intimidate rivalsThe problem of world order today Rachman continues is that these security orders are now under challenge in all three regions because of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Syria and because of China turning its nearby seas from an American lake to clearly contested waterThe fundamental question of international relations then is whether the US should accept that other major powers should have some kind of zone of influence in their neighborhoods Rachman thinks it should for reasons of diffusion of economic power around the world  combined with simple common senseThere are to be sure ways of looking at the world from different standpoints But let us keep to these three regions surely critically important onesBeginning with the American lake some eyebrows might be raised over the report in midDecember 2015 that an American B52 bomber on a routine mission over the South China Sea unintentionally flew within two nautical miles of an artificial island built by China senior defense officials said exacerbating a hotly divisive issue for Washington and BeijingThose familiar with the grim record of the 70 years of the nuclear weapons era will be all too aware that this is the kind of incident that has often come perilously close to igniting terminal nuclear war One need not be a supporter of Chinas provocative and aggressive actions in the South China Sea to notice that the incident did not involve a Chinese nuclearcapable bomber in the Caribbean or off the coast of California where China has no pretensions of establishing a Chinese lake Luckily for the worldChinese leaders understand very well that their countrys maritime trade routes are ringed with hostile powers from Japan through the Malacca Straits and beyond backed by overwhelming US military force Accordingly China is proceeding to expand westward with extensive investments and careful moves toward integrationIn part these developments are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO which includes the central Asian states and Russia and soon India and Pakistan with Iran as one of the observers  a status that was denied to the US which was also called on to close all military bases in the region China is constructing a modernized version of the old silk roads with the intent not only of integrating the region under Chinese influence but also of reaching Europe and the Middle Eastern oilproducing regions It is pouring huge sums into creating an integrated Asian energy and commercial system with extensive highspeed rail lines and pipelinesOne element of the program is a highway through some of the worlds tallest mountains to the new Chinesedeveloped port of Gwadar in Pakistan which will protect oil shipments from potential US interferenceThe program may also China and Pakistan hope spur industrial development in Pakistan which the United States has not undertaken despite massive military aid and might also provide an incentive for Pakistan to clamp down on domestic terrorism a serious issue for China in western Xinjiang province Gwadar will be part of Chinas string of pearls bases being constructed in the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes but potentially also for military use with the expectation that China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf for the first time in the modern eraAll of these moves remain immune to Washingtons overwhelming military power short of annihilation by nuclear war which would destroy the US as wellIn 2015 China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB with itself as the main shareholder Fiftysix nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June including US allies Australia Britain and others which joined in defiance of Washingtons wishes The US and Japan were absentSome analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions the IMF and the World Bank in which the United States holds veto power There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to NatoTurning to the second region eastern Europe there is a crisis brewing at the NatoRussian border It is no small matterIn his illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region Frontline Ukraine Crisis in the Borderlands Richard Sakwa writes  all too plausibly  that the RussoGeorgian war of August 2008 was in effect the first of the wars to stop Nato enlargement the Ukraine crisis of 2014 is the second It is not clear whether humanity would survive a thirdThe west sees Nato enlargement as benign Not surprisingly Russia along with much of the Global South has a different opinion as do some prominent western voices George Kennan warned early on that Nato enlargement is a tragic mistake and he was joined by senior American statesmen in an open letter to the White House describing it as a policy error of historic proportionsThe present crisis has its origins in 1991 with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union There were then two contrasting visions of a new security system and political economy in Eurasia In Sakwas words one vision was of a Wider Europe with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the EuroAtlantic security and political community and on the other side there was the idea of Greater Europe a vision of a continental Europe stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok that has multiple centers including Brussels Moscow and Ankara but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continentSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was the major proponent of Greater Europe a concept that also had European roots in Gaullism and other initiatives However as Russia collapsed under the devastating market reforms of the 1990s the vision faded only to be renewed as Russia began to recover and seek a place on the world stage under Vladimir Putin who along with his associate Dmitry Medvedev has repeatedly called for the geopolitical unification of all of Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok to create a genuine strategic partnershipThese initiatives were greeted with polite contempt Sakwa writes regarded as little more than a cover for the establishment of a Greater Russia by stealth and an effort to drive a wedge between North America and western Europe Such concerns trace back to earlier cold war fears that Europe might become a third force independent of both the great and minor superpowers and moving toward closer links to the latter as can be seen in Willy Brandts Ostpolitik and other initiativesThe western response to Russias collapse was triumphalist It was hailed as signaling the end of history the final victory of western capitalist democracy almost as if Russia were being instructed to revert to its preworld war I status as a virtual economic colony of the westNato enlargement began at once in violation of verbal assurances to Gorbachev that Nato forces would not move one inch to the east after he agreed that a unified Germany could become a Nato member  a remarkable concession in the light of history That discussion kept to East Germany The possibility that Nato might expand beyond Germany was not discussed with Gorbachev even if privately consideredSoon Nato did begin to move beyond right to the borders of Russia The general mission of Nato was officially changed to a mandate to protect crucial infrastructure of the global energy system sea lanes and pipelines giving it a global area of operations Furthermore under a crucial western revision of the now widely heralded doctrine of responsibility to protect sharply different from the official UN version Nato may now also serve as an intervention force under US commandOf particular concern to Russia are plans to expand Nato to Ukraine These plans were articulated explicitly at the Bucharest Nato summit of April 2008 when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership in Nato The wording was unambiguous Nato welcomes Ukraines and Georgias EuroAtlantic aspirations for membership in Nato We agreed today that these countries will become members of NatoWith the Orange Revolution victory of prowestern candidates in Ukraine in 2004 State Department representative Daniel Fried rushed there and emphasized US support for Ukraines Nato and EuroAtlantic aspirations as a WikiLeaks report revealedRussias concerns are easily understandable They are outlined by international relations scholar John Mearsheimer in the leading US establishment journal Foreign Affairs He writes that the taproot of the current crisis over Ukraine is Nato expansion and Washingtons commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscows orbit and integrate it into the west which Putin viewed as a direct threat to Russias core interestsWho can blame him Mearsheimer asks pointing out that Washington may not like Moscows position but it should understand the logic behind it That should not be too difficult After all as everyone knows The United States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the western hemisphere much less on its bordersIn fact the US stand is far stronger It does not tolerate what is officially called successful defiance of the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 which declared but could not yet implement US control of the hemisphere And a small country that carries out such successful defiance may be subjected to the terrors of the earth and a crushing embargo  as happened to CubaWe need not ask how the United States would have reacted had the countries of Latin America joined the Warsaw Pact with plans for Mexico and Canada to join as well The merest hint of the first tentative steps in that direction would have been terminated with extreme prejudice to adopt CIA lingoAs in the case of China one does not have to regard Putins moves and motives favorably to understand the logic behind them nor to grasp the importance of understanding that logic instead of issuing imprecations against it As in the case of China a great deal is at stake reaching as far  literally  as questions of survivalLet us turn to the third region of major concern the largely Islamic world also the scene of the global war on terror GWOT that George W Bush declared in 2001 after the 911 terrorist attack To be more accurate redeclaredThe GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office with fevered rhetoric about a plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself as Reagan put it and a return to barbarism in the modern age the words of George Shultz his secretary of stateThe original GWOT has been quietly removed from history It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America southern Africa and the Middle East with grim repercussions to the present even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court which Washington dismissed In any event it is not the right story for history so it is goneThe success of the BushObama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection When the war was declared the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan They were protected by Afghans who mostly disliked or despised them under the tribal code of hospitality  which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused to turn over Osama bin Laden for the to them astronomical sum of 25mThere are good reasons to believe that a wellconstructed police action or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban might have placed those suspected of the 911 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing But such options were off the table Instead the reflexive choice was largescale violence  not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban that came later but to make clear US contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin LadenHow serious these offers were we do not know since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained Or perhaps the US was just intent on trying to show its muscle score a victory and scare everyone in the world They dont care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will loseThat was the judgment of the highly respected antiTaliban leader Abdul Haq one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as a big setback for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within a goal they considered within their reachHis judgment is confirmed by Richard A Clarke who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made As Clarke describes the meeting when informed that the attack would violate international law the president yelled in the narrow conference room I dont care what the international lawyers say we are going to kick some ass The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendousThe consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewedThe next target of the sledgehammer was IraqThe USUK invasion utterly without credible pretext is the major crime of the 21st century The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as genocidal by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them and resigned in protest for this reason The invasion also generated millions of refugees largely destroyed the country and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called blandly the liberation of IraqPentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3 of Iraqis regarded the US security role in their neighborhood as legitimate less than 1 believed that coalition USUK forces were good for their security 80 opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat abandoning its official war aims and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor IranThe sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere notably in Libya where the three traditional imperial powers Britain France and the US procured security council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it becoming the air force of the rebelsThe effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful negotiated settlement sharply increase casualties by at least a factor of 10 according to political scientist Alan Kuperman leave Libya in ruins in the hands of warring militias and more recently to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyondQuite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union accepted in principle by Libyas Muammar Gaddafi were ignored by the imperial triumvirate as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from west Africa now the champion for terrorist murders to the Levant while the Nato attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to EuropeYet another triumph of humanitarian intervention and as the long and often ghastly record reveals not an unusual one going back to its modern origins four centuries agoThis piece was first published on TomDispatchcom This is part one of an overview essay from Noam Chomskys new book on American power and the world Who Rules the World
