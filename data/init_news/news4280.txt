Though it appears as if rumors of capitalisms imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated writes Johnson there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent selfinduced shocks has reached a breaking point In 1946 George Orwell pondered the fragility of the capitalist orderReviewing the work of the influential theorist James Burnham Orwell presaged several concepts that would later form the groundwork for his bestknown novel 1984Not only is the best of capitalism behind us but the worst of it may lie just aheadIn his book The Managerial Revolution  Burnham envisioned as Orwell put it  a new kind of planned centralised society which will be neither capitalist nor in any accepted sense of the word democratic The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of productionThe real question Orwell adds is not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers bureaucrats or politicians the question is whether capitalism now obviously doomed is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracyWhile Orwell was wary of Burnhams worldview and of his more specific predictions he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been and always will be a precarious oneFor quite fifty years past Orwell noted the general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchyPointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging the weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state Orwell was far from optimistic about the future  but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give wayRecent events and the material circumstances of much of the worlds population have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago And though it appears as if rumors of capitalisms imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent selfinduced shocks has reached a breaking pointWidespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has in 2016 come to a head in striking fashion Donald Trump Brexit and the rise of farright parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptionsIs the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one asked Martin Wolf a formidable commentator in one of the worlds leading business papers the Financial Times This was no rhetorical softball Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent that they have taken for granted a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with He also worries rightly that they have downplayed the concerns of the losersWolf concludes that if the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few in the first place would be the citizenry to whom the politicians are accountableNot all members of the commentariat share Wolfs willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions however Indeed many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public reviving Walter Lippmanns characterization of the masses as a bewildered herd that if left to its own devices is sure to usher in a regime of chaosIts time declared Foreign Policy s James Traub channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro for the elites to rise up against the ignorant massesApologists like Traub and Barro  just two among many  speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the herd has been loosened and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case To use Barros infamous words  Elites are usually elite for good reason and tend to have better judgment than the average person They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus  evidence in short of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voiceAside from being conveniently selfserving this narrative is also falseFar from loosening the leash elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent  and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minorityBut in the midst of these antidemocratic diatribes fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emergedFar from loosening the leash elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent  and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutionsInstead of urging us to align Against Democracy  to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan many are arguing that it is capitalism and not the excesses of the democratic process that has provided figures like Trump a launching padIn his book Postcapitalism  Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market capitalism he insists has reached the limits of its capacity to adapt And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability crippling austerity for the many and rapid accumulation of wealth for the fewAccording to Oxfam the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent CEO pay has continued to soar And though postcrisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability the financial sector is still far too large  and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever
