The retired neurosurgeon lashed out Friday morning at reports of a recent closeddoor meeting of Republican establishment leaders focused on deep divisions within the GOP electorate particularly the continued strength of billionaire businessman Donald TrumpThe Washington Post reported that the group including Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discussed the possibility of a brokered national convention if there isnt a clear winner in the partys months long primary election seasonIf this was the beginning of a plan to subvert the will of the voters and replace it with the will of the political elite I assure you Donald Trump will not be the only one leaving the party Carson said in a statement that referenced Trumps repeated threats to leave the GOP if treated unfairlyI pray that the report in the Post this morning was incorrect Carson added If it is correct every voter who is standing for change must know they are being betrayed I wont stand for itThe Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to questions about the meeting and Carsons threatA thirdparty run by Carson or Trump would be a nightmare scenario for the GOP While Carson is slipping in recent polls an independent bid that siphoned even a few percentage points away from the partys nominee could make it all but impossible for the Republican nominee to win the general electionSpokesman Doug Watts said Carson was appalled at reports suggesting that Republican leaders were trying to manipulate the partys presidential nominating process He acknowledged that Carson like Trump and the rest of Republican field signed a pledge not to launch a thirdparty bidThe pledge isnt meaningless Watts said But he signed the pledge based on everybody playing by the rules
