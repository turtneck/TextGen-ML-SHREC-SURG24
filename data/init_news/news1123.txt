Eric Peters Autos October 31 2016 Automotive good ideas gone bad range far and wide  whether its a classic fail like the exploding Pintos of the early 70s  or a latemodel train wreck like the Pontiac Aztek Here are ten automotive atrocities that will be remembered for as long as the warranty claims and classaction lawsuits linger  The entire American Motors Corp AMC lineup  From dreadful dreadnoughts like the malformed Matador to demented detritus like the Gremlin and Pacer no other automaker ever managed to build such a seemingly endless conga line of bizarre poorly conceived and often poorly built cars within such a short span of time from the late 1960s to the earlymid 1970s Only bankruptcy eventually succeeded in stopping the madness Exceptions deserving of a kind word include the Javelin and AMX which were decent efforts hobbled by AMCs perpetual lack of adequate development funds  Chryslers lean burn engines  While Honda was developing highly efficient combustion chambers to lower engine emissions via engineering advances such as the CVCC cylinder head which allowed the cars to meet federal exhaust emissions standards without catalytic converters Chrysler was ducttaping its V8s with leanedout carburetors that mainly made them even harder to start than they were before  and prone to stalling in the middle of busy intersections In addition you also got gelded performance and terrible gas mileage Now you know why rich Corinthian leather never made a comeback  General Motors diesel V8  Imagine a luxury car that was both slow and inefficient as well as prone to early and catastrophic engine failures and you have a taste of the bitter flavor that was the dieselpowered Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs of the late 70s and early 80s These diesel engines were actually converted gas engines which contrary to the myth wasnt the problem Poor quality control was The resultant debacle not only soured an entire country on the otherwise perfectly sound concept it helped hustle Oldsmobile to the boneyard of automotive hasbeens and nearly killed off Cadillac too  The Sterling  Japanese automakers rarely screw the pooch but this was an exception Back in the late 1980s in collusion with British car maker Land Rover Acura Legends were resold as British Sterling 825s and 827s The alliance was as enduring as the HitlerStalin nonaggression pact  and just as awkward Parts for these cars  especially interior pieces  are all but impossible to find Dealer support is nonexistent Resale values are lower than current highs for wellworn Yugos If Truman had had another bomb left to drop the childhood home of the dude who would grow up to create Sterling would have been a worthy target  Pontiac Fiero  A great idea ruined by upper management skinflints and con men  who thought it would be slick take Chevette underthings front suspension engine and put them in a car that looked sporty and then charge the suckers top dollar Firstyear sales were great  until the word got out They then nosedived into the ground like the Air France Concorde forcing the cars cancellation just four years after it came out Just in time to hand over the entire market for a car of this type to Mazda  which brought out the Miata a year after the Fiero was sent to the crusher The Best of Eric Peters Tags Eric Peters   is an automotive columnist and author of Automotive Atrocities and Road Hogs 2011 Visit his website Copyright  2016 Eric Peters
