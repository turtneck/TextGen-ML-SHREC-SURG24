Professor Dr Mujahid Kamran ViceChancellor of the University of Punjab on the Suspension without Pay of Prof Tony Hall 1 Shares1 0 0 0Professor Mike Mahon President and Vice Chancellor Lethbridge CanadaDear Professor Mike MahonIt is with a sense of great sadness that I have learnt of the suspension without pay of Professor Anthony Hall one of the most distinguished scholars not only of the  but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally In a country like Pakistan which is far behind Canada in term of education research and scholarship no teacher or nonteacher of any university can be suspended without pay When someone is suspended he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension If Canada is doing better than us on various scales then one would expect that suspension without pay puts Canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play I may add respectfully that in Pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing The decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment From his writings that I have read over a period of time it is evident that Professor Anthony Hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state His analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly And his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation  or any university for that matter should have been proud to have Professor Hall on its faculty His suspension creates an impression even from this distance from where I write that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech have targeted people like Professor Anthony Hall who speak out for democracy decency peace and justiceI have found out from the internet that Bnai Brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech It is quite evident that the charge that Professor Anthony Hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious To the contrary it appears that an antiMuslim bias has been created in your institution by Professor Halls unfortunate suspensionThere is also a strong impression that Bnai Brith has taken over the administrative decision making at LethbridgeMORE Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech Bnai Brith attack on Canadian professor has roots in Zionist false flag tactics It is also worrying that Bnai Brith have now targeted Canadian universities and Canadian society If this is the case then the situation is disturbing not just for Lethbridge and Canada but for all freedom loving people worldwide When I was a young student at University of Edinburgh Scotland in the 1970s I used to meet many Canadian students and I found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice The suspension of Professor Hall is inconsistent with my image of the Canadian people that I had then formedOn behalf of the academic community of the University of the Punjab established 1882 I urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend Professor Hall It will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech academic freedom and genuine scholarly discourse at LethbridgeWith my humble regards and very best wishesProfessor Dr Mujahid Kamran Vice Chancellor University of the Punjab since January 2008 Author of a dozen books including Einstein and Germany 2009 The Grand Deception Corporate America and Perpetual War 2010 The Inspiring Life of Abdus Salam 2013 911  The New World Order 2013 International Bankers World Wars I II and Beyond 2015 Winner Abdus Salam Prize 1985 this prize was instituted from Salams Nobel Prize money Presidential Pride of Performance Award 1999 Awarded Sitara e Imtiaz ie Star of distinction awarded by Government of Pakistan 2015 etc
