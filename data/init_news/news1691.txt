This post has been updatedSoledad OBrien former CNNnews anchor extraordinaire was met with a puzzling situation last Saturday She was cohosting a massive Earth Day extravaganza on the Mall She was standing in front of a crowd she estimated at 250000 people She had a microphone But she was talking and nobody was listeningThe events hosts newscaster Soledad OBrien and Black Eyed Peas bandleader WillIAm appeared to have a rough time of it The Washington Posts Chris Richards wrote OBrien either frustrated by glitchy teleprompters or perhaps not clear on how a concert works actually shushed the crowd at one pointOBriens problem reflected what some see as a problem with Earth Days of recent vintage Even as companies celebrities and the likes of My Morning Jacket and No Doubt stand by to do what they can for the planet what theyre doing doesnt seem to amount to muchLaunched in 1970 as a protest against corporate environmental misconduct Earth Day has become a planethugging marketing frenzy for companies themselves the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2008 Makers of everything from snack chips to sportutility vehicles now use April 22 to boast about their efforts to help save the planetTwas not always so When Democratic Sen Gaylord Nelson Wis saw the waters off Santa Barbara Calif turn black in 1969 after what was then the worst US oil spill organizing a rock concert was not on his mind Faced with ghastly images of oilcovered birds and meager attempts to soak up oil slicks with straw he wanted to build a coalition across political parties  across country and cityGaylords unique contribution is that he was the first person to see the political importance of conservation that it could be used to mobilize people Denis Hayes one of the organizers of the first Earth Day said after Nelsons death in 2005 He recognized the partnership between traditional conservation issues and the new emerging urban and industrial issues Largely forgotten is that he was the first and most important to help us build bridges between environmental concerns and organized laborIt worked Twenty million people came out on April 22 1970 to rally raise hell and clean upThe reason Earth Day worked is that it organized itself Nelson said The idea was out there and everybody grabbed it I wanted a demonstration by so many people that politicians would say Holy cow people care about thisPerhaps not coincidentally the Environmental Protection Agency was created in 1970 the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 and the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973 In a country where Ohios Cuyahoga River had caught fire less than a decade before a Republican president Richard M Nixon signed executive orders and legislation that would begin the process of cleaning up the nationThen even as the Earth kept warming up a long cold winter set inTen years later it has become popular in some circles to write the obituary of the environmental movement to refer to the passing of the golden era for environmentalism Nelson wrote in 1980 It is asserted that public interest has waned that new worries have captured attention that inflation the energy crisis and international conflict have superseded if not wiped out public concern over environmentalismBut the golden era really was a golden era Nelson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995 but momentum had stalledOne could argue that there has been no major environmental legislation since 1990 when President George HW Bush signed a bill aimed at reducing acid rain the New Yorker wrote in 2013after the Senate tabled what would have been a landmark bill on carbon emissions Todays environmental movement is vastly bigger richer and better connected than it was in 1970 Its also vastly less successfulNelson had envisioned Earth Day as a teachin When Earth Day returned in 1990 it sought to enlist people in a welldefined movement not to enable them to work out their own vision of how they might make a difference asAdam Rome who wrote a book about the celebration told the New YorkerSo the United States still hasnt ratifiedthe Kyoto Protocol The messaging of the day may be lost amid promotional products and greenwashing But we do have Earth Day Tshirts and hoodiesAs Hal Harvey environmentprogram director for a funderof prominent environmental groups told the Wall Street Journal The danger is we let ourselves be happy with gestures rather than substance
