German LopezYouve called the war on drugs a failure What did you mean by thatBut weve compromised those values severely during this socalled drug war  so severely that were actually inhibiting public safety Were consuming gross amounts of taxpayer dollars We are undermining human potential And were doing it all in a way that has a significant if not savage disparate impact on poor people and minoritiesThat to me is a failure When we can get the same aims but also save taxpayer dollars create greater safety than were experiencing right now elevate human life and human potential and not further cement racial disparities in this country but alleviate them then we should be going in a dramatically different direction with drug policy reform Pilot programs for prison reentry and entire states like Georgia  which is dramatically lowering its AfricanAmerican prison population saving taxpayer dollars and driving down crime  are showing us that we could go a different wayCory BookerOverall drug policy has gone seriously awry and is offending our value system And marijuana is one of those drugs thats been almost pulled out of a category of other serious drugs many of which are prescribed by doctors to deal with serious injuries  somehow this drug was pulled out made a schedule 1 crime and so vilified that its created classes of criminals amid otherwise lawabiding citizens For example a mother who has a sick child with seizures  which we can show medically that marijuana without even its intoxicating element could severely reduce and benefit that child  right now that persons behavior if shes getting that lifeaffirming drug is going to be called criminal If she goes into another state that may have legalized it or legalized it medically and comes back into a state that doesnt shes trafficking drugs across state lines  a federal offense Im one of those people who think our marijuana laws are way off the rails We need to pull back and focus on things like legalizing medical marijuana supporting states like Alaska or Colorado or Washington that want to be incubators of reform and allowing scientists and medical researchers to test marijuanas impact on people What Im comfortable doing now is just saying Hey federal government play catchup here Get into the zone we already know most Americans are comfortable in And were going to stop criminalizing large segments of the country were going to allow scientists to study it and were not going to take lawabiding citizens who sell marijuana through dispensaries in the states that have legalized it and make criminals out of themYou have drug laws that are so severely disparately enforced against some groups Lets take African Americans for example theres no difference between black and white marijuana usage or sales in fact You go to college campuses and youll get white drug dealers I know this from my own experience of growing up and going to college myself Fraternity houses are not being raided by police at the level you see with communities in inner citiesSo equal usage of this drug equal sale of this drug but blacks are about 37 times more likely to be arrested for it African Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimums more likely to get about 13 percent longer sentences Its created these jagged disparities in incarceration In my state blacks are about 13 to 14 percent of the population but they make up over 60 percent of the prison populationRemember the majority of people we arrest in America are nonviolent offenders Now youve got this disparity in arrests but that creates disparities that painfully fall all along this systemFor example when you get arrested for possession with intent to sell you can do it in some neighborhoods where there are no public schools and its not as densely packed as an inner city You do it in an inner city and now youre within a school zone so youre facing even higher mandatory minimums So when you face that and you get out from your longer term now youre 19 years old with a felony conviction possession with intent to sell in a school zoneBut forget even all of that  if you just have a felony conviction for possession what do you face now Thousands of collateral consequences that will dog you for all of your life You cant get a Pell Grant You cant get a business license You cant get a job Youre hungry You cant get food stamps You need some place to live You cant even get public housingWhat that does within our country especially in these concentrated areas where we have massive numbers of men being incarcerated is create a caste system in which people feel like theres no way out And were not doing anything as a society like we know we could do There are tons of pilot programs that show if you help people coming back from a nonviolent offense lock into a job or opportunity their recidivism rates go down dramatically If you dont help them what happens is that left with limited options many people make the decision to go back to that world of narcotic salesWhats more dangerous to society someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of their own home or someone going 30 miles over the speed limit racing down a road in a community And yet that teenager who makes a mistake  doing something the last three presidents admitted to doing  now he has a felony conviction because its more likely hes going to get caught And for the rest of his life when hes 29 39 49 59 hes still paying for a mistake he made as a teenagerThats not the kind of society I believe in nor is it fiscally responsible Its undermining productivity Its undermining peoples ability to take care of their families Its locking in generational problems in poverty or even limiting opportunitiesThis is so wrong that those conversations Im having with conservatives as well as with Democrats are resonating When you have people like Sen Rand Paul talking about racial disparities in incarceration when you have people like Grover Norquist standing up and talking about disparate racial impact of this problem this convergence in understanding of fiscal conservatives of Christian conservatives of libertarians shows me that this is a time of great hope for our countrySo Im not going to question peoples motives This is one of those issues like the civil rights movement of the 1960s where it should pull all Americans together to say enough is enoughI went through 15 years of my life where every single day I would encounter good Americans who were being overly punished in a disproportionate way for a nonviolent drug offense whose lives were being destroyed who had desperation desire hunger just to have a shot at the American dream  yet a nonviolent drug offense was undermining their potential to contribute to raise their kids to have a decent lifeThats just wrong So every day that Im here that echoes in my conscience and drives me forwardLet me even go a step further because I alluded to this point but didnt make it clear enough the violence in my community thats driven by men who believe  and I think theyre wrong but this is what they believe  that they have no fair shot in this country they made a mistake and theyve gone into a system that often turns them out worse than they went in in terms of their proclivity for crimeWhen you take juveniles like we do in this country and put them in solitary confinement  other nations consider that torture  you hurt them and you scar them through your practices You expose them for nonviolent crimes to often violent people You expose them to gang activityThen you throw them back on our streets And you tell them Were not going to help you get a job You want a roof over your head Forget it In fact if we catch you trespassing on public housing authority property were going to take action against you Youre going to get a Pell Grant try to better yourself through education Sorry youre banned from getting a Pell GrantWhat do people do when they feel trapped and cornered by society What I saw in my city was people getting more and more caught up in criminal activity You can trace it way back to an early youthful offense that resulted not in us helping them not in us intervening to empower them  but in taking children and abandoning them and saying You made this mistake and were going to punish you and by the way that punishment is going to continue every day of your lifeThink of the statistic when I was mayor We found out that the murder victims in our city had an 85 percent chance of having been previously arrested an average of 10 times Some people might take a statistic like that and say Well it shows these people are whatever NoIf you want to judge a society dont judge it by the kid like me who grew up in an affluent neighborhood and was given great schooling Judge it by how we treat all of our childrenWhat does it say about a society when a kid makes a mistake and we dont surround him with opportunities that we know now work But no we have this slippery slope of punishing teenagers for nonviolent offenses  things kids in the neighborhood where I grew up in an affluent town did a lot But when these kids get caught they begin a slippery slope into a system that often closes off their options and points them more toward crime than toward redemption Thats unacceptable to meSo Ive got a lot of missions here  to expand opportunity empower people with education make college more affordable  but dear god I am driven every single day to end this nightmare that has made my nation singular in humanity for having more people behind bars for nonviolent offenses And in terms of race and class we now have a country that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850This is haunting to me especially because theres another way I dont have to invent it Im not just asserting it I know factually theres another way because I know many red states with Republican governors are showing theres a way to dramatically reduce the prison population The governor of Georgia is bragging about a 20 percent reduction of African Americans in the criminal justice system There are commonsense things we could be doing that were not doing because of a lack of urgency  and thats unacceptable to me I was taught as a kid as Langston Hughes said so eloquently Theres a dream in this land with its back against the wall To save the dream for one we must save the dream for allBut Im the X Generation We grew up after the Civil Rights Movement And I know Im here because of the outrageously righteous impatience of a whole lot of Americans from wildly different backgrounds  from religious folks to nonreligious folks black folks to white folks Christian folks to Muslim and Jewish folks Latino folks you name it There was a wild sense of urgency to raise the consciousness of this country until this place couldnt stop the change I mean Sen Strom Thurmond did a 24hour filibuster trying to stop civil rights legislation And the pressure in this country to end an outrageous injustice a savage injustice led to changeTo me this issue is no less urgent In fact in terms of affecting poor people and minorities and devastating communities this is an urgent issue of that magnitude  to bring a legal system that is truly a justice systemWere all hurting for it I dont care what your background is Youre hurting for it Youre hurting because the truth of our country  liberty and justice for all  is not being told Youre hurting for it because youre spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars from your annual taxpayer expenses to support an unjust system Were hurting for it because theres a better way to go and not doing anything is making streets less safe and destroying and undermining our children that we desperately need in a competitive economic environment to be contributing and not costingSo I dont know what its going to take but I know one thing its going to take is us and more people getting involved and seeing this as a cause for our country not a cause for some people over there This really does touch us all and theres got to be a lot more pushing You know the old saying  Ive heard it a million times down here Change doesnt come from Washington it comes to WashingtonThis interview has been edited for length and clarity
