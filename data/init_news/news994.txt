Hillary Clinton known as the Bride of Frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of Monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the Clinton regime which even a former FBI official now describes as a criminal operation The Monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than Charles W Burson Monsantos former Executive VP Secretary and General Counsel Burson who retired from Monsanto in 2006 but still maintained an active Monsantocom email address all the way through 2015 was praised by Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations Its sickening Via PR Newswire  On behalf of the Monsanto Board of Directors and the employees of Monsanto I thank Charles for his service to our company said Hugh Grant Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of Monsanto During his tenure Monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses Charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the United States but also in Latin America and AsiaPacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant Monsanto seeds and technologies Clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind In other words Charles Burson was instrumental in Monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified Monsanto seeds  This legal action by Monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the Hillary Clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put Hillary Clinton into the White House where no doubt she would return the favor to Monsanto through government policy decisions at the USDA and FDAFully consistent with the criminal conduct of the Clinton crime mafia Charles Burson also took part in excusing Monsantos illegal bribery of over 140 Indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersAfter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in Indonesia Monsantos then general counsel Charles Burson explained that no Monsanto isnt a bad company Theyre super honest and transparent and ethical tooThe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia At every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  Monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company We are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote Burson Surprise The Justice Department then defers prosecution of Monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened Whaddaya know With the corrupt lawless Justice Department calling the shots Monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in WashingtonFrom the same link above The Justice Department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if Monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement So wait You mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing 140 foreign officials in Indonesia  a felony crime under US law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on And the Justice Department says oh yes youre fine now there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes And then the Clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the Monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said Hey this guy would be awesome to help support a Clinton presidencyYepThats Hillary Clinton in a nutshell Hopelessly corrupt criminally involved collusion at every level and the total abandonment of human rights and human dignity This woman shouldnt be behind a desk at the Oval Office she should be behind bars Oh and it case youre curious here are all the other emails that were ccd in that same Hillary Clinton fundraiser message  Check out some of the names Do you now see how deep the
