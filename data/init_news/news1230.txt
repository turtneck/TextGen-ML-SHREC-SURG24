While two of his potential Republican presidential opponents were dodging press and scrambling to clean up gaffes on vaccinations Rubio on Tuesday presided over his first hearing as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere SubcommitteeHe peppered two panels of witnesses with pointed questions on President Barack Obamas move to normalize relations with Cuba which he called disgracefulAnd immediately after the hearing Rubio became one of the GOPs fiercest advocates for vaccinations since the issue emerged as a political football this week asserting children should absolutely be vaccinatedIt was a senatorial move from a senatorial perch for the Florida Republican who has told his staff to prepare as though hell run for president in 2016 though he hasnt yet made a decision publiclyThe hearing highlighted two of his primary advantages in the potential presidential race His measured charismatic speaking style and compelling personal story and heritage But the hearing also hinted at the troubles ahead for Rubio as hes vies for attention in a party crowded with rising stars and a different high profile issue seemingly each week The USCuba relations remain a lessthanglamorous storyline and an initially packed hearing room cleared out midway through when most of the senators left to vote And with the threat from ISIS taking center stage in the debate over US foreign policy and others with considerable foreign policy chops like South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham contemplating a run it remains to be seen whether the Cuba issue will be a sufficient launching pad to keep Rubio in the national spotlight Rubio opened the initially full hearing with a series of assertive and pointed questions for a State Department official seeking to pin her down on whether the US would agree to limit its meetings with democracy activists as a condition for the US government opening an embassy in Havana Can you categorically say we will never accept that condition he ultimately asked Its not a real condition the official replied While the questions were incisive they came in stark contrast to Sen Rand Pauls prickly interview with a CNBC host on Monday during which he shushed her and yawned while she asked questions The interview quickly went viral and drew him negative press And Rubios appeal as the son of Cuban immigrants for a party seeking to make inroads with Latinos was on display during the second panel which featured witnesses delivering testimony almost entirely in Spanish with the help of a translator At one point Rubio moved to ask a question after a witness had given her answer in Spanish interrupting the interpreter He apologized adding I could understand I told Sen Flakenot to worry about the translation Ill let you know what they said later he joked drawing laughter from the audience The senators backers believe his experience on national security issues and particularly his leadership on Cuba could give him a leg up on the competition in the primary Just last month Rubio won high praise for his command of foreign policy issues at a Kochsponsored panel that allowed him to differentiate himself from fellow 2016 contenders Sens Rand Paul and Ted Cruz He emerged as the administrations most ardent critic after Obama announced in late December plans to thaw diplomatic relations with Cuba And hes kept up the heat on the issue since appearing on local and national media and writing opeds hammering the move The subcommittee chairmanship too doesnt come without risks If he ultimately decides to run for president as is expected hell face questions about his ability to get things done on Capitol Hill Leadership of a subcommittee raises the expectations to deliver with concrete results  and can underscore the limits of a firstterm senators power
