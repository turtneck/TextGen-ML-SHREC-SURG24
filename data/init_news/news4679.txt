It feels like a million years ago today but Democrats swept to electoral victory in 2006 and 2008 largely as part of a backlash to the miserable foreign policy failures stemming from the 2003 invasion of Iraq And relative to that context President Obamas record in office has been good and avails itself of an obvious defense  yes the Middle East is still a messedup place but American soldiers are no longer dying there by the dozen Meanwhile Americas relationship with the rest of the world is vastly improved global cooperation on climate and nuclear proliferation is delivering tangible results and  oh yeah  Osama bin Laden is dead and America has been safe from terrorist attacksAgainst a Republican field that seems stuck in the Rumsfeld era it should be a winning argument but judging bySaturday nights debate Democrats seem ready to blow it Rather than sell the full range of Obamaera achievements Bernie Sanders Martin OMalley and most importantly Hillary Clinton got bogged down parrying with the excellent moderators over the toughest elements of Obamas record in office rather than turning to the good stuffBut theres more to the world than ISIS and the Arab Spring and a great deal of the point of Obamas foreign policy has been to prevent chaos in the Middle East from soaking up all the bandwidth of American foreign policy To win Democrats need to learn to contextualize problems and talk about successesConsider for example the crowdpleasing high points of Obama on national security Unlike George W Bush he really has kept us safe and avoided any terrorist attacks on the US homeland And while Bush let bin Laden get away in Afghanistan in order to free up resources to launch a pointless and unsuccessful invasion of Iraq Obama found bin Laden and had special forces kill him Youd think this would be something Democrats would want to mention as frequently and as quickly as possible in a discussion of counterterrorismBut on Saturday Democrats went through extended discussions of ISIS radical Islam and everything under the sun without mentioning it Osama finally came up once briefly near the end in the context of a personal question addressed to ClintonJohn Dickerson Begin the final segment of this debate with something none of you saw coming Something quite unexpected Soon after your inauguration you will face a crisis All presidents do What crisis have you experienced in your life that suggests youve been tested and can face that inevitable challenge Secretary Clinton you first Hillary Clinton Well there are so many I dont know where to start LAUGHTER I guess the one I would pick is the fact that I was part of a very small group that had to advice the president about whether or not to go after bin Laden I spent a lot of time in the situation room  as secretary of State and there were many very difficult  choices presented to us But probably that was the most challenging Because there was no certainty attached to it The intelligence was by no means absolute We had all kinds of questions that we discussed And you know at the end I recommended to the president that we take the chance to do what we could to find out whether that was bin Laden and to finally bring him to justiceThis is not much of a brag But at least it got a token mentionHere are some other things that nobody brought upThis good stuff does not of course undo the problems in the Middle East But then again the Middle East was a violent and chaotic place when Ronald Reagan and George W Bush were in office Obama has not managed to solve the problems of the region but he has defended Americas core interests  including crucially the absence of terrorist attacks at home  without incurring the thousands of American military casualties than we saw under his predecessorIt is all things considered a pretty good recordBut its bound to look terrible if  as happened Saturday night  Democrats are reluctant to talk about it except under duress Journalists and Republicans like to pick at the scabs and weak spots of a politicians record Competent politicians learn to talk about successes and broader context The Obama economic record isnt perfect either but Democrats are more than happy to defend it as broadly successful and superior to the alternatives The lesson we learned Saturday is that the party including the woman who served as secretary of state for half his administration isnt yet ready to do that on national security
