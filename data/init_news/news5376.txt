  WashingtonsBlog CNNs Jake Tapper hit the nail on the head last night as he was speaking about why people voted for Trump Tapper said that most Americans are sick of the income inequality globalization and politicsasusual that the status quo have given us He even pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization and a lot of people have been left behind  Indeed exit polls last night showed that the economy was the number 1 concern for voters The Guardian reports  Its the economy stupid was a phrase coined by her husbands adviser James Carville in the 1992 election and in many ways it ought to have helped Democrats again in 2016 Barack Obama helped rescue the US from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth Unfortunately for Clinton many Americans simply did not feel as positive Stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters Trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy Despite being pushed in this direction by Sanders in the Democratic primary Clinton never really found a satisfactory response Her volteface on trade sounded  and was later proved by leaked emails  unconvincing at best deeply cynical at worst Similarly Brexit  the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts  was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization  that only a handful of fatcats really profited from Leaders of the Brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Trumps victory as an unmistakable rejection of political establishment  Ukip leader Nigel Farage  who went to the US to appear at a Trump campaign rally  said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new President saying that 2016 was the year of two great political revolutions adding I thought Brexit was big but boy this looks like its going to be even bigger N igel Farage has issued this statement following Donald Trumps victory Today the establishment is in deep shock Even more so than after Brexit What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives I commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK We now have a President who likes our country and understands our postBrexit values Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come Voters in the UK and the worlds strongest nation the US have both rebuked the status quo including neoliberal trade and economic policies Whats next The rebellion will spread  For example its so probable that Merkels Christian Democratic Union party will be thrown out on its ear that Merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the Russians will hack the German election Postscript There are of course other reasons that Trump won But the economy is the main one
