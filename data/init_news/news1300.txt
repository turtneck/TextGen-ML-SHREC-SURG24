At a Capitol Hill social club earlier this month Marco Rubios top advisers huddled with supportive House members to deliver a sober update about the Florida senators chancesThe aides led by campaign manager Terry Sullivan told the group that they were not expecting to win Iowa or New Hampshire the first two states to vote They said they were hopeful that things would turn their way by the next two  South Carolina and Nevada  but realistically Rubios path to victory would be a monthslong grindOne attendee who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting said the message was that this is not going to be over in February or March as much as we would all like it to beThe strategy outlined that day was notable because Rubios campaign has sought for months to temper expectations so that the senator from Florida could peak right before voting was set to begin Now his team is bracing supporters for a drawnout Republican race that it says will ultimately reward Rubios versatilityWith just more than a week until the Iowa caucuses Rubio has stalled out neither rising nor falling much from where he has been in the polls for months either nationally or in any of the first four states Even in his home state of Florida which votes in midMarch Rubio is mired in third place well behind frontrunner Donald Trump and a few points behind Sen Ted Cruz TexRubios position reflects a race that has been dominated by Trump and Cruz two outsider candidates who largely speak to different sets of aggrieved voters Rubio had sought to present himself as a counterweight  a sunny optimist whose age 44 and Cuban American background represented the future of the Republican party More recently Rubio has shifted somewhat to try to match the mood offering more dire warnings about terrorism and more blistering attacks against President Obama and Hillary ClintonIn recent weeks Rubio has also been attacked from several sides as various rivals see him as a threat running more than 22 million in negative ads against him Right to Rise a super PAC backing former Florida governor Jeb Bush has been relentless in hitting Rubio New Jersey Gov Chris Christie has demeaned Rubios toughness and experience on the trail And Cruz has cast him as weak on immigrationDespite his standing Rubios donors remain confident that he will win even if he may have to do it in a way different from what they initially expectedI think Marco is doing fine said Anthony Gioia a major GOP fundraiser in Buffalo He is a very good campaigner Im not troubled by the little shortterm dips Hes still the best candidate against the Democrats and I think at the end of the day thats going to prevailRubios fundraising team is gearing up for an expensive next phase of battle Lobbyist and fundraiser Wayne Berman is organizing a National Finance Leadership Call Day in Washington on Friday Meanwhile billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer is promising donors who raise 10800 in new primary money five VIP tickets to an Iowa rally and private reception with Rubio on TuesdaySupporters who have heard directly from the Rubio campaign say their most immediate priority is to finish ahead of mainstream rivals Christie Bush and John Kasich in Iowa and New Hampshire That would position him for a final grouping with Trump and Cruz in which Rubio could be seen as the more electable choiceEven as Rubio fights off Christie and others though he and his allies are also going hard after Cruz A proRubio super PAC unleashed a tough attack ad campaign against Cruz this week casting him as a flipflopper and calling attention to his birth in CanadaThe early January meeting at the Capitol Hill Club designed to be an update on strategy and expectations also veered into a gripe session about Cruz according to people in attendanceRep Mia Love RUtah for instance explained how she felt betrayed by Cruz on a trade bill he persuaded her to back but later abandoned those people said Sullivan struck by her story told her she clearly did not need any talking points when it came to Cruz she should just retell that one Love did not respond to requests for commentRubio is also trying to play defense against Cruz Bush and Christie He is now talking about immigration  his most obvious weakness among conservatives  in a new way as more of a nationalsecurity matter than a debate over the merits of legalizing undocumented immigrantsWe cannot ignore the fact that ISIS has proven to have a significant understanding of the immigration policies of other countries Rubio said at a moderated discussion here Thursday using an acronym for the Islamic State Rubio is taking heat from Cruz over his membership in the bipartisan Gang of Eight that pushed comprehensive immigration reform in 2013Here in New Hampshire Rubio has railed against Christie taking aim at his past support for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor A proRubio super PAC recently aired antiChristie ads on TVOn the campaign trail Rubio is trying to reach voters with different priorities as part of his strategy to compete everywhere He speaks at length about his hawkish national security view Lately he has been underscoring his Christian conservative values more He tries to personalize the topics he raises by drawing from his experienceI am passionate about many of the issues we face in America because I faced them in my own life he said at a townhall meeting in Plymouth NH this weekOn the trail Rubio has also taken to framing the competition as a long slogIts an unusual and fun election cycle for you to cover he told reporters here Thursday But were going to continue to focus on winning votes and in the end Im very confident that when the votes are counted Ill have more delegates than anyone else and Ill be our nomineeOne label Rubio resists is the one many have applied to him disparagingly the choice of the establishmentEvery time Ive ever run for office whether its to the Senate or now as president Ive had to take on the Republican establishment And were doing it again now Rubio saidEven so many backers privately say that their confidence in Rubio is rooted at least in part in the recent history of the GOP slowly weeding out renegade contenders and nominating more orthodox candidatesSome supporters say that they just do not understand the appeal of someone like Trump even though he has attracted large crowds strong polls numbers and seemingly endless media attention and has shown no signs of slowing downFrank VanderSloot a billionaire head of an Idaho nutritionalsupplement company said it took him a couple of months of asking around before he could find a Trump supporter highlighting the disconnect between many in the donor class and those in the grass rootsThe two frontrunners arent anywhere near the top of my list or on the top of any list of anyone Ive talked to VanderSloot saidMatea Gold in Washington contributed to this report
