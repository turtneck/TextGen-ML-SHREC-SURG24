Heres something interesting from The Unz Review Recipient Name  Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin isnt happy Credit VDarecom St Thomas Aquinas told us that one of the pleasures enjoyed by the blessed in Heaven was to contemplate the sufferings of the damned in Hell Apparently if you get to Heaven there is a sort of balcony you have access to where you can stand and watch the sinners down below being prodded scorched and flayed Far be it from me to bandy theology with the Angelic Doctor but Ive always thought that divine justice should have a bit more charity in it than that Whatever Down here in the terrestrial sphere theres no doubt that one of the pleasures of winning an election is seeing the torments of the losers One of the first losers out of the gate on Wednesday morning was the curiously named Steven Thrasher   of BuzzFeed Its not the Steven that excites my curiosity its the Thrasher Mr Thrasher is a homosexual  indeed he basks in the glory of having received the 2012 Journalist of the Year award from the National Lesbian  Gay Journalists Association I know its Neanderthal of me but I cant help wondering whether Thrasher is an assumed name meant to signal something to those in the knowbut thats idle speculation on my part So here was Mr Thrasher on Wednesday morning This is a terrifying moment for America Hold your loved ones close People of color women Muslims queer people the sick immigrants all are threatened by Donald Trump They need your love your warmth your support Hold tight to the ones you love America Hold tight to the ones you love living in black and brown and yellow and native skin Hold tight to us because we will have to face white people who think we are rapists We will have to face a nation that wants to stopandfrisk us Hold tight to us because mass incarceration is actually going to get worse and more of our brothers and sisters are going to be disappeared  This is a terrifying moment for America Hold your loved ones close Guardian  November 9 2016 It goes onor thrashes onfor another six hundred words in the same vein Homosexualists were very much to the fore in this kind of hysteria  although I cant recall anything Donald Trump has said on the subject and I doubt on a priori grounds that homosex bothers him in any way For another example here was lesbian writer Cathy Renna  at Huffington Post November 10th Get yer hankies out This election was a hate crime Not physical but psychological and one that may well lead to legal and physical manifestations that would very much be categorized as hate crimes I saw and heard about such pain and fear on social media and personally as we realized Trump would take the election And it has not let up I checked on several people who were expressing a level of fear that seem like it could lead to selfharm A Vote For Trump Was A Hate Crime  November 11 2016 That one also continues for over 600 words Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is not homosexual although he does have eccentric tastes According to Wikipedia he once dated Maureen Dowd Im afraid that brings to my mind a limerick the late Robert Conquest wrote about Ms Dowds approximate UK equivalent Brigid Brophy The limerick is much too vulgar for a family website so Ill leave you to look it up for yourselves Mr Sorkin unbosomed his feelings about the Trump victory in the form of a letter to his 15yearold daughter The Trumpsters want to see people like us Jewish coastal elites educated socially progressive Hollywood  sobbing and wailing and talking about moving to Canada I wont give them that and neither will you Read the Letter Aaron Sorkin Wrote His Daughter After Donald Trump Was Elected President Vanity Fair November 9 2016 Ms Sorkin can of course make up her own mind about moving to Canada Its not actually an option for her Dad though Hes a convicted drug felon  Aaron Sorkin Says He Used Drugs  AP August 3 2001 And Canada doesnt give settlement visas to felons Casting around for targets on which to vent their spleen the CultMarx crowd didnt even spare the celebrity fluff magazines Heres a gal named LV Anderson an associate editor at Slate previously known as an expert on Ziploc bags  breaking a butterfly on the wheel the actual butterfly in this case being People magazine   Amoral PEOPLE Magazine Is Already Fawning Over How Cute Trumps Family Is November 9 2016 ORDER IT NOW Amoral People  you see has done what they habitually do when someone gets elected President theyve posted pictures of Trumps familyactually of his daughter Ivanka Kushner and her kidswhom the magazine describes as cute 22 photos of Ivanka Trump and her family that are way too cute httpstcoAZdq7b2Gwa pictwittercome6cSxQAft1  People Magazine people November 9 2016 That has Ms Anderson sputtering Trump and Kushner both played key roles in the most hatefilled presidential campaign in modern history They worked tirelessly to elect a demagogue  Trump and Kushner more than anyone else normalized Donalds patent unfitness for the presidency And now People is normalizing their moral bankruptcy by pretending that they are just average celebrities as harmless as the Kardashians End sputter Are the Kardashians really harmless  though Discuss among yourselves And then of course there was the HitleryHitleryHitleryHitler brigade British Lefty historian Simon Schama on BBC Radio November 8th quote Democracy often brings fascists to power It did so to Germany in the 1930s And so in my view it has done this evening  Fury at BBC Radio 4 as Simon Schama compares Donald Trump election win to rise of HITLER  By Cyrus Engineer Expresscouk November 9 2016 Its all been wonderfully delicious to watch In a simile that I like very much one of my email correspondents who lives in the Washington DC suburbs told me that quote There are few in my zip code with whom I could share the joy of this moment I can report that the apparatchiks are all walking around dazed and despondent like Japanese schoolkids who have just heard the emperor announce the capitulation on the radio  Added to the pleasure of hearing such wailing and gnashing of teeth on the Left is the spectacle of establishment Republicans like Paul Ryan falling into line behind The Donald The English language has the idiom rats deserting a sinking ship I cant think of a phrase that expresses the reverse thing rats scampering to get back on the ship as she hoists sail and starts to pick up speed but there really ought to be one If St Thomas Aquinas got it right and Heaven is half as much fun as this Im going to be very good indeed from now on in hopes of getting there at last If you go before me save me a space on that balcony To take set this in a global perspective VDAREcom Editor Peter Brimelow remarked to me the other day that an American election is the Greatest Show On Earth Hes right of course and thats hopeful for the human race at large Our election will surely have been an encouragement In many European nations just as here a smug entrenched political elite has been pushing a sentimental globalist ideology whose benefits to their own people have long since passed the point of diminishing returns We see this in the great crisis of illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East Weve been chronicling the crisis on VDAREcom the great floods of illegals into Germany France Greece and most lately Italy  Italy Becomes A Leading Destination For Migrants Matching Greece  NPR November 6 2016Weve told you about the sneaky euphemisms refugees asylum seekers migrants and so on No doubt some small proportion of the numbers are genuinely fleeing from something The great majority though its plain from the news pictures are middleclass young men from subSaharan Africa and reasonably stable places like Pakistan looking for a Western lifestyle Its overwhelmingly a problem of illegal immigration And rising numbers of Europeans are mad as hell that their governments far from doing anything to stop it are actively encouraging it There you see the commonality with Trumpism in the USA Illegal immigration has been a signature Trump issue Trumps success in the election this week has given heart to Europeans fighting for the sovereignty of their own countries and the integrity of their borders Heres a relevant quote from one of those Europeans Ronald Reagan spoke of Polands struggle to be Poland And today three decades later history is about to repeat itself in the United States and in several West European countries Of course I am not comparing our current political elite with the Communist dictatorships with their prison cells for dissidents but the fight of a nation to be itself remain itself and defend its identity that fight is also being waged today We are witnessing Americas struggle to be America and the struggle of several European nations among them the Netherlands Britain France Germany and many others to preserve their identity and liberty to remain the Netherlands Britain France Germany Everywhere patriots are on the march We are living the Patriot Spring Geert Wilders The Patriot Spring  Breitbart  January 26 2016 That was Dutch dissident Geert Wilders He is the leader of a political party over there the fifthlargest in the Dutch parliament with twelve seats in the House and nine in the Senate That hasnt stopped the Establishment bringing Wilders to trial for hate speech after he promised an election rally that there would be fewer North Africans in Holland under a government run by his party  Europes Show Trials Are Where Americas AntiSpeech Regime Is Going By Alex Grass The Federalist November 6 2016 Wilders trial is ongoing ORDER IT NOW Patriots in European nationsthe counterparts to those of us who write and broadcast on websites like this onelive under real threat Its not just the threat of show trials either Wilders has 24hour police protection and sleeps at undisclosed locations Thats the fate of honest patriots in societies under the soft totalitarianism of Political Correctness This weeks election in the USA has given them new hope Heres Geert Wilders stirring statement on his hopes for the President Elect My hopeand expectationis that Donald Trump will follow in Reagans footsteps that he will stand firm speak the truth concede nothing and in doing so inspire Western Europe to protect its freedoms against Islamization America has just liberated itself from Political Correctness The American people expressed their desire to remain a free and democratic people Now it is time for Europe We can and will do the same Geert Wilders For Breitbart The Second American Revolution Has Come by Geert Wilders November 9 2016 The key takeaway here Wilders phrase the Patriot Spring I dont know if he coined that himself or borrowed it but its something to watch out for across the pond in coming months There are elections all over in Europe next year Germany in February and September the Netherlands itself in March France in April May and June Hungary in May Norway in September Czechia in October It could be that were looking at not just a Patriot Spring over therebut a Patriot Year If that comes to pass it will have been partly under the inspiration of Donald Trump and our country the USA the wellwisher to the freedom and independence
