A growing number of prominent Republican women are worried that as members of their maledominated party step up to defend Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault they are causing irreparable damage to the GOPs deteriorating relationship with female votersTrump has faced questions throughout his campaign about his crass comments about women but concern escalated this month following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump boasted that he had sexually assaulted women and subsequent allegations by 11 women that Trump had inappropriately touched or kissed them A series of mostly male Republicans have come to Trumps defense  dismissing the accusers as liars and some worry further alienating the female voters that the party desperately needs to surviveFor nextgeneration professional women the party is going to have to do something very very drastic to change the course of where this candidate has taken us said Katie Packer a deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012 I think the leaders in our party are going to have to aggressively reject this Come November 9 they better be prepared to make very strong statements condemning all of Trumps behaviorThis division within the Republican Party comes as polls suggest the nation is on the verge of electing its first female president even as misogyny remains a part of American life and culture Ironically it is Trumps candidacy rather than Hillary Clintons that has brought sexism to the forefront of political debateThe difference between talking about Donald Trumps accusers and being fascinated by sexThe controversy also comes as the Republican Party continues to struggle to attract women who make up a majority of the electorate and who have supported the Democratic presidential candidate in every election going back to 1992 President Obama won women by 11 points in 2012 and several polls show Clinton leading among women by an even bigger margin this yearA growing number of wellknown female Republican strategists and politicians have had it with Trump Sen Kelly Ayotte RNH said earlier this month she cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women Former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina whose looks Trump once mocked said Donald Trump does not represent me or my party And former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice wrote on Facebook earlier this month Enough Donald Trump should not be PresidentThe latest flareup came Tuesday night when former House speaker Newt Gingrich R exploded at Fox News Megyn Kelly during an interview repeatedly shaking his finger at her and accusing her of being fascinated with sex because she brought up allegations of sexual assault against Trump In a scolding tone Gingrich tried to tell Kelly which words she could or could not useGingrich once had a fascination of his own with Bill Clintons sex life as he was a driving force behind the movement to impeach Clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a young former intern Clinton became the second president in American history to be impeached by the House but he was acquitted by the Senate Voters meanwhile punished the Republicans for what they saw as an overreach The GOP lost five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections which led to Gingrichs resignation as speakerTrump and his supporters deemed Gingrichs interview a victory with the campaigns director of social media tweeting that Kelly is not very smart and telling his followers Watch what happens to her after this election is overCongratulations Newt on last night That was an amazing interview Trump said at a ribboncutting at his new hotel in Washington on Wednesday We dont play games Newt rightTwo of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct piled on Juanita Broaddrick tweeted Beauty is only skin deep Megyn Kelly is ugly as hell on the inside Paula Jones wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted Woohoo he slammed this nasty heiferBut many other Republican women have concluded in recent weeks that this is not the party they knowLooks like Newt Gingrich just proved my point again tweeted Amanda Carpenter a conservative commentator and former communications director for Sen Ted Cruzs presidential campaign Carpenter wrote this week in The Washington Post about how her party has left women like her behind by ignoring Trumps chauvinism that was welldocumented in decades worth of publicly available smutty television radio and print interviews long before he became the nomineeIf the GOP has truly convinced itself that openly engaging in sexual assault fantasies is something normal that men do among one another I have a suggestion Relocate the Republican National Committee headquarters into a mensonly locker room Carpenter wrote Eliminate all pretenses of wanting to let women inChristine Matthews a Republican pollster said in an interview that Democrats no longer have to push a war on women narrative because its playing out on its own thanks to Trump  and comments like those that Gingrich made on TuesdayIts just one more clueless middleagetoolder white guy taking to task a woman Matthews said Its so unhelpful on every levelOne GOP woman wonders why the men in her party wont defend herNicolle Wallace former communications chief for George W Bush who is now a political commentator tweeted that Republicans are now engaged in a hot war against women that will end badly for the partyMen like newtgingrich are a big reason the GOP has lost women Packer wrote in another tweet Men like him dont make women like me want to share a tent wthemEarlier this week Kellyanne Conway Trumps campaign manager and the first woman to lead a GOP presidential nominees campaign

none of this is true Conway said These are lies and fabrications Theyre all made up And I think that its not for me to judge what those women believe Ive not talked to them Ive talked to himTrump has repeatedly denied allegations of abuse or sexism and has bragged about empowering female employees in his businessesNobody has more respect for women than I do Trump said during the last presidential debate when asked about his accusers prompting laughter from the crowd in Las VegasCarrie Almond president of the National Federation of Republican Women has traveled to 39 states in an RV this year talking with thousands of women who enthusiastically support Trump and believe the party speaks for themIts very important to not put all women into the same basket because not everyone sees everything the same way said Almond who is from MissouriWhen confronted with criticism Trump tends to go after women in much more personal and demeaning ways than men even though he insists he is an equalopportunity counterpuncher Trumps attacks on female journalists accusers and rivals over the past year have been heavy with criticism of their looks their intelligence and their mental healthAfter the first debate during the Republican primary  which featured three moderators two men and one woman who all peppered him with uncomfortable questions  Trump zeroed in on the woman Kelly for asking him about comments he makes about women After the debate Trump said that Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her whereverDonald Trump calls her Crooked Hillary but his fans just say bWhen the Muslim American parents of a soldier killed in Iraq in 2004 appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July in opposition to Trumps candidacy Trump zeroed in on the mother Ghazala Khan saying in an ABC News interview She had nothing to say She probably  maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say Khan later said it is still too difficult for her to talk about her sons deathIn early September when the hosts of MSNBCs Morning Joe were critical of Trump he zeroed in on the female host Mika Brzezinski tweeting Just heard that crazy and very dumb morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings MorningJoe Joe a messTrump has told NBCs Katy Tur to be quiet when she pressed him during a news conference and snapped at CNNs Dana Bash on Wednesday that she was rude to ask about the propriety of holding an event boosting his new Washington hotel He urged his millions of Twitter followers to search for a seemingly nonexistent sex tape of a former Miss Universe whom he had criticized as fat And he has accused Hillary Clinton of lacking a presidential lookWhen Trump made a similar critique of Fiorina during the primaries she responded I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump saidTrumps rallies have also been hotbeds of incendiary rhetoric around gender including popular antiClinton Tshirts in many locales proclaiming Trump that bJohn Weaver a GOP consultant who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen John McCain RAriz and Ohio Gov John Kasich said he is stunned by the misogyny the lack of understanding of where this country is now coming from Trumps campaignIf you have a gender gap the size of the Snake River Canyon why do you trot out Newt Gingrich and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and your nominee to talk about it and further make it worse said Weaver noting that all three men have been married three times The only ones I can see who seem to be obsessed about sex in this campaign are those three peopleWeaver continued Hes going to lose the general election and the credit goes to the women of America who are saving us from this guy
