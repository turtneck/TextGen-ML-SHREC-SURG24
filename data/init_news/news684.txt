Republican Donald Trumps and Democrat Hillary Clintons efforts to portray themselves as assertive adversaries of the Islamic State terror group are increasingly defining the 2016 presidential race  and never more so than in the wake of the massacre in Nice France this weekAlthough authorities have not yet tied the attack to jihadistinspired terrorism both candidates immediately responded to the latest in a string of attacks at home and abroad that have heightened voter anxiety by vowing aggressive efforts to combat the Islamic StateThey have done so in strikingly different ways she with specific proposals and he with broad promises But together their messages effectively assure a wartime posture in the White House next year no matter who becomes president  and they mark a sharp departure on the campaign trail from the noninterventionist sentiment that thenSen Barack Obama rode into office eight years agoThe intense jockeying was encapsulated in a round of dueling telephone interviews Thursday evening with Fox News host Bill OReilly following the deadly truck attack in southeastern France that killed more than 80 people assembled to celebrate Bastille Day The interview was especially notable for Clinton who rarely speaks to Fox News but may have been trying to engage with conservative voters who care deeply about national security and may not be sold on TrumpWeve got to do more to understand that this is a war against these terrorist groups the radical jihadist groups Clinton said Its a different kind of war We need to be smart about how we wage it but we have to be determined that were going to win itIn his interview Trump ticked through a list of recent attacks as evidence that a change in management style at the top is a necessity to blunt future attacksYou look at San Bernardino You look at Paris A hundred and thirty people killed and so many injured in Paris from that attack And you look at Orlando Its out of control Trump said And Bill unless we get strong and you know really strong and very very smart leadership its only going to get worseIn truck rampage experts see potential shift toward cruder deadlier acts of terrorThe backtoback interviews underscored the differences in the two candidates approaches Trump has embraced the debate over terrorism to emphasize his proposed ban on most foreign Muslims  which Clinton vigorously opposes  and advance a muscular but nebulous strategy to stamp out terrorists abroadClinton has been more specific arguing for a smart but strong effort to combat the Islamic State focusing on ratcheting up intelligence cooperation between the United States and its allies and fighting radical propaganda onlineClinton must walk a fine line Even as she pursues centrist Republicans including veterans of the Bush administrations foreign policy shop she is trying to consolidate support among Democrats after a bruising primary with Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont Many liberals already see her as too hawkish going back to her vote for the war in Iraq in 2002 which contributed heavily to her primary defeat six year later against ObamaTheres a lot of concern about another war in the Middle East conceded Sen Jeff Merkley DOre a Sanders endorser who helped the candidate win a landslide in his own states primary But look this is not a choice between Hillary Clinton and Gandhi This is a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and Id be far more terrified of Trumps reckless foreign policy than of Hillary ClintonTrump faces challenges of his own While his freewheeling rhetoric and his controversial Muslim ban and proposed wall along the Mexican border were big hits in the Republican primary they have exposed him to accusations in the general election that he is not serious and illprepared for the rigors of major security decisionsWith the Republican and Democratic conventions taking place over the next two weeks Clinton and Trump will be auditioning on the national stage at a time when the publics attention has been repeatedly directed to global terrorism threatsIts an electorate that is profoundly insecure and unsure about what happens next both in terms of the economy and increasingly in terms of international policy and terrorism said Anita Dunn former White House communications director in the Obama administration Making the case to the American people that you are the person to address their issues and to make the country feel secure again is really the predominant challenge for both campaignsAssailant was entirely unknown to antiterror units prosecutor saysIn his Fox News interview Trump said he would ask Congress for a war declaration on the Islamic State a move rarely used in American historyIf you look at it this is war coming from all different parts And frankly its war and were dealing with people without uniforms Trump saidIn her interview Clinton used similar language to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State But asked on CNN whether she would endorse Trumps proposal to seek authorization from Congress for war she made clear that she has no intention of drawing US or NATO troops into a fight with the Islamic State She called it the Islamic States dream to pull US ground troops into a war in the regionI would point people to read more about what the hopes and ambitions of ISIS happen to be Clinton said using a common acronym for the group They would love to draw the United States into a ground war in SyriaThey actually think the end times could be hastened if we had some great confrontation in that region she addedHours after the coup attempt in Turkey Clinton became the first candidate to issue a statement calling for calm and respect for laws institutions and basic human rights and freedoms The sentiment closely echoed the comments of Obama and Secretary of State John F Kerry and offered an implicit contrast with Trump who had not yet commented on the situationStill Clinton has not shied away from supporting an aggressive and frontal approach to the threatShe has argued that the United States and its allies should continue to reclaim territory from the Islamic State boxing their fighters into smaller and smaller territory She has criticized allies in the region for not doing enough to stop radicalization within their own borders and she called on countries including Saudi Arabia and Qatar to invest more in the global effort to fight the Islamic StateShe has also embraced the language of more conservative politicians After the Orlando attack on a gay nightclub by a selfradicalized convert to the Islamic State Clinton said radical jihadist terrorism and radical Islamist terrorism are virtually the same after once refusing to use the word Islam in the context of terrorism out of concern that it would only embolden the enemy and enable recruitmentTrump like many Republicans has repeatedly slammed Obama for refusing to use the term radical Islamic terrorism And he has accused Clinton of moving closer to his point of viewIn fact Clintons positions are not that divergent from the policies of the current White House Her hawkishness has been mostly displayed through rhetoric or by degree  though she has strayed from the president on a key issue stating that the Islamic State threat cannot be contained as Obama has stated but rather must be defeatedLiberal Democrats who support Clinton have struggled to get Sanders supporters past her foreign policy record At Netroots Nation the annual conference of progressives held this year in St Louis Clintons campaign was nearly invisible Foreign policy a focus of some past conferences was discussed only at a few crowded panelsRania Khalek 30 a journalist who has written critically of Clinton said the Democrat poses a more direct threat to the Muslim world than TrumpPeople are not going to protest when she decides to put boots on the ground in Syria Khalek said People are not going to protest when she decides to give Israel more military aid She has a record of killing people Donald Trump doesnt have that record yetJennifer MillerSmith a 50year old Clinton supporter from Florida argued that some progressives subjected Clinton to tests they never demanded of Kerry or Vice President Biden  for example their support for the Iraq WarIraq was a long time ago and shes learned since then MillerSmith said Weve all learned since thenEven I believed Colin Powell she said about the former secretary of stateCharles Khan 28 a financial reform activist who was in seventh grade at the start of the Iraq War said that polling and politics might curb Clintons hawkish tendenciesI think Hillary is smart and doesnt want to do anything that is unpopular Khan said With a huge majority of Americans not wanting to be involved in another war thats probably the stance shed take
