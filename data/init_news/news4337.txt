Hillary Rodham Clintons attorney has agreed to provide the FBI with the private server that housed her email during her four years as secretary of state Clintons presidential campaign said TuesdayHer attorney also has agreed to give agents a thumb drive containing copies of thousands of emails that Clinton had previously turned over to the State DepartmentThe FBI has been looking into the security of Clintons unusual private system which has emerged as an issue in her campaign amid growing questions from Republicans and some US intelligence officials about whether government secrets might have been put at riskThe development in the FBI inquiry came the same day that a top intelligence official whose office has been reviewing some of Clintons emails informed congressional leaders that topsecret information had been contained in two emails that traveled across the serverThe finding contained in a letter sent to leaders of key oversight committees marked the first indication from government officials that information regarded as top secret  the governments highest category of security designation  may have passed across Clintons server while she led the State DepartmentA State Department spokesman late Tuesday described the topsecret designation as a recommendation and said they had not been marked classified at the time but said staffers circulated these emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011 and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary ClintonNick Merrill a Clinton spokesman said Tuesday night that Clinton is cooperating with the FBI probe He declined to say whether the FBI ordered that she turn over the devices and when her attorney David Kendall had done soShe directed her team to give her email server that was used during her tenure as secretary to the Department of Justice as well as a thumb drive containing copies of her emails already provided to the State Department Merrill said She pledged to cooperate with the governments security inquiry and if there are more questions we will continue to address themThe inquiry by the FBI is considered preliminary and appears to be focused on ensuring the proper handling of classified material Officials have said that Clinton the Democratic presidential frontrunner is not a targetThe FBIs efforts have included contacting the Denverbased technology firm that helped manage the Clintons unusual private email systemClinton has resisted relinquishing control of the server In March she said the server contained personal communications from my husband and meI believe I have met all of my responsibilities and the server will remain private she said then in response to a question from a reporter about whether she would allow an independent party to examine the deviceClinton turned over more than 30000 emails from the account to the State Department in December and the agency is vetting those messages for release to the public She has said that she deemed an additional 32000 emails to be personal and chose not to keep themKendall told a congressional oversight committee in a letter that there was no basis to support a thirdparty examination of the server He indicated that he had confirmed with IT staffers that no email sent or received by Clintons account while she was secretary of state remained on the server or backup systems associated with the system Thus there are no hdr22clintonemailcom emails from Secretary of State Clintons tenure on the server for any review even if such a review were appropriate or legally authorized he wroteMeanwhile Tuesday 17 House and Senate members from both parties were informed about the presence of top secret information on the Clinton email system in a letter from the inspector general for the intelligence community I Charles McCullough III The letter was first reported Tuesday by the McClatchy news serviceMuch of the classified information in the email conversations originated with the CIA according to two government officials familiar with the records Some of the information was deemed to be classified by the National GeospatialIntelligence Agencys classification guidelines The information included references to information related to satellite images and electronic communications according to the officialsThe findings by McCullough stemmed from his offices review of a sample of 40 of Clintons emails Previously he had said that the sample included four classified emails but on Tuesday he adjusted his assessment  saying that intelligence agencies deemed two of those emails to have contained topsecret informationMcCullough has asked for access to all of the emails to conduct a more thorough review but was denied by State Department officials in JulyLast week State Department spokesman John Kirby said that while the agency was working to resolve whether in fact this material is actually classified we are taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriatelyMcCullough also located two emails that included classified material from among a separate batch of 296 related to the 2012 attacks on US outposts in Benghazi One of those emails had been publicly released by the State Department causing consternation within the intelligence communityHe has also located one additional email in the sample of 40 that was classified at the time it was sent but has since been declassified suggesting that there is no longer a reason to protect the information or that it has since become public two people familiar with the finding saidMcCullough also told lawmakers that his reviewers found two emails they believe contain information that the State Department considers classified and they have alerted the agency so it can conduct its own reviewAll told McCullough has pointed to seven emails that he said contained classified information including two with topsecret materialHis findings appear to contradict Clintons earlier commentsI am confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received she told reporters last month in IowaClinton said she had no idea which emails have caught McCulloughs attention
