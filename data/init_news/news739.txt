TheSupreme Court unanimously decided that once a defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to a crime the speedy part of the constitutional Sixth Amendments right to a speedy and public trial no longer appliesDoes the Sixth Amendments speedy trial guarantee apply to the sentencing phase of a criminal prosecution That is the sole question this case presents We hold that the guarantee protects the accused from arrest or indictment through trial but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered in the Courts opinionThe case Betterman v Montana specifically referred to Brandon Thomas Betterman who was given his sevenyear prison sentence 14 months after he initially pleaded guilty to felony bail jumping in a Montana state court He took the case to Montanas Supreme Court which ruled that sentencing was not part of the trial in a speedy trial  a ruling the Supreme Court upheld ThursdayCriminal proceedings take place in three parts an investigation prior to arrest a charge and trial where the accused is assumed innocent until proven guilty and finally after a conviction a sentencing The Court ruled that the language in all three of these stages  accused convicted trial and sentencing have distinctly separate protectionsThe Sixth Amendments Speedy Trial Clause homes in on the second period from arrest or indictment through conviction The constitutional right our precedent holds does not attach until this phase begins that is when a defendant is arrested or formally accused Today we hold that the right detaches upon conviction when this second stage ends the Courts opinion saidIn constitutional cases like these as Rory Little wrote for SCOTUSblog it is in the high courts benefit to provide as much specificity as possibleIn Betterman v Montana a cutanddried Sixth Amendment case with a simple question the Supreme Court took the opportunity to raise  but not rule on  additional questions about protections afforded under separate due process clauses While the speedy trial right  like other similarly aimed measures  loses force upon conviction Betterman may have had other recourse under the due process clauses of the Fifth and 14th Amendments the opinion readsBoth the Fifth Amendment which grants the right of a grand jury and protect against double jeopardy and selfincrimination and the 14th Amendment which protects the rights of citizens more broadly require a due process of law in any proceeding that could deny a citizen life liberty or propertyHowever because Betterman brought forward a Sixth Amendment case the Court had no reason to consider today the appropriate test for such a Due Process Clause challengeIn concurring with the Courts decision however Justice Sonia Sotomayor made a point to note that Betterman was not wrong to question inordinately long sentencing times  he just argued the wrong caseI write separately to emphasize that the question is an open one Sotomayor wrote
