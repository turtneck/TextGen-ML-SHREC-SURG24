Washington CNN The Iran nuclear talks are progressing But tough issues still remain We could reach a deal But we also might not About 5050 Less than 5050Its all up in the airThose messages are just a slice of what top US officials are saying publicly as they emerge from closeddoor negotiations with their Iranian counterparts struggling to find a way to broker a lasting deal aimed at keeping Iran from a nuclear weaponBut theres a method to the messaging madness as the Obama administration is looking to reassure key constituencies in the US while holding together an increasingly fractious coalition of countries joining them in the negotiations and also ratcheting up pressure on IranAll of this is inevitably to some extent posturing but its also real and important in terms of setting the expectations for the negotiating parties as well as setting the political context at home said Suzanne Maloney an Iran expert at the Washingtonbased Brookings Institution and a former State Department Iran policy adviserSkeptics in Congress want to know the US is taking a hard line and pressing for the best deal possible International partners want to know the US hasnt brought them to this point for nothing And Iran needs to know the US wont concede certain points but is truly willing to walk awayAs I have said many times and as I discussed with President Obama last night we are not going to sit at the negotiating table forever Kerry said at a press conference Thursday But he also said the US isnt pressed by time We shouldnt get up and leave simply because the clock strikes midnightBold public statements that the US is prepared to leave Iran hanging at the negotiating table telegraph the message that Tehran needs to budge on certain issues or it could find itself without the muchawaited sanctions relief it has chased for yearsThats how Sen Chris Coons of Delaware a key Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee interpreted Kerrys wordsMy hunch is that what were hearing here from Secretary Kerry is a determination to send a message to the Iranian Supreme Leader The deal that is on the table is the best deal youre going to get You either need to accept it or were going to walk away Coons said Thursday on CNNMaloney said Kerry and other officials statements are a clear gambit to influence Iranian expectations and Iranian decisionmaking on the inside from the outsideThose theatrics were necessary Maloney saidBut they also have another audience restive members of Congress who fear that the repeated deadline extensions are a sign that Iran is gaining the upper hand and sticking to its demands while the US cavesBy passing the July 9 date that Congress set for completing the deal and turning a copy over to Congress the administration now faces a congressional review period of 60 days rather than just 30 Thats twice as much time for vocal opponents to tear the details of the deal apart and rally votes against the measureSo Kerry and President Barack Obama have doubled down in recent weeks on their insistence that the US is willing to walk away from talks altogether if Iran wont relent on the final crucial sticking pointsI will walk away from the negotiations if in fact its a bad deal Obama said last week from the White HouseIf the tough decisions dont get made we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this process Kerry stressed on ThursdayThats giving some in Congress hope that the Obama administration is sticking to its guns But its not clear whether the more hardened skeptics are buying the administrations insistence that it is not flinching on key points Maloney saidTheres still frustration and an overwhelming skepticism toward the administration and its ability to hold a hard line with respect to Iran she saidThe talking point of walking away from a deal also helps reinforce the administrations arguments that it has worked tirelessly to obtain a good deal and that it therefore got the best one possible  should a deal be reached And if there is no deal the messaging will help to lower expectationsThats why Obama told Senate Democrats this week that its more likely that there wont be a dealHe said in the course of the negotiations hes been more optimistic less optimistic And he said that the chances at this point are below 5050 said Sen Dick Durbin of Illinois the No 2 Democrat in the SenateDays later though Kerry played the other side of expectations telling reporters optimistically that the parties resolved some of the things that were outstanding and that its safe to say that we have made progress todayBecause ultimately the US needs to keep not just Iran but its partners in the negotiations pressing full steam ahead at the negotiating tableThe coalition of five world powers  Russia China Germany France and the UK  negotiating alongside the US is already showing signs of strain as Russia adopts a stance on relaxing sanctions more in line with Irans In particular the new Iranian demand that the arms embargo on it be lifted has caused frustration for the US while winning support from MoscowOn Thursday Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated that his country was backing Irans bid to lift the arms embargo as soon as possible Russia is a top supplier of weapons to IranFor that Americans also have a talking pointUnder no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey said this week on Capitol Hill
