Like the Titanics architects realizing their fatal design flaw right around the first strains of Nearer My God To Thee Republicans are waking up to the realization that their presidential primary scheme is more Frankenstein than Frank GehryTo protect an establishment frontrunner against an insurgent the party frontloaded this years primaries and caucuses Going into March only 133 delegates had been allocated Super Tuesday added another 595 delegates By months end 1537 of 2472 delegates will be goneThe problem no one figured that for the first time in modern GOP history the insurgent would wind up as the frontrunnerWhich leads to the second problem Republicans looking to stop Donald Trump are running out of opportunities to derail himSo far 15 states have allocated delegates By March 22 another 15 will have gone to the polls leaving but 20 states between then and the first Tuesday in June just 11 weeks to change the GOP narrativeReturning to the Titanic lets presume the Republican ship hasnt taken on too much water and its still a viable contestHow then to stop Trump1 Keep The Field Populated To the proposition that the only way to beat Trump is via a headtohead contest dont buy the spinThe latest NBC NewsSurveyMonkey Weekly Election Poll played out such scenarios involving Trump versus Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Florida Sen Marco Rubio The results Rubio lost by six points Cruz by 13Assuming Rubio soldiers on past the March 15 vote in Florida he and Cruz need to strike an accord they dont attack each other their super PACs stick it to Trump And they draw straws to decide who has to call Jeb Bush to ask for his super PAC join in the TrumpbashingSyndicated columnist and Fox News contributor Jonah Goldberg takes this unholy alliance a step further suggesting a RubioCruz ticket ala ReaganBush in 1980 Im not sure its in Cruzs DNA to be so magnanimous since he leads Rubio in states won and delegates earnedTrump may keep winning states moving forward but from here on its a quantitynotquality argument with the goal being   2 Keep Trump Under 50 percent The number that matters most Its not states won but the 1237 delegates needed to win the GOP nominationOf the 1744 Republican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday 391 are in winnertakeall states The two most important Florida and Ohio on March 15 Trump has to be stopped in one if not both to slow down the express at present he leads in bothThat leaves 1353 delegates to be allocated either proportionally or by some hybrid scheme Most crucial of all states where a 50 majority winner earns all the delegates Texas has such a systemBefore Super Tuesday not counting South Carolina where Trump won all 50 delegates he and CruzRubio split almost equally divided 65 delegates 31 for Trump 32 for the senators If something similar occurs in the remaining proportional states with Trump staying near his mid30s ceiling theres still a shot at wheeling and dealing in ClevelandBut before we get there well have a few3 Showdown States I mentioned Ohio and Florida as musthaves for the antiTrump forces Here are three others to add to the listFirst up Wisconsins April 5 primary which comes after a twoweek break in the action and where last weeks Marquette Law Poll has Trump up by 10As the state with the nations tenth largest Catholic population it may be an opportune moment to revisit Trumps ropeaPope And dont forget Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker had some unkind words about The Donald as he ended his presidential bidAfter that Indianas May 3 primary The Hoosier State is home to Americas most prophetic county seat By the first Tuesday in May its an indication of which way the political class leans Indiana Sen Dan Coats is no fan Gov Mike Pence whos up for reelection this fall hasnt endorsedFinally if theres still a race California and New Jersey on June 7  again after a twoweek intermission Establishment Republicans would love nothing more than embarrassing New Jersey Gov Christie on his home turf But its a winnertakeall state in Trumps backyard 51 delegates A more pragmatic strategy would be to go to California and take advantage of a system that awards delegates three apiece for each of the states 53 congressional districtsAnd from there   4 Outmaneuver Trump Now Outwit Him Later In Cleveland Lets suppose Trump goes to Cleveland close to but shy of a guaranteed firstballot victory the GOPs last multiballot convention 1948If no one is elected on the first ballot all 2472 delegates can vote for whomevers name had been placed in nomination Which means to outwit Trump in Cleveland stack the deck with delegates willing to bail on Trump once their commitment is overThe GOPs 437 pledged delegates 269 Republican officeholders past and present plus 168 members of the Republican National Committee would be lowest hanging of antiTrump fruit From there Cruz and Rubio delegates will have to uniteIf the GOP is serious about stopping the insurrection it intervenes at the grassroots level and shops for voters not only willing to become delegates but open to the idea of switching candidates at the convention the political equivalent of changing horses midstreamCan Trump still be stopped Yes But it requires a lot of oddshaped pieces to fall in placeNow if youll excuse me Im off to sink into a leather chair and enjoy a cigar and brandy  while the violins play and the lifeboats are loweredJust in case the unsinkable doesnt happenBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution where he analyzes California and
