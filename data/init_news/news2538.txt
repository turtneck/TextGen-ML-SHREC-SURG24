Much like former Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders Donald Trump is wildly popular among small donors raising millions with contributions of less than 200 But theres no guarantee this pattern will continue for future RepublicansRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump meets supporters after addressing a GOP fundraising event in Birch Run Mich in August Mr Trump has set new records among small donors for a Republican presidential candidateRepublican candidate Donald Trump who did little to establish a fundraising army for his presidential primary campaign has raked in an unprecedented amount of donations for a Republican candidate in the last three months leading some to liken his efforts and success to that of Sen Bernie Sanders Iof VermontMr Trump has already raised nearly 100 million from donors writing checks for less than 200  an impressive feat considering he only started soliciting donations in May and had just 13 million on hand in June Politico reported As the numbers roll in many Republicans are surprised by the real estate moguls fundraising success among small donors noting that Democrats typically rake in a high number of small to moderate donations while Republicans rely on fewer donors but larger sums of moneyIn 2008 and 2012 Republican candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney pulled in less than 64 million from small donors The Wall Street Journal reportedIve never seen anything like this a senior Republican operative working with the campaigns smalldollar fundraising operation told Politico Hes the Republican Obama in terms of online fundraisingOr the Senator Sanders who built his primary campaign with average donations of just 27 and famously said he did not have or want a super political action committee PAC By soliciting small contributions Sanderss campaign was able to raise 229 million through June while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brought in 238 million before the help of super PACsSanderss ability to attract small donors has truly been remarkable Anthony Corrado a professor at Colby College who studies campaign finance and presidential elections told The Atlantic during Sanderss campaign Smalldollar donations have become the bedrock of his campaign and he has been able to motivate more donors more quickly to raise more money from small amounts than was the case for Barack Obama or Howard DeanDespite Trumps latest success among small donors some say its not enough and that such success comes from different tactics than those used by DemocratsI would just put it in the perspective of theyre still not doing as well as they should be doing and theyre doing too little too late Kenneth Pennington the former digital director for Sanderss campaign told Politico Once they start copying some of things Democrats are doing then Ill get worriedInstead Trump is using his name to capitalize on donations and has offered the chance to have dinner or other meetings with the candidate and his family in return for donations An email campaign offers autographed copies of Trumps book The Art of the Deal for 184Sanderss campaign on the other hand used lengthy appeals over email sometimes between 1000 to 2000 words to garner donationsWe find that people develop a deeper investment and appreciation for the campaign when theyre being counted as part of something bigger than themselves Robin Curran Sanderss former digitalproduction director told The Atlantic in MarchWhile Trumps fundraising success might mirror that of Sanders its worth noting that money wasnt enough to win the primary for the Vermont senator when he ran against Mrs Clinton and theres no guarantee Trumps donation bounty will help him fair any better against the Democrat Some also question whether Trumps success will usher in a new era of small donations for future Republican candidatesA lot of them probably dont realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the RNC otherwise they probably wouldnt give an operative working with the candidate and the RNC which has started a joint fundraising venture with Trump told Politico People are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because Donald Trumps name is on it
