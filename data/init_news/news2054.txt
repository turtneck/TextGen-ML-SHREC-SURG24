Dont Root Root Root for the Racist RedFace Team from Cleveland Paul Thornton Los Angeles Times October 26 2016 How I wish it were the Dodgers who took the field Tuesday night in Cleveland Yes were all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride The Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the Indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs For those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red C It never officially retired the offending mascot but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFLs Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postIndians era Or so we thought Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox and he hasnt left He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term Indians while the team was on Canadian soil snip Its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as Cleveland The Cubs championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title Beyond sports Clevelands decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of 900000plus in 1950 to less than 400000 today snip But Cleveland Hey I know some generous wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio which makes wishing for their teams brutal defeat personally difficult But being on the right side of a moral dispute isnt supposed to be easy especially when the team in question isnt the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner Daniel Snyder Clevelands municipal misery doesnt excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white mens economic hardship makes Donald Trumps popularity OK snip
