The White House acknowledged Monday that it erred in not sending a higherlevel representative to the massive rally in Paris against Islamic terrorism after facing bipartisan criticism over the meager US presence at the march  which was attended by more than 40 world leadersWe should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there Press Secretary Josh Earnest said MondayBut he also explained that the planning for the rally began on short notice and President Obamas personal attendance given the security challenges would have had a significant impact on the marchEarnest said they had only 36 hours to prepare and suggested the outdoor event with large crowds posed security risksEarnest said the US still stands foursquare behind our allies in FranceThe rally on Sunday was a historic show of unity that drew more than a million people  but none higher representing the US than its ambassador to France While the administration dispatched Attorney General Eric Holder and a top homeland security official to Paris for meetings over the weekend the only US official of note to attend Sundays rally was Ambassador Jane HartleyThe White House wouldnt say why Holder did not attend the march suggesting only that he or some other top official should have goneSecretary of State John Kerry initially dismissed the criticism as quibbling and announced a trip to the French capital later this weekA spokesman for the US Embassy in Paris told Fox News that Holder did not attend Sundays march because he was not available at the timeA Justice Department spokesman said Holder had to return to Washington that afternoon but was proud to join world leaders at the summit before the rallyBut the White House absorbed heavy criticism on Sunday and Monday for the thin US presence as well as for continuing to avoid calling last weeks attacks an act of Islamic terrorOn Fox News Sunday Morning Futures Sen Lindsey Graham RSC questioned the logic in even sending Holder for the Paris counterterrorism meetings suggesting the president is not confronting the matter as Islamic terrorismLast time I checked were at war I wouldnt send my attorney general if I were president to deal with Islamic radical terrorists Were at war here Graham said Obama thinks its a crime out of controlSpeaking on CBS News Sen Marco Rubio RFla suggested he can understand how security may have played a role in the decision for Obama not to attend but said I think in hindsight I would hope they would do it differently next timeOthers were tough on the administrations decisionNot an excuse in universe can explain why US failed to send to Paris a more visible rep than Holder tweeted Aaron David Miller a former State Department official who now works at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars calling Obama Kerry and Vice President Biden MIAsJames Stavridis a retired Navy admiral who previously led US European Command also said on Twitter I wish our US President had gone to Paris to stand with our European alliesAmid the criticism Kerry who is traveling on official business in India rearranged his schedule to make it to Paris later in the week He announced his plans at a press conference in the Indian city of Ahmedabad where he had made a longscheduled appearance at an international investment conference Sunday ahead of Obamas planned visit to that country later this monthI would have personally very much wanted to have been in Paris Kerry said but couldnt do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitmentsWhen asked about criticism directed at the Obama administration for not sending a highranking official to take part in the march Kerry said earlier I really think that this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched our ambassador to France Jane Hartley was there and marched many people from the embassy were there and marchedA senior administration official stressed that Hartley attended the Paris march and that Obama has shown US solidarity with France by placing a call to their president stopping by the French embassy and directing US officials to work on helping the French in the wake of last weeks terror attackThe official also said it is worth noting that the security requirements for both the President and VP can be distracting from events like this  this event is not about usKerry at the news conference said that US officials including himself and Obama had been deeply engaged with French authorities almost immediately after the first attack occurred Wednesday and had offered intelligence assistanceMore than 40 world leaders  press reports put the number at 44  along with more than a million ordinary French citizens marched arm in arm through the streets of Paris Sunday to rally for unity and freedom of expression and to honor the 17 victims killed in three separate terror attacks last weekAmong the world leaders who did march under heavy security were French President Francois Hollande British Prime Minister David Cameron German Chancellor Angela Merkel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud AbbasShibley Telhami a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution tweeted Whats missing in this picture American leaders Even Palestinian and Israeli leaders in front line of Paris marchDemocratic strategist Doug Schoen in a column on FoxNewscom said Obama has morally abdicated his place as the leader of the free world The decision to stay in Washington Schoen wrote sent a clear message to the world Obama just doesnt careHe also lamented that Obama is the only Western leader who has refused to call this attack Islamic terrorism even though President Hollande has declared that France is it at war with radical IslamKerry said he is going to France to reaffirm US solidarity with Americas oldest ally He said as soon as he heard about the march he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could goThat is why I am going there on the way home and to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there he said I dont think the people of France have any doubt about Americas understanding about what happened about our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France

attacks on a French newspaper and a kosher supermarket Authorities say one of those involved in the attacks pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video He and two other suspected extremists were killed during police raidsMeanwhile the White House said Sunday it will hold an international summit next month in Washington on thwarting violent extremismThe summit is scheduled for
