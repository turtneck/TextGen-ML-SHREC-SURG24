A group of Senate Democrats on Tuesday eased off their push for new Iran sanctions potentially taking the wind out of the bipartisan effort to muscle through the legislation in the face of a President Obama veto threatIn a reversal Sen Bob Menendez DNJ announced at a Senate committee hearing that he and his Democratic colleagues had written to Obama telling him they would hold off on supporting legislation that he helped write The bill was coauthored by Republican Illinois Sen Mark KirkWe will not support passage of the KirkMenendez bill on the Senate floor until after March 24 and only if there is no political framework agreement Menendez announcedThe legislation would tee up new sanctions against Iran if the country fails to strike an acceptable deal curbing its nuclear program Though the final deadline for those talks is the end of June March 24 is the soft deadline to reach the outlines of a dealMenendez wants to give the Obama administration until that deadline to see whether the sanctions bill is necessaryHis office later released the letter signed by 10 Senate Democrats including Menendez saying while they support the bill they will wait until after March 24 in acknowledgement of your concern regarding congressional action on legislation at this momentThe pushback from Menendez and his colleagues could stall the legislationThe Senate banking committee which held Tuesdays hearing is still set to consider and vote on the bill on Thursday Asked for comment on Menendez announcement an aide to Kirk said only that the bill would be introduced shortly and has broad bipartisan supportBut if enough Democrats peel off it could deprive the 54seat Republican majority of the 60 votes needed to pass the legislation At the least supporters likely would not have the twothirds majority needed to override a presidential vetoThe changeup could for now end up averting  or delaying  a looming veto showdown between Congress and ObamaIn his State of the Union address Obama bluntly threatened to veto any bill that could disrupt nuclear talksNew sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails  alienating America from its allies making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again Obama said It doesnt make senseOn Tuesday Sen Sherrod Brown DOhio urged Congress to hold off warning of the consequences if lawmakers override a presidential vetoIf Congress acts to force the presidents hand in the next few months by overriding his veto and if doing so contributes to the collapse of negotiation and our heading down the path toward a military confrontation Congress beginning with each one of us will be held responsibleSen Chuck Schumer DNY on Tuesday backed Menendez call to hold off on the bill while saying he would still vote for it on Thursday so the legislation would be ready to go if needed later onBut Republican lawmakers took issue with the administrations argument that passing the bill could derail negotiations They argued that if Iran walked away from talks over prospective sanctions it shows they werent serious in the first place And they reiterated their view that tough sanctions brought Iran to the talks and it may take the threat of more sanctions to seal the dealIts clear that sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table and the threat of future sanctions represent Irans only incentive to successfully conclude an agreement here Sen Richard Shelby RAla chairman of the banking committee said TuesdayMenendez said hes hopeful diplomacy will prevail in the nuclear talks while noting hes deeply skeptical Iran is willing to make the necessary concessions
