It was bad news for Bernie Sanders that he lost in Nevada Saturday But there may be a bigger crisis embedded in the loss It suggested he isnt delivering on a key ingredient needed for his political revolutionOn Saturday about 80000 voters participated in Nevadas caucus  roughly twothirds of the total that came out in 2008Sanderss reason for running as he describes it is to upend how money and special interests shape American politics by empowering voters This means bringing out an unprecedented number of people on Election DaySo as bad as it was to lose Nevada on Saturday night the tepid voter turnout in itself is almost a more significant problem for himThroughout the course of his campaign Sanders has promised to transform American government by bringing millions and millions of new voters to the ballot boxThis is in contrast to the incrementalism of Clintons campaign which recognizes the confines of a bitterly divided American electorate and offers to fight for whatever gains are availableSanders rejects the limits of this system His political revolution is based on the idea that Democrats could win big with a message that gets a massive number of new lower and middleincome voters continually engaged in the political processIts an inspiring vision But there is little sign that its actually happeningLow turnout in Nevada wasnt an outlier New Hampshire saw 10 percent fewer voters in 2016 than it did eight years ago In Iowa turnout was also down  from 287000 in 2008 to 171000 this year By contrast voter numbers are exploding on the Republican side with records for GOP turnout being crushed in Iowa New Hampshire and from the early results South CarolinaSanders needs this to change and quickly to validate one of his key arguments against ClintonAs Voxs Ezra Klein has written Sanders thinks the core failure of Obamas presidency is its failure to convert voter enthusiasm in 2008 into a durable mobilized organizing force beyond the election Sanders vows to rectify this mistake by maintaining the energy from the campaign for subsequent fights against the corporate interests and in congressional and state electionsThe relatively low voter turnout in the Democratic primary so far makes this more sweeping plan seem laughably implausible Three states have voted weve had countless debates and town halls and theres been walltowall media coverage for weeks Sanders has drawn close to Clinton in the polls and there are real stakes in a closely divided raceAnd yet  we have little evidence that Sanders has actually activated a new force in electoral politics If he cant match the excitement generated by Obama on the campaign trail how can he promise to exceed it once in office
