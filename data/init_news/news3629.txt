It would not surprise me if at the next Republican National Convention Benjamin Netanyahu took a seat in the delegatesfromabroad section The Israeli leader has both allied and associated himself with congressional Republicans who differ with President Obama over whether to impose additional sanctions on Iran and who also  lets not beat around the bush  hate his guts Their foreign policy is actually a domestic one to destroy the presidentWhether this is political or personal  or a combination of the two  is beside the point Whatever the case when Netanyahu accepted John Boehners invitation to address a joint session of Congress in March he did so without informing the White House Boehner too bypassed the White House As a result Netanyahu will come and go and not meet with the presidentBoehner insists that as speaker of the House he has the standing to issue an invitation to a foreign leader on his own Thats debatable He is after all elected by the Republican caucus not by the full House and not significantly by the American people He knew what this invitation would look like This is high school stuff a stunt unworthy of even Newt GingrichI stand with the president on this sanctions matter Additional sanctions may drive the Iranians from the table The Europeans may go with them Lets give the talks some more timeI stand with Netanyahu in worrying about a president who has been awfully twitchy in his foreign policy His faux threat to take Syria to task if it used chemical weapons in its civil war  the famous red line  turned out to be a redfaced embarrassment It has cost Obama much more than it cost Bashar alAssadBut what concerns me most is how Netanyahu threatens to harm the bipartisan understanding and support of Israel The prime minister has never been able to hide his disdain for Obama In May 2011 he made Obama squirm before the TV cameras as he lectured him about Middle East matters in the Oval Office It was simply no way to treat the president of the United StatesAccepting Boehners invitation sent the same message of contempt I know Netanyahu sees the Iranian nuclear program as an existential threat to Israel but that does not excuse his boorish manners I am an ardent supporter of Israel but I am also an American Do not insult my presidentMy feelings however are immaterial What matters above all is the possibility that support of Israel will become a partisan political issue in the United States It may come as a surprise but Zionism was once beloved by the American and European left The British Labour Party even supported transferring Palestinians out of what is now Israel  a policy that changed once Labour got to govern Now though the European left has abandoned Israel adoring the Palestinian cause with a striking naiveteThe American left is not quite as robustly antiIsrael but the trend is unmistakable Even some American Jews  especially the younger generation  are either cooler toward Israel or indifferent The Holocaust has faded as an emotional rallying point and with both an intermarriage rate well over 50 percent and a declining population the American Jewish community is both contracting and inevitably losing clout For many young Jews as well as nonJews Israels rightwing government is hardly attractive Its been many years since Harry Belafonte sang Hava NagilaA generation of Americans who support gay rights samesex marriage and reproductive freedom and who fear global warming are going to wonder about an Israeli prime minister who embraces a speaker of the House who personifies all they loathe Israel should not become yet another rightwing issue joining such bizarre causes as the right to pollute the atmosphere or to turn millions of immigrants into fugitivesGoing back to the very formation of the state Israel has enjoyed deep bipartisan support in America  neither a Republican nor Democratic issue Theres no mystery here Israel is a democracy a beleaguered one at that whose creation is yet another desert miracle Its cinematic virtues are manifest Its a great storyNow though some damage has been done Netanyahu will come and speak to Congress and make his case  the one he has made time and time again  for additional sanctions on Iran But if in the end action needs to be taken against Iran Israel will need the support of all Americans He has with his impetuousness and contempt made that harder to get
