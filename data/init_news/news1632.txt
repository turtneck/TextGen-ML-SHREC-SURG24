  Two More Hollywood Films For Men That Leave Todays SJW Movies In The Dust Two More Hollywood Films For Men That Leave Todays SJW Movies In The Dust Bob Smith Bob Smith is a man in search of the truth His favorite quotes are Were all fools on this earth and I can be no different I know its true I read it at the LIEbrary and The truth is not misogynistic its just the truth November 11 2016 Culture Today we are going to take a quick look at two epic Clint Eastwood films one of which is a wellknown Western classic  The Outlaw Josey Wales  The other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged Western female  Play Misty for Me  Both of these superb RPO films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old Uncle Bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of SJW Hollywood crap Yes indeed So lets get crackin 1 The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976  Clint Eastwood Chief Dan George Bill McKinney John Vernon Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postCivil War epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent But Eastwoods portrayal of the Southernsympathizer Josey Wales who has a major score to settle after Union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement Out for blood and taking no prisoners Eastwoods merciless Josey Wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the American West blowing scores of Northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards Mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary But Wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change Theres a great scene early on in the film involving Josey Wales partner in crime Jaimie played by Sam Bottoms where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on Wales head Here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor Len Lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter Abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on Eastwoods alphamale killingmachine If youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior Probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate Yup you know the routine In the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon Sondra Locke see above photo Locke portrays Kansasborn settler Laura Lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty Comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos E   etcClints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made SJWs and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen She was giving her consent  Didnt you see it  It was in her eyes  Its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  Murderer Creeper Pussyblocker  Unfortunately just like today there were feminists and SJWs aplenty back in 1976 Their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mid1960s and after more than 50 years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey Uncle Bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah Ill get back to the film review now My favorite scene in the movie occurs when Josey Wales who now that I think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a Native American woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers Eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which Ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself I mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages Well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic Western film Maybe Im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film Clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it So this might have been a sly Hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but I dont really want to think that way about Clint so I wont Ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better I mean Clint played Dirty Harry Callahan for chrissakes in a film that I will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if I dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting 20 arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid SJWs who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media CEO or a billionaire The film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category If you havent seen it rectify that soon You cant miss by watching this topdrawer RPO film for men 2 Play Misty for Me 1971  Clint Eastwood Jessica Walter Donna Mills Unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in Hollywood any longer When you think of Clint Eastwood you usually think of Dirty Harry  or The Outlaw Josey Wales  or Unforgiven  or Gran Torino but Clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders In this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller Carmelbythesea disk jockey Dave Carver Clint Eastwood lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis Carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeerSJW moment there sorry That is until Jessica Walters psychostalker character Evelyn walks into his life Now you may have encountered a few of these yourself Or maybe its just me Sometimes I think I have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims If youre hot and insaneIm your guy But Clint Eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker From writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage Clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress Jessica Walters batshitcrazy Evelyn Ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves But I could be wrong about that I was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me Be that as it may Jessica Walters really brings her Agame in the role of the totally unhinged Evelyn If youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery Have you ever done thiswhat Clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so I definitely feel your pain And Ill bet Clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film Play Misty for Me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all I wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female And for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when Clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent RPO film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying By boycotting all modern SJW Hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots Always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on DVD And if you smell an SJW rat dont spend your money Its that simple In the end its just like investigating a potential LTR candidate You have to conduct your due diligence Otherwise you might just get taken for a ride
