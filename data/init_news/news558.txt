Email On Monday a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a Tshirt that referenced Hillary Clinton s comments about Trump supporters being deplorables to the polls Brett Mauthe 55 was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a proTrump hat and a shirt that read basket of deplorables According to KSAT 12 Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls However since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it Subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering KSAT 12 reports  Bulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details Instead he deferred to Comal Countys election coordinator Cynthia Jaqua Jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs Violations can be committed by voters as well It can mean a Tshirt a button a hat you know she said Anything related to the voting the party the candidate Jaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthes arrest Jaqua is quoted by My San Antonio  Its in the election code Electioneering is prohibited within a 100foot marker You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons Tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said Most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added Every election we have to advise people Even if its a school bond issue They wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump and when I asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels So according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician make reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day This is utterly ridiculous My question on all of that is what happened to free speech Is that recognized as a Godgiven right in the First Amendment I mean I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected Other voters agree with me I dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote Im kind of shocked because I think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for Jose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote Again I ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech Its not inflammatory It isnt a lie It isnt slander Whats illegal about it Ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that This is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose Mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media The reason Im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and I dont want to give you any comment he said  The charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor Dont forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook  Google Plus   Twitter  You can also get Freedom Outpost delivered to your Amazon Kindle device here  shares
