There is a principle of communication which is very well known and has been documented in a variety of different ways But it comes down to if you can make people afraid you can make them do anything McDermott said And these warmongers are fearmongers and they are creating as much fear in the American people as possibleLike Thornberry and numerous other hawks Graham and McCain are again expressing doubts about diplomacy Regardless of the outcome Irans threat to regional security and stability endures they said in a joint statement about the administrations framework for an agreement Any hope that a nuclear deal will lead Iran to abandon its decadesold pursuit of regional dominance through violence and terror is simply delusional The Obama Administrations failure to recognize and counter this threat has only served to expand Iranian influenceMcCain and Graham are hardly unique Pick just about any lawmaker who voted for the war in 2002 and they are likely to be making arguments of a similar tenor now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy argued strongly for a preemptive approach against Saddam saying then that the risks of the more diplomatic strategy were simply unacceptableThis month McConnell said in a statement To the detriment of international security  specifically regarding the security of the United States Israel and other allies as well as preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East  the Obama administration has always approached the goal of these negotiations as reaching the best deal that is acceptable to Iran rather than what should be our national goal ending Irans nuclear programOne Sen Chuck Schumer DNY asked in 2002 How long can we leave Hussein alone before we need to act and predicted the war would be somewhat easier than the previous Gulf war He has alarmed progressives by backing a bill that would require speedy congressional approval of any Iran agreement before any of the deal could go into effect Critics of the bill say it hinders chances for a final deal making military conflict more likelySchumer had nothing positive to say about the framework releasing only a short statement after it was announced that praised negotiators for working hard Their announcement deserves careful rigorous and deliberate analysis Ill be giving the framework a very careful look he said then later endorsed the review bill sponsored by Sen Bob Corker RTenn which is expected to be debated Tuesday in his Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeFor Jim McDermott who was pilloried when he was right its a case of deja vu all over again especially when he hears Sen Tom Cotton RArk suggest the United States could carry out a few days of bombing to take care of Iran or when one of the lead architects of the Iraq War former Vice President Dick Cheney says the Iran talks convince him that Obama is the worst president we ever hadThat kind of hyperbole is just over the top McDermott added referring to Cheneys charges that Obama was handing nuclear weapons to the premiere sponsor of state terrorism in the world as well as Cheneys charge that I cant think of a more terrible burden to leave the next president than what Obama is creating hereTheres just no basis for that kind of stuff at all except in the minds of somebody who wants to create the image of fear lurking outside the back door McDermott said And if we dont go out there and kill everybody in sight well then were going to have somebody break into our houseThey said We cant oppose you Youre going to attack us We know that We just know Well have to survive the initial attack but when you get on the ground then youll find out who has what power McDermott recalled Shock and awe  that worked for about 60 days and then we had 14 years of what we got now Fourteen going on 30
