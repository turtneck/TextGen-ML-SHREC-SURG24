The former Republican marijuanasmoking Everest mountaineering exgovernor of New Mexico and presidential nominee of the Libertarian party has a problem hes barred from the presidential debates To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15 from around 8 nowWithout that national exposure and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled ClintonTrump dustups are likely to produce its hard for anyone to see how Johnson 63 or either of two other minorparty candidates the Green partys Jill Stein or even Evan McMullin a 40yearold former CIA counterterrorism officer could ever become more than mere electoral curiositiesBut the emergence of three independent candidates during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look and in Las Vegas on Friday Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their casesSoftspoken and wearing Nikes Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism fiscal conservatism and noninterventionism in foreign affairs He argued at the gathering that in this the craziest election of all time he had a chance I might be the next president of the United StatesA justreleased WSJNBC poll gave Johnson 15 in the crucial swing state of Colorado and Stein 6 In Las Vegas he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any thirdparty candidate was somehow wastedA wasted vote is voting for somebody you dont believe in Thats a wasted vote Johnson said Vote for the person you believe in  thats how you bring about change I hope after having made my pitch today that youll realize if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump have at itStein who spoke separately at the event similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton whom she dubbed as the most disliked and untrusted majorparty nominees in US history Democracy needs a moral compass she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups Its not just about who you dont like the most or who you are most afraid of Stein who like Johnson represented her party in 2012 has outlined policy positions that include a Green New Deal focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100 renewable energy complete by 2030 Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agricultureOn the Republican side Evan McMullin a beneficiary of the grounded Never Trump movement failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before hed even sent out his first campaign release McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who he says has tapped into peoples darkest prejudices and deepest fearsMcMullins best hope  and likely his only one  to make an electoral dent would require Trumps departure from the race though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit Like millions of Americans I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who despite party differences could offer compelling visions of a better future McMullin said in his announcementInstead we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seekBut can they begin to make a difference Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence when in 1992 Texan businessman Ross Perot took 18 of the vote carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory Some Democrats blamed thirdparty candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000 but the thirdparty candidate won a paltry 274 of the vote and his supporters were split between Republicans and DemocratsJohnsons running mate former Massachusetts governor William Weld said hed seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trumps campaign has floundered Their campaign recently reported a 1m oneweek fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40000 people have pledged to donate at least 15 to his campaign on 15 AugustBut that was in a relatively tight race With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states the impact of any thirdparty candidate could be limitedAt the moment it doesnt look like they can have much impact at all said Hank Sheinkopf a veteran Democratic adviser But if the race gets closer they could throw it either waySheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want The longterm impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans he said As it now stands Stein Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidatesEarlier this month a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting Mike McCurry now cochair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton hinted that a third podium might be neededSome of our production people may have said Just in case you need to plan out what that might look like McCurry told Politico We wont know the number of invitations we extend until midSeptemberRon Faucheux president of Clarus Research Group a nonpartisan polling company said there was broad support for including even minor candidates Polls show that voters think third party candidates should be included he said and in an election like this where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other optionsBut even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects casting themselves as agents of change who at best could represent the beginning of a break with the current twoparty systemThe biggest message is consider us as a very very viable alternative to this twoparty system that has become so polarized that theyre not able to do anything Johnson has saidStein advanced a similar argument Were having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart she said and the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternativeShe argued that it was by elections about the lesser of two evils that the country inherited many of its problemsBut first the two have to get on TVTheres no way Im going to win the presidency if Im not in the presidential debates Johnson said I do believe anything is possible given that right now arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office
