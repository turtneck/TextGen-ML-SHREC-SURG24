Presidents often turn more moderate to make gains in their final years Think of Bill Clintons 1997 budget deal or George W Bushs 2007 failed immigration reform effort or Ronald Reagans 1986 tax reforms Second terms can feel like new presidenciesPresident Obamas increasingly successful second term has been the exception to that rule Its been a concentrated and arguably jaded version of his first term The candidate who was elected to bring the country together has found he can get more done if he acts alone  and if he lets Congress do the sameThat has been the big quiet surprise of Obamas second term Congress has become if anything more productive And that speaks to a broader lesson Obama has learned about polarization in Congress Since hes part of the problem ignoring Congress can be part of the solutionObamas diplomatic breakthroughs with Cuba and Iran call back to a controversial promise Obama made in the 2008 primary but seemed to abandon once he won the White House to negotiate with dictators with few or no preconditions This was among the biggest fights of the Democratic primary and the most radical promises of Obamas campaign  but it seemed almost completely forgotten in the first years of his presidencyObamas firstterm foreign policy was largely defined by George W Bushs wars Its only been in Obamas second term that the foreign policy philosophy he previewed in the 2008 campaign has really been visible  and where Obama has shown himself to be to the left of many in the Democratic PartyEven some congressional Democrats have balked at his negotiations with Cuba and Iran But not only is Congress largely irrelevant to these deals at least unless the opposition can overturn a presidential veto which theyalmost certainly cant but Obama doesnt have much pressing legislation before Congress which makes it safer for him to anger them In that way Obamas increasing distance from Congress has been a boon to his foreign policy effortsThe results will profoundly shape Obamas foreign policy legacy As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote Obama has reestablished productive diplomacy as the central task of a progressive foreign policy and as a viable alternative approach to dealing with countries the GOP foreign policy establishment would rather bomb He established a viable alternative to the liberal hawks that dominated Democratic thinking during the Bush years and held positions of influence on Hillary Clintons 2008 campaign And he developed a cadre of aides who can carry on that legacy to future Democratic administrations and keep a tradition of dovishness aliveBut its not just foreign policy where Obama has swung left When he ran for president in 2008 he opposed samesex marriage It wasnt until 2012 that he evolved on the issue But by 2015 he was embracing marriage equality as part of his legacy He even turned his home into a symbol of celebrationSimilarly Obama has sought to use executive action to achieve in his second term what Congress wouldnt permit in his first sweeping action on both immigration and climate changeIn some ways the immigration action is the most telling of the two Prior to his second term Obama had repeatedly told immigration advocates that he simply didnt have the power to stop deportations on a significant scale I am president he told Univision in 2010 I am not kingBut Obama eventually decided that the president had more power than he initially thought Similarly he is pushing strong regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plantsBoth efforts show a basic reality of Obamas second term Rather than working to find more compromise in Congress which would necessitate choosing different issues and agreeing to much more modest solutions Obama is sidestepping Congress with more aggressive more polarizing actions To put it another way hes prioritizing the liberal policy outcomes he promised in the 2008 campaign above the compromiseoriented political approach he promised in the 2008 campaignGiven Obamas actions you might expect Congress to have devolved into yet more partisan rancor and paralysis But over the past year the opposite has happened Democrats and Republicans shocked everyone by coming up witha fix to Medicares broken payments formula The Senate agreed ona replacement to No Child Left Behind There have been no government shutdowns or debt ceiling disasters And Republicans have even been willing to make some common ground with Obama on trade authorityEvidence of Congresss relative productivity can be found elsewhere too The Bipartisan Policy Center keeps up a Healthy Congress Index that tracks key metrics like substantive days in session amendments offered and bills reported out of committee Of late Congress is looking a whole lot healthierWhich in a way makes a twisted kind of sense Obama is a polarizing figure and his efforts to pass legislation were part of what was polarizing Congress Obama eventually realized he couldnt solve a problem that was created by his very presence And so hes more or less left Congress to do its own thing  particularly since Republicans won the Senate in 2014Now that theyve stopped arguing so much over Obama both sides in Congress have more time and more inclination to work with each other  and surprisingly to work with Obama on the rare occasions when theres an obvious common ground as proved true on trade authority The result is that even as Obamas second term has become more liberal the agenda hes actually pursuing with Congress has become more conservative  and more successful
