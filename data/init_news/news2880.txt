A couple of weeks ago in this space I pushed back against assertions by FiveThirtyEight numbercruncher Harry Enten that Gary Johnsons polls have been trending downwards indicating that voters may be moving away from thirdparty options Well today Enten is back with an interesting piece headlined Gary Johnson Isnt FadingWhile noting what we have been warning you about here for yearsthirdparty candidates typically see their crest of polling support halved by Election Day according to GallupEnten explains that Johnsons numbers have so far not followed this pattern In fact the Libertarian may have already weathered the most difficult part of the calendar Most thirdparty candidates didnt lose that much support between late summer and Election Day Enten writes Besides John Anderson in 1980 no candidate ended up finishing more than 3 percentage points below where they were polling in late August The average dropoff is about 2 percentage pointsSo how does Johnsons 9 percent stack up at this point in the campaign against other thirdparty candidates since World War II According to numbers compiled by Enten here fourth place behind Ross Perot in 1992 20 percent then finished at 19 George Wallace in 68 1714 and Anderson in 80 147 Hes just a tick above Perot in 96 88 behind which nobody comes close sorry Libertarians Because of his staying power FiveThirtyEight has adjusted its predictions for Johnsons final vote upward to 71 percentBut what about the debates I hear you ask Well while TeamGov and its supporters are touting this new Qunnipiac poll showing 62 percent of Americans think the Libertarian should be in next months televised showdown that and a glass of water will get you a drink As Enten notes Johnson may not be fading but hes also not particularly rising either and theres a whole lotta real estate between 9 and the required 15 percent The LP ticket did reach a new high this week in the Quinnipiac poll 10 percent up from 8 percent in June and tied previous highs in polls by NBC NewsSurvey Monkey 11 percent Rasmussen Reports 9 percent and ReutersIpsos 7 percent but at this advanced date ties go to the loserLooking for a glimmer of hope Heres one intriguing gap in the numerical record Of the Commission on Presidential Debates determinative Big Five polls in which Johnson has been averaging 10 percent instead of 9 none of them have produced results in the last three weeks Beginning any minute now we should have a much clearer idea whether the Libertarians are rising in the polls that actually matter
