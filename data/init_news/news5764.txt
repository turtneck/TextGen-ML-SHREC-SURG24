Email In Drowning in a Sea of Microwaves  the late geneticist Dr MaeWan Ho  a visionary voice who opposed GMOs  identified pollution from wireless technologies as a pressing issue of our times Noting evidence for DNA damage  cancers microwave sickness and impairment of fertility she concluded Evidence is emerging that the health hazards associated with wireless microwaves are at least comparable to if not worse than those associated with cigarette smoking Since the advent of radar followed by mobile phones and dense WiFi networks such anthropogenic radiation has skyrocketed Although it is nonionising and does not destabilise molecules directly evidence of other harm has been growing since 1950s studies on radar workers According to the updated Bioinitiative Report 2012 by 29 precautionary scientists effects on biology feature in several thousand peerreviewed papers Yet troubling new findings rarely filter into the media Or global Green discourse Though many studies have reported no significant effect research by University of Washington biology professor Henry Lai and others reveals that wirelessindustry funding is far more likely to yield such findings Toujours ils crent doubte they are forever creating doubt explains former Luxembourg Green MP Jean Huss whose research on the wireless industry inspired the Council of Europe to call for many precautions 2011 including protection of warning scientists and wired internet in schools But wirelessproduct marketing has a loud voice Few of us realise that genetic effects and free radical damage  both disease risks over time  are the most common cautionary findings Devicecrowded spaces such as our peak commuter trains or allwireless classrooms may be creating a subtly toxic environment Wideranging oxidative harm to animals has been found from WiFi sources And linked prediabetic and precancerous changes Groundbreaking work by biochemistry professor Martin Pall  Washington State University  winner of eight international awards  reveals a viable mechanism for such harm But as with other inconvenient truths it is going unheard Beewhispers the sensitivity of life on Earth Lifes exquisite electrophysiology is still being discovered Researchers at Bristol University reported in May that bees hairs are highly sensitive to flowers delicate EMFs In controlled trials in Switzerland bees reacted to mobilephone signals with highpitched piping a cue to desert a hive Other studies show that mitochondria  the tiny power houses in our cells are at risk from our new EMFs And that even DNA  in its delicate antennalike structure may be frequencysensitive The longterm ecological implications of our new anthropogenic radiation are not known But peerreviewed studies revealing harm to birds  tadpoles  trees  other plants  insects rodents and livestock  offer clues Biology professor Lukas Margaritis at Athens University for example uncovered harm to fruit flies from just a few minutes exposure to our everyday wireless devices including cordless phones Bluetooth and even digital baby monitors Reviewing research Indias Ministry of Environment and Forests warned that sensitive habitats may need some protection The UKs Digital Economy Bill  about to receive its final seal has sensible proposals for increasing countrywide access to fibre broadband a technology that does not in itself stoke microwave pollution though wireless addons do so But probe beyond the bill to Ofcoms 5G consultations and new EMF exposures emerge part of global trend The worldwide rush towards 5G or fifth generation wireless rollouts is set to raise our pulsing pollution to new levels Untested high microwave frequencies are being lined up to increase bandwidth automation and usage  at great profit to the industry These millimetre and centimetre waves though too weak to heat us may pose possible risks to our skin and deeper surface tissue including that of plants Highdensity transmitters are envisaged A troubling prospect for the many hundreds of patients seen by professor Dominique Belpomme s clinic in Paris patients whose disabling symptoms from wireless technologies are supported by new brain scans and blood tests  A delegation of scientists have petitioned for such electrosensitivity to be recognised as an environmentallyinduced illness  with an International Disease Code 2015 Riptides when profits outpace caution Pushing for fast rollouts the wireless industry is also in conflict with the Internatonal EMF Scientists Appeal to the United Nations Signed by 223 scientists from 41 nations it calls for remedial action  such as new safety limits wavefree zones and education of doctors  to protect our DNA fertility and nervous systems plus children and pregnant women from growing wireless exposure And from rising mainselectricity fields Signs that such caution may be needed are growing The pulsed polarized  microwaves used by wireless technologies pose more biological risks than smooth or natural waves Weak millimetre waves have a known potential to increase antibiotic resistance  what ecological effects might they risk perhaps if used universally Studies also reveal a risk to skin pain receptors  Published associations between radio  masts and skin cancers though at lower frequencies plus mobilephone masts and EMFsensitive cancers Adilza Dode Minas Gerais University 2013 raise further questions In his summer press conference Tom Wheeler  former head of the CTIA the vast telecoms lobby group and controversial chair of the Federal Communications Commission  proposed unbridled massive deployment of commercial 5G transmitters taking off in 2020 Anticipating tens of billions of dollars of economic growth with US telecoms first out of the gate he warned Stay out of the way of technological development Turning innovation loose is far preferable to expecting  regulators to define the future With no mention of healthtesting carbon costs or corporate responsibility the FCC voted unaminously to go ahead by releasing swathes of untested high frequencies for private sector exploitation  so setting a trend To questionable ends added to other issues how will our communities be affected by addiction to 5G multistream videos How will it impact our spiritual communion with Nature Many American health activists and cautioning scientists are aghast Dr Joel Moskowitz director of community health studies at the University of California warns precaution is warranted before 5G is unleashed on the world Former government physicist Dr Ron Powell points out the plans would irradiate everyone including the most vulnerable to harm from radiofrequency radiation pregnant women unborn children young childrenthe elderly the disabled and the chronically ill It would set a goal of irradiating all environments Fracking the air Faultlines in safety This drive to mine the electromagnetic spectrum comewhatmay has echoes of fracking and other headlong trends In Captured Agency  the Harvard ethics report on the FCC and the wider wireless industry Norm Alster exposes ruthless hardball tactics supported by armies of lawyers at expense to our health Microwaves Science and Lies 2014 filmed by Jean Hches across Europe exposes similar patterns that are driving our pulsed radiation to risky levels Western safety limits based only on high levels that heat tissue far exceed those of Russia  China and some other nations Professor Yuri Grigoriev  longserving chair of Russias nonionising radiation protection body RNCNIRP warned the UKs Radiation Research Trust ionising radiation is monitoredbut levels of nonionising radiation are constantly increasing and ubiquitous it is out of control  Urgent action is needed Stealthy pollutionraisers such as the 5G Internet of Things  with 30 billion tiny transmitters forecast for 2020  and also sadly wireless smartmeters  1  2  vetoed by the American Academy of Environmental Medicine  may run counter to a cherished Green goal that of nurturing healthy environments Can we manage our energy perhaps in more biosensitive ways Court claims for wirelessmeter health harm supported by medical testimonies  including by neurology professor Andrew Marino Louisiana  are sweeping America Professor Pall explains such meters high intensity microwave pulses may be more toxic than we realise We know from the nanosecond studies these can be very damaging Data obtained by a judge revealed allhour housepiercing pulses every few seconds New dataoverwiring innovations if free of dirty electricity may offer inspiring alternative ways forward Chrysalis a paradigm in waiting To create  in Wheelers phrase  a global 5G ecosystem of wireless supersaturated environments at insidious risk over time to living ecosystems not least our own bodies is dysfunctional And spiritually disturbing It suggests a mindset deeply at odds with the orchidlike beauty of the Earth But cleaner innovations such as LiFi  ecodectplus phones and the latest fibreoptics suggest a wiser course A new paradigm  safer connectivity plus more balanced use  is emerging And reminds of other stepchanges in awareness From pesticides to organic from smokefilled to smokefree We can accede if we wish to our rising planetary smog To safety limits as high as the moon in many scientists eyes And to wireless rollouts growing carbon costs Or taking pause we may begin to call the industry to account  plus governments lulled by it We may air helpful new findings such as risks from tabletlike exposures  Alexander Lerchl  Jacob Bremens University 2015 And stark risks from passive exposure bared by Leif Salford  medical professor at Lund University We may defend DNA if we wish from ionizing and published nonionizing risks  just as we defend our planet And alongside French Green Party MPs Laurence Abeille and Michle Rivasi  plus the interntional Baubiologie movement we can explore electromagnetic hygiene Uplifting possibilities for a safer cleaner world Lynne Wycherley is a nature poet with six published collections Working in parallel with pioneering doctors she has been investigating nonionising radiation for 5 years This article originally appeared in The Ecologist  More articles by Lynne Wycherley next
