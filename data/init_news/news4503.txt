We Are Change By David Armiak and Mary Bottari The Koch network has mobilized in South Dakota to defeat the  South Dakota Accountability and AntiCorruption Act  a statewide initiative on the ballot November 8The anticorruption measure Initiated Measure 22 or IM22 was launched by a bipartisan group called the South Dakotans for Integrity and put on the ballot with signatures from over 20000 state residentsIM22 cracks down on dark money and phony industry front groups by barring candidate coordination with outside groups and regulating independent expenditures It cracks down on sham issue ads which are really the functional equivalent of express advocacy by requiring them to be reported electronically within 48 hours requiring donor disclosure and requiring the top five donors to be disclosed on air The initiative also provides a small dollar public financing mechanism sets rules for lobbyists and gifts and creates an ethics commission to investigate violations of ethics and campaign finance rulesThe measure is one of four on ballot nationwide that seek to increase transparency in the financing of elections in a postCitizens United world In 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v FEC to strike down limits on independent political spending which opened the floodgates for billions in dark money into elections nationwideIf passed South Dakota voters may finally have some way of knowing who is bankrolling those big money ads and before the election tooKochs Americans for Prosperity Behind Defeat 22 Group The Kochs are bankrolling the group working to defeat the initiativeAccording to its statement of organization filing  Defeat22com was founded by Ben Lee the state director for the Kochs astroturf group Americans for Prosperity  on July 1 2016 The group promotes itself as a coalition listing its 18 partners on its website including AFP the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce  Industry and the different GOP organizations among others But a campaign disclosure filed on Friday with the South Dakota Secretary of State tells another storyOf the 609110 raised by Defeat22com so far 590000 came from AFP The next largest contribution of 1500 from the SD Farm Bureau Federation was even dwarfed by AFPs total inkind contributions of 36756 The opposition to IM22 is led and organized by AFP Chad Krier AFPs South Dakota Field Director who has organized many of the campaign events to answer questions and solicit volunteers AFP also appears to have tapped into its staff network to not only phone bank but also go door to door to urge voters to Vote No on IM22 Defeat22com has send out mailings  placed radio ads  and put up billboards The Kochs are battling the measure because the Kochs see IM22 as a threat to the dominance the millionaires and billionaires have under the current political system says former Republican State Senator and cochair of South Dakotans for Integrity Don Frankenfeld The Kochs have been battling weaker donor disclosure laws in California in court for yearsAnd Koch allies in other states are lending a handA rightwing Floridan think tank has been helping out the Defeat IM22 forces The Foundation for Government Accountability FGA has set up an educational website Measure22org  where it published poll results from 478 South Dakotans that demonstrates opposition to the measure in the state The website operates under the name FGA Action Inc a 501c04 that shares an address with FGA and lists its contact as Jonathan Bechtle  the COO and General Counsel at FGAThe site also hosts two videos which are unsupportive of the measure one produced by FGA Action Inc and another by UnitedforPrivacycom UnitedforPrivacycom is the website for People United for Privacy an SPN backed group that states  To change our laws to subject people to the chilling effects of having their privacy invaded and their personal information compiled in government databases and Google searches is not they way our democracy should operateFGA is a member of the State Policy Network SPN  a rightwing web of think tanks in 48 states which has been working hard to convince the public that the free speech rights of millionaires and billionaires are harmed by campaign finance disclosure laws Both SPN and FGA are largely funded by the Donors Capital and Donors Trust investment vehicles utilized by the Koch networkThe amount of money spent by FGA Action Inc and People United for Privacy against IM22 is unknown because both groups have yet to file disclosuresThe Kochs Protest Taxpayer Funded Elections The Kochs are attacking the anticorruption measure for its creation of a small dollar publicly funded campaign finance system which will give each registered voter two 50 vouchers that she can contribute to the candidate of her choosing if the candidate agrees to only fundraise from small donor South Dakotans AFP argues in its Defeat22com radio ad and mailings that this system will divert public tax dollars from roads and schoolsan interesting line of attack from the antigovernment Kochs which have opposed taxes for roads in states like WisconsinIn state the Kochs protest taxpayer funded elections Dont let politicians take your tax dollars to fund their campaigns is the Koch spin Their preference is to put millionaires and billionaires in charge of campaigns and electionsNationally Ben Lee is taking a different approach In a recent opinion piece in Forbes  Lee trots out the Koch line that the ballot measure is a fullon assault on the First Amendment cloaked in the guise of transparency The Kochs might believe that their right to bankroll politicians secretly is written into the constitution but super majorities of average citizensboth Democrats and Republicandisagree and the popularity of campaign finance transparency and limits continues to rise The widespread support for IM22 is best demonstrated by South Dakotans for Integritys financial disclosure submitted on Friday with attachments that list over 6000 donations for a total of over 12 million More than 99 of contributions were for 100 or less The good government advocacy organization Represent Us provided 55079 in inkind contributions to South Dakotans for IntegrityIf IM22 passes on November it will put the brakes on secret political spending by AFP the Kochs and others pulling the strings in South Dakota But more significantly if the law succeeds in setting up a campaign finance system that is more responsive to all citizens not just the wealthy it could become a model for other states to followAnd this is precisely what the Kochs fearTwo other two ballot measures promoting transparency and clean elections are Proposition 59 in California and Amendment 2 in Missouri Source PR Center
