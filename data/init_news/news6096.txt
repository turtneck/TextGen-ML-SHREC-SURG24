By Lasha Darkmoon on November 1 2016 Tom Leonard  Darkmoonme Oct 31 2016 with pictures captions and comments by Lasha Darkmoon Hillary Clinton faced an upset in her run for the White House two days ago after the FBI announced a fresh probe into her emails Investigators will examine new messages to see whether she sent classified information on a private server Just ten days before Americans go to the polls the Democrat candidates bid to become the first woman US president may be derailed if it is decided she should face criminal charges I AM INNOCENT Recent Polls suggest Mrs Clinton will trounce Republican rival Donald Trump who has been struggling to fight allegations about groping women But Mrs Clinton will now be forced on the defensive herself in the final days of their vicious election battle LD  The latest news is that Hillarys 12point lead has been  wiped out  within the last 24 hours with Hillary now just one point ahead of Trump This could of course change at any moment with rapid fluctuations depending on the volatility of the situation FBI director James Comey had recommended earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges over emails sent by Mrs Clinton when she was secretary of state under Barack Obama But he said recent developments had prompted him to take another look The agency has obtained new emails from an unrelated case that appear pertinent to the investigation said Mr Comey A jubilant Mr Trump hailed the dramatic development of a reopened investigation as bigger than Watergate a reference to the corruption scandal that brought down Richard Nixon Bigger than Watergate The controversy has weighed heavily on the campaign challenging Mrs Clintons key contention that  unlike her opponent  she would be a safe pair of hands in the White House Mr Comey announced in July that the FBIs 12month investigation into Mrs Clintons controversial email traffic while secretary of state was over She was criticised for using a private email server rather than the official system to transmit classified information but escaped prosecution In a harshlyworded criticism of her extreme carelessness and gross negligence Mr Comey said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her poorlyprotected account He also flatly contradicted various Clinton claims although  in explaining why he had not recommended prosecuting her  he accepted there was no evidence she had intentionally jeopardised state secrets The scandal has been brandished by Republicans as evidence of Mrs Clintons dishonesty and incompetence Mr Comey informed Congress by letter that his agency had obtained new emails They will be reviewed to see if they are significant and if new action against Mrs Clinton is required Mr Comey did not give a timeframe for how long this investigation will take The original FBI probe found that of 30000 emails Mrs Clinton handed over to the State Department 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them However another 33000 emails went missing They were presumed to have been permanently deleted but newly released FBI notes suggested they still exist in several locations and could be recovered It is unclear whether any of these are involved in the new FBI inquiry Law enforcement officials said the newly discovered emails were taken from the electronic devices of senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her disgraced husband Anthony Weiner during an investigation in the latters sexting of girls Anthony Weiner Huma Abedin Click to

husbands sleazy sexual activities she was forced to divorce him This was in August 2016 The unlikely couple had been married for just over six years As for Huma her relationship with Hillary Clinton has been an extraordinarily close one for almost 20 years so much so that there have been sensational rumors of a lesbian liaison  The view for popular consumption is that Hillary is Humas mentor and mother figure Hillary once compared Huma to her own daughter Chelsea I have one daughter she said But if I had a second daughter it would be Huma Humas real mother noting that Hillary had now replaced her in her daughters affections once told Hillary jokingly Im jealous of you See here  John Lennons widow Yoko Ono  pictured  claims to have had a lesbian affair with Hillary in the 1970s We met many

corruption is on a scale weve never seen before We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office Mr Trump had previously criticised the FBI and Department of Justice for not bringing charges against his election opponent His running mate Mike Pence called on the FBI to immediately release all the emails pertinent to the investigation adding The American people have a right to know The Republican vice presidential candidate told a rally in Pennsylvania that he and Donald Trump commend the FBI for having the courage to reopen the case Chants of Lock her up came even before Mr
