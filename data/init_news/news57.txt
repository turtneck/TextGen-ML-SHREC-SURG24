Political parties choose their presidential nominees But with more Americans opting out of parties is the process representative of what America wants The New York primary  and others ahead  offer insightsHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueDemocratic presidential candidate Sen Bernie Sanders speaks to supporter Michael Cantalupo while taking a walk in New Yorks Times Square Tuesday Mr Cantalupo said he is unable to vote in the New York primariesDenise Guardascione a waitress for nearly three decades at the Shalimar Diner in Queens thinks the New York primary process was riggedShes a vocal supporter of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump but as a registered Democrat Ms Guardascione missed the deadline to switch her registration to become a Republican  which shocking to her was more than six months agoAnd now the independentminded waitress has become bewildered by what seems to be the complicated backroom system of electing party delegates both in her own state and across the countryIts antiquated it belongs in the Smithsonian next to Archie Bunkers chair says Ms Guardascione a Queens native who works six days a week slinging eggs and coffee for this wellknown political haunt Its just for the expletive bigwigs and muckety mucks not us not the people who just want to voteIn truth presidential primaries have never been more open Since 1972 primaries have gone from being the province of party bosses to vibrant voterdriven contests But in this year of populist revolt in both parties more open looks to many voters like still pretty antiquatedThat is by design Parties after all are not democratic They can choose their nominees in whichever way they think is best But at a time when Democrats and Republicans are a shrinking share of the population closed primaries are shutting more and more of America outThe irony is that America is no less partisan Research suggests the growing ranks of independents are just as partisan as the parties These voters have just abandoned parties because they are ashamed by how the parties actThe anger over closed primaries superdelegates and convention arcana isnt likely to help Nor are allegations of irregularities in the New York primary On Thursday the states Elections Board suspended the top official in charge of Brooklyn after numerous allegations the most serious of which is that 125000 Democratic voters were incorrectly purged from the rolls before polls openedThe question is whether the spotlight of this election could force further change ahead both in states and in the nationNew York and other states have long given power to the parties and to the establishment says Jeanne Zaino a political scientist at Iona College in New Rochelle NY But who has higher voting turnout States that have early voting states that have mail in ballots and same day registration We in New York allow none of that This was not just a closed primary this was an ultraclosed primary Whether youre running for office or voting you had to be on top of your game to be a part of itThe knock against closed primaries in this election season has been that they hurt insurgent candidates like Trump and Bernie Sanders But the picture isnt so simpleYes Senator Sanders of Vermont has done much better among independents But his biggest wins  in Hawaii Alaska and Washington state  all came in closed primaries or caucusesTrump meanwhile has in many cases actually done better among Republicans than independentsWhat is clear is that the primary rules disenfranchise those who most dislike the parties So why is Sanders doing so well among independents asks Dan Hopkins of the FiveThirtyEight data journalism website It appears to be driven not by their ideology so much as their dislike of partisan politicsIn one respect that makes sense Why would parties give vote to someone who doesnt like themYet those people are a growing share of the American electorate Some 39 percent Americans now identify as independents 32 percent say theyre Democrats and 23 percent say theyre Republicans according to a Pew Research Center survey last yearIn 2000 29 percent were independents 33 percent were Democrats and 28 percent were Republicans Pew foundIn Tuesdays closed primary three million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary Sanders said Thats wrongIt almost certainly hurt Sanders In Michigan for example Hillary Clinton won the Democratic vote by 58 to 40 percent  similar to the 58 to 42 percent margin in New York But since Michigan was an open primary where independents could vote Sanders won the state by taking 71 percent of independent votersEight of the 16 remaining primary contests  including Pennsylvania New Jersey and Maryland  are closed contestsSanders and his supporters have also complained about the fact that 15 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention  712 out of 4763  are party leaders known as superdelegates who overwhelmingly support Mrs ClintonIn short the deck is stacked against Sanders And intentionally soSanders isnt a Democrat hes an independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist It is not illogical that Democratic primaries should favor an actual DemocratThe same is true in different ways for Trump The GOP frontrunner won a solid victory in New York But hes getting little help from the establishment in navigating the complex delegate rules  rules that he says are rigged Meanwhile the wellorganized campaign of Sen Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him in Louisiana and swept Colorados state convention contestPresidents have always gone through a complex multilayered processes in which voters local officials and party leaders each have their role scholars say Party leaders should have no small say in choosing their partys presidential nominee the thinking goesBut even within the parties there is some restlessness for change Closed primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance said Charles Schumer D of New York now the No 2 Democrat in the Senate to The New York Times in 2014As Americas political balance increasingly settles outside either of the two parties 2016 is showing how even a more open system can be warpedAnd if part of that story is about disenfranchisement it is about these younger voters people who are new to the process or who disengaged from it and didnt register or registered as independent and couldnt vote says Professor ZainoYoure talking about Sanders supporters who are going to be on the losing end of that
