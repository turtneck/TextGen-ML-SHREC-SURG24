The younger Trump swears his foundation gives all of its money away to good causes Which is true if you dont count the cash spent on Trumpowned resorts Or the plastic surgeonThose are some of the beneficiaries of the Eric Trump Foundation an eponymous public charity headed by the Republican presidential nominees thirdborn Though Eric Trumpthe executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the Trump Organization and one of his fathers top surrogates and closest political advisersrecently claimed his father had donated hundreds of thousands to his charity the only available evidence seems to suggest payments in fact went the other way the Eric Trump Foundation ETF paying hundreds of thousands over the last 10 years to host lavish fundraising events atDonald Trumps golf coursesIn promotional videos and press releases ETF touts a 95 to 100 percent donation ratio and implies that by benefit of being a Trump namesake properties are handed over for charity events at little or no cost But according to a Daily Beast analysis of annual IRS reports and New York state financial disclosures from the charitys inception in 2007 to 2014 the most recent year for which data is available ETF spent 881779 on its annual Golf Invitational at Trumpowned clubs a portion of which100000 in 2013 and 88000 in 2014was reported as paid directly to a company of a family member of the Board of Directors In other words Donald Trump himselfDonald Trump and his private foundation are already in hot water as reports swirl of suspected selfdealing or using his foundation funds for private gain Indeed the man who considers a presidential run as an opportunity to turn a profit made headlines and invited criticism this week after The Washington Post revealed that the selfprofessed billionaire had reportedly used monies from the Donald J Trump Foundation to pay off 258000 in legal disputes Previous reports found Donald Trump had also used the fundwhich he hasnt personally donated to since 2008to purchase portraits of himself and gift 25000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in a possible quid pro quo to head off an investigation into his shady Trump University both of which may have violated federal and state tax laws New Yorks attorney general is currently investigating the reportsOf course viewed through the prism of his fathers questionable philanthropic practices Eric Trumps foundation seems downright angelic Eric Trumps foundation operates with almost no overhead Eric neither pays himself nor his board members and relies on Trump Organization employees who volunteer for whatever the foundation may need Most importantly Eric Trumps charity has over the last 10 years according to its tax reports raised 65 million for St Jude Childrens Research Hospital a beloved Tennesseebased nonprofit that treats children with catastrophic diseases freeofcharge That figure nearly doubles when you include the yearlong fundraisers utilizing Trump hotelswhere guests are encouraged to donate and buy special services a percentage of which goes to St Judeand employees who both contribute their money and volunteer their time by competing in companywide contests and organizing events like car washes bake sales and walkathons to raise cash that goes straight to the hospitalover 600000 this past year according to ETFs executive director Paige ScardigliWe pride ourselves on having an extremely low expense ratio and that is only made possible by leveraging off the Trump assets Scardigli wrote in an email to The Daily Beast Trump assets are not profiting from these ETF events but instead they are donating their time and resources to the causeWere so lucky as Trumps to have the best hotels in the world to have the best golf courses in the world and other great assets and were so lucky to be able to use those assets at our disposal for a great purpose And thats really what ETF is Eric says in a 2016 videoIt sounds like they were just making a number up said Elizabeth Keating a Boston University professor who studies nonprofit finance They should have had a proposal that said These are the costs for which there should be an invoice detailing what the foundation was paying for Instead it sounds like the golf course just said Give us 100000Scardigli took the reins as ETFs director in January replacing a woman who left the organization after eight months And hers wasnt the only highlevel dropout this year The foundations Board of Directors and Executive Committee have each lost a member since March Jeffrey Lichtenberg a freelance realestate broker and consultant with a history of bid rigging on construction projects and Nathan Crisp until recently a Trump Hotels executive who police accused of twice slamming a Brooklyn mother to the ground on EasterWhen asked why the Trump Organization didnt donate the use of the courses Michael Cohen a longtime attorney to Donald Trump and board member on the Eric Trump foundation said I believe there are certain rules that you do have to pay for certain thingstheyre not marked up Its inexpensive I think theres some law that says you have toTrump National Golf Club Westchester where ETFs annual event is held did not return a request for event pricing but charities which have held fundraisers at Trump clubs showed similar expenses and revenue in their tax reports known as 990s suggesting Eric Trump indeed paid a standard ratearound 100000for use of his fathers property Tic Toc Stop a charity dedicated to funding Tourette Syndrome research paid 51700 for a smaller golf outing in 2014 And according to The Boston Globe the DanaFarber Cancer Institutewhich has held its annual gala at Trumps Florida club MaraLago for the last six yearspaid around 150000 for a fundraiser with up to 600 guests The most recent ETF fundraiser boasted 500 attendeesThough the Eric Trump Foundations website says We exclusively support St Jude Childrens Research Hospital that isnt the case In 2012 ETF began donating in earnest to other causes cutting small checks to 40 individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the childrens hospital Some of these small donationslike the 1600 to the American Society for Enology and Viticulture a California wine industry organization where Eric Trump once gave a keynote addresshave seemingly little to do with the charitys mission of helping sick childrenThe cats cradle of connections dont end there The GSM fund paid out 43231 that same year for their golf tournamentan annual event held at Trumps Hudson Valley course that cost nearly double what the charity gave out in grants that year They along with at least six other charities that have received donations from the Eric Trump Foundation since 2012 hold fundraising events at Trump golf clubs
