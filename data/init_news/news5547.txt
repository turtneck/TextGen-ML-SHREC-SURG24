Washington CNN Donald Trump finally admitted Friday that President Barack Obama was born in the United States reversing himself on the issue that propelled him into national politics five years agoTrump sought to end his longstanding attempt to discredit the nations first AfricanAmerican president with just a few sentences tacked on at the end as he unveiled his new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in WashingtonBut the issue isnt likely to die down any time soon  especially as Trump continues to falsely blame Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for starting the birtherism controversy Clinton said earlier Friday that Trumps acknowledgment of Obamas birthplace doesnt go far enough and that he must also apologizeFor five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president Clinton said at an event in Washington His campaign was founded on this outrageous lieObama was born in Hawaii in 1961Trump offered no apologies for his leading role in the birther movement and didnt explain what drove him to change his mind The President dismissed Trumps criticism Friday joking with reporters at the White House and saying I was pretty confident about where I was bornSpeaking at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia Friday First Lady Michelle Obama addressed the controversy head onThere were those who questioned and continue to question for the past eight years up through this very day whether my husband was even born in this country she said Well during his time in office I think Barack has answered those questions with the example he set by going high when they lowThe birtherism controversy exploded the previous night when Trump said in an interview with The Washington Post that he still wasnt prepared to acknowledge Obamas birthplace Within a few hours the campaign released a statement  attributed to his spokesman  that said Trump now believes Obama was born in the United StatesTrump finally said the words out loud Friday morningPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States Period Trump said ignoring reporters questions despite earlier indications he would hold a press conference Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great againThe developments over the past day were steeped in political motivations With 53 days before the presidential election Trump is moving into a margin of error race with Clinton and trying to broaden his appeal while maintaining his grip on the GOP base Trump has tried to improve his dismal standing among minority voters and moderate Republicans in recent weeks many of whom see birtherism as racially motivated and an insult to ObamaHe is also aiming to take the issue of Obamas birthplace and legitimacy off the table by the time of the crucial debate with Clinton September 26Trump has declined other opportunities during the past two weeks to refute his original birtherismWhen local Philadelphia TV station WPVI asked Trump on September 2 about his past statements Trump replied I dont talk about it anymore I told you I dont talk about it anymoreHe repeated the same line when asked about it during a gaggle with reporters aboard his plane last weekAnd in an interview with Fox News Bill OReilly last week Trump again said I dont bother talking about itTrumps extraordinary attempt to prove Obama was not a naturalborn US citizen and was therefore not qualified to be president started on the conservative fringe but gathered momentum and became a major issue The White House initially tried to ignore the birtherism movement as the work of conspiracy theorists but Trumps huge media profile propelled the issue through conservative media and it eventually gained tractionThe saga only ended in a surreal and extraordinary moment in American politics when the sitting President went to the White House briefing room in April 2011 and produced his longform birth certificateWere not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers Obama said at the time in a clear reference to TrumpIn his statement Thursday night Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Mr Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raisedHe was referring to a controversy from the 2008 Democratic primary fight between Obama and Clinton In a March 2008 interview with 60 Minutes Clinton said she took thenSen Obamas word that he was not a Muslim but when pressed if she believed he was she replied No No there is nothing to base that on  as far as I knowClinton however was not questioning Obamas birthplaceClinton slammed Trumps comments to the Post while speaking at a Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute event in Washington Thursday saying he needs to stop his ugliness and bigotryHe was asked one more time Where was President Obama born And he still wouldnt say Hawaii He still wouldnt say America This man wants to be our next president When will he stop this ugliness this bigotry she said This is the best he can do This is who he is And so we need to decide who we areClintons campaign later tweeted President Obamas successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement PeriodTrumps embrace of the birther controversy seemed outlandish when it began In retrospect it looks like a template for the factchallenged approach he has adopted in his presidential campaignAfter Obamas news conference the realestate developer claimed credit for getting the President to produce evidence of his birthplaceToday Im very proud of myself because Ive accomplished something that nobody else was able to accomplish Trump said in New Hampshire after Obamas news conferenceIn subsequent years Obama poked fun at the birtherism controversy and used it to ridicule Trump most memorably in a savage takedown at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011Now I know that hes taken some flak lately but no one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald Obama saidAnd thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter  like did we fake the moon landing What really happened in Roswell And where are Biggie and Tupac
