CNN The 2016 election is setting new lows for presidential transparency in the modern eraHillary Clinton is under fire for waiting until she nearly collapsed at a public event Sunday to disclose she was diagnosed Friday with pneumonia She hasnt provided a full accounting of her health though Donald Trump has revealed far less The Republican nominee is departing with decades of tradition by not releasing his tax returns which could provide key details about his investments and financial interests And both candidates have declined traveling with a protective pool of reporters that follow them to provide continuous coverage of their activitiesOn Monday night transparency questions surfaced again as PBS interviewer Charlie Rose grilled former President Bill Clinton about his familys foundationIn other words Trump and Clinton have less than two months to close the sale but most voters arent sure exactly what theyre buyingFew candidates relish throwing open their most intimate health and financial secrets But the issue is particularly acute this year given Trumps decades of business dealings And of course Trump 70 and Clinton 68 would be the oldest and second oldest presidents inaugurated for a first term in a job that comes with intense physical and mental demands  making their health a highly relevant issueIts just the kind of thing that if it happens to you and youre a busy active person you keep moving forward she said I think its fair to say Anderson that people know more about me than almost anyone in public life Theyve got 40 years of my tax returns tens of thousands of emails a detailed medical letter report all kinds of personal detailsTrump has said he will soon release details of a physical exam he underwent last week In an interview Monday with CNNs Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence said both candidates should release detailed medical informationTrumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway fought back against the allegations Tuesday that Trumps campaign shared Clintons lack of transparencyAs far as I can see there are two major party candidates running for president and only one of them has pneumonia and lied about it especially to the press because she always treats you all like second class citizens Conway told CNNs Alisyn Camerota on New DayPeople have a right to knowPeople are vying for the highest office in the land the Indiana governor said People have a right to knowBut when it comes to taxes Pence said Trump wasnt violating any laws by withholding the data though he acknowledged theres a bit of a tradition hereTrump has said he would release his returns once the Internal Revenue Service completes an audit When pressed why Trump would not release topline information about previous returns now  which would not interfere with the audit process  Pence told Blitzer the Republican nominee would release his returns in totality and not parse them out piece by pieceStill the Clinton campaign is already trying to use her weekend misfortune to increase pressure on TrumpWe know more about Hillary Clinton in than any presidential candidate in history  we know almost nothing about Donald Trump and he has got to come forward Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNNs Jake TapperI hope that there will be an even standard applied to getting them both to release sufficient information not just on health but obviously we have the ongoing issue on taxes too Kaine said in OhioPoliticians have long tried to shroud themselves in secrecy to varying degreesYou have had candidates that have been a little close to the vest before  many of them if not all of them having something they would rather not talk about said Bruce Buchanan a presidential historian at the University of Texas at AustinBut this year threatens to set unprecedented levels for the lack of disclosure Buchanan said because the election matches up two candidates who have reputations in that veinPresidential candidates have not always been under such a spotlightAfter all President Franklin Roosevelt took extensive  and successful  measures to hide his paralysis during his 1932 election campaign and subsequent presidency President John Kennedy despite a conjuring a mythology of youth and vitality was one of the most unhealthy presidents ever to hold the office  but his multiple ailments were not common knowledge at the timeClintons case appears to have little in common with those two Democratic presidents  and pneumonia is a fairly common complaint that should not impair her capacity to serve as PresidentBut her wobbly exit from a ceremony Sunday commemorating the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attack in New York created a sudden political storm for two reasonsFirst the episode and video of Clinton staggering into her van played into conservative conspiracy theories that she is hiding some kind of secret illness since sustaining a concussion while secretary of state and is not fit to serve  a narrative without evidence that is often trumpeted by her opponent and his surrogatesThen the length of time it took for her campaign to say what is wrong  with journalists in the dark about where she was  fostered the idea that something was being covered upIts not health itself that is the problem she has to deal with CNN senior political analyst David Axelrod said on Monday By allowing that sixhour gap they created this sense that they were trying to put one over on people and that is not helpful to her candidacyThe incident also played out as the Clinton campaign has spent months rebutting arguments against the Clinton Foundation which Republicans have argued was a conduit for access to Hillary Clintons State Department In the Monday interview with Rose Bill Clinton insisted we have been as transparent as we can be when it comes to the foundationWeve been more transparent than any other foundation  more transparent than any other foundation has been asked to be and certainly more transparent than anybody else in this line of work he saidTransparency is often uncomfortable for candidatesBut at the same time people who run for President are assuming the ultimate public trust  the Presidency of the United States a position for which good health and a freedom from conflicts of financial interest are desirable if not essential So any unwillingness to comply with what have become political norms for disclosure risks reflecting badly on a candidates characterClintons campaign promised to do better going forward  and is planning to offer more details about her health later this weekIn political terms she now has little choiceIf they keep trying to hide and obfuscate her real condition it is going to be a big albatross all the way to election day said Douglas Brinkley a historian at Rice University on CNNs At This Hour with Berman and BolduanFor her part Clintons physician did issue a health statement last year certifying that she was fit to serve as President Trump has offered no such information His only health disclosure was a note from his doctor saying his health was astonishingly excellent and that he would be the healthiest person ever elected presidentNeither candidate has approached the level of disclosure that another senior citizen candidate  John McCain  offered in 2008 when the cancer survivor invited select reporters to view over 1000 pages of health recordsEven if Trump offers more health details he still risks setting an unprecedented example on financial disclosure for future candidates The billionaire has steadfastly refused to match Clinton  and previous presidential nominees  by releasing years of tax returnsNobody cares about itNobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media Nobody cares about it Trump said in a Fox News interview earlier this monthTrump has made his record in building a global business a pillar of his argument that he would be able to turn the economy around as President Yet he has refused to publish tax returns that would allow voters to make their own assessment of his financial health or claims about his incomeSuch disclosures would also permit voters and reporters to view Trumps charitable giving which he has said has been substantial without providing evidenceTrump did comply with election laws in May requiring candidates to release a financial statement which claims a net worth of 10 billion and business interests all over the world Trump also lists 16 liabilities for which he owes at least 315 million according to the statementBut the information does not offer details on the source of Trumps annual income  information that would more typically be available on a tax return Thats important for voters to size up whether Trump would face conflicts of interest as President given his vast businesses interests around the globe Critics have suggested that Trump could be compromised as President if he has heavy exposure to US adversaries like China and RussiaIts also possible that Trumps returns show he paid a very low tax rate if his income comes mainly from capital gains or can be written off against property investments  a factor that could be politically embarrassing
