After the past disastrous week he cant win But hes already made all of us losers and weve been accessories to his crimesThe selfimposed carnage will mean almost nothing to Trump loyalists But with 36 days left the clock has run out for real estate magnate andwithout a meaningful field organization and with an undisciplined national communications apparatusthere is simply no way for him to build and grow the kind of broadbased coalition necessary to topple Hillary Clintons current polling lead Between now and Election Day the gap is too large there are too many yards left to run the football and the real estate developer just dipped his hands in cementWithout question Trump would have been the most disastrous American president of the modern era Some very real damage however has already been doneto what is deemed acceptable in our discourse to the way in which we determine the longterm viability of candidates and to the fundamental spirit of fair playand there is no turning backThere is more than enough culpability to go aroundincluding a broad swath of GOP primary voters journalists who partook in false equivalences in the name of clicks and ratings and even the RNC honchos who refused to deploy legal mechanisms stop him Of course there is also the broader society which bought into the fable of his business acumen tuning in for his weekly reality show on NBC and handed him a trough laden with celebrity Together one and all we made himThere will almost certainly be social and political consequences of Trumps monthslong verbal carpet bombing campaign Notwithstanding heroic acts of journalism the socalled balanced egalitarian approach to election coverage has been dominated and fraught with dishonest political brokers Beyond an emboldened more virulently bigoted strain of ethnonationalists win or lose Trump and his band of surrogates have fundamentally changed the rules of fair playBeating out more than a dozen primary opponents while lobbing bigoted remarks at Muslims Hispanics and women a promised pivot never came to fruition The fact that he was not forced to suspend his campaign after making racist remarks about a federal judge says as much about us as it does about Trump With our tacit approval he moved on to vicious stereotypes about African Americans and refused to apologize for his attempt to delegitimize the nations first black president In fact he said we should thank him for telling the truth and forcing President Obama to produce his longform birth certificate Instead of issuing a mea culpa Trump falsely blamed Clintons 2008 campaign team for initiating the controversy and promptly patted himself on the back for putting the issue to bedExcept Trump never walked away from birtherism He continued to claim the document was fraudulent and even posited that the health official who signed it might have been murdered On two occasions he has risen to the podium and suggested circumstances under which his opponent might be shotFor any other candidate in any other year just one of those things would have been enough But Trump knows it isnt Shes nasty but I can be nastier than she ever can be he boasted in an interview with the TimesHe knows that he and some of his most prominent surrogatesChris Christie Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrichcan keep blowing the whistle changing the rules midplay They all but blamed Americans for paying their fair share of taxes and honoring their contractual obligations Trump in the words of former New York mayor Giuliani was a genius for using the net operating loss carryforward deductionan obscure loophole unavailable to most working Americansto cure future tax debt for nearly two decadesSo what if he filed multiple bankruptcies refused to pay small businesses after they rendered services to his companies and cost tens of thousands of people their jobs It was all fair and legal according to Trump So what if he is an admitted serial adulterer who wont spare a breath before spitting out misogynist hypersexualized comments about women Everybody cheats at least according to Giuliani and the women deserved it right So what if it turns out to be true that Trump didnt pay a dime in federal or state taxes over the span of 18 yearsleaving police officers school teachers veterans and others out in the wash That makes him smart rightOnce upon a time allegations of fraud draft dodging flagrant philandering and selfdealing not to mention public verbal assaults against a litany of people would have been immediate disqualifiers A selfprofessed billionaire who paid no taxes for even one year would have been laughed off the stage Candidates have surely dropped out over less The torrent of bad press wouldve been enough to send any other selfrespecting candidate for the hills Within hours the candidate and his spouse wouldve been standing tearfully before a flag draped podium proclaiming their allegiance to their country and vowing to continue the fight as private citizens for the public goodNever in the history of American politics has a major party nominee made such a mockery of the process But the game changed the moment GOP voters cast their lot with a onetime reality show personality with no public policy experience little in the way of intellectual curiously and no guiding values It changed the moment sitting GOP members of Congress refused to call foul on some of his most egregious remarks If you believe in nothing nothing is truly out of bounds and for Trump apologies are an admission of defeatTo the extent that Trump and an almost laissezfaire media class has begun to normalize various brand of racism bigotry and misogyny it is truly a reflection on all of us He needed willing participants and unfortunately he found them Not only among the altright and white supremacists he also found them in the halls of cable news networks with people incapable or unwilling to challenge his nonsensical rants and stop booking surrogates who flat out lie
