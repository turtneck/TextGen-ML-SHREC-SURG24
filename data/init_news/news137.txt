around This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it  But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country  the middle class is dying  poverty is exploding  millions of children in America dont have enough food  and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet  Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion So is Donald Trump the man for the hour If you would like to read his full economic plan you can find it on his official campaign website  His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression Last weeks GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 12 in the second quarter and 12 over the last year Its the weakest recovery since the Great Depression  the predictable consequence of massive taxation regulation oneside trade deals and onerous energy restrictions And Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been So how would he fix things The following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trumps plan to save the US economy 1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class The tax savings under Trumps plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article   A married couple earning 50000 per year with two children and 8000 in child care expenses will save 35 from their current tax bill  A married couple earning 75000 per year with two children and 10000 in child care expenses will receive a 30 reduction in their tax bill  Married couple earning 5 million per year with two children and 12000 in child care expenses will get only a 3 reduction in their tax bill 2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses Under his plan no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent Alternatively Hillary Clintons plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent So Trumps plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses and it would encourage many that have left the country to return But where would the lost tax revenue be made up 3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation For working families with children this would be a great blessing Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with It is definitely an idea that I support but once again where will the money come from to pay for this 4 US manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment This would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment but it would also reduce tax revenue As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America  but it would also likely increase the budget deficit 5 A temporary freeze on new regulations Red tape is one of my big pet peeves and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trumps planned freeze on new regulations In 2015 alone federal agencies issued over 3300 final rules and regulations up from 2400 the prior year Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average US business and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to nearly 15000 per US household annually Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as 2 trillion dollars per year and Trump will end it 6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated In particular Trumps plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website  The Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas raising electricity rates The EPAs Waters of the United States rule which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land limiting land use and The Department of Interiors moratorium on coal mining permits which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work 7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe Donald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy I write about this all the time  and it is a hot button issue for me So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following  Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America narrowing our trade deficit increasing domestic production and getting a fair deal for our workers Renegotiate NAFTA Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization Label China a currency manipulator Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations 8 Donald Trumps plan would be a tremendous boost for the US energy industry Barack Obama promised to kill the coal industry and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession To turn things around Trump would do the following  Rescind all the jobdestroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the US rule Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clintons extremist agenda Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius and stop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs 9 Trump would repeal Obamacare Trump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years And without a doubt it has already cost the US economy a lot of jobs  Not only that but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families Trump says that he would replace Obamacare but that is a rather vague statement What exactly would he replace it with 10 Trumps plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve This is a great concern because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does It is at the very heart of our debtbased system and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 the value of the US dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight We are in the midst of a longterm economic decline and things have not gotten better during the Obama years If you can believe it a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this  Americas economic performance peaked in the late 1990s and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth productivity growth job growth and investment began well before the Great Recession Workforce participation the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce peaked in 1997 With fewer workingage men and women in the workforce percapita income for the US is reduced Median real household income has declined since 1999 with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels Despite a welcome jump in 2015 median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999 17 years ago Moreover stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lowerincome and lowerskilled Americans leading inequality to rise That same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time If we continue to do the same things we will continue to get the same results Donald Trump is promising change and many of his proposals sound good but there are also some areas to be concerned about Ultimately just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the US economy around We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems and Trumps plan stops well short of that But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clintons plan and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction More Jobs Shipped Out Of The Country Ford Moves All Small Car Production To Mexico  trump will have an accident butbutbut but but obammy mammy said Donald trump will never ever become presidenthis words ver batembawok also said Donald trump will never replace me in the WHominous

responding out of shameful ignorance Its not your fault you are dumbdowned It is ironic that you are calling me out for posting anonymously when you are doing the same Resorting to name calling though

BS1986 he wants to be coronated  all hail Trumpus Maximus ThePeanut995 You are in for a rude awakening GSOB We all are if either one is elected Ive done my research No choice is without risk Trump is who Id like to see Its time to think outside the box If he gets in perhaps in a 2nd term the Fed Reserve gets axed I cant stop thinking big with Mr Trump I cant stop thinking small with the leftist

she was continuing beewok obambi failed policies Mondobeyondo I have never felt as depressed  about my own future about the future of my friends my family and my country as I do at this very moment William Lutz Mondo Im feeling the same way Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day Ive noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis but even more so after Obama got reelected The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years This downfall is inevitable anonymous Youre not the only one Jerry C Most of us felt that way almost 8 years ago rat28 Another stupid tickle down economy by the GOP We should be taxing the rich  Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick  repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years Bad deal from Donald Trump libs credit card economics yeah just let the 35 year old kids livin in their parents basement worry bout the 12T of red inkand thats just in 8 years GSOB Which is impossible to pay off South Texas The stupid in your comment just burns Ive not met one person who is retired who has benefited from the wonders of Obummacare Their cost went way up for less choice and service Maybe you could go get a medical degree and offer our services for free and help out with the problem As for GW another money sucking joke pushed by scum who live in opulate homes and waste more energy than any working class family Speaking of which how big is your home SnodtBlossom Sleep with Trump in 2016 BS1986 You do have your moments LIZ THE SHIZ oh Snotty you just want to rub your fingers through his thick blond weave dont you SnodtBlossom What Im saying is If you vote for Trump and youre single and admit to voting for him a lot of women wont want you GSOB Let me be blunt  God called women into spiritual leadership roles as an exception to His design in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church the home and in the nation In no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing but it is something God uses to shame the men into action SnodtBlossom Be SHAMED be very SHAMED G SOB LIZ THE SHIZ and you wonder why your single LIZ THE SHIZ but theyll be the ugly women not the mindless bleach blond Fox News types Satirist 1976 Michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written You presented Trumps solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans Well done This is not satire Trump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else William Lutz Replace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea South Texas No the government needs to get out of looting me with a savings account and make it free market all the way GSOB You dont understand how it works They dont tax those dollars you put into a HSA Orange Jean Except that in most of them you select a certain  amount each year and if you dont use it you lose it Who do you think ends up with the money then GSOB Dont expect a reward for being careless No system can sustain carelessness South Texas Exactly my point Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to let me do something with my money Ive never had a use for an HSA but known people who do But hey at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by giving us the privilege to use our money pretax If some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector this would be a non issue SnodtBlossom Hillary will win Peanut NO SHE WONT  HE IS NOW NECK AND NECK WITH HER AND WILL EXCEED HER MORE STUFF ABOUT HER WILL BE COMING OUT SnodtBlossom How much prior political experience does Trump have NADA ZIP ZILCH ZERO He talks the talk but never walked the walk But hey its only THE PRESIDENCY Maybe next well grab people off the street wno medical training to do surgery Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position though both had a strong military background Dwight being  The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II and Grant Commanding General of the United States Army How much military background does Trump have NADA ZIP ZILCH ZERO no major US company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trumps casino empire in the last 30 years He has filed four business bankruptcies Maybe he thinks its just as easy to file bankruptcy wthe entire government and walk away Raymond Chow Political experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation Cobbett How much prior political experience does Trump have Oh yestheres Iraq Libya Syriashe was also instrumental in convincing Bill to bomb Serbiaall resounding success storiespolitics just equal BS turee60 How much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none jonodough you mean like the idiot obama Mondobeyondo If she doesnt have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election LIZ THE SHIZ yup the fix is in just watch the electoral college  your vote dont mean squat GSOB Not yet it dont Raymond Chow Why do people always mention electoral college when they dont understand what electoral college is When looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesnt mean electoral college Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state All states in the national election are winner take all So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college LIZ THE SHIZ just like super delegates seems fishy budman nebraska is not winner take all each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district GSOB And the minimum wage will go up And unemployment will rise and government will spend even more Orange Jean  yeah and little pink pigs will fly away from Smithfield Foods and not get turned into hams ISA4110 Yep krinks Hey Genius A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition A Whistle Blower forfrom the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much The more she came up with creative reasons to deny paymentcoverage the higher she was promoted GSOB The free market is the best thing going Because it has some level of risk non hackers despise and envy this good system What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people not all No system can What happens if the majority are non hackers Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone The market then is no longer free krinks Werent you paying attention They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment GSOB Appeal it then krinks Appeal To who The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no Are you an idiot GSOB You sound like a confident young man Just ignore me Stick with your leftist ideas Your choice Jace Tate the once estudious michael snider is now drowned by drivel LIZ THE SHIZ well he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow When people runs out of argument or loses they start calling names which is exactly what you are Yes you sue or appeal your case krinks I explained that a big bonus follows when you tell people NO in the private industry If you dont understand this YES you are an IDIOT Jerry C Then payers should be free to leave and go to a provider who says yes in a fair market LIZ THE SHIZ meanwhile you die waiting for the appeal Raymond Chow Then sue them or perhaps you didnt sign up for the coverage Its like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident joe Thats how insurance works Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors IE banksters intended Raymond Chow Yes a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries Ie wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where its lower even though I live in California Cobbett Why are people so obsessed with their health Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I might get illrather spend it on women and booze Lillian DeVore I think its more of an obsession with the preexisting conditions peoples health Cobbett I had my appendix whipped out when I was 14some time agoeven though Im a heavy boozeralthough not nowI Feel Fine Why worrywhat will be will be GeneP54 He should but he said that he wants universal healthcare turee60 I agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better The government doesnt need to get into our medical Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didnt cost me anything William Lutz I agree On one hand some of Trumps policies sound alright but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic First of all building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective Furthermore 1 He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood 2 He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve the FDA the USDA Department of Energy etc 3 Reckless spending and debt is going to continue and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses 4 I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare 5 His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries Its a recipe for World War 3 6 Even though he is anti establismhment at heart he is running on a major party platform which is rigged and corrupt He shouldve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party Jace Tate Isis took the oil didnt they William Lutz Yeah they probably took it but my point is that you dont easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War By the way I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either Hence I suspect that he will strengthen the so called war on terror which God forbid he would do No more George Dubya Bush please Christopher Privett Obama expanded Bushs programs of surveillance and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars For a WALL built across their southern border John Francis You are right some things dont add up but Ill take him over Hillary any day of the week Im still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all having a very hard time with Trumps torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden Jessy Scholl Seriously Donald Trump cant talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot Jace Tate how are lower taxes going to help zero growth How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy you dont think there is any fixing it I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions themacabre How are higher taxes for failed government programs going to helpwe need to cut federal spending not give it more money Thats like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack ISA4110  I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer  How stupid can you be Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector businesses and people improves growth and the economy Waiting  JC Teecher You are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution When a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness There is a slimvery slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss Dont believe it It is in the book the only book that matters sister soldier Amen and amen again LIZ THE SHIZ we will wind up with a one world government just like in Star Trek Next Generation  the united federation of planets GSOB Leftist 1 A member of an ideological camp that defines socialism as a form of totalitarian secular feudalism an advocate for the management of nonLeftist people as farm animals When the Leftist tried to convince me that North Korea had the only true and just form of socialism on earth I gave up on trying to talk rationally with him and just walked away Jace Tate if you would all stop patting each other on the back youd find the diversity among yourselves deplorable in the face of true knowledge Jace Tate you changed your comment you liberal demagogues William Lutz But I give Donald credit where its due At least he is better than Hillary and not as conniving and deceiving as she is However I refuse to pick the least of two bad apples GSOB  vizeet Removing Obamacare and reducing Defense budget will be huge saving for US And will be good for rest of the world William Lutz Trump however will not reduce military spending and his idea of replacing ACA is only a secret plan SnodtBlossom Do you think he will help you when you are homeless GSOB It is not the POTUS job to do that LIZ THE SHIZ if he has any rooms empty in his crappy hotels he can rent them to the homeless and get refunded through section 8 housing Raymond Chow You cant even afford to step into his hotel lobby I dont think they allow vagrants there sister soldier Didnt the current sitting president already reduce the defense budget My bad he reduced our defenses turee60 You cant reduce the defense budget you need to raise the defense to protect our country from terrorist Ye Deplorable Uncucker I would hope that after he is elected he will go after the Fed Shut them down Paleface and let the treasury print the US that way avoiding paying interest to a private bunch of parasites LIZ THE SHIZ ask JFK what happens when you try to go after the fed you cant can you Priszilla
