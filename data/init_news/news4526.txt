Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney have much in common Both were pragmatic as governors mildmannered as candidates and more comfortable balancing budgets at their desks than clinking glasses at a political dinnerThe two Republican leaders personal rapport is cordial But they are hardly chummy  and at moments their relationship has been strained with each mans intertwined political network carrying some grievances with the othersAs Bush 61 and Romney 67 explore presidential campaigns in 2016 they are like boxers warming up for what could become a brutal bout sizing each other up and mulling whether or when to step into the ringTheir early maneuvering reveals a level of competitiveness and snippiness that stems from a long history following similar career paths in business and politics prescribed by their dynastic familiesWere seeing the first shots of the war between clan Romney and clan Bush said Alex Castellanos a Republican strategist who has worked for both men Both bring to the battle incredibly powerful fan clubs as well as wounds they have to heal How ugly could it get Youre only competing to lead the free worldBush has been trying to consolidate support among establishment donors leaders and operatives since announcing in December that he would begin laying the groundwork for a likely campaignThe Bush connection is a centrifugal force and its drawing back a whole generation of public servants and politicos said former Utah governor Jon Huntsman one of Romneys 2012 opponentsBut on Friday Romney sought to slam the brakes on Bush telling about 30 powerful donors that he too was seriously considering a 2016 bid I want to be president he said adding that his wife Ann was supportiveRomney has begun methodically calling donors staff members and endorsers from his two prior campaigns to measure how deep his reservoir of support would be if he runs for a third time his advisers said He also has scheduled a series of public speeches including a Jan28 address at Mississippi State UniversityThe entry of both Bush and Romney is far from certain and Romneys dalliance is preliminary But the prospect of two centerright heavyweights entering a 2016 field likely to be fluid crowded and diverse forces other contenders and the partys stable of donors to adjust their thinkingAwkward was the reaction from several past Romney supporters when they learned he was weighing a 2016 campaign If both he and Bush run they would occupy similar space as favorites of the party brass and business communityThe abundance of great candidates developing on the Republican side is making life very tough for me because Im going to have to choose amongst friends said former New Hampshire governor John H Sununu who was White House chief of staff under Bushs father but a top campaign surrogate for RomneyBut Sununu added its applesauce right now Lets not try to pick up applesauce and move it to the other side of the plateThe two candidates would invite comparisons to each other which could be tense for Bush who was sharply critical of Romneys 2012 campaign  in particular his lack of outreach to minorities  and has pledged to run a more inclusive and transparent campaignA RomneyBush race could end up being nastier than Jeb against someone like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul Bill Kristol editor of the Weekly Standard said of the Texas and Kentucky senators A CruzBush race is pretty straightforward and ideological A RomneyBush race would be more personal  about whose turn it is and who is owed itAssociates of both men insist there is no animosity between them and that each will make his decision about a 2016 run irrespective of the otherGovernor Bush respects Governor Romney said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell who worked on Romneys 2012 campaign His process moving forward wont be impacted by Governor Romneys decision to explore a run  and I would assume it is the same on the reverse sideBeth Myers a longtime adviser to Romney said he and Bush have been friends since 2002 when Romney was elected to his first term as Massachusetts governor and Bush to his second as Florida governorMitt has great respect for Jebs ability and integrity and theyve worked together many times over the years to promote conservative principles Myers said At the end of the day whatever decision Mitt makes about running for president Im 100percent certain he will still value and maintain his friendship with JebMitt and Ann Romney also have nurtured a friendship with Bushs parents former president George HW Bush and his wife Barbara In 2007 when Romney gave a personal speech on his Mormon faith which had become a touchy issue with evangelical Christian voters he did so at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station Tex where he was warmly introduced by the 41st presidentWorking on Romneys 2008 primary campaign were several Jeb Bush lieutenants Sally Bradshaw Bushs longtime political adviser Ann Herberger a Miamibased fundraiser and Al Cardenas a fixture in Florida Republican politics All three stayed out of Romneys 2012 campaign although Cardenas then the chairman of the American Conservative Union endorsed him as the primaries were endingThe BushRomney family dynamic has been one of intrigue and ambition dating at least to the 1950s when Romneys father George Romney then president of American Motors was striving to make political connections as he eyed a run for officeIn 1957 Romney wrote a letter to Prescott Bush Jebs grandfather then serving in the Senate from Connecticut urging him to testdrive a Rambler or a Metropolitan Both were popular AMC models and Romney told Bush the latter got 40 miles to the gallon according to carindustry historian Patrick R Fosters book The Metropolitan Story But Foster writes it remains unknown whether the efforts resulted in a sale  or even if Romneys solicitation drew any notice in Bushs officeIn recent weeks Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush have been quietly trying to ascertain the others motives and playbook Bush has asked Romneys former donors about what Romney is up to while Romney met shortly before Christmas with Bush strategist Mike Murphy and inquired about Bushs preparations according to political consultants who know Romney and BushRomney has said little publicly about Bush but in exchanges with intimates he has focused on Bushs past advisory work for Lehman Brothers and Barclays two major financial institutions He argued that it makes Bush vulnerable to the same kind of Democratic attacks that he faced in 2012 over his career as Bain Capital cofounder and chief executive He also has voiced doubts about Bushs political skills and ability to beat likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham ClintonAna Navarro a GOP operative and Bush confidant said Im not going to get worked up over comments Romney has allegedly made to donors behind closed doors  yet We all know he sometimes misspeaksBush has vowed to more vigorously defend his business record than Romney did Comparing their careers is like comparing an apple to a peanut Bush said in a December interview with a Miami television stationThose comments irritated Romneys family and loyalists who took them as a slight against his career managing a complicated enterprise on a scale far larger than Bushs business dealings according to Romney associatesBush also is considering releasing a decade or more of his tax returns after Romney faced heat for only reluctantly releasing two years of his returns And Bush has advocated a more welcoming message on immigration reform than Romneys hardright position which he criticized in 2012He got sucked into other peoples agendas and I think it hurt him a little bit Bush said in the TV interview He added Winning with purpose winning with meaning winning with your integrity is what Im trying to talk aboutBefore announcing his 2012 campaign Romney sensing that immigration policy would be a contentious issue in the primaries sought Bushs adviceI went to see Jeb I flew down to see him and said Id like to take immigration off the issue list for the primaries And wouldnt it be great if Republicans could come up with an immigration plan that all of the contenders could say yeah I agree And then we could sweep that aside Romney told The Washington Posts Dan Balz in an interview for his book Collision 2012We were unable to get there Romney continued I mean there just wasnt enough consensus among Republicans generallyAs Bush and Romney explore a run whispering into their ears are two political professionals with big egos eccentric personalities and a longsimmering rivalry Romneys Stuart Stevens and Bushs Murphy They are fierce competitors with roots in each others turf Stevens worked on George W Bushs presidential campaigns while Murphy worked on Romneys 2002 gubernatorial campaignMembers of Bushs team have not forgotten Stevenss role in Bushs 1994 gubernatorial race which became Bushs lowest point politically Stevens advised one of Bushs primary opponents Jim Smith who waged a bruising TV ad assault against Bush over his business experience and characterThis begins the destruction of Jeb Bush Stevens told the New York Times as the ads began Bush won the primary but he didnt win the governorship until four years laterDuring the 2012 campaign Murphy mocked Stevens on Twitter as Romney struggled in the primaries against relatively weak opponents More recently Romney backers have been murmuring fresh questions about Murphys work for the political action committee of former New York mayor Michael R Bloomberg I who is anathema to the conservative baseSome Romney allies are bitter that Bush was slow to endorse Romney in 2012 In the runup to the Florida primary with Romney fighting to beat back a surge from Newt Gingrich Bush sat on the sidelines when Romneys team thought he could have made a difference Romney called emailed and met privately with Bush to try to win him over but he could not be convincedI voted absentee Bush said on CNN And thank God its a secret ballotRomney won Florida nevertheless and by the time Bush announced his endorsement on March21 the day after Romneys decisive victory in the Illinois primary the nomination was all but officially hisBush called Romney on his cellphone with no tipoff from an emissary and their talk was brief according to aides Back at headquarters advisers were pleased by the news but grumbling still wondering why it had taken so long
