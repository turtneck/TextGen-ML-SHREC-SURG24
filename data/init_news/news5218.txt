Hillary Clinton will already make history with her nomination for president becoming the first woman to lead a major presidential ticket Now the question is whether she wants to do it again with her choice of running mateClinton is expected to name her vice presidential pick sometime after the Republican National Convention ends and before her own convention begins in Philadelphia on July 25On her list are several Hispanic lawmakers AfricanAmericans and at least one womanLatino politicians like Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro offer an appealing contrast to Donald Trumps controversial comments on Mexican immigrants plus he would bring youth to her ticketShe also has a close relationship with Labor Secretary Tom Perez who is beloved by labor unionsOhio Sen Sherrod Brown and Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren would excite supporters of Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders Brown has been a vocal opponent of free trade agreements and is one of the Senates most liberal members while Warren was the original progressive hero who has long railed against Wall StreetBut both Brown and Warren along with New Jersey Sen Cory Booker have a big complicating factor  they come from states with Republican governors who would nominate their replacements if the Clinton ticket wins And with control of the Senate hanging in the balance this November too losing a Senate seat may be too risky of a gamble for DemocratsUltimately though Clinton may go with a safer nonhistoric pick Virginia Sen Tim Kaine is a solid choice who was a finalist in President Obamas search eight years ago Kaine himself has admitted he is a boring choice but boring isnt necessarily a bad thing in politics and he does come from a swing state tooThats the same with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who has emerged as a late top possible pick for Clinton The former Iowa governor comes from an important state and is a longtime friend of the Clintons tooBelow are some of the potential candidates Clintons team is weighing Check out Trumps potential VPs hereBecerra is the current chairman of the House Democratic Caucus making him the highestranking Latino in the House Elected to Congress in 1992 he previously served in the state Assembly and was the California deputy attorney general In 2008 President Obama offered him the position of US trade representative but he turned it down saying he would have more influence in Congress Becerra has stumped for Clinton in both English and Spanish and could be a powerful voice for her on issues of immigration Once a supporter of NAFTA he now says he opposes it and voted against CAFTABooker cultivated a popular social media presence and a national profile even before he was elected to the Senate in 2013 During his seven years as Newark mayor he became wellknown for shoveling residents driveways after snowstorms rescuing a woman from a house fire and living on food stamps Booker could energize AfricanAmericans and young voters But as a freshman senator his experience will be a question even though he has served the same amount of time that Barack Obama did before becoming president His attentiongetting tactics also make him something of a wild card who could upstage ClintonBrown twoterm senator of one of the most critical swing states would bring a geographic advantage to a Clinton ticket He also would help with reaching bluecollar Democrats who might be swayed by Donald Trumps populist appeal He has been a strong surrogate for Clinton when it comes to labor issues Brown is also a vocal opponent of free trade and critic of NAFTA an issue where progressives who backed Sanders are skeptical of Clintons recent conversion Before being elected to the Senate in 2006 he served in the House for 14 years and was previously the Ohio secretary of stateThe current secretary of housing and urban development Castro is a rising star in the Democratic Party In 2009 when he was just 35 he was elected the mayor of San Antonio  the youngest mayor of a major US city He delivered the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte NC He would be the first Hispanic on a presidential ticket and would provide a contrast to Trumps controversial remarks about Latinos But recent reports say he has slipped on Clintons list owing to concerns he lacks the experience to step into the presidency if necessaryKaine would be a more traditional choice for vice president but that may be exactly what Clinton needs Last month he even admitted he lacks the pizazz of some other candidates telling Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd I am boring Hes an effective surrogate comes from a swing state and has good relationships on both sides of the aisle He has arguably the most political experience of her possible running mates including service as mayor of Richmond governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee He is fluent in Spanish and was an early Clinton endorserA former twoterm governor of Massachusetts Patrick would add diversity to the Clinton ticket In 1994 President Bill Clinton appointed Patrick as an assistant attorney general putting him in charge of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice Later he went into private practice as general counsel of Texaco and CocaCola He endorsed President Obama in 2008 Obamas chief strategist David Axelrod consulted on Patricks 2006 gubernatorial race and later helped in his tough 2010 reelection While Massachusetts isnt a swing state Patricks business and executive experience could be useful as a counterpoint to TrumpPerez has long been mentioned as a possible running mate for Clinton The current secretary of labor was first appointed by Obama as an assistant attorney general for the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division The son of Dominican immigrants he would help excite the Hispanic electorate He is also beloved by labor unions  so much so that they campaigned against his nomination to replace Eric Holder as attorney general in 2014 because they wanted Perez to stay at the Labor Department He is less well known than some of Clintons other possible picks though but has been unafraid to attack TrumpA newlyfloated name Clinton is reportedly vetting Stavridis would lend considerable military experience and national security credibility to a Clinton ticket He spent over thirty years in the Navy and rose to the rank of a 4star Admiral For four years he served as the 16th Supreme Allied Commander at NATO where he oversaw operations in Afghanistan Libya Syria the Balkans and piracy off the coast of Africa He is currently the Dean of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University He has criticized Donald Trump calling his foreign policy naive and dangerousVilsack has served at almost every level of government beginning as mayor of Mt Pleasant Iowa in 1987 He went on to serve as a state senator and the twoterm the governor of Iowa Hes the current Secretary of Agriculture and is the only remaining member of President Obamas original cabinet Like Kaine hes a safe pick for Clinton and was already vetted for the vice presidency by John Kerry in 2004 He briefly ran for president in the 2008 cycle but dropped out in early 2007 He endorsed Clinton and served as her national cochairWhen Warren campaigned with Clinton last month it was many Democrats dream ticket She has been a ferocious Trump attack dog firing back as the presumptive GOP nominee derided her with nicknames such as Pocahontas Even before she was elected she became a hero for progressives after creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and speaking out against Wall Street influence Many liberal groups urged her to run for president herself this year but she rebuffed their advances Now Warren on the ticket could be an olive branch to Sanders supporters Others think that an allwoman ticket would alienate some male voters
