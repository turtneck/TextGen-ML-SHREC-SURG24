The Supreme Court gutted a key portion of the law in 2013 and told Congress to provide a fix But only a handful of Republicans support a House bill that would do so by specifying which states and localities with a history of minority voter suppression require extra scrutiny when changing their voting laws In the Senate Democrats still cant find a single GOP cosponsor for their forthcoming billI think if someone is judged to have completed their debt to society then thats certainly something that should be seriously considered said Sen John McCain RAriz I dont think someone  if they paid their debt to society  why they cant reenter societyCurrently the question of whether an exoffender can vote in a state or federal election is largely determined by where the person lives Some states permanently revoke voting rights for people convicted of a felony Other states like Maine and Vermont never strip felons of their voting rights even while they are in prison Most states do restore voting rights to exfelons after they have served their full sentence but the process for registering again to vote can be burdensomeMyrna Prez deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center said that states are taking action on this front and the general trajectory is to ease restrictions Since 1997 Brennan reports at least 23 states have expanded voter eligibility or eased the process by which rights are restoredThe issue is also forging unusual alliances on Capitol Hill Sen Rand Paul RKy a potential 2016 presidential candidate and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid DNev are cosponsors of the Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 which would reinstate voting rights to nonviolent exoffenders for federal elections unless an individual is serving a sentence or a term of probation at the time of the electionA criminal record is currently one of the biggest impediments to voting in federal elections Paul said in a statement The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act will reform existing federal law and give lowlevel exoffenders another opportunity to vote This is an issue that I feel strongly about and I will continue to fight for the restoration of voting rights in the hopes of giving nonviolent exoffenders a second chanceTheir bill doesnt have any other cosponsors But given the sentiments of Graham and McCain for example that may be more because its not on peoples radars right nowBut that bill goes further than the PaulReid plan It would restore voting rights for federal elections to anyone including violent offenders who is not incarcerated and serving a felony sentence at the time of the election That appears to be a line Republicans wont cross given that none are signed onto that bill in either chamberHuffPost counted 10 Senate Republicans who are cosponsors of at least one criminal justice reform bill and reached out to all of them to see if they support restoring voting rights to exoffenders Besides Paul Graham and Hatch those senators include John Cornyn Texas Mike Lee Utah Ted Cruz Texas Jeff Flake Ariz Johnny Isakson Ga Marco Rubio Fla and David Perdue GaCardin did a little test recently to see what kind of support hed get on a voting rights measure  and he got decent results During last weeks Senate budget debate he offered an amendment to fund an initiative to notify inmates of their voting rights and produce a report on the effect of criminal disenfranchisement laws on minorities The vote was purely symbolic but four Republicans supported it Paul Lisa Murkowski Alaska Bob Corker Tenn and Lamar Alexander Tenn
