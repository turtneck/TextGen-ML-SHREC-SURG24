June is shaping up as a time of reckoning for President Obama  and his legacyOver the next three weeks he could record significant wins on three of his most ambitious initiatives Or have each of them blow up in his faceAnd those outcomes are largely outside of the presidents controlOn Capitol Hill lawmakers in the House are nearing a makeorbreak vote on Obamas broad Pacific Rim free trade deal with 11other countries At the Supreme Court the nine justices will soon rule on a crucial provision in the presidents landmark 2010 healthcare law with the insurance plans of more than 6million people in the balance And in Geneva US and Iranian diplomats face a June30 deadline to announce a deal on the future of Tehrans nuclear programA string of victories would provide the administration political momentum heading into the final stretch of Obamas presidency as he begins to frame the story of his administration after years of fierce combat with Republicans A string of losses would undermine the White Houses message of transformational progress just as the 2016 campaign for his successor heats up and his presidency is examined in the crucible of an election seasonThis is a consequential time for the administration said Simon Rosenberg founder of NDN a liberal think tank Its reflective of the fact that Obama has been a very ambitious president which sometimes runs counter to the DC media narrativeThe hurdles facing the administration are distinct and unpredictable and inside the West Wing Obama aides who said it reflects the extent to which the president is still driving the countrys political agenda have compartmentalized their fight on each front Teams of policy experts and political advisers are plotting strategies and working through various contingencies independentlyIts going to be a busy summer said White House press secretary Josh Earnest adding officials had already expended significant political capital in an effort to achieve some of these prioritiesBut White House allies acknowledged that the president and his advisers are acutely aware of the stakes The healthcare law is considered Obamas signature domestic policy achievement the trade accord is central to his economic agenda and the Iran nuclear deal could reshape the security environment in the Middle East and stand as his defining foreign policy successPeople are conscious of it These are hugely consequential inflection points on the substance of his presidency said one former White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his former colleagues freelyJulie Smith a former national security adviser to Vice President Biden called the summer determinative for the presidents agenda A lot of what hangs in the balance will be determined in the next couple of weeks she saidObama has projected confidence as he wields the powers of the presidency to influence the debate where he can He invited a handful of Democratic lawmakers who support his trade initiative to accompany him on Air Force One to a summit with European leaders in Germany this weekThe House plans to vote by next week on legislation which the Senate has approved that would give Obama additional authority to complete the TransPacific Partnership The president has called the accord a linchpin in his bid to ensure that the United States remains the worlds dominant economic power in the face of Chinas riseREAD The odd bedfellows in the push for trade passage in the HouseIt marks a rare chance for Obama to show he can work with the GOP which largely supports his push but he faces intense opposition from labor unions and progressive DemocratsIm not going to hypothesize about not getting it done he said Monday during a news conference in Germany I intend to get it doneOn health care Obama was equally defiant The Supreme Court is considering in King v Burwell whether to strike down government subsidies for people who purchase coverage on the federal health insurance exchange Obama on Monday called such an interpretation a contorted reading of the Affordable Care Act and added that the case probably shouldnt have even been taken up by the courtThe administration has insisted that there is no backup plan if the court strikes down the subsidies which could force 64million Americans to lose their insurance Both sides on Capitol Hill are preparing for a political blame game if that happens During an appearance Tuesday at the Catholic Health Association in Washington Obama cast the health law as woven into the fabric of AmericaTheres something deeply cynical about the ceaseless partisan attempts to roll back progress he said Youd think it was time to move onIf the court guts the law it would be a terrible thing said Neera Tanden president of the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank But from the perspective of the parties it would completely galvanize Democrats to make the Supreme Court a massive issue in the electionOn the flip side a loss for Obama in the courts would buoy Republicans who have denounced the law as a costly program that will impede the nations economic growthInstead of jousting with reality again perhaps hell consider the concerns of the constituents who write in every day to tell us how this law is hurting them Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said TuesdayOne of the presidents top legacy items got a legal reprieve Tuesday when the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit rejected state and industry challenges to a proposed rule limiting greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants as prematureThe issue of Irans nuclear capability also came up during Obamas meetings in Germany White House aides have emphasized that he does not consider the June 30 deadline a soft target that could be pushed back more than a few days if an agreement is still being finalizedIran has a historic opportunity to resolve the international communitys concerns about its nuclear program and we agreed that Iran needs to seize that opportunity Obama said after meeting with his European counterpartsThe president has invested significant political capital in preserving the framework of the tentative deal that would scale back Tehrans nuclear program for 10 to 15 years slowing Irans ability to produce a nuclear weapon according to the administration Republicans and some Democrats as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have denounced the agreement and argued that Washington is foolish to trust TehranRobert Dallek a presidential historian said that no matter how these initiatives fare over the next several weeks it will take years to evaluate whether Obama ultimately achieves his policy goals Still Dallek said presidents naturally become more preoccupied with their legacy as they approach the end of their second termTheyre very mindful of what historys going to say about them and theyre eager to shape how history views them he saidAnd for White House staff members who have experienced significant turnover the ticking clock adds to the anxiety as they race to lock in the presidents most ambitious initiativesPeople who have been there a long time start thinking Oh my gosh I wish we could get this over with said Joseph Hagin who served as deputy chief of staff for President George W Bush from 2001 to 2008 People are tired people are leaving and its depressing to the people who are staying Its really this summer when people start to realize its coming to a close But youve still got to be on your game
