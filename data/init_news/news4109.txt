LISTEN Clinton Crime Family EXPOSED By Veteran FBI Assistant Director Posted on October 30 2016 by Shae Weatherall in Politics Share This On the heels of the FBI announcing its renewed investigation into Hillary Clintons emails Veteran FBI Assistant Director and wiretap expert James Kallstrom is speaking out In his statements Kallstrom exposes the Clintons as being a crime family adding credence to the long list of allegations against them for unethical and illegal activities throughout the last several decades Hillary and Bill Clinton sharing a secret Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom inset During an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis former FBI Assistant Director in Charge New York Division James Kallstrom came forward with some serious statements about the Clinton family According to Kallstrom the FBIs original investigation into Hillary Clintons emails was impeded by the Department of Justice and other top officials in our government However now that the case has been reopened he is apparently seeing it as an opportunity to add his expert opinion and his own insider knowledge of the situation The Hill has provided a partial transcript of Kallstroms remarks  The Clintons thats a crime family basically  Kallstrom said  Its like organized crime I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool   The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation  he said  Thats the problem They never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled Im sure is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that   The agents are furious with whats going on I know that for a fact  he said Listen as former FBI Asst Director Kallstrom speaks about why he supports Donald Trump as president and explains how he knows that Hillary Clinton would be a devastating choice to lead America Among the many statements he made during the full tenminute interview  perhaps this one was the most profound  Its just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money And shes a pathological liar and shes always been a liar And God forbid if we put someone like that in the White House  Given her extensive and tainted legal and political history it is truly outrageous that Hillary Clinton was ever allowed to become the Democrat nominee for president to begin with Now shes under a second federal investigation for wrongdoing while she was serving as our Secretary of State and shockingly there are still those who support her She is obviously corrupt to the core but hopefully over the next few days as more information comes out people will open their eyes and realize that Hillarys campaign for votes is no different than any other selfserving racket she and her family have been involved in
