EXCLUSIVE A senior Hillary Clinton aide has maintained her top secret security clearance despite sending information now deemed classified to the Clinton Foundation and to thenSecretary of State Clintons private unsecured email account according to congressional letters obtained by Fox NewsCurrent and former intelligence officials say it is standard practice to suspend a clearance pending the outcome of an investigation Yet in the case of Cheryl Mills Clintons former chief of staff at the State Department two letters indicate this practice is not being followed  even as the Clinton email system remains the subject of an FBI investigationIn an Oct 30 2015 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley RIowa  who has been aggressively investigating the Clinton email case  Mills lawyer Beth A Wilkinson confirmed that her client has an active Top Secret clearance The letter said previous reporting from the State Department that the clearance was no longer active was wrong and due to an administrative errorA second letter dated Feb 18 2016 from the State Departments assistant secretary for legislative affairs Julia Frifield provided additional details to Grassley about the administrative error It too confirmed Mills maintained the top secret clearanceThe letters come amid multiple congressional investigations as well as an FBI probe focused on the possible gross mishandling of classified information and Clintons use of an unsecured personal account exclusively for government business The State Department is conducting its own administrative reviewUnder normal circumstances Mills would have had her clearance terminated when she left the department But in January 2014 according to the State Department letter Clinton designated Mills to assist in her research Mills was the one who reviewed Clintons emails before select documents were handed over to the State Department and others were deletedDan Maguire a former strategic planner with Africom who has 46 years combined service told Fox News his current and former colleagues are deeply concerned a double standard is at playHad this happened to someone serving in the government their clearance would have already been pulled and certainly they would be under investigation And depending on the level of disclosure its entirely possible they would be under pretrial confinement for that matter Maguire explained There is a feeling the administration may want to sweep this under the rugOn Monday the State Department was scheduled to release the final batch of Clinton emails as part of a federal courtmandated timetableSo far more than 1800 have been deemed to contain classified information and another 22 top secret emails have been considered too damaging to national security to release even with heavy redactionsAs Clintons chief of staff Mills was a gatekeeper and routinely forwarded emails to Clintons personal account As one example a Jan 23 2011 email forwarded from Mills to Clinton called Update on DR meeting contained classified information as well as foreign government information which is born classifiedThe 2011 email can be declassified 15 years after it was sent  indicating it contained classified information when it was sentFox News was first to report that sworn declarations from the CIA notified the intelligence community inspector general and Congress there were several dozen emails containing classified information up to the most closely guarded government programs known as Special Access ProgramsClinton has maintained all along that she did not knowingly transmit information considered classified at the timeThe US Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual lays out the penalties for taking classified information out of secure government channels  such as an unsecured email system While the incidents are handled on a case by case basis the manual suggests the suspension of a clearance is routine while derogatory information is reviewedThe manual says the director of the Diplomatic Security Service based on a recommendation from the Senior Coordinator for Security Infrastructure DSSI will determine whether considering all facts available upon receipt of the initial information it is in the interests of the national security to suspend the employees access to classified information on an interim basis A suspension is an independent administrative procedure that does not represent a final determination Fox News has asked the State Department to explain why Mills maintains her clearance while multiple federal and congressional investigations are ongoing Fox News also asked whether the department was instructed by the FBI or another entity to keep the clearance in place Fox News has not yet received a
