A lot of people I speak to who arent deeply involved in American politics are a little confused about what exactly is up with the House Republicans these days Why did Kevin McCarthy remove himself from the running for speaker without even having a vote And if the problem with McCarthy is that he wasnt conservative enough why are people talking about Paul Ryan  who isnt any more conservative than McCarthy  as possibly being able to step into the breach What in other words is actually going onIts awkward for the media because a key element of the story is a wild allegation for which nobody in journalism seems to have any evidenceBut its clear at this point that the rumors  whether or not they are true  have started to play an important role in bigpicture American politics So here goes People are saying that McCarthy who is married is or was in the past having an affair with Renee Ellmers a married Republican member of Congress from North CarolinaMcCarthys opponents on the right helped shove him out of the race by threatening to elevate this rumor from Capitol Hill gossip to national news This explains why he bowed out without insisting on a vote and it also explains why people think a person with McCarthylike views might be able to squeak inI have no idea and nobody else seems to either Its obviously in neither partys interest to admit it if it is true but its also not the kind of thing they would easily be able to disprove if it werent true But Politicos team of congressional correspondents reports that Ellmers has thanked colleagues for their prayers and support and earlier this week her lawyers sent a ceaseanddesist letter to GotNews the website that originally published the rumors calling them defamatoryNobody thinks the alleged affair is the actual reasonMcCarthy faced opposition in his quest for the speakers gavel Rather the affair seems to be a tool that his enemies inside the caucus and in the larger movement used against himIts a tool that works on two levelsThe affair allegations matter in other words because they raise the possibility that the Freedom Caucus doesnt actually have the votes necessary to block an establishmentfriendly choice for speaker from obtaining the 218 votes needed to take over Its possible that the affair allegations were a crucial difference maker  either in driving a few votes away from McCarthy or in driving him from the field even though he had 218 supporters  and that Paul Ryan or some other figure could unite the party without saying or doing anything substantively different from what McCarthy has done
