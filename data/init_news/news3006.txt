GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER demands that Italy send all new illegal alien Muslim invaders back to Africa Germanys Minister of the Interior has launched a controversial proposal to return African Muslim male invaders home rather than bringing them to Italy in order to discourage more economic freeloaders from attempting the dangerous crossing Even worse Italy has been rescuing them near Libya not even waiting until they get within spitting distance of Italy So where are all the women and children moaseu the taxi service just outside of Libya is part of the pull factor  The Champ audioexpression November 5 2016 Breitbart Minister Thomas de Maizire said Sunday that those saved in the Mediterranean should be sent back to Africa instead of taking them to Europe According to a spokeswoman for the minister this measure would serve a twofold purpose discouraging new migrants from coming while also demolishing the organizations of human traffickers that organize the crossings Germanys interior minister Thomas de Maiziere threatened to close Italys border with Austria if Rome starts sending migrants north With the migrant route through the Balkans from Greece closed migrants are instead crossing the Mediterranean from North African countries such as Libya and arriving in Italy De Maizire is not alone in his approach The prevention of illegal migration does not start at our internal borders said Helmut Teichmann director of the Germanys Federal Police The aim of the federal government is to stop the refugees before they reach Europe he said On Saturday 2200 more people tried to cross the Strait of Sicily in 16 different vessels and were rescued in a series of operations coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard who later brought them to Italy Rescuers also recovered ten bodies of migrants who drowned during the attempt Critics were quick to remark that part of the incentive for attempting the crossing in the first place is the knowledge that migrant rescuers are providing a free taxi service to Italy Protesters have raised their voices in opposition to De Maizires plan claiming it was a scandal that would effectively deny potential refugees the right of asylum but the Minister did not back down Eliminating the prospect of reaching Europe could keep them from risking their lives in a dangerous journey In point of fact this year has seen the deaths of a record number of migrants during the perilous trip On Thursday some 240 migrants drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya bringing the years death toll in the Mediterranean to 4220 compared with 3777 in the whole of 2015 The Minister suggested that once the migrants were returned to Tunisia Egypt or other North African countries they could submit their asylum applications which if approved would allow them to reach Europe safely As of 2 November 159496 people had reached Italy by sea so far in 2016 according to the International Organization of Migrants IOM
