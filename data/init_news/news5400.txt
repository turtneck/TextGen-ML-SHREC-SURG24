Comments Consultant Jesse Benton of the proTrump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting AfricanAmericans and women In Cleveland if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels  we can turn her to regular turnout levels shes gonna lose about 60000 votes in that area  thats dead heat So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly targeting AfricanAmericans and sort of suburban moms just bad stuff about Hillary just trying to take their taste for her away Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel 2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them  the Clinton campaign the media polling organizations  of rigging the election against them But time and time again its been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter  especially nonwhite male voters  Since the Republicans cant win this game they have elected to change the rules instead by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters  especially minorities  from exercising their right to vote closing down polling stations They justify this in an underhanded appeal to protecting the integrity of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of voter fraud over the nations head This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy and we must punish them for it at the ballot box Watch it here
