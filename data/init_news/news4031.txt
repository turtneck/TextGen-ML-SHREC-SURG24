Wednesday I participated in Facebooks meeting with conservatives at the companys headquarters in Silicon ValleyEven though I did the round trip in a little more than 24 hours the West Coast feels a long way away from New York City Geographically and culturallyThe Facebook setting is so different from the work environments Im used to including its open floor plans to encourage the constant flow of creativity and its casual nature The place is calm but I had the feeling cool stuff was happeningIts different and Ill admit a bit unnerving for someone who likes structure But its also really neat Its powerful And they know itFacebook invited 16 conservatives to a meeting it described as long overdue Over time the trust between conservatives and the company has been erodingLast weeks accusations from a former contract employee about the alleged practice of suppressing conservative viewpoints and news stories in its Trending Topics feature was the spark that lit a fireThe meeting was an attempt to put the fire out and to begin to rebuild trust with the conservative communityThis was a meeting where two bubbles collided one of conservative media and activists and the other of the world of FacebookI went to the meeting with an open mind and a lot of curiosity The Facebook executives we met with greeted us with humility and the admission that they need to do a better jobOverall the meeting went well Here are my five takeaways1 Facebook recognized that its lost trust with conservatives and it is genuinely serious about fixing itWhile some in the conservative media worried that this meeting would be an insincere gesture and a mere photoop there were no cameras the main company executives present  including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  could not have been more genuineIt was very clear that Facebook does not take these allegations lightly and they acknowledged a real trust deficit with their conservative partners and usersI left feeling assured that Facebook would be working to repair relationships amidst the damaging allegations and to reestablish credibility in the conservative community about its commitment to inclusivity and neutralityWednesdays meeting was a civil environment where everyone had the opportunity to voice their opinions concerns and questionsImagine a meeting in 2016 where 16 different conservatives  representing all the different viewpoints we have  get along really well and are reminded of our common principles Maybe we should have the convention in Silicon Valley OK maybe in 2020Everyone had a chance to speak and did so frankly And respectfullyZuckerberg and his team did way more listening than talking which left the door open for a meaningful conversation And despite the uncomfortable temperature in the room the power went out in the headquarters just as the meeting started Zuckerberg kept the meeting going for an additional 20 minutes so that everyone had a chance to speak and get their questions answered or ideas raised3 Facetoface is best for establishing trustZuckerberg immediately acknowledged that this meeting was one he should have started long beforeHe was right  and we can meet him halfway on that But the fact that he invited all of us to Facebooks headquarters allowed everyone to voice their concerns and opinions to each other in one room facetoface That showed an immediate level of respect from Zuckerberg and his team and the same was true of the conservatives that were thereThe conservatives were prepared specific smart and creative This is an important thing to remember in business relationships and even personal relationships4 Employment diversity is not limited to gender and ethnicityFacebook  and Silicon Valley in general  takes pride in their commitment to diversity among their employees But a point that was made yesterday is that diversity in thought and opinion is critical as well for a wellrounded companyGender diversity and ethnic diversity are not the only ways to diversify and Facebook clearly lacks conservative staffers The company did not disagree5 Conservatives need to keep using all the available social media platformsSocial media as a whole has been a boon for conservatives Never before could a conservative reach that many people without a mainstream media filterConservatives have built followings movements and even presidential campaigns utilizing FacebookSince the company has admitted it needs to do better lets take them up on thatWe can offer specific solutions and bring creative ideas We can pick up the phone or get on a plane and meet with people  I found them to be reasonable and approachable This may not always be the case but it is the situation we have right nowConservatives want Facebook to be more responsive and we are pushing on an open door Lets walk through itBeing a conservative means fighting for individual liberty freedom of expression and markets and for less government interference in our lives By all accounts a majority of Americans agree with those principlesWe should use all available tools at our disposal to spread that word and build a stronger conservative movement in the United States
