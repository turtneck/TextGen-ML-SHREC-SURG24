Politics Poland Establishing New Territorial Defense Force to Fight Russian Threat Polands rightwing government is creating a new military arm to counter the supposed Russian threat as well as planning to double the size of Polands armed forces Originally appeared at Sputnik The Polish government has given a final goahead to the planned creation of a territorial defense force which local media were quick to call the personal army of Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz Sputnik Poland discussed the issue with Polish politician and commentator Mariusz Olszewski  Macierewicz is a very efficient politician and defense minister and his ability to place the territorial defense force under his personal command rather that the presidents is nothing short of a political masterpiece  Mariusz Olszewski told Sputnik Poland He added that the new force was obviously meant for use inside the country against the socalled death squads trying to destabilize the political situation in the country If this is really what is happening then the governments fears are fully justified Olszewski chuckled In the event of an armed conflict the territorial defense units will be called up to secure their designated areas stamp out attempts to stoke up ethnic and religious conflicts and attempts to destabilize the country When asked whether it means that the Territorial Defense Force TDF would serve as a kind of personal police for the ruling Law and Justice party Mariusz Olszewski said that it would rather serve the national security minister The very list of threats the TDF is supposed to deal with looks a bit strange though as we have no internal threats neither have we any regional or ethnic minorities here Olszewski said adding that the real threat to the powersthatbe came from people who use Western money to destabilize the country through media death squads and challenge the constitutional order in Poland I am also worried by Ukrainian media saying that it could take the Polish army just five days to reach the border of the Second Polish Republic prior to 1939  Ed This is exactly the kind of misinformation Western propaganda was spreading about Russian troops needing just 24 hours to reach Warsaw Someone is trying to pit Eastern European countries against each other to make people believe that war is imminent Mariusz Olszewski warned While admitting that security was something no country should ignore he added that a country the size of Poland might need a territorial defense force but only as a backup to the regular forces not as the mainstay of national defense as our defense ministry wants us to believe This is either someones mistake or just a PR stunt Poland needs ground forces an Air Force and to a lesser extent a Navy As for territorial defense it is just a smokescreen meant to hide what is really happening in our army Mariusz Olszewski emphasized  The Territorial Defense Force TDF is a planned military reserve component of the Polish armed forces which is currently being formed Plans call for the force once fully active to consist of 35000 parttime volunteers Poland plans to deploy the new territorial defense units on its eastern border and to transfer the acting brigades there with an eye to becoming one of the largest NATO armies in Europe Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said that the deployment was aimed against Russia describing it as a measured proportionate response to the prospect of aggressive Russian action He also supports the idea of significantly boosting the Polish armed forces from the current 80000 servicemen to some 150000
