Everything you have seen here has been an illusion Those are not the words of President Obama But given what we now know about ObamaCare they well could have beenInstead they are the words of Eisenheim a 19th century master magician in the fictional film The Illusionist And just like Obama he uses his abilities to fool the masses into believing that his artifices are quite realThe president sold his health care plan on the promise that it would help Americans who had no insurance but all others would remain unaffected It proved to be an illusionMillions of Americans lost their insurance their doctors and their hospitals Average premiums did not go down by 2500 as promised They went up appreciably rendering the term  Care Act an oxymoronThe tax was cleverly disguised as a penalty because as Jonathan Gruber the socalled architect of the ACA confessed recently Americans are stupid And the quintessential coverup obscured the identity of those who would pay for ityoung healthy individuals subsidizing older sick people It was a scheme of deception designed to fool Americans An artifice In a court of law it would be called fraudEither the president knew his promises were untrue and deliberately set out to deceive Americans or he inexplicably believed it was true but did not bother to read or understand the bill he signed into law Which means he was both nave and incompetent but slightly better than malicious No mea culpa will ever undo the damageWhat can be undone are key parts of ObamaCare Republicans are vowing to try Some Democrats fraught with buyers remorse may join themAll the impassioned rhetoric about repealing ObamaCare in its entirety is nothing more than political phantasmThe new Senate does not have a vetoproof majority of 67 votes Its simple mathRepublicans will of course pursue the charade because that is one of Washingtons quaint traditions But once the symbolic pretense is over the new Congress may go about disassembling ObamaCare piecemeal How exactly Here are some of the ways1 Revisit the employer mandate Under ObamaCare companies with at least 50 fulltime employees are required to provide insurance Under pressure from businesses and even members of his own party Obama delayed implementation Republicans would like to kill it completely but this is a long shot2 Revisit the individual mandateAll Americans are forced to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty Although it remains the most unpopular part of ObamaCare the Supreme Court narrowly upheld this provision Removing it from the health care law would undermine the premise and financial stability of ACA which means the president would surely put ink on a veto So this is the longest of long shots3 Repeal the medical device tax The tax on medical devices helps generate revenue to pay for lowincome subsidies But the 23  tax also hurts manufacturers and has a negative impact on the economy There is bipartisan support for repealing the tax and it probably has the best prospect of passage4 Revisit what constitutes full time employment Changing the definition of full time employee from 30 hours to 40 hours per week would allow many businesses to hire more people without being forced to provide employer coverage It would help stem job losses caused by the law This idea is gaining traction5 Federal reimbursements The federal government is required to reimburse insurance companies when their costs end up higher than anticipated Derided as a blatant bailout it could be on the chopping block6 Medical board Written into the ACA law is an Independent Payment Advisory Board which oversees health care pricingThe much maligned board has yet to be activated so repeal stands a decent chance of happening7 Lowering subsidies ObamaCare could be made more affordable to the government if subsidies given to lowincome enrollees were reduced Obviously this would increase the cost to participants but modifying the subsidies has some support8 New copper plan Creating a new lower cost category of ObamaCare coverage would reduce the high price of premiums but increase outofpocket expenses born by participantsThis would attract those who must comply with the law but desire the lowest cost available It might also spawn creation of additional low cost plans which consumers crave It is doable9 Withhold fundingNot all ObamaCare funding is mandatorySome administrative costs for example are funded through discretionary appropriations Congress could vote to stop funding for certain provisions making full implementation difficult However the president could veto such a spending bill even in the face of another government shutdown10 Republican alternativesWith both houses of Congress now in its control the GOP will likely intensify the push for its own alternative ideas bills that would allow people to purchase insurance across state lines to increase competition and lower premium prices promote health savings accounts permit small businesses to pool their employees together to gain better insurance rates and coverage tax credits for those individuals without employer provided insurance limiting medical malpractice awards which are a driver of overall health costs and Medicaid reform11 Supreme Court decision Beyond congressional action the US Supreme Court is poised to hear a formidable challenge to ObamaCare which could seriously destabilize the law A key provision requires that subsidies be given to eligible individuals enrolled through an exchange established by the state It was purportedly designed as an incentive for states to setup their own exchanges However 37 states chose not to do so relying instead on federal exchanges Supporters of ObamaCare claim it was merely a hasty mistake  some have called it a typoIf the high court disagrees by ruling that some 5 million people on federal exchanges are not eligible for financial assistance under the plain meaning of the statute this could shatter the financial underpinnings of ObamaCareOf course predicting how the Supremes will rule is a fools errand But one thing is certain the president cannot now go back to Congress to try to fix the textual language of his signature achievement Republicans will control both houses in 2015There have been 42 significant changes to ObamaCare so far 24 of them ordered unilaterally by the president Setting aside the question of his legal authority to do all these revisions underscore what an illconceived and poorly crafted law this was from the outset But it also belies another promise averred by Obama that his new law would be fairIt is hardly fair to enforce the mandate on individual Americans while granting a myriad of waivers exemptions exceptions and delays for select businesses and unions who supported the presidentPolls show that Americans were overwhelmingly against ObamaCare before it ever passedTheir antipathy has remained constant as people continue to recoil from an unpopular law that deprives them of their freedom of choice in matters which are inherently personal  their health They resent such decisions being made for them by their government A new Gallup poll finds a majority of Americans 56  disapprove of ObamaCare while 37  approveObama has only himself to blame for the manifest flaws in his grand illusion Driven by an authoritarian impulse he forced ObamaCare through a compliant Democratically controlled Congress never giving anyone a chance to digest the 2700 page bill and what it might portend for AmericaObamas promised transparency was a concomitant fraud epitomized by thenHouse leader Nancy Pelosi when she sputtered one of the most baffling and incomprehensible lines in American politics we have to pass the bill so that you can find out whats in itWell now we knowThe wreckage wrought by ObamaCare is strewn across the landscape of American lives People have seen their premiums rise deductibles escalate benefits decline quality of care diminish plans cancelled and doctors vanishFor what When he began his first term President Obama vowed his health care law will cover every American Yet 41 million Americans are still uninsuredIs the law worth the 2 trillion dollars in taxpayer expense and the loss of 25 million jobs as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget OfficeOur president thinks so He insists he is proud of the pejorative ObamaCare If so he is a modernday Eisenheim Americas illusionist fooling no one but himselfGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney
