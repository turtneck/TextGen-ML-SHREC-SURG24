Editors note The following column originally appeared on The Resurgent website It is reprinted with permissionIn the first 48 hours since the horrific mass shooting in Orlando the worst terror attack on American soil since 911 the public has seen walltowall media coverage of the eventsThe false narrative emerging from the media seeks to make a few points all of which are red herrings and straw men designed to take attention from the truth The shooter Omar Mateen was homophobic because he hated gays Mateen was unstable because he was mean and beat his wife Mateen had too much unfettered access to gunsStory after story references these points and they quote each other liberally take the pun as you wish Fox News and other media outlets reported comments by a coworker at security firm G4S who called him toxic and unhinged The Times of London quoted CNN about his first wife He was mentally unstable and mentally ill Antigun New York Daily News quoted NBC News who spoke to Mateens father Seddique Matteen who insisted the rampage had nothing to do with religionThe Washington Post also did a story on Seddique Mateen defending his sonHe had a child and a wife and was very dignified meaning he had respect for his parents Seddique Mateen wrote standing in front of the flag of his apparent birthplace Afghanistan I dont know what caused him to shoot last nightThe shooters father has close connections with his native Afghanistan and has traveled back there as recently as 2014 even interviewing Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul according to the Washington Post He made a series of Youtube videos praising the Taliban and railing against the USThe Boston Globe appears to be at a complete loss as to Mateens motive for the killings because theres no actual proof besides the killers own words pledging allegiance is ISIS he was tied to any jihadist causesWhile Mateen claimed allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadi no evidence had emerged by late Sunday pointing to actual ties to terrorist groups or a significant association with jihadist causesYes they actually wrote that Apparently a confession isnt evidence to themWe can either accept the media narrative that some unknown complex mix of motives drove this mentally ill man to buy readily available assault weapons and kill people he simply hated for no reason or we can apply Occams Razorthe simplest explanation is usually the correct oneThe Quran teaches that homosexuality is wrong and punishable by death not just God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality This is not for the servants of God which Seddique Mateen said In some Sharialaw Muslim countries it actually is punished by death Certainly ISIS punishes homosexuality by death Many Muslim men are brought up and taught to beat their wivesthat this is the correct way to administer discipline in the home This kind of behavior is common in the Islamic world where women are not valued as anything more than property Mateen had a clean record worked as a security guard kept himself in excellent physical condition and trained for his jihad This was not a crime of opportunity or of passion It was a planned operation The mentally ill narrative offers no hard evidence at this point He bought weapons because despite the FBI having investigated him nothing of concern was noted that would prevent him from doing so This is a failure of the intelligence and law enforcement system not our Second Amendment rights The attack was absolutely religiously motivated You didnt see Mateen attacking the Orlando Islamic Center the mosque he attended because he didnt like the people there You didnt see the people with whom he worshipped calling the FBI or the local authorities to report Mateen acting weird or talking about killing peopleThe simplest explanation is that Mateen was a radicalized Muslim who moved easily with other radicalized Muslims some of whom are probably living their lives in Orlando Only now would the FBI be interviewing those people and find connectionsThe press is weaving a false narrative to fashion a complex explanation for a simple problem We have a cancer of radical Islam growing in America Political correctness the inability of our president to accept the problem because of his beliefs about Islam being a religion of peace and impossible restrictions placed on federal state and local law enforcement have made this crime possibleOur government is ignoring the cancer and it will continue to grow as long as the country keeps buying the medias spinSteve Berman is a Georgiabased software entrepreneur and blogger who writes at The Resurgent Erick Ericksons home on the web Follow him on Twitter lifeofgrace224
