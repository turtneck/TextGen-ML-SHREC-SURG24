The Daily Sheeple by Jake Anderson Anomalous signals from deep space often evoke a quick pulse of gossip and speculation about aliens that dies off soon thereafter when scientists are able to explain it Usually the explanation involves a natural cosmic process  an asteroid space detritus or frequencies from an exploded star Sometimes however the signals are too mysterious to explain Theres a reason why you may have seen a sustained social media buzz regarding aliens this past week A few days ago two scientists from Laval University in Quebec released a paper arguing they may have just received our first communication from extraterrestrials First a bit of context This has been an exciting decade for those of us who stargaze in awe wondering how many sentient beings live in this incomprehensibly enormous universe of ours First the search for exoplanets accelerated dramatically aided by the Kepler telescope which has identified over 1000 planets outside of our solar system While scientists have long known that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably contains several hundred billion planets  the ability to study them had eluded us until fairly recently this ability will be exponentially augmented when the James Webb telescope allows us to analyze exoplanets atmospheres and search for traces of industrial gasses Additionally the discovery of Earthlike exoplanets  some of which are conceivably close enough to visit in a few decades  has tantalizing ramifications for our near future human race Earlier this year scientists announced the incredible observation of a series of inexplicable brightness frequencies from the star KIC 8462852 which led many to speculate the signals could have been originating from a Dyson sphere  a theoretical megastructure by which an advanced alien race a Kardschez type 2 civilization  could harness the power of its sun The newest discovery from this star has made it even more unlikely that the signals are from natural causes The newest strange signals hail from a gaggle of some 234 stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which analyzed the spectra of 25 million stars EF Borra and E Trottier the two astronomers who discovered the anomalies discussed them in their paper  which was originally titled Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis they wrote The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis Of course it is far from certain that these are actual alien messages In an interview with none other than Snopescom  Borra claimed he never actually used the word probably and that further confirmation was needed The director of the SETI Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute  Andrew Siemion issued an admonishing response You cant make such definitive statements about detections unless youve exhausted every possible means of followup So why is everyone so excited The discovery appears to match a prediction Borra made in 2012 when he claimed aliens could very well use intermittent bursts of laser as a means of communication For his part Siemion plans to use his Breakthrough Listen Initiative to more closely assess several stars from the 234 sample Meanwhile Borra andTrottier Borras graduate student will continue observing the mysterious signals Its an exciting decade for space research With plans for a mission to Mars in the hopper as well as an exploratory probe that will be sent to the moon Europa we may be witnessing the rebirth of the Space Race What better incentive could there be to venture further into space than the call of an alien species Lets hope that by the time we meet them our own species will have transcended its addiction to war and unsustainable resource allocation We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  Click for details  Contributed by The AntiMedia of theantimediaorg  The Anti in our name does not mean we are against the media we are simply against the current mainstream paradigm The current media influenced by the industrial complex is a topdown authoritarian system of distributionthe opposite of what AntiMedia aims to be At AntiMedia we want to offer a new paradigma bottomup approach for real and diverse reporting We seek to establish a space where the people are the journalists and a venue where independent journalism moves forward on a larger and more truthful scale Share Rate
