It was once a sleepy Capitol Hill backwater with a reputation for bipartisanship where freshman lawmakers would learn the ropes of lawmaking and budgetsNow the recent blowup over climate research on the House science committee is the latest firefight on a panel thats more partisan and backbiting than ever members and former staff sayAs Chairman Lamar Smith RTex has molded the committee with a more aggressive role in oversight than anyone can remember he and his Democratic counterpart are feuding openly over what theCommittee on Science Space and Technology should really be doing supporting science or debunking itThe snipingbetween the lawmakers and their staffs is ratcheting up with Smiths highestprofile campaign yet to discredit scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who published a pivotal study that refuted the idea that global warming had pausedover the past decadeIn recent weeks ranking memberRep Eddie Bernice Johnson D a softspoken Texan in her 22nd yearon the committee has sent Smitha series of blistering letters denouncing his subpoena of the scientists and other NOAA staffas alternately a fishing expedition a witch hunt and an ideological crusadeNOAA chief tells lawmaker I will not allow anyone to coerce the scientists who work for meShehas branded her colleagues claims that NOAA altered historical climate data the most outrageous statements ever made by a Chair of the Committee on ScienceAnd Smitha fellow Texan whorejects the scientific consensus that manmade pollution is behindglobal warming has charged back in his own letter campaign accusingJohnson of a lack of interest in oversight of government waste and wrongdoing and a partisan political allegiance to the Obama administrationEven in an era of extreme partisanship on Capitol Hill the namecalling stands out The committee thatoversees NASA the National Science Foundation NOAA and nondefense research and development inmuch of the rest of the governmentis more polarizedthan ever current and former staff and members say with the climate talks in Paris only ratcheting up tensionsDemocrats accuse Smithnow in his third year as chairman of a contempt for the scientificmethods and an almost exclusive focus on discreditingthe work and gutting the budgets of federal researchersThey say he has sidelined them by using the GOPs new unilateral power in this Congress to depose and subpoena federal officials without a voteTheyclaim they find out about bills the majority is introducing at the last minute  and are notified of witnesses he has invited to testify at hearings with only a one or twoday notice making it hard for them to come up with their own witnesses in timeThis committee was always considered nonpartisan looking at the nations future Johnson said in an interview Ive had people tell me its worse now than the Benghazi committee investigating the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya Its just as contentiousWhile she said she and Smith have never been personal friends Johnson described the chairman as respectful and friendly toward her during committee hearingsThen I get these letters saying Im just a pawn of the Obama administration she saidI dont even think of the administration Its just common sense that would lead you to research what hes saying versus what the reality is and try to make a comparisonSmith a former chairman of the highprofile House Judiciary Committee said in a response to emailed questions that he has a long record of bipartisanship in CongressJohnson consistently argues that the Committee should seek fewer documents and ask fewer questions Smith wrote Even in the face of possible or admitted wrongdoing she places political allegiance to the Obama administration before the Committees obligation to hardworking taxpayers This does damage to Congress as an institution and to the trust people have in our federal agenciesSmith said its Johnson who has failed in her duty to join him in key investigations Ofa 3milliongallon toxic waste spill in Coloradocaused in part by an Environmental Protection Agencycontractoran illegal meth labatthe National Institute of Standards and Technology a National Weather Service executive who wrote his own lucrative postretirement consulting contractBoth parties point to limited bipartisan victories including a law strengthening science technology engineering and math STEM education and adding computer science to those efforts and a commercial space bill extending some regulations and providing limited property rights for resources extracted from asteroidsBut its the basics of scientific inquiry that have upsetthe relationship between Democrats and Republicansfrom Smiths early effort to put tight reins on the grantmaking National Science Foundation by scrutinizing projects it funds to his challenge to coal regulations which have attempted to discredit studies on the health effects of carbon emissionsThis was not a deeply polarized committee before said David Goldston who served as chief of staff to former Rep Sherwood Sherry Boehlert a moderate Republican who was science committee chairman from 2001 to 2006Relations were extremely cordial said Goldston who is now director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council There were some differences on spending levels agency missions and the direction of research he saidBut he described thepanels current Republican majority this way I dont think they think of themselves as antiscience but as preventing a perversion of science by leftwing ideologyAnd one of the most ideological battles in science now is climate change the subject of routine hearings on the committeeOn Tuesday as the climatechange summit got underway in Paris the committee held a hearing titled Pitfalls of Unilateral Negotiations at the Paris Climate Change ConferenceThe partiesproceeded in parallel universes with Democrats lobbing questions to their sole friendly witness on the economic and environmental benefits of reducing greenhouse gasemissions and Republicans lobbing questions to their three friendly witnesses on why ObamasClean Power Plan wouldcost billions of dollars and cause financial hardship for American families along with no significant benefit to climate changeRep Donna Edwards DMd who is on the panel said in an interview thatthe committee is struggling with the fundamental question of whether we are going to trust the science that comes from scientists who are really disengaged from politicsBecause of the tenor that the chairman has taken hes challenged this idea that were going to depoliticize science she saidThe committee started in1958 as the Space Committee to oversee NASA and gradually its science portfolio grew Today the Democratic and Republican staffs have little contactcurrent and former staffers saidOn oversight theres not a lot of cooperation for major investigations said one Democratic staffer who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of what he described as strains between the staffsThat tradition goes back a long time Now its not unusual for us to find something out through a press release the staffer saidSmith said in an email that the Republicans always provide the minority with the required notice of committee proceedings in accordance with the Rules of the House Usually we provide more notice than requiredEven as Congress investigates the global warming pause actual temperatures are surgingTop Weather Service official creates consulting job  then takes it himself with
