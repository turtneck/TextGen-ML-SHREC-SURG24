by Yves Smith By Wolf Richter a San Francisco based executive entrepreneur start up specialist and author with extensive international work experience Originally published at Wolf Street Five years ago when Google announced that it would build a superhighspeed fiberoptic network in Kansas City and then roll it out in other cities it started an effort to own and control the data pipelines going into homes and businesses Given how frustrated consumers are with their ISPs it seems people couldnt wait for Google Fiber now operated by Alphabets Access Google then spent a fortune building out the network in select cities around the country This could have been huge  At a huge cost Amazing bet is what Craig Barratt senior VP at Alphabet and CEO of Access called Google Fiber in a blogpost yesterday In the same breath he also announced that they would pause the buildout of Google Fiber in cities where it had been planned that there would be layoffs and reassignments though he didnt say how many and that hed step aside as CEO of Access His replacement has not been announced Hes the third CEO of an Alphabet division to part ways since June He prefaced this whole debacle this way And thanks to the hard work of everyone on the Access team our business is solid our subscriber base and revenue are growing quickly and we expect that growth to continue I am extremely proud of what weve built together in five short years Google Fiber is one of two big entities in Other Bets of the Alphabet empire whose CEO Larry Page and newish CFO Ruth Porat are trying to crack down on ballooning costs The other big entity in Other Bets is Nest Labs which makes internetconnected thermostats and the like In a brilliant move Google had acquired it in 2014 for a breathtaking 32 billion But by now this move has become very unbrilliant In June Tony Fadell Nest cofounder and CEO quit after internal disputes over this focus on spending Some key Nest employees moved to Googles new hardware division And the entity is in turmoil In August Bill Maris CEO of Googles venture capital arm GV also left Earlier this year Alphabet got second thoughts about its ambitious robotics efforts and put Boston Dynamics up for sale It had acquired the experimental robot maker in 2013 for 500 million But tensions soon arose and cofounder Andy Rubin bailed out in 2014 No deal yet Then there was infamously Google Glass So Google Fiber is in good company It will cease efforts to install a fiber network in 10 cities where it had been planned but not fully committed according to Ars Technica  In addition San Francisco was supposed to get Google fiber for sure but that has now been cancelled too The 11 cities where Google Fiber has been nixed Chicago Dallas Jacksonville Los Angeles Oklahoma City Phoenix Portland San Diego San Francisco San Jose and Tampa In this handful of cities and also in certain related areas of our supporting operations well be reducing our employee base Barratt wrote Hence the layoffs Google Fiber has already been rolled out in Atlanta Austin Charlotte Kansas City Missouri and Kansas Nashville Provo Utah Salt Lake City and The Triangle North Carolina And its still publicly committed to building the network  subject to change I suppose  in Huntsville Alabama Irvine California San Antonio and Louisville In June Google Fiber announced that it would acquire Webpass a 13yearold company that provides highspeed wireless internet in Boston Chicago Miami San Diego Oakland and San Francisco A wireless network is a lot cheaper to install in urban areas with multifamily housing than fibertothehome About 9 of the employees at Access will lose their jobs though some people could be reassigned to entities of Alphabet according to Ars Technica The source did not say exactly how many employees that percentage represents Access includes more than just Google Fiber so the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned is probably a little higher Alphabet headcounts are hard to come by but this Bloomberg report says Access has about 1500 employees The Information report indicates that Google Fiber had about 1000 employees before the layoffs If both of those numbers are accurate then the percentage of Google Fiber employees being laid off or reassigned to other parts of Alphabet might be around 135 percent Google Fiber apparently has not hit its subscriber goals and fiber construction is a costly endeavor While the company isnt giving up on fiber entirely it may be able to deploy Internet service at a lower cost using wireless technology Its billions of dollars a year just to maintain this stuff and Google doesnt want to spend that kind of money on just being another player in that market Jan Dawson an analyst with Jackdaw Research told Bloomberg  I think the new CFO put an end to the experiment that wasnt really going anywhere Chetan Sharma an independent wireless industry analyst told Bloomberg  So serving up digital ads is still Alphabets main business and flourishing Controlling the highspeed pipeline to get these ads into homes and businesses and grabbing whatever data can be grabbed by ISPs via deeppacket inspection and other methods still seems to be part of the plan but now through cheaper and less glamorous wireless services and no longer through the holy grail of data pipelines optical fiber And so goes another huge dream to diversity away from advertising Even the absolute master of marketing Apple is running into trouble with its latest product Read Smartwatch is Dead Market Implodes Apple Watch
