 The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning By Jeremy ScahillNovember 10 2016  Information Clearing House    The Intercept   A few days ago we learned that Private Chelsea Manning attempted to take her own life last month for the second time since being sentenced to 35 years at the US military prison in Leavenworth Kansas The whistleblower who provided the collateral murder video the Iraq and Afghan war logs and the hundreds of thousands of classified US State Department cables to Wikileaks was convicted of espionage As I waited to vote today I found myself thinking of her languishing in misery in isolation and incarcerationThis election  particularly in its closing stages  has been dominated by controversies over emails classified documents and Wikileaks Weve heard endlessly about Hillary Clintons private basement server her 33000 deleted emails the phishing and leaking of John Podestas emails including parts of Clintons much discussed private speeches to Goldman Sachs Trump for his part suddenly discovered a great love for Julian Assange though he does have trouble correctly spelling Wikileaks in his tweets of praise Taken together with Trumps bizarre and consistent lauding of Vladimir Putin and leaks from the US intelligence community the country has been treated to an odd flashback of Cold War propaganda including a fair dose of redbaiting from the Democrats In the matter of Anthony Weiners computer his wife Huma Abedins communications and the potential implications for Clinton the FBI whose overreach had not previously been of much concern to Democrats suddenly became a deviant manipulator of the electoral process while Trump and his supporters alternately praised the agencys professionalism and denounced it as part of the rigged systemThe US public is now getting a taste of the way hacking phishing and an overwhelming dependence on fallible machines and networks can impact politics But lets be clear None of the disclosures in this campaign  not one thing in any of the hacked emails or those declassified and released from Clintons private server  has brought to light anything of greater importance than the documents Chelsea Manning provided to Wikileaks She revealed war crimes including murder and torture dirty and duplicitous dealings of the US and its allies exposed liars documented a secret history of Americas longest running war and forced a much needed debate about the US role in the world And for that she is being torturedThe double standards of our society dictate that a perjurer like the director of national intelligence James Clapper faces no consequences for his crimes Gen David Petraeus gets a slap on the wrist no jail time and prestigious positions at universities for sharing classified information with his mistress Only Gen James Cartwright may face the inside of a prison cell for discussing classified information with journalists  and he is a sacrificial lamb for the cause of exonerating Clinton and Petraeus from any true accountability by the Obama Justice DepartmentBut Chelsea Manning whose motivation was noble whose actions made our country better faces the full wrath of the system And it may end up killing her When we talk about the hightech scandals that marked this election at the top of the list should be the torture of Chelsea Manning
