October 27 2016  1159 am Im voting for him  but will be very quiet about it I believe there Are many out there who are doing the same Islam is not gayfriendly Its the leftist idiot who would believe that it is despite a mountain of evidence showing the truth about Islam However  too many follow the company line It is getting very demanding these days and frankly very strange But doesnt the left always do that Whatever problem there is within the right  at least there is enough room and more than the case now with the left Well  at least for this cis white male AndyT October 27 2016  1139 am As a gay man I despair of my fellow gays Here in the UK most have this poor refugee mentality By time the penny finally drops it will be too late BareNakedIslam October 27 2016  1234 pm Andy while the majority still have that poor refugee mentality I have seen a number of gay people commenting here andor emailing me who know the truth Theyre just afraid of the ridicule they will get by talking about it in within their liberal circles Manual Paleologos October 27 2016  1056 am The irony is that the LGBTQWERTY community is almost uniformly liberal They support the people who are stoning them throwing them from buildings and hanging them They have ceded any influence with the political Right as no matter what the Right does they will not get any meaningful Gay support That means that just or unjust there is absolutely no upside to supporting Gay issues There is a small upside from the Christian Right to pissing on them Meanwhile although we disagree on some major issues we are probably their best friends We are the people who would die to protect them
