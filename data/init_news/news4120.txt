I know all of these meats 1This slab of bacon has felt the warmth of my hands and the beauty of my gaze 2 I can remember the moment as if it happened only an hour ago I was young having just been asked to leave the seminary after I repeatedly refused to chip in for WiFi and walking through downtown Kansas City when I came across this sirloin steak Never before had I seen something so special I took the meat up into my hands and eyed it for a solid three minutes before I set it back down on a manhole cover and continued on my way A chance meeting sure But an unforgettable one 3 Ive seen and held raw meat as well This pork chop while raw is still deserving of human touch and I provided that comfort for it Anyone would have done the same 4 When you win a oneday twonights cruise to Stamford CT on a radio call in sweepstakes you think you have it made But I was a bit nervous when I took this succulent rack of St Louis ribs onboard with me It was my very first cruise and I didnt know what to expect But lets just say I was extremely happy that I won two tickets for this maiden voyage 5 Im currently holding this tenderloin in my hands but sadly I have not opened my eyes to gaze upon it yet The time will come though when I see it And it will be incredible 6 Heres another cut of meat that has sensed my touch and stare This one I was holding and touching in a helicopter a few years back It was the helicopter of my rival and he was trying to show me how much better his life was than mine All I had was the meat a far cry from a fully functional helicopter So even though he asked me not to bring meat onto his helicopter I insisted It made me feel less small Secure somehow
