Getty  Tibrina Hobson Candace Cameron Bure has never been shy about voicing her opinions on social and political issues  a trait that has made her an exceptionally good fit at ABCs The View as she stood out in contrast to the decidedly liberal viewpoints of many of her cohosts But aside from praying with Whoopi no less for the election cycle to be over soon A video posted by Candace Cameron Bure candacecbure on Oct 26 2016 at 935am PDT Bure has kept her 2016 voting plans under her hat noting earlier this summer that although she wasnt exactly thrilled with the remaining choices she absolutely planned to vote Ive talked about how conflicted I am Im not happy with the ultimate choices that were left with but Im still going to go out there and vote because I do believe that its my right And I think there are other things we have to consider And then theres the congressional power Theres also the seats in Congress And I think a lot of people who dont show up to vote for the president then forget that theres all these other people we get to vote into Congress So youre giving up so much just because you dont like the candidate choices She did reveal the issue that has her most concerned this election cycle  however in a recent podcast with The Church Boys The biggest thing for me is the Supreme Court justices because no matter who wins this election its four years maybe eight if theyre reelected but thats the maximum The Supreme Court justice seats will be until those people die  and that could be a very long time A number of Americans share Bures concern noting the age of several sitting justices According to ballotpedia  with the increasing likelihood that Justice Scalias seat will remain empty into the next presidents term the next president could potentially appoint four justices The average age at which a Supreme Court justice retires is 787 years old Justice Kennedy will be 80 when the next president takes office Justice Ginsburg will be 83 and Justice Breyer will be 78 Bure explained her concern by noting that she has spent time recently studying the bigger picture and the principles outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution If we get too far away from what our Founding Fathers wrote up for us in how this country will be different from all other ones then we will lose it But in order to hold on to what we have Bure says that its not about putting faith in Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton  or any candidate for that matter Instead she says her faith remains unshakable in Jesus Christ and that she will pray for the wisdom of whomever wins the election
