by Yves Smith Yves here This is a very important video from the Real News Network  and I wish there were a transcript so do take the trouble to listen to it One of the reasons for the ferocity of the howling from the Democratic Party hackocracy in the wake of the unexpected Trump vicory is that they are effectively cornered animals As political scientist Tom Ferguson explains the Democrats cant get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers which they have abjectly failed to do But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Trump has successfully peeled off Ferguson also has some important exit poll and early granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths For instance playing the gender card wasnt as successful as the media would lead you to believe Ferguson who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left does not rule out the idea that Trump could deliver on policies that would make him popular most important ones that would create more jobs and improve wages One expert close to the Sanders camp came to the same view separately months ago So while Trump may be stymied or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers its a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects 0 0 0 0 0 1
