Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton along with attorneys general in 10 other states are suing the Obama administration over the presidents directive to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom that matches their gender preferenceThe lawsuit is an attempt to make sure states can ignore the federal governments mandateThe 10 other states joining the lawsuit include Arkansas Oklahoma Alabama Wisconsin West Virginia Tennessee Maine Louisiana Utah and GeorgiaTheyre asking the courts to declare the directive unlawful accusing the administration of engineering a massive social experiment flouting the democratic process and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rightsSupporters of the lawsuit argue that in addition to violating privacy and safety rights of women and children the White House directive is a major overreach of powerSimply put the Obama administration is creating new law outside the boundaries of the Constitution  making changes only Congress can make Paxton saidI think the problem with the way the Obama administration has carried this out is that they havent candidly assessed the cost of this type of policy Trotter said on NPRSo we understand that women need privacy They need safety in places that they frequent And yet the Obama administration has decided to reinterpret an old law that never included transgender people for over 40 years she saidTrotter said the president is doing this from a Washington onesizefitsall edict instead of going through Congress and having a national discussionSome schools are now worried if they dont comply they will lose fundingWe dont have a rule of law if we can reinterpret a more than 40yearold law and say that the plain language the black letter of the law is meaningless because someone has become enlightened about it Trotter saidTexas lieutenant governor previously went as far as to say the state is willing to give up the 10 billion it receives in federal education dollars rather than complyThe directive from the US Justice and Education Departments represents an escalation in what the Obama administration calls a civil rights issueThis is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we as a people and as a country have enacted to protect them  indeed to protect all of us US Attorney General Loretta Lynch saidThis isnt the only legal fight over transgender rights Earlier this month the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina sued each other over a state law curbing public restroom access for transgender peopleThe question of whether federal civil rights law protects those who identify as transgender has no definitive answer and will likely be decided by the US Supreme CourtStill schools that refuse to comply with the Obama administrations directive could very likely be hit with civil rights lawsuits from the government and a cutoff from federal aid to education
