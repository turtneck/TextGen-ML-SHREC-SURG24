The GOP establishment has seen all of its candidates not merely beaten but utterly humiliated by an aggressively ignorant demagogue whose rhetoric makes him sound like a cheap knockoff of Benito Mussolini and George WallaceWhy A look at the facts of American economic life suggests that the rubes have decided theyre tired of being played for marks which explains why the GOP establishments siren song about the Land of Opportunity is no longer doing the trickThe basic myth the right wing of The Money Party has sold to Republican voters over the past 40 years the left wing of the party is called the Democrats goes like this the economy boomed in the decades immediately after World War II and standards of living rose rapidly But since then too much government regulation too many taxes and an overly generous welfare system that has made Those Peopleeven lazier than they were before have combined to kill the American dreamThat is why ordinary Americans aka working and middleclass white people have bank accounts that dont reflect the rewards they should have received for all their hard work If not for government meddling we would have a thriving economy just like the one we enjoyed back in the good old daysAll this is a fantastic lie as a glance at the actual economic history of America since 1945 illustrates In what follows all figures have been converted to constant inflationadjusted dollarsAmerica is a vastly wealthier country today than it was forty years ago Furthermore on a perperson basis the countrys wealth has increased far more over the past four decades than it did in the thirty years immediately after World War IIHere are the numbers between 1945 and 1974 per capita GDP in the US grew from 17490 to 27837 That is an impressive improvement but it pales in comparison to what has happened since in 2014 per capita GDP was 55185 ie almost exactly double what it was in 1974 In terms of economic output the country is twice as rich per person now as it was thenWhere has all this money gone The answer ought to shock anyone who cares about either economic opportunity or increasing inequality The average household income of the bottom 50 of American households was 25475 in 1974 and 26520 in 2014 In other words half the population has gotten essentially none of the extra 10trillion dollars of national wealth that the American economy has generated over the past forty yearsKeep in mind that this group includes fully half of the nations middle class by every standard definition of that category Meanwhile over this same time the average household income of the top five percent of American households most of the members of this group would not of course consider themselves rich let alone part of the actual plutocracy has gone from 187729 to 332347 As for the really rich the numbers are truly staggering in constant inflationadjusted dollars the household income of the top 001 roughly the nations 13000 richest households increased by about sevenfold from less than 5 million to more than 30 million per year Of course some of Trumps appeal is based on his willingness to exploit racism and xenophobia while speaking to the economic anxieties of white middle and working class voters But establishment politicians are making a big mistake when they underestimate the extent to which Trumps message  crude and bombastic as it is  that Americans were winners but are now losers resonates with the actual life experience of so many people These people are angry about what has happened to them and their communities and especially angry about the empty promises of a Republican party that is run for the almost exclusive benefit of the rich The half of America that gets along on 40000 or 25000 or 10000 per year doesnt care about cutting capital gains taxes or getting rid of the estate tax which already exempts the first 11 million of a married couples wealth and it isnt enthusiastic about slashing Social Security and Medicare either To the contrary all these things are the pet projects of the Republican donor class For forty years the GOP has managed to manipulate culture war issues and racial and ethnic animosities to hide from its base two facts the contemporary Republican party exists to protect the economic interests of that class and those interests dont actually align with the economic interests of middle and workingclass Americans even if they happen to be white and culturally conservative That it took a shameless foulmouthed egomaniacal reality TV star to speak this truth in such a way that Republican voters would hear it is a sad comment on the state of our politics and culture
