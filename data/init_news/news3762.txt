This November full moon will be unlike any other you have ever seen We have all seen supermoons before but this particular full moon will be the second in a series of three this fall The moon will peak on Monday November 14th and it will be closer to the Earth than any other since 1948 The full moon will not come this close to Earth until 2034 The scientific term for a moon this magnificent is perigree moon which refers to when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit When a perigree moon is full it is known as a supermoon This months supermoon will appear 30 brighter and 14 larger than a normal full moon This means that the night of November 14th will be one you will want to go outside for NASA reports that we will be able to see a moon illusion that will make the moon look exceptionally big when viewed through foreground objects like tall buildings The moon will reach the crest of its full moon phase at 852 am Eastern time but it will look exceptionally big and bright all night Astronomers have been monitoring the moon closely in order to better understand our solar system For the past seven years NASAs Lunar Reonnaissance Orbiter LRO has been mapping the surface of the moon as well as taking highresolution photos to better understand the moon and Earth Mapping the surface of the moon and learning about how its been impacted by collisions with asteroids can shed light on the Earths history as well If you miss this months supermoon you will have one more chance to catch the last supermoon of 2016 on December 14th Yet the December supermoon will not be as magnificent as the one coming up in November so mark your calendars and go outside with friends and family to see this once in a lifetime show Ariana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacycom She is an avid nature enthusiast gardener photographer writer hiker dreamer and lover of all things sustainable wild and free Ariana strives to bring people closer to their true source Mother Nature She graduated The Evergreen State College with an undergraduate degree focusing on Sustainable Design and Environmental Science Follow her adventures on Instagram
