On behalf of the US House of Representatives I extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Christmas this yearWe spend a lot of time this season asking for what we want But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more But all of usat all timesneed more of what is good And this year I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas a courageous humilityIt took courage for God to humble Himself He came down from heaven and became a mana child in a manger He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us He would have to give up His only Son At first this might seem like a sad story But we are to rejoice in the Lord always Christmas is a day of celebration And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize what a gift Hes given uswhat a profound act of loveAnd so we rejoice This year may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly May we recognize that our way is not the only wayit is not even the right way It is Gods way we seek May we cherish all the gifts we have been givenespecially the men and women of our armed forces the people who keep us safe And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first It is courageous to do the right thingMay we remember and be braveand be gladRepublican Paul Ryan is Speaker of the US House of Representatives He represents Wisconsins 1st Congressional District Follow him on Twitter SpeakerRyan
