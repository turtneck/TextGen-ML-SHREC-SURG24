Will the antiClinton revolt among American elites gain momentum November 7 2016  Fort Russ Mikhail Khazin  one of the top Russian economists Translated from Russian by Kristina Kharlova There are rumors of revolt in the US state apparatus in the broad sense of the word against Hillary Clinton Note that the top layer of the US establishment still supports Clinton squashing any signs of disobedience FBI closes cases newspapers stop printing nasty things about her and so on But one way or the other the issue floats to the surface One of the likely reasons for this is that Hillary Clinton is actively trading the national sovereignty of the United States in the framework of the activities of her foundation In other words American patriots consider her a traitor And as it turned out this factor may play a decisive role Previously it was not so obvious In particular the latest issue  the sale by Lockheed Martin to Turkey of a few dozen fighters of the fifth generation Clinton is an old lobbyist for this company so there is no doubt that its her achievement The problem is that Turkey under the current circumstances may cease to be a US ally and no one can guarantee that these fighters do not fall into the hands of potential adversaries For this reason I do not exclude that these actions led to the resumption of the case against Clinton by the FBI The results of tomorrows elections remain unclear But one thing is for sure there are many people in the US who do not advertise their fondness of Trump but in reality are ready to support him in the election That is why the result of the vote may be surprising Follow us on Facebook
