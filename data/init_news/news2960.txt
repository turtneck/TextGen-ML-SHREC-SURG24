Europe is struggling with the greatest massmovement of people across its borders since World War II And the crisis has exposed the limitations and gaps in its immigration systemA Greek riot police officer r stands guard as migrants and refugees wait a registration procedure at the national stadium of the Greek island of Kos on August 12Europe is experiencing the largest movement of people across its borders since World War II and it is struggling Its not just wrestling with capacity and enforcement as the crush of Middle Easterners and Africans take to the Mediterranean and trek across frontiers but also testing the limits of its humanitarianismThe human tide has weighed heavily on some countries and inundated swaths of European countryside or urban space  eliciting fortitude and generosity of spirit which has been undercovered It has also revealed a dark side to the continent fences tear gas riots and hate speechTodays migrants are as poor or traumatized as those refugees during World War II but many are also black or Muslim They stand out in communities that have long known nothing but homogeneity And they are entering at a time when EU citizens question what it really means to live in the 28member unionThese questions have been brewing for years but the sheer scale of migration has thrust them suddenly from abstract scenarios into a situation demanding answers now Through July of this year some 340000 have attempted to reach Europes doorstep according to EU statistics nearly three times the same period of last year And so far nearly 2440 have died tryingIn an ongoing series called Seeking Refuge the Monitor has searched for themes and lessons learned in the midst of one of the European Unions greatest modern testsWhen a boat capsized in April off of Libya killing nearly 800 migrants on board the argument that the EU should scale back patrols to deter migration  as they were doing at the time of the tragedy  was flipped on its headRescue patrols and walls factor into a migrants choices to attempt the trip but it doesnt deter his or her decision to leave war or poverty Life is still better in EuropeThat has been put in sharp focus in Greece We kicked off the series on the island of Kos where migrants were steadily streaming in amid an economic crisis that sapped the Greek states capacity  or appetite  to house and care for thousands of newcomers Since then tens of thousands have arrived anyway with 21000 showing up in one week in August alone2 Much of Europe see the migrants as the other guys problemGreece and Italy face the physical crush of arrivals while Germany Sweden and Britain are where most migrants want to go Germany announced this week that it expects 750000 asylum claims this year four times more than last yearYet in between are nearly two dozen countries that do not see migration as their problem An EU plan to relocate and resettle some 60000 migrants has sent much of Europe into an emotional tailspin One of the countries feeling the brunt of criticism for not doing its part is BritainCentral and Eastern Europe meanwhile which have almost no experience with this type of migration condemned Brussels for placing a burden on their shoulders where they say it doesnt belong  even though emigration has long been that regions only escape valve In the end a broad mandatory relocation plan was torpedoed in favor of a smaller voluntary one  which nonetheless continues to rileThere is no incentive for central European countries to accept relocation They dont see it as their problemsaid ElizabethCollett director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe in BrusselsFor all of the anger directed at Brussels critics make a valid point too Europes system for accepting migrants doesnt work The policy thats been most tested is theDublin Regulation the European treaty that stipulates that refugees must have their asylum applications processed by the EU country they first set foot in Though the convention is meant to be mandatory overloaded periphery countries are turning a blind eye to the migrants who wish to move on as virtually all doSo the migrants easily leave and take advantage of another European rule that applies to most countries in the bloc the passportfree Schengen zoneEarlier in the summer France started checking passports at its frontier with Italy to dissuade migrants from entering  a violation of Schengen rules particularly as it happened just as Europeans kicked off the summer vacation seasonThis is a muchwider problem than Schengen but Schengen is the victim because it becomes a symbol of all the fears that we are defenseless explainedMarcPierini a visiting scholar on European policy at Carnegie Europe in BrusselsNow many of those same migrants who crossed the ItalianFrench border are amassing in Calais at Frances northern edge This time they face a harder task moving onto their final destination Britain both because of geography and because Britain is not part of Schengen Thousands have stormed the Eurotunnel this summer leaving at least nine dead4 Some Europeans have been magnanimousThis migration crisis has given a highprofile platform to xenophobia It has led Hungary where numbers of migrants entering has dramatically spiked to start building a wall The Slovakian government said it would accept refugees from Syria but only Christian ones not MuslimsAnd yet there are European citizens who are trying to rise above the fear As the newest flashpoint has appeared in the Balkans at Greeces border with Macedonia authorities have tried to keep them back with batons Meanwhile one group waits for their arrival  with suppliesIve never seen anything like this said Gabriela Andreevska a young Macedonian who spends most nights at the border helping the migrants trying to reach the EU So many people sleeping on concrete Theyre there and you cant turn a blind eyeIn the heated discussion about Europes migration crisis which can bleed into the wider debate over security and terrorismits easy to forget the most important lesson of all Each migrant is a person with families back home and a lifetime of aspiration and regret behind him or herThe Monitor captured the human element by following the path of two Syrians through Europes borders until they finally reached northern Europe Living in a tidy apartment in Germany wellhoused and fed and nearly guaranteed to be granted refugee status one of them was still anxious his mother and sister were still in warravaged SyriaI want to bring my family and Im just wasting time he said I dont want to see one of them in the news someday
