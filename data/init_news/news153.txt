Email This Week in the News You wouldnt know it by watching the news but there are actually important things going on in the world that have nothing to do with the Presidential election Today well talk about some of these nonelectionrelated events on Survival Saturday like the Dakota access pipeline Russia Venezuela and our dystopian future For election coverage go on over to my other website DaisyLuthercom  which is all Hillary all the time right up until the election My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement Have you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government  Here are the important things to know about the protest  Trust me youll want to read this Everyone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September The federal government ordered a halt to work on a 38 billion fourstate oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the project The US Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldnt authorize construction near Lake Oahe a culturally important location to the tribe until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act  source  Unfortunately the governments willingness to do the right thing was shortlived Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose  but not by who you might think Protestors have been nonviolent but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal Theyve beaten up on young people old people and independent journalists covering the story Hundreds have been arrested These people are protecting their water sources and their way of life and they are being brutalized by our own government The story youre getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair That couldnt be further from the truth The AntiMedia who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards has provided truthful coverage and it is ugly Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors Right now this affects some people up in North Dakota But what about when someone wants to build something across your land What about when someone wants to seize your home What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard Heres what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests  Its on film Its ugly You owe it to your fellow human beings to witness this and be outraged Go here to learn what you can do to help  With all of this progress is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete Thousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor Weve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital Is this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few I dont watch a lot of documentaries but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete  This film is available for free on Amazon  and it isnt one of those dry boring ones that keep you shifting in your seat in order to stay awake Its fascinating from the moment you hit play When it was over we sat there in silence for at least a minute aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now I cant recommend this highly enough Everyone should watch it Let me quote Morpheus from the Matrix  for a moment here This is your last chance After this there is no turning back You take the blue pillthe story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe You take the red pillyou stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes Remember all Im offering is the truth Nothing more This documentary is the red pill Take it if you want to survive the future that is coming for us all Watch Obsolete then come back over here and lets talk about it I think this will spark a very interesting conversation How will you prepare for a future in which humanity is largely obsolete Meanwhile in Venezuela Things are still awful there although there hasnt been as much news coverage Basically this is how life is now for Venezuelans and recovering from this collapse could take decades Currently the people of the country are revolting against the unpopular president Nicholas Maduro A campaign had begun for a recall election in order to replace Maduro but authorities halted the process The electoral council cited fraud when faced with huge numbers of signatures on a petition Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets Source Federico Parra AFPGetty Images NPR reports  The demonstrators were protesting what they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press As for Maduro he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power via elections or legal means ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution  If they launch a supposed political trial which is not in our constitution the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution even if they are members of Congress Whats more in a conversation with the American DEA Maduros nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US which is news to most Americans Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family He was caught attempting to smuggle 5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US The Charlotte Observer reported  Efrain Campowas recorded saying were at war with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail according to the transcript which was filed in federal district court in New York We need the money Campo said according to the transcript Why Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money Do you understand The opposition    is getting an infusion of a lot of money The defense has sought to paint Campo and his cousin as victims of a US political plot against the Venezuelan government and has asserted that they didnt have the knowledge or capability to pull off such a complicated transaction Were irritating the snot out of Russia Lately the Powers That Shouldnt Be great phrase borrowed from my friend Mel at Truthstream Media  have been going out of their way to paint Russia and Vladimir Putin as the biggest threat to America A bigger threat even than Hillary Clinton and boy thats a stretch Im pretty sure you can put all of these recent headlines together and get a picture of where this is headed  Hint  There are many more but I dont want this post to be a lengthy novel about idiocy
