We Are Change Hey  had you heard that uranium is an incredibly scarce resource and that Russia is buying it all up No me neither But thats what Ive discovered on the campaign trail Apparently a few years back Hillary Clinton betrayed the country  yet again  by selling 20 of our precious uranium supply to Russia in return for yet more payolaAs secretary of state she approved a deal to sell Uranium One a company that controlled a fifth of US uranium production to the Russian atomic agency Rosatom In return she and Bill received vast amounts of payoffs from the Kremlin and related interests  most notably a 500000 speaker fee for Bill from a Moscowbased investment bank which works out at about 250000 net of taxMoney also went to the Clinton Foundation charity from which the Clintons personally steal money through a channel so clever and cynical that it remains hidden The deal is a perfect example of Clinton Corruption says Donald Trump As secretary of state Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take control of about 20 of Americas uranium supply to the RussiansIt shows the long and lucrative history of financial deals with the Russians particularly with the Russian government says Peter Schweizer author of the book Clinton Cash director of the film of the same name and an editor at large for the alwaysreliable Breitbart website Uranium is a fundamental issue of national security Schweizer told Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Its not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places They are precious few places you can mine for uranium in the United States is one of those areasEven the New York Times  a wholly owned subsidiary of the Worldwide ClintonIlluminatiSpectre Cabal  was critical Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal it reported in a big expose published earlier this year in which it even floated the prospect of a Putin monopoly of uranium down the roadIts all very very troubling Apart from just one teensy weeny little problemUranium isnt a scarce resource that Vladimir Putin or anyone else is about to controlUranium is a massive drug on the international commodity markets There is a worldwide glut It is produced all around the world and there is so much of it washing around that the price is in freefall  and has been for almost 10 years Right now the worlds uranium miners are so desperate that they are actually giving it away for less  literally  than it costs them to dig it out of the groundUranium prices have collapsed by a staggering 88 since their peak in the summer of 2007 They are down about three quarters since the February 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan which caused that country to switch off most of its reactors and caused everyone else to review their nuclearenergy productionAs it happens the price of this allegedly precious commodity just hit a new low of 20 a ton In 2007 it was 160 Its now half the price it was when the Russians took control of Uranium One According to the World Nuclear Association the miners trade body thats about 20 below the average cost of digging it out of the ground Two thirds of the worlds uranium costs more than 20 a pound to mineThe problem is that while lots of mines are producing it hardly anyone wants it Nearly all of the commercial use for uranium is for nuclear energy Nuclear reactors are being mothballed Plans for massive nuclear expansion are being shelved or reconsidered Fukushima caused a massive political backlash against nuclear energyEven countries that still plan on building many more reactors  such as China and India  started slowwalking their plans and rethinking And then the price of other sources of energy such as oil and gas collapsed So there is even less demand for new reactorsMeanwhile despite the panic US uranium output isnt very important anyway According to the World Nuclear Association the US ranks ninth among global producers Our production is less than one quarter of Australias and less than one tenth of Canadas The US accounts for about 2 of total uranium production worldwide  meaning that the US mines now in Putins hands account for about 04 of world outputWhoa You can really see why Vladimir Putin wanted control of it  and why the Clintons were able to charge him in return a stratospheric 250000 net plus of course the secret funds stolen from the Clinton Foundation in returnWhy hasnt there been an investigation Where is the FBI when you really need itOK maybe technically Hillary didnt personally actually approve the deal Turns out she had no actual veto power over it But she was one of many people who could have referred it to the president who could have blocked it There are lots of others who also approved it including multiple regulators and stock exchanges around the world Uranium One is actually a Canadian company The fact that they all waved it through just shows how wide the Clintons tentacles really stretchBut I always like to end on a positive note and I have one now If uranium really is a scarce and precious resource and Vladimir Putin is secretly trying to corner the market as so many of these sources allege then obviously sooner or later the price is going to explode And if thats true I know an easy way you can guarantee yourself a fortuneJust go out and buy stock in Uranium Participation Corp URPTF 036 a publicly traded Canadian company that functions effectively as a uranium trust It simply owns a lot of uranium on behalf of investors Its price has of course absolutely collapsed along with the underlying price of the uranium in its vaults and the stock is now at record lowsAlthough it is a Canadian stock and its primary exchange is in Toronto the stock also trades freely over the counter in the USI assume that all those people raging against Hillarys evil uranium sell out to Putin and warning about the coming uranium apocalypse have plunged tons of their own money into the stock RightAnd if they havent  what does that tell youVia Market Watch Follow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat LukeWeAreChange fbook httpsfacebookcomLukeWeAreChange
