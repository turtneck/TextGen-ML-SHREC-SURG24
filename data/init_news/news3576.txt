Russias military moves in Syria are fundamentally changing the face of the countrys civil war putting President Bashar alAssad back on his feet and may complicate the Obama administrations plans to expand its air operations against the Islamic StateSo far the administration has not budged in its twofold strategy  direct airstrikes against the Islamic State and significant aid for those fighting against it and a push for negotiations to end what has been the largely separate Syrian civil warSenior administration officials acknowledge that Russia has already made some tactical gains in the civil war even as they insist President Vladimir Putin will ultimately pay for what they describe as a strategic blunder that will undercut his already tenuous reputation in the world and encourage the spread of the militantsIf Putins goal was to get attention one senior official said then it was brilliant  If it was to end the fighting in Syria thats where we think its a strategic error At the same time the official said Russia is now going to be viewed as being antiSunni  attracting the ire of extremist groups including the Islamic StateBut others within the administration and many outside experts are increasingly worried that if President Obama does not take decisive action  such as quickly moving to claim the airspace over northwestern Syria and the Turkish border where Russian jets are already operating  it is the United States that will suffer significant damage to both its reputation and its foreign policy and counterterrorism goalsPutin has said he does not intend to launch military ground operations in Syria and senior administration officials said Wednesday that they see no evidence of any ground combat units there But the Russian deployments include sophisticated electronics some of them designed to jam aviation electronics Other than Russia and the Syrian government only the USled coalition against the Islamic State is flying planes in SyriaThe current internal administration debate is largely the same one that has kept the administration out of significant intervention in Syrias civil war for the past four years On one side Russias involvement has strengthened the winning argument that the United States should avoid direct involvement in yet another Middle East conflict and should continue directing its resources toward countering forces such as the Islamic State that pose a direct threat to US national securityOn the other side the argument is that it makes no strategic sense for the United States to concede Russian dominance of the situation If Russia succeeds in keeping Assad in power the problems in the West caused by both the Syrian war and militant expansion will only get worsePutins strategy is that you accept our terms on Assad and then we step back and let you solve your own problems in Syria said Igor Sutyagin a Russianstudies expert at Londons Royal United Services Institute If you dont we create a complete mess  increasing the influx of refugees into Europe and your life gets more difficultWorldViews Why Russia is in SyriaThe administration has said that the civil war can be solved only through negotiations and that there can be no solution that leaves Assad in power Until the middle of last month the opposition  a wide assortment of groups ranging from CIAtrained rebels to nonIslamic State extremists  appeared to be turning the tide against the Syrian military taking territory in Idlib and Aleppo provinces in the northwest and on the southern front near the Jordanian borderThe only viable future for a unified Syria is one that unites the moderate elements and what remains of the regime after Assad is pushed out a US intelligence official said Wednesday But Russias actions have directly threatened that prospectRecent efforts by the United Nations and others to organize new negotiations beginning with localized ceasefires have already begun to fall apart under Russian bombardment that is likely to change Assads calculus Some see the Kremlins goal as maintaining Assads control over a rump Syrian state in western population centers away from areas of Islamic State dominion an objective that would also ensure Russias continued foothold in the Middle EastIf the possibility of negotiations existed until one or two weeks ago we definitely find ourselves today  in a completely different place said one international official who has long been involved in the effort Weve been completely blown out of the waterA ceasefire reached with Iran and Hezbollah to allow aid and evacuation of civilians from Zabadani west of Damascus near the Lebanese border has now unraveled because of Russian action the international official said Although coordinates had been shared with Russia and plans were in place for UN officials to enter the area Saturday it has been bombed three times said the official who like other US and international officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberationsRussia has said that its purpose is to strike the Islamic State But the vast majority of its targets have been in areas of opposition control in western Syria and are seen as paving the way for Assads forces to take territory lost to the rebels or never contested The strategy is much the same as the one the administration has followed against the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq where air power is designed to weaken the militants and allow local forces to move in and hold groundAssads military also backed by Russian and Iranian supplies and intelligence and new influxes of Iranian and Hezbollah fighters appear to stand a good chance of regaining the initiative against the Syrian rebels many of whom say they fear they are being abandoned by the United StatesThe growing involvement of Russia in the Syrian conflict is likely to lead to even greater civilian displacement and further complicates delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance Mercy Corps said in a statement WednesdayPeople are increasingly moving closer to the border with Turkey so they can cross if things get too bad said Michael Bowers vice president of the aid organizationAn alternative nightmare scenario has already begun to play out as CIAarmed rebels have begun fighting against Syrian troops moving into Russianbombed areas part of the USRussia proxy war that Obama has vowed to avoidAs rebel forces reposition themselves farther south in Idlib and Hama provinces the Islamic State is likely to gain a stronger foothold in the northwest region along the Turkish border to the north of Aleppo Syrias secondlargest cityThat region has been under discussion between the United States and Turkey as a possible protected area where rebels can regroup and refugees can gather Last week Obama approved shaping operations including some airstrikes to prepare for a proposed major increase in antiIslamic State airstrikes by US and coalition planes flying from Turkish basesBut Russian operations in the area may complicate those plans and push the administration toward a decision to confront Moscow  one that it has so far not wanted to make Turkey and NATO have already warned Russia after at least two incursions of Turkish airspaceThey are sending planes and messages to Turkey and NATO said Sutyagin once a military policy expert for the Russian government The message he said is that this area where you want to establish safe zones  is not safe because we are approaching there entering your airspace and there might be
