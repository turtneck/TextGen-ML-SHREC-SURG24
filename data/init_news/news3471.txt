With about 900000 concealed handgun permit holders in Texas there is a good chance that someone next you in a Lone Star State grocery store or restaurant is carrying a concealed handgun Starting Friday Texas will join 44 other states that already allow people to openly carry handguns throughout the stateAmidst todays threats of terrorism and mass public shootings it is a good thing when we enable people to legally carry guns and protect themselvesUnder the new law a person will need a concealed handgun permit to be able to openly carry a gunIf the experiences of other states are any guide few people will actually openly carry their handguns Moreover businesses can still prohibit guns or request that they be concealed However the Chief Financial Officer of Kroger Americas largest supermarket chain has just said that the company will allow open carry He says that the company hasnt encountered any problems with open carry Other supermarket companies such as Whole Foods Randalls and HEB will be posting signs banning open carry They will still be allowing concealed carryThese bans may be short lived When Texas originally passed concealed carry in 1996 many stores initially posted signs banning concealed carry With a few years those signs all but disappearedAn odd nuance in Texas law has led to much national attention in the last couple of years Before Friday people were allowed to openly carry rifles just not handguns No problems ever occurred but simply the additional handling required for carrying rifle as opposed to keeping a holstered handgun certainly created concern that something might go wrongSome such as Michael Bloombergs Everytown advocacy group put pressure on companies to ban openly carried riflesHillary Clinton also chimed in The idea that you could have an open carry permit with an AK47 over your shoulder walking down the isles of a Supermarket is just despicableStarbucks Jack in the Box Chipotle Wendys Applebees Chilis and Sonics all respectfully request that customers not openly carry guns More importantly however they still allow people to carry a concealed gunOpenly carrying handguns are less threatening than rifles and will likely face no greater PR issues than they have in other statesBut open carry has an important drawback It isnt as effective as concealed carry in protecting people against terrorist attacks and mass public shootingsCriminals and terrorists can strike anywhere and at any time They can attack someone who is openly carrying a gun Alternatively they can select another target or wait for a more opportune momentConcealed carry is the most effective way of counteracting this strategic advantage A killer cant attack a big grocery store in Texas without facing likely resistance And of course an attacker has no idea who might be packing heatSince at least 1950 all but two of the mass public shootings in the US and every single one in Europe has occurred in a gunfree zonePoliceOne the largest private organization of police officers in the US recently asked its 450000 members Considering the particulars of recent mass shooting tragedies like Newtown and Aurora what level of impact do you think a legallyarmed citizen could have made Eighty percent said Casualties would likely have been reducedIn the US over 13 million American civilians are licensed to carry concealed handgunsEvery day permit holders stop crimes But they have also stopped a large and growing number of mass public shootingsConcealed carry in Texas isnt as common as you may think  just over 4 percent of the states adult population has permits But the rate is more than twice as high in Pennsylvania and Florida both also large statesTheres a simple reason for this Texas charges a permit fee of 140  one of the highest in the country Lower fees would increase the number of concealed carry permits and the number of people who can protect others It would especially help the most likely victims of violent crime  poor black men and women living in highcrime urban areasA year from now I predict that people will wonder why such a fuss was made about open carryWhile Michael Bloomberg may have scored some temporary PR victories against open carry his fear tactics will be discredited in the longrunJohn R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission Lott is also a leading expert on guns and opeds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center He is the author of nine books including More Guns Less Crime His latest book is The War on Guns Arming Yourself Against Gun Control Lies August 1 2016 Follow him on Twitterjohnrlottjr
