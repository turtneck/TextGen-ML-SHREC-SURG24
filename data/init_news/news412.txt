Human remains recovered from the crash site of EgyptAir Flight 804 showed burn marks and were very tiny suggesting an explosion brought down the plane a senior Egyptian forensics official told the Associated Press TuesdayMeanwhilea US official briefed on the latest intelligence told Fox NewsAll signs continue to point to terrorismThe official who spoke to the AP claimed he personally examined the remains of some of the planes 66 passengers and crew at a Cairo morgue He said all 80 pieces brought to Cairo so far are small and that there isnt even a whole body part like an arm or a headHe added that at least one part of an arm had signs of burns  an indication it might have belonged to a passenger sitting next to the explosionThe US official speaking to Fox News said American satellites could have missed a potential explosion over the eastern MediterraneanContrary to popular belief we cannot see every part of the earth all the timeThe official said most US satellites would be trained to positons on land and known areas of interest and not focused over an empty part of the sea particularly the eastern MediterraneanThe official would not rule out an explosion took place To date no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the EgyptAir disasterThe Airbus A320 crashed early Thursday morning near the end of a fight from Paris to CairoAn independent Cairo newspaper alWatan quoted an unnamed forensics official Tuesday as saying the plane blew up in midair but that it was unclear whether the blast was caused by the an explosive device or something else The official also said the remains retrieved so far are no larger than the size of a handBut Egypts head of forensics denied the statements Tuesday Reuters reported citing state news agency MENAEverything published about this matter is completely false and mere assumptions that did not come from the Forensics Authority MENA quoted Hesham Abdelhamid as sayingAnalysts who spoke to Fox News also said the body parts could have been broken up in a similar way upon impact with waterFamily members of the victims arrived Tuesday at a Cairo morgues forensics department to give DNA samples to help identify the remains of their kin a security official said The official also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reportersAn international effort to hunt for the planes cockpit voice and data recorder resumed Tuesday with ships and planes from Britain Cyprus France Greece and the United States taking part in the searchThe search area is roughly halfway between Egypts coastal city of Alexandria and the Greek island of Crete where the water is 8000 to 10000 feet deepThe head of Egypts staterun provider of air navigation services Ehab Azmy told The Associated Press Monday that the plane did not swerve or lose altitude before it disappeared off radar challenging an earlier account by Greeces defense ministerAzmy head of the National Air Navigation Services Company said that in the minutes before the plane disappeared it was flying at its normal altitude of 37000 feet according to the radar reading That fact degrades what the Greeks are saying about the aircraft suddenly losing altitude before it vanished from radar he addedThere was no turning to the right or left and it was fine when it entered Egypts FIR flight information region which took nearly a minute or two before it disappeared Azmy saidGreeces defense minister Panos Kammenos had said the plane swerved wildly and dropped to 10000 feet before it fell off radarGreek civil aviation authorities said the flight appeared normal until air traffic controllers were to hand it over to their Egyptian counterparts The pilot did not respond to their calls and then the plane vanished from radarsIt was not immediately possible to explain the discrepancy between the Greek and Egyptian accounts of the air disasterA 2013 report by the Egyptian ministry of civil aviation records that the Airbus 320 in the crash made an emergency landing in Cairo that year shortly after taking off on its way to Istanbul when one of the engines overheatedIt said that the EgyptAir A320 GCC took off from Cairo airport heading to Istanbul at 253 and that when it reached an altitude of 24000 feet the pilot noticed that one engine had overheated A warning message appeared on the screen reading engine number 1 stall After checking on best measures to take the pilot headed back to Cairos airport where a maintenance engineer inspected the engine disconnected it and sent it to be repairedThere were no injuries no fire and no damage to the plane the report read adding that the engine had a technical problemThe report is one of over 60 reports classified by the ministry as incidents serious incidents and accidents that took place between 2011 and 2014 Among them 20 involved A320 Airbus planes the highest among any other aircraftExperts contacted by AP said that while an overheated engine is not a common problem it is unlikely to cause a crashDavid Learmount a widely respected aviation expert and editor of the authoritative Flightglobal magazine said engine overheat is rare but it happensHe said that the pilot can shut down the engine and aircrafts can operate with a single engineI dont think engine overheat alone has ever caused an aircraft to crash An engine fire could cause a crash but has not done so in the modern aviation era he addedFox News Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report
