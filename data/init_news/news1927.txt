Three days before Floridas climactic primary Marco Rubio sank deep into a black leather armchair on his campaign bus He had just spent 25 minutes smiling wide for supporters at a highend boutique selling 150 candles Dont forget to vote on Tuesday he shouted from the third step of a woodpaneled staircase Now on his parked bus the afternoon sunlight shut out by drawn blinds the smile was gone The candidate knew it was already overThere will be a reckoning he warnedThere will be a reckoning in the mainstream media where all these networks and cable networks are going to have to ask themselves why did they give so much coverage for the sake of ratings he said There will be a reckoning in the conservative movement where a lot of people who for a long time have espoused conservative principles seem to not care about those anymore in rallying around Donald Trump because they like his attitudeI think there are a lot of people in the conservative movement who are going to spend years and years explaining to people how they fell into this and how they allowed this to happenFor now though it is Rubios reckoning thats at hand And not just because of Trump or cable television networksRubios strategy was always an inside straightoverly reliant on a candidates ability to dominate free national media in order to outperform outwit and eventually outlast a wide field of rivals It was sketched out by an inner circle of advisers who believed they could eschew the very fundamentals of presidential campaigning because they had a candidate who transcendedThats exactly what happened in 2016 it just turned out Rubio wasnt the one transcendingEven before his picturesque launch at symbolic Freedom Tower in Miami last spring Rubios aides were hardly the only ones who saw in Rubio an answer to the Republican Partys prayers a young charismatic and Hispanic conservative the son of a bartender and a maid with remarkably broad appeal across a GOP spectrum riven by ideological and stylistic divisions Hed been plastered on the cover of Time as The Republican Savior Rubio was the kind of rare talent who could win a primary and then articulate a conservative message that resonated in a fastchanging country in the generalAnd he scared the daylights out of the DemocratsSo while other campaigns touted shock and awe fundraising networks and precise psychographic analytics and voter targeting operations Rubios tightknit group of mostly 40something bros believed wholeheartedly that they didnt need a specific earlystate win They didnt need a particular political base They didnt need to talk process They didnt need a ground game They didnt need to be the immediate frontrunnerAll they needed was MarcoTheir confidence bordered on arrogance Sure his closest adviserscampaign manager Terry Sullivan and media strategists Todd Harris and Heath Thompsonwere right that their candidate was likable He began the race as the second choice of many Republican primary voters They just never figured out how to make voters embrace him as their firstTrump was drawing away the cameras they had banked on lifting their rising star sucking up all the media attention as he dominated media cycle after media cycle setting the parameters of the 2016 debate day after day Suddenly their telegenic candidate couldnt get on TVAnd when Rubio stumbled as all candidates do there was no infrastructure to catch him no field program to lift his support no base to fall back uponAll they had was MarcoAs Jeb Bush was quickly beset by leaks backbiting and inflated expectations Rubios campaign more closely resembled the Barack Obama model of 2008 from the start It was a closeknit group led by Sullivan Thompson and Harris with Alex Conant Rubios communications director since 2011 Rich Beeson the deputy campaign manager pollster Whit Ayers and a few others in the innermost circleThey held conference calls three times a week to stay on the same page and based their headquarters only a few blocks from Capitol Hill to better coordinate with Rubio when the Senate was in session Sullivan ran a tight ship In the early months of the campaign he insisted on personally signing off on every expense above 500 The limit was later relaxed but symbolic of a campaign that knew it had to scrimp to compete with Bush whose super PAC hauled in 100 million in the first half of 2015The campaign spared no expense in setting up events to be televisionfriendly There were invariably press risers tidy backdrops and television lighting to portray Rubio quite literally in the best imaginable lightBut one of the things Sullivan seemed least interested in was field offices The campaign would force volunteers and supporters to pay for their own yard signs posters and bumper stickersRubio seemed to agree In August he was due to open his Iowa state headquarters the morning after flipping pork chops at the state fair but he bailed at the last minute The reason heading back to Florida for his childrens start of school The grand opening would be delayed for 10 days and it would occur without Rubio He wouldnt announce a state director to run operations in the crucial caucuses for another monthIt was a fitting episode for a campaign that had bragged about how staff could work just as well out of a Starbucks with a laptop The campaign wouldnt announce supporters in Iowas various regions until January 2016 and only then under intensifying pressure from allies And when campaign officials announced their field offices they wouldnt say exactly where they actually were making it all but impossible for volunteers to volunteerIts not that Rubios team didnt know the data science that powered Obamas two campaigns or that studies showed that door knocks and personal phone calls are among the most effective means to get out the vote Its that theyre expensive and timeconsuming And Rubios team thought they had figured out a better way targeting exactly their voters with pinpoint precision online on TV and in the mailIts almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win said one Rubio supporter very familiar with the campaigns planning Were they just fucking lazy or arrogantIn fact they had designed a campaign to fit neatly with Rubios own conception of himself as master political communicatorMarco is convinced and perhaps rightly so that he has the skills to convince anyone said Dan Gelber who served for eight years in the Florida Legislature with Rubio including two as the Democratic counterpart when Rubio was GOP speaker He really believes that if you give him an audience he can turn them to his way of thinkingDonors were unnerved by it though So Terry Sullivan outlined the plans to some of Rubios supporters at a closeddoor strategy session at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas in OctoberThe campaigns goal Sullivan explained was simply to put Rubio in front of as many voters as possible as often as possible according to an attendee And that meant getting free media coverage and buying paid television ads So the campaign had locked in ad rates earlypaying as little as 10 cents for every dollar spent by Bushs super PAC At times theyd spend far less than Bushs allies and still outadvertise themThe team wanted Marco to sell himself on TV not rely on secondrate surrogates or volunteers And that meant less focus on doorknocking or volunteer phonecallingDonors and earlystate supporters who had grown accustomed to presidentiallevel coddling and attention pushed back And by December Optimus the firm paid nearly 900000 to run Rubios analytics operation prepared a public memo to quiet the critics The memo described a hypothetical Midwestern state with 150000 likely voters roughly the expected Iowa turnout at the time and one candidate at 20 percent trailing another at 30 percentIt was clear to everyone it was about Rubio and IowaIn it Optimus made the case that running a ground game missed the elephant in the room as it nudged support up less than 1 percentage point Youve got a 10 point gap you need to close the memo readAll this is not to say that door knocking doesnt work We know it does the memo concludedSullivan put it most succinctly to the New York Times in December More people in Iowa see Marco on Fox and Friends than see Marco when he is in IowaThe groundfree strategy surprised Democrats and even some of Rubios rivalsThis isnt even a question in the mind of anyone whos worked on presidential campaigns Dan Pfieffer a former senior adviser to President Obama told POLITICO earlier this year You have to build an extensive and aggressive ground operation to winTed Cruz had invested more in ground operations than any other Republican and his campaign manager Jeff Roe told POLITICO he was surprised how few ground troops any of his opponents were mobilizingIts a huge investment its a huge investment of resources when a lot of people might not know how many resources they have so I understand why they dont do it Roe said But theres an advantage The ground game just never goes away
