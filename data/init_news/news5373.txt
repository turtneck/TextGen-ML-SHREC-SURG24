interest to provoke a confrontation between these superpowersBrian Cloughley Its not so much a continuation as a resurrection of the Cold War After the Warsaw Pact disbanded in March 1991 NATO although deprived of any reason to continue in existence managed to keep going and in 1999 added Poland the Czech Republic and Hungary to its 16 members As the BBC noted these countries became the first former Soviet bloc states to join NATO taking the alliances borders some 400 miles towards Russia With good reason Moscow wondered what on earth the USNATO military alliance might be planningIn spite of facing no threat whatever from any country in the world NATO continued to expand around Russias borders inviting Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Lithuania Romania Slovakia and Slovenia to join in 2002 which they did two years laterAs President Putin observed in an interview with Italys Corriere della Sera we are not expanding anywhere it is NATO infrastructure including military infrastructure that is moving towards our borders Is this a manifestation of our aggressionThe US is also implacably hostile to China and does what it can to provoke it in the South China Sea but NATO has not yet ventured into Eastern watersMORE Arise President Trump or Why its not the End of the World as We Know it Trumps sexual predator characteristics  His Grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOPs attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump Turkey and police tyranny The crisis of Imperialism finds political expression There is certainly confrontation  but it was originated by the western powers at the behest of Washington It is dangerous to indulge in military menaces but the US appears determined to continue such a policy and the world as a whole will certainly not benefit from its postureHow do you explain the silence of the media and Western Governments on the infamous war led by Saudi Arabia against the people of the YemenThe most important things are money and oil Western governments and mainstream media may from time to time make statements that regret the Saudi war on Yemen but they will never take action against the Riyadh royal dictatorship that might make it cease its merciless blitz on the Yemeni people The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its citizens lack the right and legal means to change their government while there are pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression including on the internet and freedom of assembly association movement and religion and a lack of equal rights for women    but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyrannySaudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in torture and other abuses and arbitrary arrest and detention while freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia civil law does not protect human rights including freedom of the speech and of the press  but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in YemenDont you think that with Hillary Clinton President of the USA well have a total war knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the militaryindustrial complexUnder a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havocwreaking wars around the world and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagons fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation and the bombers would have streaked across the skies deliberately provoking China and Russia Remember that she is one of the WashingtonBrussels wardrum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi about whose murder she giggled that  We came We saw He died  The USNATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State aka ISISHillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obamas years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser Jeremy Bash told Londons Daily Telegraph that she would order a full review of US strategy on Syria as a first key task of her presidency resetting the policy to emphasise the murderous nature of the government He said that Mrs Clinton would work to get Bashar alAssad the Syrian president out of therePresident Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of We came We Saw He died and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiascoIf Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States as seemed only too likely there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation Greater turmoil chaos and catastrophe were to comeSeveral reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups such as ISISDaesh and alNusra How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them as we have seen in various attacks on European soilThe US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners The British have also supplied groundtoair missiles to insurrectionists groups with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agenciesThe Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron how do you explain that these personalities are not judged in particular via ICC authority which judges only African despotsThe International Criminal Court ICC investigates and where warranted tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity But the United States is not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC there will never  ever  be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes but they are also easy to arraignHow do you explain that Hillary Clintons candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandalsBecause the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillarys scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote HillaryIn your opinion why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of human rights democracy etc Who gave them this rightNobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government anywhere but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that as in the old colonial days they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior There is flexibility in this policy however because if dictators are important for the economies of the West they are permitted to torture detainees treat women as chattels forbid freedom of religion and imprison criticsSome of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails Dont you think that the coordination between European intelligence failsI do not believe that there has been mass movement of DaeshIS adherents to northern EuropeLibya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe You have an experience in both military and diplomatic how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevailUnlike in Saudi Arabia for example in Gaddafis prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings The entire population received free education and medical care Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the USNATO aerial blitz of MarchOctober 2011 Germany refused to join in during which among other devastation water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other while extremist Islamic Wahhabi groups have grown in size and influence and the Government of National Accord is powerlessMany of those who energetically supported the war such as the former secretary general of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen continue to claim that it was a success  a model intervention  and that it is the fault of the international community that the country is a shambles But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya didnt work and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was the worst mistake of his presidencyGiven that the Obama presidency is in its last months it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic aka Takfiri terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed He and his supporters in Europe notably France and Britain will continue clandestine ground operations drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs but these will fail It is difficult to predict the future in Libya other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the USNATO war and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problemsIs the era of the American domination a fatality Doesn  t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world It should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said Our participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi emphasis added in Libya I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do The name of the game is regime change but America the indispensable nation has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism Unipolarity with the US possessing and exercising most military power has not workedIt appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counterproductive and could well lead to war Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nationWhat do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald TrumpMr Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White HouseInterview realized by Mohsen AbdelmoumenWho is Brian CloughleyBrian Cloughley is a British
