Its extremely lonely being Sarah Palin lonely at the outer lunatic fringe of the rightwing universe There are the voices stringing together those non sequiturs in her head of course but where are her Fox News friends Theyre faux friends thats what they areAfter the universally ridiculed stream of nonsense that issued from Sarah Palin at last weekends conservative confab in Iowa she came out swinging during an appearance on Hannity Sean Hannity it should be noted is apparently conservative enough for Palin Thats a relief But OReilly who dared question herseriousnessabout a possible run for president in 2016Hes troubleThere needs to be unity understanding Palin told Hannity Conservatives have that strike against us right off the bat that being the media Even there on Fox you know kind of a quasi or assumed conservative outlet  and soon we have all day listening to the tease of Bill OReillysHmmm did Roger Ailes get the memo about the quasiconservative operation hes running Someone should really tell him Palin then spewed some more sentence fragments that made sense to herHope away Sarah They all see you as a joke All of them Every last one of themDonald Trump Did someone say Donald Trump Nothing gets Trumps attention like his own nameWhen he heard that Bill OReilly had questioned his seriousness as a presidential contender the Trumpster took to Twitter accusing OReillyof bad and very deceptive journalismThis came as a complete shock to OReilly who had no idea anyone considered what he does journalism He thinks he is just bestowing wisdom on an adoring publicThe two raging egomaniacs chitty chatted by phone Thursday during OReillys show and it was amicable enough up to a pointI dont think youre going to run for president OReilly told Trump But if you decide to run youve got to know that building the organization that youd have to build is very difficult for someone whos never done it beforeNo one tells Trump he doesnt know how to build thingsBut how do you know Im not building it now Bill Trump saidBecause youre playing golf in Miami Donald OReilly saidIsnt that what presidents doTrump refused to take back the tweet and OReilly advised him Dont be a pinhead Dont tweetThis war within the conservoverse is very very worrisome This highly combustible combination of blowhardism and hot air might just explode Then conservative brain matter will litter the land like confetti and hopefully be scooped up by scientists who will study the nature of this soontobeextinct speciesAw shucks and gosh golly Mike Huckabee sure is shocked at how these city slickers act The author ofGod Guns Grits and Gravyand presumed presidential contender is all about wholesome activities like traveling to the local gun range and not listening to the mental poison that isBeyonc but he is shocked by the mouths on these bigcity women The cursing The dropping of the Fbomb Like its normal and everything Someone has to teach these ladies a lessonIn New York not only do the men do it but the women do it Huckabee said inan interviewwith Iowa radio host Jan MickelsonYou just are looking around saying My gosh this is worse than locker room talk This would be considered totally inappropriate to say these things in front of a woman And for a woman to say them in a professional setting we would only assume that this is a very as we would say in the south Thats just trashyFellow Fox newsian Megyn Kelly does not truck with trashy She invited her former colleage on her show this week to give him a quick update on  women women who work life and realityWell I do have some news for you Kelly said at the end of their little chat Were not only swearing Were drinking were smoking were having premarital sex with birth control before we go to work and sometimes boss around a bunch of menHuckabee kept that silly grin on his face but when he realized with horror what she was saying sex with birth control egads he begged her to stop said he hated to hear that and presumably ran screaming into the New York night4 Fox News has very nuanced discussion of sexual assault on campusesOh hahahhahaha Just kidding They totally didnt Several female Fox newsians did sit around on their halfcircle couches and discussed the fact that the University of Virginia has suggested sorority women stay home this weekend since fraternities will be partying hard during something Greeklifers call bid week They discussed and deplored it and naturally pointed out again that sexual assault when it does happen on campuses although it basically does not happen on campuses because women always lie about these things is womens fault In a piece of sterling analysis Stacy Dash pointed out The good girls stay homeWomen her cohosts interjectedThe bad girlsbad women Dash snickered the ones who like to play go out and play and sometimes get hurtBut that is okay because they are you know badAlcohol is not to blame Its the same thing with guns Dash said finally getting to her metaphor Guns dont kill people People doAlso could we just add people who play with guns people who have guns people who have kids and guns kids who have parents who have guns etcits never the gunsAlcohol doesnt get you drunk she added You get yourself drunkAnd to bring it all back home then you get yourself raped Because rapists dont rape people people get themselves rapedClearThere are definite perks to being a governor One is that you can officially declare holidays whenever the hell you want Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott enjoyed this little perk this week when he officially declared February 2 Chris Kyle Day in honor of the reallife American sniper who killed many Iraqis bragged about it called all Muslims savages and got a movie made out of his exploits starring Bradley CooperChris Kyle is Gov Abbotts kind of guyIn honor of a Texas son a Navy SEAL and an American hero a man who defended his brothers and sisters in arms on and off the battlefield Abbott said during a speechat the Texans Veterans of Foreign Affairs MidWinter Convention in Austin I am declaring February 2nd Chris Kyle Day in TexasHe left out the part where Kyle was killed by a disgruntled US veteran on a Texas gun range in 2013Nor did he say anything about the uptick in violence and violent rhetoric against Muslims who happen to make their home in Texas and elsewhere since the films release He had zero to say about the Republican lawmaker who proposed that Muslims in Texas take an oath of loyalty to the United States while sporting an Israeli flag on her deskSo how exactly should people go about celebrating Chris Kyle Day Perhaps by going to their local gun range
