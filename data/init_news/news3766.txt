posted by Eddie Bill Clinton seen walking his dogs Buster and Frank at his mansion in the Maldives This afternoon  WikiLeaks says sources in the Clinton Foundation inadvertently leaked the details of an apparently secret deal with Christies International Real Estate in New York Several recorded phone conversations between Christies executives and Clinton board member FrankGuistra clearly show that a deal for The Imperial Maldives had been closed The Imperial Maldives is a development of 185 water villas set above the turquoise waters of the North Male Atoll According to the recordings the agreed price was 200 million US Also according to the recordings this deal began the morning after the last debate The morning after Trump told Clinton he would appoint a special prosecutor and put her in prison Mr Guistra is heard to say Trump can drag his sorry orange ass down to the Maldives if he wants her so bad Theres no extradition treaty laughing The Clinton camp is very tightlipped at the moment and no comments from Clinton Foundation board members WikiLeaks seems to suggest that the Clintons are feeling the pressure of a worldwide criminal organization becoming frayed at the seams and are looking for a hideout until they can hatch their next diabolical plan for world domination Or those fuckers just need a real good vacation source
