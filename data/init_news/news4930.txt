Hillary Clinton defended herself Thursday against accusations she was out of touch as the situation in Benghazi spiraled out of control before the 2012 terror attack at a longawaited congressional hearing where Republicans grilled the former secretary of state for 11 hours over her roleWhile the daylong hearing spanned everything from the initial decision to intervene in Libya to Clintons public explanation of the Benghazi attack a central GOP allegation was that Clinton paid more attention to emails from friend Sidney Blumenthal than pleas from murdered diplomat Chris Stevens to increase security in the face of growing threats But even as Clinton said she took responsibility she accepted little blame for the denial of security requests before the attack or for the faulty narrative about an antiIslam video that formed afterClinton testified to the Benghazi committee that the security requests were handled by security professionals in the department and not herI did not see them I did not approve them I did not deny them she said while saying she was aware of the risks on the groundClinton insisted Blumenthal whose frequent messages to her turned up in recently released emails was not a primary source of information or even technically advising herBut when she questioned what the emails have to do with the tragedy committee Chairman Trey Gowdy RSC contrasted the frequent and direct communication with Blumenthal against Stevens struggle to get helpI think it is eminently fair to ask why Sidney Blumethal had unfettered access to you Madam Secretary  and theres not a single solitary email to or from you to or from Ambassador Stevens he saidClinton earlier admitted that Stevens did not even have her personal email while also claiming she didnt have a computer in her officeI do not believe that he had my personal email Clinton said before adding that Stevens had a direct line to othersClinton acknowledged some of his requests were approved and others were not But she said Stevens emailed regularly with her close aides and did not raise security with the members of my staffThe exhaustive hearing which featured not only tough questioning of Clinton but frequent infighting between Republican and Democratic committee members came as the former State Department leader tries to reclaim momentum in the Democratic presidential race On Capitol Hill she tried to settle lingering questions on her role surrounding the 2012 attacksRepublicans suggested the investigation though is far from overIn a tense exchange Rep Jim Jordan ROhio grilled Clinton on why the administration initially seemed to blame protests over an antiIslam filmWhered the false narrative start It started with you Madam Secretary he charged pointing to a State Department statement that night saying some were using the video to justify violence Jordan said she later told the Egyptian prime minister they knew the attack was planned and had nothing to do with the film He alleged she didnt tell the American people the truthBut Clinton responded There is no doubt in my mind that we did the best we could with the information we had at the timeShe said they were dealing with fluid and fastmoving and conflicting information and stressed that the night of the attack she only said some sought to justify the attack with the video She said there were probably many motivations And while former top intelligence officials have indicated they knew the attack was terrorism from the start Clinton seemed to suggest it was the intelligence community guiding the public narrativeThe intelligence community did the best job they could she testifiedAt other times in the hearing Clinton said Stevens had volunteered for the mission itself and said that while the risk in the region was known there was no credible actionable threat known by our intelligence community against our compound Clinton at times also tried to rebuff tough questioning by suggesting American agents should not be disparaged though lawmakers did not appear to imply thisIn another tense exchange later in the evening Rep Susan Brooks RInd questioned if Clinton had a personal conversation with Stevens after he was sworn in that MayWhen Clinton initially responded I believe I did Brooks pressed her further saying there were no call logs or record she spoke with Stevens directly Clinton responded again she believed she did have a conversation with Stevens before his was killedGenerally Clinton and Democrats on the committee argued that the attack has already been thoroughly investigated by the Accountability Review Board and other congressional panels Democrats accused Republicans of leading a partisan hunt against Clinton to damage her presidential candidacyIndeed the hearing comes at a critical time for Clinton Following a strong debate performance last week Clinton on Wednesday also saw the man who may have represented the biggest primary threat to her candidacy Vice President Biden opt out of runningYet questions about her personal email use and her actions relating to the Benghazi attack loom over her runRep Elijah Cummings DMd the committees top Democrat said the panel was only formed because Republicans did not like the answers from prior investigations So he said they established the committee and set them loose Madam Secretary because youre running for president Cummings called it an abusive effort to derail her campaignBut Gowdy denied this Of allegations that the investigation is all about Clinton Gowdy said Thursday Let me assure you it is notThe former State Department leader meanwhile tried to downplay questions about what her emails did and did not show by claiming much of her work was done over phone in person and other waysShe said she mostly did not work over email and said she did not have a computer in her office while secretary of stateI didnt conduct the business that I did primarily on email she said adding that she generally did not email during the dayDespite these claims investigators are looking into a number of workrelated emails Clinton sent at the department and whether they contained classified material The emails came up under questioning from Brooks RInd who asked why so few of her emails addressed Libya in the leadup to the attackAt the hearing Clinton also was challenged over her advocacy for military intervention in Libya with a GOP member describing her as the architect of a policy that has led to disasterClinton defended her role saying she pushed for intervention to prevent mass massacres but stressing that President Obama made the final call to use US military forceShe also told the committee the night of the Benghazi attack she only had one call with President Obama There were no meetings or calls with thenCIA director Leon Panetta or Gen Martin Dempsey according to Clinton even though she said they were the decision makers who could have sent in US military forcesClinton added that she did not talk to the survivors of the attack until they had been debriefed and after they arrived back in USOur Libya policy couldnt have happened without you because you were its chief architect Rep Peter Roskam RIll told her adding Things in Libya today are a disasterClinton said she does not subscribe to that viewGowdy in explaining the purpose of the hearing said they owe the truth about what happened to the victims of the 2012 terror attackThey were more than four images on a television screen They were Americans who believed in service and sacrifice Gowdy RSC saidFor that sacrifice Gowdy said We owe them and each other the truth He said he wants a final definitive accounting of what happenedGowdy said that includes answers over what the US was doing in Libya what happened to requests for additional security and what the government told the public after the attacksIn her opening statement Clinton said she was there to honor the service of the four men who died She argued that America must lead in a dangerous world and said it would compound the tragedy for America to retreat from the world
