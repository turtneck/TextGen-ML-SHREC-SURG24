  Recipient Email  I earnestly recommend that everyone watch Peter Thiels 13minute address at the National Press Club this morning He hits a number of nails on the head A few at random  At 1m08s  The truth is no matter how crazy this election seems it is less crazy than the condition of our country Thiel checks off some of the craziness the national debt healthcare costs student loans income stagnation  And wars   At 2m52s  While households struggle to keep up with the challenges of everyday life the government is wasting trillions of dollars of taxpayer money on faraway wars Right now were fighting five of them in Iraq Syria Libya Yemen and Somalia Which is the more enthusiastically prowar party The Democrats  At 7m55s  Yet even after these bipartisan failures the Democratic Party today is more hawkish than at any time since it began the war in Vietnam Whats the root problem Optimism   At 8m55s  For a long time our elites have been in the habit of denying difficult realities Why is Trump the solution  At 10m54s  Nobody would suggest that Donald Trump is a humble man but the big things hes right about amount to a muchneeded dose of humility in our politics Very unusually for a presidential candidate he has questioned the core concept of American exceptionalism He doesnt think that the force of optimism alone can change realities without hard work Just as much as its about making America great Trumps agenda is about making America a normal country The only nail whose head Thiel leaves un hit is immigration This is a bit odd as there is probably no other single issue that accounts for so much of Trumps popular support Its somewhat less odd to those of us who recall Thiel taking up an interest in the immigration issue some years ago then quickly dropping it as apparently too radioactive We at VDAREcom are bolder which is one reason  although so be sure a very minor one  why we have much much less money than he does It is none the less heartening to see a successful entrepreneur speaking so clearly and eloquently in support of Trump Watch the whole thing on YouTube  Reprinted from VDarecom by permission of author or representative
