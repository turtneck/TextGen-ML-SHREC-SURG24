Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply Thursday over who is more progressive at a debate that saw the former secretary of state ratcheting up her criticism of the Vermont senator on several fronts  even accusing him of engineering an artful smear with suggestions she could be bought by donorsThe debate the first since the Iowa caucuses and last before next weeks critical New Hampshire primary was by far the most confrontational of the Democratic primary raceClinton coming off a narrow Iowa win and trying to shrink Sanders huge lead in Granite State polls stayed on offense for most of the night She slammed Sanders campaign promises as too costly while standing firm in claiming shes a true progressive despite Sanders comments to the contrarySanders meanwhile dug in as he questioned whether Clinton really walks the walk of the progressive cause  and described her as the candidate of the establishmentSecretary Clinton does represent the establishment I represent I hope ordinary Americans he said stressing that he unlike Clinton doesnt enjoy super PAC backing and is funded in large part by smalldollar donationsThe verbal jabs flew quickly and Clinton left few allegations unchallenged visibly fed up with a campaign trail narrative that has painted her as the candidate of Wall Street She rebutted Sanders establishment charge by questioning whether someone running to be the first female president can carry that labelThe most heated moment at the MSNBChosted debate in Durham NH came when Clinton told Sanders she rejects the suggestion that anyone who takes donations or speaking fees from interest groups can be boughtEnough is enough Clinton said telling Sanders the attacks by insinuation are not worthy of him Clinton said if Sanders has something to allege say it directly but You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever receivedShe closed I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeksThat line earned a groan from Sanders and some boos from the audienceSanders went on to link Wall Street deregulation with billions spent on lobbying and campaign contributionsSome people think yeah that had some influence he saidClinton meanwhile described herself as a progressive who gets things done and ripped Sanders for suggesting Clinton cannot be a moderate and a progressive at the same time She teased Sanders as being the selfproclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism and said she doesnt know anyone who fits his definitionThe fireworks underscored the tight state of the race going into New Hampshires contest next Tuesday Clinton arrived on the debate stage clearly ready to rebut Sanders proposals and accusations  notably his oftrepeated criticism that she as senator erred by voting to authorize the use of force in IraqA vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS she counteredYet as Clinton stressed her secretary of state experience and Sanders said that factor is not arguable the Vermont senator noted experience is not the only pointJudgment is he said again pointing to the 2002 Iraq vote One of us voted the right way and one of us didntAs she has at prior debates Clinton also challenged the senators proposals for free college and universal health care The numbers just dont add up Clinton saidShe questioned how the country could for instance pay for free tuition at public colleges as Sanders wants and accused him of wanting to effectively scrap ObamaCare  a charge he deniedSanders defended his plans particularly for universal health careI do believe we should have health care for all he saidThe former secretary of state met the Vermont senator on stage in Durham NH after eking out a narrow victory in Mondays caucuses While her campaign celebrated the win Sanders strong showing in the state nevertheless has helped boost his fundraising  and he heads into New Hampshire with a steady doubledigit lead in the pollsThere remains an ongoing dispute however over the Iowa results The Des Moines Register editorial board earlier Thursday called for an audit of the Democratic caucus results citing problems and confusion at polling sitesAsked at Thursdays debate about the editorial Sanders said I agree with the Des Moines RegisterHe said after speaking with precinct captains the campaign believes they may have at least two more delegatesYet Sanders who has complained how some local delegates were allocated based on coin tosses also said they should not blow this out of proportion This is not the biggest deal in the world Sanders saidAsked if shed participate in an audit Clinton said Whatever they decide to do thats fineClinton separately said shes 100 percent confident nothing will come of the FBI probe into her personalemail use as secretary of stateThe Democratic debate on Thursday was the first to feature Clinton and Sanders oneonone with former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley now out of the race following his distant third showing in IowaThe debate was one of four added to the calendar earlier this week after the Democratic National Committee
