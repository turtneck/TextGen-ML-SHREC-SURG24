Given that Congress has become so utterly dysfunctional in recent years its tempting to think the upcoming presidential election will be fairly lowstakes Does iteven matter what Jeb Bush thinks about tax policy or what Hillary Clinton is proposing on paid leave Hardly anything will passThe next president wont need Congress to tackle global warmingBut on global warming its a rather different story Whoever gets elected to the White House in 2016 will have an enormous amount of influence over Americas climate policies  and they wont need Congress to actFor that you can thank or blame President Obama Over the past six years the Environmental Protection Agencyhas acquired unprecedented authority to regulate the nations carbon dioxide emissions Obama has used that power to enact a slew of new pollution rules including CO2 regulations on coal plants all with the aim of cutting US greenhouse gas emissionsat least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025The EPA will likely keep this authority to regulate carbon dioxide for the foreseeable future  unless it gets altered by courts or repealed by Congress And many of the biggest decisions on how to use it will be left to the next presidentIf say Hillary Clinton wanted to expand Obamas carbon rules to oil refineries or cement plants she could Conversely if a Republican president skeptical of climate change wanted to bog down implementation of Obamas CO2 rules for coal plants hed be able to do that too Though as well see Republicans may not have unlimited power to scuttle Obamas climate policiesAny future administration will have a lot of room to be either more ambitious or less ambitious explains Michael Wara an expert on energy and environmental law at Stanford And how the next president uses the EPA could have ripple effects around the world  and even decide the fate of ongoing international climate talks with China India and other countriesSo far the 2016 candidates have been vague about which way theyd steer the EPA Clintonhas said Obamas climate rules should be protected at all cost but shes given little sign of whether she might expand them further Meanwhile Republicans like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bushsound skeptical about tackling global warming but they havent said whether they might try to relax or even dismantle Obamas climate policies So heres a look at what they could doFirst a recap of how the executive branch acquired so much power over US climate policy Back in 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the existing Clean Air Act  if theres evidence that they endanger public health and welfareIn 2009 Obamas EPA laid out this evidence and that endangerment finding set in motion a series of rules to curtail US greenhouse gas emissions Since this was being done under the auspices of the Clean Air Act a law Congress had passed in 1970 no new legislation was required The EPA could act on its own The big actions so farAdd it all up and the White Houseclaims these rules put the US on pace to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025 But whether that actually happens will depend on the next presidentOkay now lets assume its 2017 Theres a new president and Congress is still totally gridlocked on climate change What happens nextThe next president likely wont be able to dismantle Obamas climate policies entirely  not on his or her own After all the Supreme Court has effectivelyordered the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases so long as theres evidence that they cause harm andthat evidence is quite solid Only Congress could undo everything Obamas done by revising the Clean Air ActStillwhoever occupies the White House and EPA will have a lot of say in how to implement Obamas climate rules That sounds boring but its actually a key step Theres tons of leeway to strengthen or weaken these rules Here are a few ways this could play out1 Fueleconomy standards could be tightened or weakened in 2017 Remember the EPAs fueleconomy standards for new cars and light trucks are on pace to rise from their current 35 miles per gallon to 545 miles per gallon by 2025Automakers may push to relax the CAFE standards in the midterm reviewYet those numbers arent set in stone These CAFE corporate average fuel economy rules are scheduled to come up for a midterm review in 2017 At that point automakers may lobby to allow the standards to rise more slowly  particularly if sales of fuelefficient vehicles have been sluggish due to low oil prices Green groups meanwhile could push to make the standards stricter or to have them keep increasing past 2025 to push vehicle emissions down even furtherSo the next administration will have to decide Leave the vehicle standards alone Make them stricter WeakerThe one twist here is that due to a longstanding quirk of the Clean Air Act Californiacan threaten to create its own stricter standards if its not happy with what the federal government is doing and other states can join Automakers really hate the idea of multiple sets of vehicle standards around the country so they may prefer not to weaken the federal rules too much and risk having California go it alone2 The Clean Power Plan will live or die based on implementation The EPA will finalize its rules for reducing carbon dioxide from existing power plants in the summer of 2015 Its a core component of Obamas climate policy  power plants are responsible for 31 percent of the nations greenhouse gas emissions But the next president will have enormous influence over how this plan actually worksAssuming the rule holds up in court it could prove difficult for the next president to simply hit the kill switch on the plan and start all over But he or she will get to decide how to implement it  and thats arguably just as significantAfter the rule is finalized states will have another 14 months to submit plans for cutting emissions though some will request extensions That process could drag on until 2017 or 2018Theres a lot of latitude in the review processAt that point the EPA will review each states plans for reducing emissions from its power plants and decide whether the plans are acceptable An administration that really wants to tackle climate change can make sure states are doing as much as is feasible By contrast a president who was less concerned about global warming could allow states that wanted to like Texas to submit lessaggressive plansTheres a lot of latitude in the review process says Stanfords Michael Wara The history of the Clean Air Act shows this If you have a president who doesnt like climate policy they could basically signal to the states that theyre going to give a lot of compliance flexibility and allow states to make assumptions in their plan that reduce their costs This would likely involve seemingly arcane tweaks to models and baselines that would be harder for green groups to challenge in courtMeanwhile some states may outright refuse to submit any plans for reducing emissionsSen Mitch McConnell RKY is already urging states to do exactly this If that happens the EPA has the authority to impose its own federal plan on the states The agency will unveil the details of this federal plan in 2015 though again implementation would be left to the next presidentMeanwhile industry groups are almost certain to challenge aspects of the rule in court Adele Morris the policy director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution points out that an administration hostile to Obamas EPA rule could defend it weakly in court And if any parts of the rule get struck down the next administration will get to decide how to redo itIt all comes down to preference If you have an administration thats friendly to Obamas policy then youd have continuity in implementation says David Doniger director of the Natural Resources Defense Councils climate and clear air program But if you had an administration that wasnt as friendly they could try to drag their feet or change the rules3 The next president will decide whether to regulate other sectors  like refineries The Clean Air Act doesnt just cover vehicles and power plants Technically the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from other sources as well Oil refineries Cement plants Trucks Airplanes The agency is regulating methane leaks from new oil and gas wells but it hasnt touched existing wells And so on These sources all add upThe Obama administration is leaving most of the decisions about what to do with these sectors to the next president If Hillary Clinton comes in and wants to expand the EPAs authority here she can If Marco Rubio comes in and doesnt he may have to fend off lawsuits but he can likely hold off on doing this for a long timeAt this point we only have a hazy sense for what most US presidential candidates think about global warming But given how much power they have at their disposal they should give more detailed answersFor instance Hillary Clintons campaign chair John Podestaclaims that shell put climate change and clean energy at the top of the agenda And Clintonhas said the EPAs climate rules should be protected at all costHillary says the EPA rules should be protected  but would she expand themFine So we know shell veto any attempts by congressional Republicans to repeal the EPA rules altogether But what else Would she try to strengthen the fueleconomy rules during the 2017 midterm review Would she want to expand the EPAs carbon regulations to oil refineries and chemical plants Would she try to beat Obamas goal of cutting emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025On the other end of the spectrum theres Marco Rubio whosaysI do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it But what does that mean in practice Would he weaken the vehicle rules Abandon the US goal of cutting emissions 26 percentThen theres Jeb Bushwho says hes concerned about climate change and that we need to work with the rest of the world to negotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions But again what does this mean Would he keep Obamas climate rules in place Strengthen them Weaken themSome green groups have started to focus on these questions We definitely want to ensure that the next president is actually committed on building progress through the Clean Power Plan Tiernan Sittenfield senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters told meFor now many environmentalists have mainly been pressing Clinton on what she thinks of the Keystone XL pipeline Yet that issue will probably be resolved before Obama leaves office The EPA rules are far more relevant for the next administrationIts worth being precise about what the EPA can and cant do here The executive branch has acquired sweeping authority over the nations greenhouse gas emissions The Obama administration estimates that this authority alone could push emissions down 26 to 28 percent between 2005 and 2025truly drastic changes to our energy system would likely require CongressLooked at one way thats a huge deal  a decisive break from the past when emissions would go up and up seemingly without end Looked at another way its a pittanceTo help avoid drastic global warming the United States will probably need to push down emissions80 percent or more by midcentury That would require truly staggering changes It wouldnt be enough for coal and gas plants to get slightly more efficient under EPA rules Wed have to replace virtually our entire energy system with a new cleaner oneThats the sort of thing that only Congress can really do Only Congress can fund RD for new technologies or offer subsidies for clean energy Only Congress can bring about dramatic changes to our grid infrastructure Only Congress can enact an economywide carbon tax Barring some creative flexibility on regulations these are things the next president just cant accomplish without cooperation from the House and SenateWhere the EPA rules could have a more important effect is on the international stage  at least in the near term Remember the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions Theres also China India Brazil Europe Russia and so on Thats why international cooperation on climate change is so crucialRight now the world is groping toward a very very weak international agreement The US put forward its pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025 That spurred China to respond by vowing to get its emissions to peak around 2030 Other countries have started to pitch in tooAdd all these pledges up and were still not close to tackling global warming The Climate Action Trackerestimates that were on pace for global average temperatures to rise 31C or 56F above preindustrial levels give or take  a seriously disruptive changeWhat the US has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamicsEven so some experts think even these weak promises could lead iteratively to stronger action over time You can see how those plans could start to connect together and create a positive negotiating dynamic David Victor a political scientist at UC San Diegos School of International Relations and Pacific Studies told me The encouraging precedent here is in trade  You build credibility and trust over time and then move to bigger issuesThe next US president can help decide how this agreement continues to evolve in the years to come The US can keep pushing its own emissions down and try to persuade countries like China and India to respond in kind Or it could abandon this budding framework entirelyAbandoning the US climate targets says Wara would do real damage to whatever credibility the US has left on the international stage What Obama has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamics in a very positive way And if the US were to walk away from that that would be very damaging for future climate negotiations and commitments
