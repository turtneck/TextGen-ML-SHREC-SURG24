Washington CNN Angela Merkel the German chancellor desperately working to reach a diplomatic accord ending unrest in eastern Ukraine continued her efforts at the White House Monday urging President Barack Obama to forestall sending lethal aid to KievHer efforts appeared effective at a midday press conference Obama said he hadnt yet decided whether or not to send arms and equipment to besieged Ukrainian troops in the eastern part of the countryBut both leaders hinted there could be disagreements to come on how to best end the unrest that has waged for months and so far claimed 5000 lives Obama left open the possibility of equipping Ukrainians with American weapons if Merkels latest attempt at brokering a diplomatic end to the violence failsThere may be some areas where there tactical disagreements Obama said There may not be But the broad principle that we have to stand up for not just Ukraine but the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty is one where we are completely unifiedMerkel used similar language saying through a translator the alliance between the United States and Europe will continue to stand will continue to be solid even though on certain issues we may not always agreeIt was the latest bid in Merkels shuttle diplomacy which has taken the East Germanyborn chancellor from Kiev to Moscow to the White House in just a matter of days Shes headed to Belarus for more talks on Ukraine on WednesdayObama and Merkel hoped to display a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin whose government has backed separatists in Eastern Ukraine Tough economic sanctions levied both by the United States and Europe have severely degraded Russias economy but until now havent stopped Putin from his territorial campaignThe united front was intact on Monday as Obama and Merkel underscored their alignment on sanctions and preference toward achieving peace through diplomacyI am absolutely confident that we will do this together Merkel said of the diplomatic efforts I myself actually would not be able to live with not having made this attemptThe show of unity could be weakened if Obama decides to follow the advice of a bipartisan group of lawmakers and former administration officials pushing for greater lethal aid to Kiev Under pressure from American lawmakers and former administration officials the White House has said its reconsidering whether or not to send arms to Ukrainian troopsIts not based on the idea that Ukraine could defeat a Russian army that was determined Obama said of his administrations deliberations It is rather to see whether or not there are additional things we can do to help Ukraine bolster its defenses in the face of separatist aggressionHe failed to give a timeline for his deliberations on lethal aid to Ukraine nor did he cite any specific move by Russia that would prompt him to decide either wayObama has been reluctant to send lethal aid overseas in the multiple world crises hes faced citing the potential for the arms to wind up in the hands of enemies In Ukraine administration officials say theyre worried that shipments of US weapons could elevate the unrest there into a proxy war with Russia And theyre unsure of the Ukrainians ability to effectively use Americansupplied armsRepublicans and Democrats have pressed the topic both in the United States and overseas Sen John McCain the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said at a security conference in Munich this weekend that Ukrainian troops were woefully underprepared for battleThe Ukrainians are being slaughtered and were sending them blankets and meals Blankets dont do well against Russian tanks McCain said echoing the plea Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko made to Congress in SeptemberOthers who are closer to Obama including the presidents former Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy and his current nominee to become defense secretary Ashton Carter have also said they believe the US should supply Kiev with lethal aidMerkel has staunchly opposed that tack arguing more military aid could escalate the crisis furtherThe progress that Ukraine needs cannot be achieved with more weapons she said over the weekend I have grave doubts about the validity of this pointMerkel has positioned herself as the diplomatic envoy between the West and Russia traveling to Moscow last week for closeddoor meetings with Putin and French President Francois Hollande The summit however concluded without a clear path toward ending the escalating violence in Eastern UkraineA weekend telephone call between Merkel Putin Hollande and Poroshenko ended with the leaders agreeing to meet in Belarus on Wednesday though firm details of the session werent finalizedThe European leaders  recognizing their countrys stronger economic ties to Russia  have been eager to broker a ceasefire diplomatically a goal that so far has remained elusiveObama who released a National Security Strategy last week with a heavy emphasis on diplomacy has held similar views saying the crisis in Ukraine wont end militarilyBut so far diplomacy has produced few results A September agreement calling for drawback of heavy arms and a buffer zone disintegrated shortly after it was signed Subsequent calls to adhere to the plan were ignored
