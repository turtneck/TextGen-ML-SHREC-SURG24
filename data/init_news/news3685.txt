America Has Become A Lawless Nation  Hillary Clinton Magically Cleared By The FBI By Michael Snyder on July 5th 2016 It is hard to be proud to be an American today after watching FBI director James Comey magically clear Hillary Clinton of all wrongdoing Sadly Comey is likely to go down in history as the man that struck the final death blow to the rule of law in America During his address to the media Comey admitted that Clinton sent or received 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified material at the time they were sent But of course there were probably many more Comey told the press that it was  likely that there are other workrelated emails that they did not produce  that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State and the lawyers cleaned their devices  So basically Clinton turned over to the FBI whatever she felt like turning over and then she destroyed the rest of the evidence As a former lawyer this infuriates me but it doesnt surprise me In fact it doesnt surprise me at all that Hillary Clinton was allowed to skate I expected this all along If you search the thousands of articles that I have posted on The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream  you will find many articles where I say that Hillary Clinton should be in prison but not a single one where I ever said that I thought she would be going to prison This is how politics in America works today People like Bill and Hillary Clinton could openly sacrifice children to Satan on the White House lawn and still probably not get into trouble Despite scandal after scandal going all the way back to Arkansas in the 1980s nothing ever sticks to them and nothing probably ever will In this case FBI director James Comey essentially had to rewrite federal law in order to clear Clinton This is something that Andrew McCarthy explained very well in his article entitled FBI Rewrites Federal Law to Let Hillary Off the Hook  There is no way of getting around this According to Director James Comey disclosure a former colleague and longtime friend of mine Hillary Clinton checked every box required for a felony violation of Section 793f of the federal penal code Title 18 With lawful access to highly classified information she acted with gross negligence in removing and causing it to be removed it from its proper place of custody and she transmitted it and caused it to be transmitted to others not authorized to have it in patent violation of her trust Director Comey even conceded that former Secretary Clinton was extremely careless and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications her own and those she corresponded with being intercepted by foreign intelligence services  In essence in order to give Mrs Clinton a pass the FBI rewrote the statute inserting an intent element that Congress did not require The added intent element moreover makes no sense The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence they are guilty of serious wrongdoing The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence The amazing thing is that the FBI handled a highly similar case very very differently less than a year ago Just check out what happened to Naval reservist Bryan Nishimura  US Magistrate Judge Kendall J Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years of probation a 7500 fine and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance According to court documents Nishimura was a Naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008 In his role as a Regional Engineer for the US military in Afghanistan Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers Nishimura however caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal unclassified electronic devices and storage media He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled offbase in Afghanistan and ultimately carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment In the United States Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system  Nishimuras actions came to light in early 2012 when he admitted to Naval personnel that he had handled classified materials inappropriately  Nishimura later admitted that following his statement to Naval personnel he destroyed a large quantity of classified materials he had maintained in his home  Despite that when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Nishimuras home in May 2012 agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel So what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton Neither of them ever intended to do anything wrong So why were they treated so differently Needless to say social media is exploding with outrage over this decision to let Clinton go free Many Americans are openly asking why they should continue to play by the rules if politicians like Hillary Clinton are not required to do so Unfortunately this is what America has become Our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a society and as I have stated before Hillary Clinton is going to be the overwhelming favorite if there is an election in November At this moment she has solid leads in all of the swing states and she only really needs to win one of them  Perhaps you enjoy talk of battleground states Well theres a scenario for you too First pick the six closest swing states VA NH IA OH FL NC Got it Now understand that New Hampshire excepted Clinton only has to win one of them in order to reach the requisite 270 electoral votes to win  Optional third step for Republicans only start shotgunning Pabst Blue Ribbon and dont stop until November Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states According to a Ballotpedia battleground poll released last week Trump trails by 14 in Florida 4 in Iowa 10 in North Carolina 9 in Ohio and 7 in Virginia Hillary Clinton is a horrible evil miserable human being  and right now she is the oddson favorite to become the next president of the United States But ultimately it is the American people that are to blame for blindly supporting corrupt politicians such as Clinton and if they willingly pick her to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow The Price Of Silver Explodes Past 20 Dollars An Ounce As The European

lived almost 74 years and have never seen as corrupt an administration as this one My estimate of years left based on my genetic profile is probably 5 to 10 years I feel sorry for my descendants I personally feel this country is in the last years of its existence Kent Harris 911 was Gods judgment against this nation Please read the Isaiah 910 prophesy and then read what God will do to this nation as a result of our defiance from Isaiah 911104 He will utterly destroy this nation You say that God will never do such a thing He will and know this that when you walk into church any church and see if any pulpits says anything at all about this this coming Sunday The answer will be no God in the prophecy says the pulpit is wholly to blame During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination None Why Because God has blinded just like pharaoh of Egypt the pulpit They have been consumed with the outward versus the inward They are vipers among vipers Steeve Girard 911 was the warning of the Arab World the Americans ignored it with exceptionalism Time to coughup bahmi 911 was meant to blame Muslims for everything connected but the jews and neocons were behind 911 along with the Saudis This was however a distraction so the real bad guys could install people like Obongo and let his destructive agenda destroy us choke us in debt focus on homosexuality same sex butt banging etc While we were occupied with the distractions the real bad guys did their thing and now have us on the precipice of total destruction and NWO marginalization If you voted for Obama YOU are part of the problem GV focus on homosexuality same sex butt banging ever obsessed with Teh Gays Paul Patriot Amen This Is why I am convinced Hitlery will be the next president Its all apart of the plan to destroy American Constitution and sovereignty during her reign She is what the sheeple illegals and liberal progressives are calling for and the Lord will oblige the desires of those who mock blaspheme and spit in the face of the God of our heritage natures God Nothing will change until the pulpits start preaching Truth and a nation repents JC Teecher All is going along with the prophetic word and the nations are aiding and abetting to the fullness of the Gentiles islamic peoples JC Teecher The pulpits for the most part are bringing about the apostasy sad No the church wants to be liked and civil in this matter Sin is a three letter bad word Churches are more interested incommunity and not scaring people off with the truth Unfortunately that is the majority of churches todayThey didnt scare me The only truth that scared me was Hell and I was scared into the kingdom by Gods love for me a sinner That He died for me to save me Dont hear much about that these days Politically incorrect on the way to Hell Jerry C Actually Id say sin is a fiveletter word death lol watchmannonthewall I somewaht agree with you regarding Gods move against the US but I tend more towards 911 being one of a couple of disciplines and warnings the 2008 meltdown was the other regarding coming judgment on the nation rather than it actually being a judgment If Athaliah becomes president she will be just like the real Athaliah narcissistic and paranoid and her rage will extend to Christians She is power hungary and has a self destruct button that will take all with her At that point I think it quite likely the warnings of the destruction of America by about 202021 will probably occur Joe Trevors I believe we are experiencing the End Times battle between the Body of Christ  the Body of Antichrist Our war is not against flesh  blood but against the spiritual powers on high Yes Kent you do see how our nation is being transformed by the installation of leaders in our society who are following the Antichrist But also our nation is filled with millions of people who are following the Christ One way I see this is to view Islam as the Trojan Horse to bring down Christianity Yes it is bringing down the Church but it cannot hurt the Head of the Church Jesus so it is making war on the Body of Christ the members one of another You can today how Islam is being used by our government to destroy the Church in Syria Muslims are killing Christians  other Muslims in Syria NowAlive Perhaps Mr Cahn is right Its an interesting premise to be sure What I will say is that the idea that none meaning no pulpits spoke out against homosexual marriage is simply wrong Many spoke of judgment because of it But you are certainly right about vipers filling the most pulpits They are indeed blind Alas that the Baby Boomers now run this countryoff a cliff GV During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination None Pharisee fixated on genitalia while remaining SILENT on American war crimes around the world She is the next president of America Joe Trevors Only God knows who will be the next President It is important for us to pray to the Lord  trust God as we say the Lords prayer in part Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven We need our faith more than ever during these days of tribulations God can do anything he wants God answers our prayers but we do not understand how he answers us do we Oz Steamer She looks likely to be the LAST President of the United States Jerry C Why would TPTB collapse the economy on one of

that stopped investigating Omar the Orlando Shooter The FBI had no time to follow Omar They did not want to infringe on Omars constitutional rights because Obama forbids us to discriminate against Muslims Omar got a job at a security company so he could protect us Omars Dad was preaching what Omar followed Omars Dad works for the CIA The FBI was forbidden to bother Omar no matter what he threatened The FBI does not even know to investigate Omars dad What about the MOSQUE where Omar worshipped The FBI is super good  in covering up Randy GREAT post there Joe Except that Orlando was a completely contrived event just like Sandy Hoax WHERE were the ambulances to carry off the dead bodies Where was all of the blood Did everybody who was shot at either place just happen to leave all their blood at home that day The temps in Connecticut on DECEMBER 14 2012 were 306 for the low and 493 for the high yet not one wisp of breath fog from ANYBODY there How is that possible Check The Old Farmers Almanac for the weather reports on the 14th and 15th Joe Trevors Yes how can they cover up so much with so little outrage from them in Orlando Randy Quite easily Since the media is in bed with the corrupted legal system and political system they just ignore the outrage they dont report on it therefore very few ever hear about it Someone forgot to check the records to see what the weather would possibly be like on December 14 2012 and thats how that very important clue got left out of the narrative when the hoax was launched You dont see anyone being asked on Tee Vee why there was no snow on the ground or breath fog from the people because the media doesnt want to have questions like that being asked SnohtBlossom You have NO CHOICE Enjoy it Bwah hah haha SnottyWhen ya have to give

probably thought blondie deserved a break because she was a woman of color like Elizabeth Warren max gon You are absolutely right Michael if the USA spineless population picks this evil woman to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow Joe Trevors Our greatest hope is to vote for Donald Trump I believe God is using Donald It is a sign by the overwhelming opposition against him by both Democrats  Republicans Look at Republican Paul Ryan as House Majority leader he has no trouble understanding Obama or Clinton But he cant understand Trump Paul say I dont know where Donald is coming from Trump is exposing how we are already ruled by a ONE PARTY OLIGARCHY that chooses who will be President This time Trump is confounding their agenda Trump is revealing how they are all lying to us  of course they all really support Hillary or a 3rd party candidate Arent they the ones who say Anyone but Trump JC Teecher Look at the bright side even though it is just a dying ember of one this brings the chosen one to the final phase of taking her pedestal of satanic hierarchy in ussag and will eliminate the need for martial law in order to stave off the trump charge I still believe we will see bank failures and an economic collapse whereby she will pull the exact same stunts as Odrama did to filter off funds but I think it will stabilize after the haircut to the upper middle class wealth The con game continues at a much more rapid and rabid pace themacabre If there was ever a situation that demanded a special prosecutor this was it How could the Valerie Plame joke get a special prosecutor and not this obvious case of criminal wrong doing Of course the criminal wrong doing was and is obviousthere was no way Obozo would have sanctioned a

this guilty criminal Clinton came on the scene Steeve Girard longer than that It started with throw everything out the White House windows Reagan DJohn1 That announcement by the FBI did two things The FBI were always the untouchables that could not be bribed or intimidated Not until yesterday at least I think the reaction of the American People will be to elect someone else Now if the electorial college does not follow what the people elect then we have a real problem this time around I think if she had won a verdict in a trial that was public then she may have been elected This way she is damned politically forever She never got her day in court So people will assume she was guilty and that Bill bribed the FBI Assume is a big word But that is what people will do She has just been shot in the foot politically That is why she will never become President of this country Her reputation is shot That Obama is running around supporting her effort to get elected President using government transport to do so is another problem she has When both of them are being transported on Air Force One that is on our dime as tax payers Trump labeled her crooked Hilliary and this just gave her the reputation to go with it Only God knows the future It is beginning to look like Trump may become President after all Joe Trevors Yes Mr Cipher Half the population couldnt care less is she is crooked

a vial person Fortunate for her we have a rather stupid populace in this country that cannot see through her campaign facade Hillary and Bill will continue their charade in office It will be all about them and theirs bankers who will call the shots World War 3 is a real distinct possibility with this charlatan in the Oval Office Would anybody care to wager on another false flag event similar if not worse to 911 to further an agenda This time we can place the false blame on the Syrians to foster the belief that we need troops on the ground HeyAHuman Condition people to accept blatant corruption Condition them to accept that the elite are above the law and that justice is not blind How much more will we accept df NJ I would be happy if we just enforced our existing banking and monopoly laws tempusfugit RE what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton Nishimura confessed Its that simple All Western systems of law whether full adversarial full discovery or something in between have always relied upon testament of selfconfession or the force to exact it in the absence of confession Nishimura selfrecognized his actions selfclassified them and confessed them That he confessed them with the emotion of wrongdoing is his In contrast Hillary has not confessed nor is she capable of selfrecognition of her actions let alone classifying them or even classifying them as bad To give testament of nullvalue is why we dont give guns to children they cannot selfpay the price of learning the lesson so they dont learn Selfconfession is inherently predicated on the sensing of cost and the ability to pay it Children dont confess they cant even if they admit spoken guilt they do not feel it nor give it any recognition that those who pay do Grant the unable credit as if they are able and youll only end up backrupt with decades of time lost and not one shred of gratitude nor remorse from those who took credit they were unable to pay Oz Steamer o what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton Firstly Nishimura was is MALE and Hillary is a woman Secondly anyone who thinks the Feminists want equality only has to look at this decision If Hillary was a man shed be in prison by now The Feminists especially the male ones are trying so hard to get her to be President The Feminists show they have never ever wanted genuine equality only to bash men and to get away with what can only be described as obvious criminal behavior For any religious person the choice is clear go with Feminism and Hillary or go with religion and oppose her and Feminism Pick one I fear the US election is already Hillarys as the Republicans are clearly trying to destroy Donald Trump and to win against your own Party elite and against Hillary and the media who automatically side with Hillary would be an impossible task God Help America if Hillary wins Mr Cipher Ya but shes offering free college and other goodies Horiboyable  You knew the fix was in because Obama had already come out and said he would support Hillarys bid before FBI director James Comey made his announcement Seriously what type of women would stay with a man that gets BJs from interns I tell you what type a women that would sell her mothers eyeballs in their lust for power Folks with this decision the line has been clearly drawn in the sand if you would like to see it It is THEM against US You are free to chose not to see reality but you are not free to avoid the consequences of reality bobbi She stays with him because who else would want her XSANDIEGOCA J B Im not shocked or surprised I would have more surprised if she wasnt handed a Get out of jail free card Its should be quite to others now who owns the Monopoly Board retired22 Perhaps what will save us is the gigantic financial correction coming down ona financial correction that will cripple the Welfare State  destroy political Washington Unfortunatelythis will give us a whole new set of problems Barry Lets all just admit to ourselves that the Clintons and maybe others mustve threatened Mr Comey into kowtowing to their will and not recommend these charges No doubt a death threat against him or his family was made to convince him to accede to their will Now Ms Lynch can easily just say that the FBI has recommended not to pursue an indictment so she will just let the matter drop off the radar How convenient Dead bodies have been left in the wake of the Clintons since Arkansas If you dont believe me just ask Larry Nichols JC Teecher I dont know of anyone that would not lie and turn against their work ethicpatriotism to prevent the possible death of one of their own little ones comey is no different He has to live with what he did as well as lyin lynch Some people have no conscience though much less a soul voltaic While you allwere silent as a mouse when GWB was not convicted for lying America into an endless war over fake WMDs You sense of justice is remarkable Jerry C Your New York Times reported we did find WMDs in Iraq What about Clinton who voted to attack Iraq on the same information Bush was given In addition it was Bushs advisor appointee from Clintons administration who told him Ah the facts again Cal Signs a nation is under judgment are many two in particular come to mind Sorceries the primary definition is obvious but the secondary meaning derived from the Greek Pharmakeia Pharmacy in English A drug epidemic has struck this country exceeding the 1960s killing thousands and women rulers Hillary will no doubt win this election because the devil ordains it and America is under judgment Obama is the stepping stone to the tribulation and the return of Bill and Hillary to the WH will destroy what is left of the United States during the tribulation America is not mentioned anywhere in biblical prophecy and the reasons are obvious For evil to prosper good men do nothing Good men did nothing to stop the Warren Court escalation of the Vietnam War and the drug saturated counter culturethe proverbial Pandoras Box and the beginning of the end of the greatest nation on earth Preacher62 Truth right there except for the part about the greatest nation This nation has always been about lawlessness and greed from the outset dropping off smallpox laced blankets killing millions of native americans to all the unjust wars especially the civil war declared to the millions murdered by abortion If the blood of Abel cried out to God from the ground how loud is the screaming he is hearing from this country bobbi Hillary will president not by election but by corruption black heart Rush likened the Comey cavein to that of Chief Justice John Roberts on the Obamacare challenge effectively rewriting the law so Obama would have his victory Good comparison but I believe the Comeycave is more in tune with FBI AD James Kallstrom when under pressure from Clinton he covered up the TWA 800 shoot down After Kallstrom retired he reportedly suffered sever mental anguish By a twist of fate Comey was at a pivot point in history It fell to him the the task of saving western civilization He failed he sold out and this will haunt him Hillary will be elected Any Democrat starts with some 200210 electoral votes In her first term after she grants citizenship to millions of invaders and invites millions more we have been effectively PRIed as in Mexicos forever ruling national party except for a minor break of 12 years The Republicans will never again control the Oval office or the senate or the house Thank you Comey you hack you political flack Until now the idea of session was a mere discussion point Texas will get serious after Hillarys inauguration Will Texas get out Probably not JB Sad day indeed Michael Ive said this before and Ill say it again the only thing that will change things is if the church in this country is on its knees in constant prayer praying for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and spiritual revival Thats why none of this makes any sense  its a spiritual battle For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms Ephesians 612 The wicked prosper while the righteous suffer but Christ didnt promise Christians a life free of persecution no servant is above his master Matthew 1024 Hillary gets away while Christians are fined and imprisoned for refusing to bake a cake  or take a photograph Wrong has become right and right has become wrong Isaiah 520 Its becoming like the days of Lot or Noah marked by violence immorality  and lawlessness Yet God holds the hearts of all rulers in His hands Proverbs 211  just as He hardened Pharoahs heart Hes still in charge and in control  as a believer if you want things to change you have free access to the control room of the universe Dark times indeed  and like Habakkuk we can be dismayed  but the righteous shall live by faith Habakkuk 24 Hebrews 1038 sistersoldier Amen JB Scorners seem to believe that the earth needs to be in a complete catastrophic upheaval before the Lords return Also there are those who identify with the household of faith that believe God is merciful and that they will not see or experience His wrath True God did not appoint us His elect to wrath but when He is ready to chastise a NATION one method He will use is to give our enemies power over us He did it with Israel and the US is no more blessed than the apple of His eye Life will seemingly be normal upon Christs second coming Natural disasters will precede Him stepping down on the Mt of Olives but life will continue to thrive until those who are alive and remain see Him face to face As it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man For in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark JC Teecher Good to see you sister The days of the entrance of AntichristSatan has been dramatized by the ignorant to the point that some people will be expecting an ugly man with horns and wearing red flannel underwear while sporting a pitch fork and serpents tail To the contrary he will be an awesome looking man in his early thirties with similarities as we have been shown as to what Christ may have looked like before he was imprisoned and beaten He will be speaking scriptures and seem so Holy with signs of power around him In fact the biggest sign was revealed to me and Im gonna share with you real soon maybe today What people dont understand is the fact that he will be impersonating Christ and come in peacefully and prosperously but will go out in a sort of blaze of demonic glory after killing the two witnesses That brings about the end of this age sistersoldier Welcome back JC I hope you had the opportunity to relax and catch plenty of fish Its good to see you posting again as well Yes I believe that it will be as you said or as the Bible says which agrees with your statement The Antichrist will indeed be fiercely attractive with a an irresistible charismatic personality He will represent all that the world worships Especially those who dont know the One True God Isaiah 53 describes Jesus as just the opposite of the way pictures and movies portray Him The deception began centuries ago with a false image of the true Saviors likeness The prophet said that our Lord had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him nothing in his appearance that we should desire him He was despised and rejected by mankind a man of suffering and familiar with pain Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised and we held him in low esteem Preacher62 Food for thought and simply my opinion not being argumentative The antchrist is not a person but a spirit just as the kingdom of God is within those who belong to himLuke 17 the spirit of antichrist is within those who belong to Satan I believe the teaching of a literal and physical antichrist to be a distraction from the truth We are told time and again in the scripture to examine ourselves to see if Christ is in us and if he is not then we have failed the test of Christianity Teaching that there is a literal antichrist keeps many looking out there for the enemy when we should be looking within for the enemy The war that we are fighting is not against flesh and blood and it is not out there the war we are fighting is within ourselves Satan is prowling around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour This refers to Christians because all who are not Christians have already been devoured Finally 1 John 2 tells us that MANY antichrists had already come and that was 2000 yrs ago there have been many since and there are many still to come I am sure The only real option we have is to do as the Lord commanded and Go and make disciples This is all that will prevent them from being devoured If we get too caught up with looking for something or someone that does not exist then we might become distracted from doing that which is necessary John 666 tells us the mark of man From that moment they left him and followed him no more The mark of Gods children on the other hand is that they hold out faithful till the end by the grace of God Love and blessings JC Teecher I see what you are saying however it makes me wonder if you believe that Satan is not a real entity and being held right now by Michael the Archangel Preacher62 No Satan is VERY real and the prince of this world JC Teecher Ok thanks Many follow mans teachings that Antichrist is a flesh man walking the earth right now while God teaches us exactly who he is how and when he comes in the book of Revelation I have even heard the pretribber Hagee say he will arise from Europe and then get shot in the head and miraculously recover and come back to life after three days What a hoot and hogwash Bill G Wilminton NC Many many Christians believe in The PreTrib Rapture including myself Hagee makes many good points so does Perry Stone and others Hagee does believe that HeAntiChrist will be shot and miraculously recoveras HeAntiChrist Mimicks Christ I study both pretrib and posttrib Rapture and I find many fallacies in the posttrib beliefs and it seems at times that the posttribbers focus on being included in the pain and misery of the Tribulationlike they dont want to be Left Out or feel that they should be LEFT OUT I believe that those that love The Lord are The Bride of Christ and one does not have their Bride get beat to a pulp and then sweep her away for the honeymoon There are other serious issues with the posttrib rapture Shalom GV I study both pretrib and posttrib Rapture and I find many fallacies in the posttrib beliefs  gee people reading the same Bible coming to totally different conclusions Bill G Wilminton NC God said that NO ONE would KNOW the day or the hour of The RaptureUncertain by Design BUT  For A Man to Lie with A Man As With a Woman Is an Abomination In The Eyes Of The Lord  Sorry GV No Uncertainty There GV your god ordered the murder of children and babies Sorry Bill no uncertainly there JB I agree with your personification of the antiChrist  many mistake anti to mean someone who is gruesome and abhorrent but in the Greek which is more precise translates into in place of Christ  in other words Satan creates his counterfeit as he always has  he tries to imitate what God does with his own version and well have a man arrive on the scene who the entire world embraces and some will mistake for the Messiah Like Satan he will want to be worshipped JC Teecher The thing is Satan is or shall i say will be the Antichrist All others that have come in the spirit of antichrist have been menflesh men Satan will come looking as a man even a flesh man but will be spirit bodied JB True God has and does judge corporately and some day individuals Many examples of that in His Word Our country has been given a lot of truth  as what was once a Christian nation  and to whom much is given much will be expected Nationally weve also been blessed because of a promise He made to Abraham those who bless you I will bless Whats unique about that is we were blessed  not because of anything we did because were certainly no longer living righteously  but because of a promise He made But as we continue to turn our backs on Israel that goes away and theres really nothing left to stay His judgment  except the prayers of believers But yes that was also something that astounded Habakkuk  he wanted God to pour some wrath on Israel and when God showed him that he was going to bring the Chaldeans on them for they were incredibly barbaric Habakkuk didnt like that much but the Lord responded that He is free to use whoever He chooses as His war club I think generally things will tend to get worse though Man says he is evolving and getting better but if you read Pauls letters to Timothy he describes terrible times in the last days and a very wicked generation df NJ It would be nice if corporations would go to Hell sistersoldier Yes and Amen The Bible submits the question Will the Son of Man Jesus find faith on the earth when He returns A testimony as to how wicked mankind will have become in the latter days If I may tag team on your comment about the blessing of Abraham Abraham is considered to be the father of faith He believed God and it was counted unto him as righteousness We know this because Abraham obeyed the voice of GodThe first seed which carried the promise to bless all nations was the seed of faith Faith in God is the seed that God can bless and still be true to His word as we know that not all of Abrahams descendants were righteous but his faith was pure America has rejected the God of the Word and the promise and thereby have chosen to forfeit the blessings What a mighty and a Righteous God we serve df NJ So we are all Jews first Got it Preacher62 Actually only those who belong to God are Jews Repent and believe the Gospel and you can be a Jew as well Romans 22829 28 For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision 29 No a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law rather it is a change of heart produced by Gods Spirit And a person with a changed heart seeks praise from God not from people sistersoldier NO I dont Gods Word affirms that the Jews are Gods chosen people You are a people holy to the Lord your God The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people his treasured possession Deuteronomy 76 From eternity past God knew that He would need to be born into the human race in order to save us from the spiritually dead condition that we were in Ephesians 12 Genesis 3 God had planned from the beginning to be born into a very small nation or race of people called the Jews JC Teecher The Lord works in mYsterious ways sister I just logged back on to see if you were also and boom there you are I have my shadowburner acccount set up so if you want me to email you just reply and Ill post it for you and then after i receive your email on that acct Ill send back my regular email and the info i spoke about sistersoldier JC Teecher crap its held up
