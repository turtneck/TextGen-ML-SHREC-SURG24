different at the University of Missouri campusStudents on Tuesday woke up to what protesters call a small but important victory a weekslong protest movement that ousted both the university president and the schools chancellorAfricanAmerican students at Missouri have long complained of a mealymouthed response by school leaders in dealing with racism on the overwhelmingly white Columbia campus Black student leaders have conveyed their displeasure over students openly using racial slurs and other incidentsThis is just a beginning in dismantling systems of oppression in higher education specifically the UM system said Marshall Allen a member of the protest group Concerned Student 1950The speed of Wolfes resignation shocked many As late as Sunday Wolfe didnt sound like a man who planned to leave his job putting out a statement expressing a desire to have an ongoing dialogue to address these very complex societal issuesBut the tide had already turned against him Saturday night when about 30 black members of the Missouri Tigers football team declared in a tweet that they wouldnt play until Wolfe was gone By Sunday more members of the team black and white and head coach Gary Pinkel publicly backed the players and the media started paying attentionBy Monday morning student groups were calling for walkouts and some faculty offered protesting students their support The calls for his resignation grew louderSo Wolfe  who had presided over the university system which includes the main University of Missouri campus in Columbia along with the University of MissouriSt Louis University of MissouriKansas City and Missouri University of Science and Technology  stepped down saying he took full responsibility for the inaction that has occurred and urged the university community to listen to each others problemsIt is my belief we stopped listening to each other we didnt respond or react he said Use my resignation to heal and start talking againStudents faculty and staff converged on the Carnahan Quad after Wolfes announcement There they linked arms and swayed side to side singing We Shall OvercomeThough the protesting students and some faculty say racial problems on campus go back decades the current crisis took flight back in September when Student Government President Payton Head took to Facebook to complain about bigotry and antihomosexual and antitransgender attitudes at the school after people riding in the back of a pickup truck screamed racial slurs at himFor those of you who wonder why Im always talking about the importance of inclusion and respect its because Ive experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university making me not feel included here he wroteIn early October a drunken white student disrupted the Legion of Black Collegians an AfricanAmerican student group while the group prepped for homecoming and used a racial slur when he was asked to leaveLater that month Concerned Student 1950  named for the year AfricanAmerican students were first admitted to the university  issued a list of demands including an apology from Wolfe his removal from office and a more comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum overseen by minority students and facultyLDamian Washington a former wide receiver on the football team said that he was happy the team was able to add leverage to Butlers hunger strike and that the protest wasnt just about Missouri or being black It was about discrimination in all forms everywhere he saidOnly a minority knows what it feels like to be a minority on campus he saidIts difficult to put yourself in others shoes he said explaining that even though he and Butler are black his experience  as a football player  on campus was different from ButlersA statement from head coach Pinkel and Missouri athletic director Mack Rhoades released after Wolfes announcement said football activities would resume TuesdayThe two men addressed the media Monday afternoonTheres no playbook Theres no script for what all of us have been dealing with And I think certainly its been also a great learning experience for everyone involved said RhoadesAs we move forward its paramount as a campus and a community that this not divide us but rather bring us together to listen to grow to understand and to create positive change the athletic director saidIf the Tigers had failed to take the field Saturday against the Brigham Young University Cougars at Kansas Citys Arrowhead Stadium the home of the NFLs Chiefs the team would have been forced to pay a cancellation fee of 1 million according to a copy of the contract published in The Kansas City Star earlier this yearOur teams excited about getting going again and playing and were looking forward to our game against BYU this weekend Pinkel told reporters saying he got involved because he supports his players and because Butlers life was on the lineMy support of my players had nothing to do with anyone losing their job With something like this football became secondary Pinkel said I just know my players were suffering and they felt awful and again Im like their dad and Im going to help them in any way I canThe
