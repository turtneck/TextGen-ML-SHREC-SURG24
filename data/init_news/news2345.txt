Islamic State suicide bombers brought terror chaos and bloodshed to the city at the heart of European unity on Tuesday detonating their nailspewing bombs at an airport departures hall and on a subway train in attacks that left at least 31 people dead and prompted authorities to launch an intensive manhunt for at least one suspected accompliceThe wanted man accompanied two of the bombers to the airport along with luggage heaving with explosives Authorities were also hunting for a suspected Belgian bombmaker who trained in Syria with the Islamic State and later sneaked back into Europe On Wednesday Belgian state broadcaster RTBF identified two of the attackers who targeted Brussels as brothers Khalid and Brahim BakraouiTuesdays mass killings add this city to an ignominious but growing list of European capitals that have been struck in the past year by deadly attacks either perpetrated or inspired by the Islamic State including Paris and CopenhagenAuthorities had been bracing for an attack in Belgium for months as the country has struggled to stem a tide of homegrown extremism and as the Islamic State has repeatedly threatened to hit Europe in its coreBut when the attacks finally came the magnitude was stunning The days violence represented the worst on Belgian soil since World War IIWhat we had feared has happened said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel This is a black moment for our countryPeople who died werent whole anymore They were in piecesThe apparently coordinated explosions created a renewed sense of threat that spilled far beyond Brussels as authorities boosted police patrols in cities such as Paris London and WashingtonThe targets appeared to have been chosen for their symbolic value and for their ease of accessThe attackers first struck with twin bombings at the international airport where earlymorning travelers were preparing to board flights linking Brussels to cities across the continent and around the world An hour later a subway car transiting beneath the modernist glassandsteel highrises that house the European Union burst with smoke and flameIn addition to the dead about 250 people were injured Belgian officials saidMany of the injured lost limbs as shrapnel from the blasts radiated through packed crowds Cellphone video recorded in the minutes after the airport blasts showed children cowering on a bloody floor amid the maimed and the dead Footage from a subway station revealed desperate scenes as people dressed for a days work stumbled from the mangled wreckage into a smokedrenched tunnelAuthorities acknowledged that they had been readying for an attack But nothing like this they saidWe never could have imagined something of this scale Interior Minister Jan Jambon told Belgian television station RTLAnd even as the country tried to recover from the trauma of Tuesdays strikes there was evidence that more could be on the wayHow the Brussels attacks could force Obama to betray his policy instinctsThe man being sought by police accompanied two of the bombers to the airport according to a senior Belgian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the case The taxi driver who transported them said they were hauling particularly heavy luggage that investigators believe was packed with explosivesAt an apartment in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels investigators later found explosive devices loaded with nails and chemicals along with an Islamic State flag the Belgian federal prosecutors office said in a statementIt was exactly the same type of bomb as at the airport the senior official saidBelgian police released surveillance images of three men pushing luggage carts at Brussels Airport The prosecutors office said two of them  dressed in black with black gloves on their left hands probably to conceal detonators  had blown themselves up But the third dressed in white was on the loose His identity was unknown and despite a nationwide hunt  with heavily armed officers combing the streets and checkpoints at Belgian borders snarling traffic for miles  the suspect remained at large Tuesday nightAcross the continent authorities were also hunting 24yearold Najim Laachraoui a suspected Islamic State bombmaker according to two European security officialsLaachraoui a Belgian who was born in Morocco and raised in the Schaerbeek neighborhood is believed to have trained in Syria and then returned to Europe His DNA was found on one of the explosives belts from Novembers Paris attacks and he is thought to have traveled at one point with Salah Abdeslam the only surviving suspect believed to have played a direct role in the Paris massacreTuesdays attacks came only four days after Belgian counterterrorism authorities cheered the arrest of Abdeslam 26 who was the most wanted man in Europe for the past four months Abdeslam was discovered hiding in a Brussels apartment building in the Molenbeek neighborhood near the center of the city After the raid officials said they had uncovered a web of suspects much broader than they previously imaginedWithin hours of Tuesdays assault the Islamic State asserted responsibility for the attacks according to a statement posted on the Amaq Agency a website believed to be close to the extremist group The message said Belgium was targeted because of its participation in an international coalition battling the group in Syria and Iraq US and European security officials said they believed the claim to be credibleThe latest bloodshed made clear that European capitals remain perilously vulnerable despite attempts to dismantle the militant network that perpetrated the worst terrorist attack in Paris in generations last NovemberIn Washington State Department spokesman John Kirby said US citizens were among the injured but he would not say how many No Americans are known to have died in the attacks although that information may change he said The State Department also issued an alert on traveling in Europe urging Americans to avoid crowded places and to exercise caution during religious holidays and at large festivals or eventsEurope has struggled mightily with spillover
