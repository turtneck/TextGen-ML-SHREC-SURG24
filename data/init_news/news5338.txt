CNN Republicans dreaming of shooing away Donald Trump may want to think twiceBy publicly rebuking the billionaire businessman for his inflammatory comments the party may convince Trump to launch a thirdparty candidacyThats a potential nightmare scenario for the GOP establishment a populist outsider with unlimited resources attacking their nominee from the right in the general election raising hell  and attracting votes  with his rhetoric on issues like illegal immigrationRalph Nader who has run for president multiple times as a thirdparty candidate and may have cost Democrat Al Gore the 2000 election by running to his left said Republicans mishandle Trump at their own perilThe Republican Party establishment is playing with nitroglycerine when it goes after Donald Trump and tries to minimize him and exclude him Nader said in an interview Thursday Because a jilted Donald Trump as a thirdparty candidate can blow the presidential race wide open and turn it into a three way raceLaunching a thirdparty candidacy is no small feat It is a timeconsuming and expensive process riddled with logistical hurdles including massive signaturegathering requirements to gain ballot access in each of the 50 statesBut if its tedious its hardly impossible  particularly for a candidate with money to throw aroundRepublicans remember all too well businessman Ross Perots independent candidacy for president in 1992 The Texan made an appeal to voters looking for an alternative to establishment candidates and his campaign is widely considered to have complicated George HW Bushs effort to win reelection against Bill ClintonClay Mulford Perots soninlaw and political adviser said a thirdparty run from Trump has the potential to energize a part of the electorate thats itching for a fresh faceThere is just a sense of ineffectiveness of the twoparty system So I think he would do better than expected if he were in the debates and if he were considered viable Mulford said And having money helpsIndeed poll numbers suggest that a thirdparty candidacy from Trump would damage Florida Gov Jeb Bush a toptier candidate in the current Republican fieldDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leads Bush 50 to 44 in a headtohead matchup according to an ABC NewsWashington Post poll out this week But throw an independent Trump into that race and Clintons lead grows significantly to 46 leaving Bush at 30Hed be the one person that would probably fit the bill Hes not really a Republican hes not a Democrat said former US Sen Dean Barkley of Minnesota who was appointed and served briefly as an independent by Gov Jesse VenturaIndependents decide the election every four years and if all of them or most of them go to Trump that leaves the Republicans too small of a base to have any chance of winningAt a campaign stop in New Hampshire Thursday Bush made sure to emphasize that he isnt dismissive of Trumps candidacyI think hes a serious candidate and hes going to have a lot of money Hes tapping into peoples angst that are legitimate Bush saidMeanwhile during a visit to the USMexico border in Laredo Texas Thursday Trump said his preference is to run as a Republican and he was confident that he could win the partys nominationBut in many ways a thirdparty run makes a lot of sense for TrumpThe former host of the reality TV show The Apprentice was once a registered a Democrat donated money to members of both parties and considered running for president in 2000 as an independentAt the very core of his campaign is the idea that he is the antipolitician Trump has never held public office and he loves to point out that thanks to his massive wealth  which he claims amounts to more than 10 billion  he is not beholden to anyone including party leadershipThis last point has already created massive headaches for the GOPTrump sparked furious backlash by referring to some Mexican immigrants that enter the United States as criminals and rapists Republicans criticized Trumps choice of words as being hurtful and insensitive to the immigrant community but many chose their words carefully  a sign of how delicate of an issue illegal immigration isFor many Republicans Trump seemed to cross the line last weekend with his critique of McCainI like people that werent captured OK Trump said of the Arizona Republican senator who spent more than five years in as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam WarThe RNC which remains neutral in the GOP nominating process took the unusual move of speaking outThere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably said RNC spokesman Sean SpicerThe RNC declined to comment for this storyBill Hillsman a political consultant who has worked for a number of independent candidates including in gubernatorial races in Massachusetts and Texas said the partys condemnation of Trump is likely to have helped fuel Trumps unorthodox campaignI think the damage is already done to a large extent Hillsman said All the people who said well his campaign is over now and blasted him for some of his previous comments many of which hes walked back they already have just pretty much dismissed this guy and the polls are saying otherwise
