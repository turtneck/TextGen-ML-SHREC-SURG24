Did Donald Trump really just surge past Hillary Clinton in two of the elections most important battlegroundsNew swingstate polls released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University show Trump leading Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania  and tied in the critical battleground state of Ohio In three of the states that matter most in November the surveys point to a race much closer than the national polls which have Clinton pegged to a significant midsingledigit advantage over Trump suggestThe race is so close that its within the margin of error in each of the three states Trump leads by three points in Florida  the closest state in the 2012 election  42 percent to 39 percent In Ohio the race is tied 41 percent to 41 percent And in Pennsylvania  which hasnt voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988  Trump leads 43 percent to 41 percentClintons campaign responded to the surveys by cautioning that while the swing states were always expected to be close the urgent stakes of a possible Trump election remain highWe know the battlegrounds are going to be close til the end Thats why we need to keep working so hard Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted Wednesday morning Trump is a serious danger folksTrump meanwhile thanked his supporters for the strong showing tweeting a celebratory series of images featuring Fox News graphics showing the Quinnipiac results Thank you Trump tweeted adding ImWithYou an implicit shot at the Clinton campaigns initial slogan Im With HerIn another blow to Clinton a McClatchyMarist poll of registered voters nationwide released on Wednesday showed Clintons lead over Trump slip to three points 42 percent to 39 percent after leading by six points in a Fox News poll conducted in late JuneBut other polls give Clinton an advantage in all three states Including the new Quinnipiac surveys POLITICOs Battleground State polling average  which include the five mostrecent polls in each state  gives Clinton a 32point lead in Florida a 28point edge in Ohio and a larger 46point advantage in PennsylvaniaBy Wednesday afternoon a quartet of battleground polls painted a hazy picture of the race in those three states as well as in Colorado and Wisconsin The latest NBC NewsMaristWall Street Journal polls showed Clinton up by three points against Trump in Iowa 42 percent to 39 percent tied in Ohio 41 percent to 41 percent and up by nine points in Pennsylvania 45 percent to 36 percent in contrast to her twopoint deficit in the Quinnipiac pollMonmouth Universitys survey of likely Colorado voters found Clinton with a significant 13point advantage while Trump cut into Clintons Wisconsin advantage by five points compared to last month trailing 45 percent to 41 percent compared to last month when Clinton led 46 percent to 37 percentWhile the Quinnipiac results are eyepopping they dont represent any significant movement  except in Florida In three rounds of polling over the past two months the race has moved from a fourpoint Trump lead in Ohio in the first survey then tied in the next two polls In Pennsylvania Clinton led by one point in the first two polls and now trails by twoBut in Florida the race has bounced around Clinton led by one point in the first poll two months ago but she opened up an eightpoint lead in June  a lead that has been erased and more in the new Quinnipiac surveyThe polls from the Connecticutbased school are likely to be met with some skepticism When Quinnipiac released their first round of polls in the same three states two months ago they prompted a round of sniping from Democrats and an Fbomb on Twitter from Nate Silver the FiveThirtyEight founder who has built a career using poll results to make political predictionsBut subsequent polls later confirmed the May Quinnipiac surveys Trump pulled virtually even with Clinton nationally after knocking out his rivals for the GOP nominationIts possible the results of the FBI investigation into Clintons private email server dating back to her service as secretary of state  FBI Director James Comey called Clinton and her staff extremely careless even as he said the government shouldnt press charges because there wasnt evidence of criminal intent  are driving Clintons poll numbers down leading into the conventions typically a critical time for campaignsIn the poll release the school suggested the investigation could have played a role pointing to other lingering questions about Clintons honesty and trustworthiness While there is no definite link between Clintons drop in Florida and the US Justice Department decision not to prosecute her for her handling of emails Quinnipiac pollster Peter Brown said she has lost ground to Trump on questions which measure moral standards and honestyBut the Quinnipiac polls are imperfect measures of a postemail investigation race Thats because like many of the schools other polls they were conducted over an unusually lengthy 12day time period June 30 through July 11The national polls conducted since Comeys statement are mixed Clinton posted a 3point lead in this weeks NBC NewsSurveyMonkey online tracking poll down from a 5point lead the week prior Morning Consult another online tracking poll gave Clinton identical 1point leads in the days before and after Comeys statementOverall Clinton leads by 43 points in the latest national HuffPost Pollster average and she has a 37point advantage in the RealClearPolitics averageThe polling in other battleground states since the announcement are also cloudy Monmouth University surveys conducted after the Comey statement gave Clinton a 4point lead in Nevada  but showed Trump ahead by two points in IowaIn the Quinnipiac polls there are warning signs for both candidates in all three states First despite nearuniversal nameID neither candidate can break out of the low 40s on the ballot test That points to two very unpopular candidatesBut in a reversal from earlier surveys its a more acute problem for Clinton Clintons unfavorable ratings 59 percent in Florida 60 percent in Ohio 65 percent in Pennsylvania are higher than Trumps 54 percent in Florida 59 percent in Ohio 57 percent in Pennsylvania in all three battleground states And majorities in all three states  which together account for 67 electoral votes or nearly a quarter of the 270 necessary to win the presidency  have a very unfavorable view of ClintonAnother measure of voters ambivalence about Clinton in the Quinnipiac poll a second ballottest question this time adding two thirdparty candidates to the mix When voters are asked to consider the general election again this time given the option of choosing Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein Trumps advantage over Clinton grows in each state Trump leads on the fourway ballot by five points in Florida one point in Ohio and six points in PennsylvaniaThere are some eyebrowraising results from the polls however On the twoway ballot test in Florida Clinton trails Trump despite the Republican winning just 21 percent of nonwhite voters in the increasingly diverse stateIn Ohio Clinton wins 90 percent of Democrats but Trump only captures 77 percent of Republicans putting him at a significant disadvantage In Pennsylvania where Democrats outnumber Republicans by close to 10 percentage points both candidates are at 82 percent among their own partisans with Trump only three points ahead among selfidentified independentsFormer presidential candidate Herman Cain on Wednesday said he was not surprised by Trumps upswingAnd thats because Donald Trumps substance is finally starting to cut through some of the media clutter and Hillary Clintons shallowness is also starting to emerge She is the freestuff candidate disguised as wanting to help people but thats not coming through But Donald Trumps substance is whats finally starting to emerge Cain told Fox  Friends in the same interview in which he praised former 2012 rival Newt Gingrich as the right choice for Trumps vice presidentFor Bernie Sanders Clintons dismal showing is more proof that his former rival needs to more effectively make her policybased case against TrumpThis is not a beauty contest between Trump and Hillary Clinton Sanders said on ABCs Good Morning America This is the fact that the middle class of this country is in trouble Which candidate has more to say about education more to say about health care more to say about climate change more to say about income and wealth inequality more to say about a sensible foreign policy And I think the more the people hear the contrast between the two I think Secretary Clintons support will grow
