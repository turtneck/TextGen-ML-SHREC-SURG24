maxBarack Obama We talked about foreign policy we talked about domestic policyDonald Trump This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half And it could have gone on for four hours I mean it was just in fact it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say And he told me the good things and the bad things there are things that are tough right nowLesley Stahl Like whatDonald Trump WellLesley Stahl Give us some meatDonald Trump Well look I dont want to divulge but we talked about the Middle East thats tough Its a tough situation I wanted to get his full view and I got his you know I got a good part of his viewLesley Stahl UhhuhDonald Trump And I like having that because Im going to be inheriting that in a short period of time I found him to be terrific I found him to be very smart and very nice Great sense of humor as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects but we were talking about some pretty tough subjectsDonald Trumpand we were talking about some victories also some things that that he feels very good about ButLesley Stahl LikeDonald Trump Well what I really wanted to focus on was the Middle East North Korea Obamacare is tough You know healthcare is a tough situationLesley Stahl Oh I bet he asked you not to undo itDonald Trump Well he didnt ask me no he told me you know the merits and the difficulties And we understand thatLesley Stahl You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office did something wash over you orDonald Trump No I think Im a sober person I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different In my case a little bit of a wild man Im not Im actually not Im a very sober person But it was respect for the office it was respect for the president Again I never met him before but we had we had a very good chemistry going And and I really foundit might not be that I agree with him but I really found the conversation unbelievably interestingBarack Obama I want to emphasize to you Mr Presidentelect that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed then the country succeedsLesley Stahl Was it at all awkward at all given what youve said about each other You said he was not born in this country he said things about you he said youre unqualifiedDonald Trump You know what it was a very it was a very interesting thing because I mean few people have asked me from my family what was that first period of time likeLesley Stahl YeahDonald Trump We never discussed what was said about each other I said terrible things about him he said terrible things about me We never ever discussed what we said about each otherLesley Stahl There was no awkwardnessDonald Trump Ill be honest from my standpoint zero zero And thats strange Im actually surprised to tell you that Its you know a little bit strangeDonald Trump Thank you sirLesley Stahl Do you think that that your election is a repudiation of his presidencyDonald Trump No I think its a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down Theyve let em down on the job front Theyve even let em down in terms of the war front You know weve been fighting this war for 15 yearsLesley Stahl This was the message of your campaignDonald Trump Weve spent 6 trillion in the Middle East 6 trillion we could have rebuilt our country twice And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the and our airports are like obsolete And I think it was just a repudiation of whats been taking place over a longer period of time than thatLesley Stahl You know you surprised everyone by winning the primaries beating 17 other Republicans or 16 whatever people are really surprised that you won this election Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as presidentDonald Trump You know Ill conduct myself in a very good manner but depends on what the situation is sometimes you have to be rougher When I look at when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country and I say it and I say it very proudly its going to be America first Its not going to be what were doingwe weve lost were losing this country Were losing this country Thats why I won the election And by the way won it easily I mean I won easily That was big big Lesley Stahl Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump Or are you going to reign it in Donald Trump Well sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated I dont want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will beLesley Stahl Can you beDonald Trump Sure I can I can be easily thats easier Honestly to do that its easierLesley Stahl So lets go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if youre going to do what you said or youre going to change it in any way Are you really going to build a wall Donald Trump YesLesley Stahl Theyre talking about a fence in the Republican Congress would you accept a fenceDonald Trump For certain areas I would but certain areas a wall is more appropriate Im very good at this its called constructionLesley Stahl So part wall part fenceDonald Trump Yeah it could be  it could be some fencingLesley Stahl What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrantsDonald Trump What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records gang members drug dealers we have a lot of these people probably two million it could be even three million we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate But were getting them out of our country theyre here illegally After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized were going to make a determination on the people that youre talking about who are terrific people theyre terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that But before we make that determination Lesley its very important we want to secure our borderPaul Ryan We had a fantastic productive meetingLesley Stahl So you were with Paul Ryan you met with the Republican leadership what was the one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right awayDonald Trump Well I would say there was more than one thing there were three things it was healthcare there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country Were going to substantially simplify and lower the taxesLesley Stahl And youve got both HousesDonald Trump And I have both Houses and we have the presidency so we can do thingsLesley Stahl You can do things licketysplitDonald Trump Its been a long time since its happenedDonald Trump And they gave me a lot of credit Dont forget I was abused four or five weeks ago they said I was going to instead of having all three we would lose all three So that was good But those are the three things that we really discussedLesley Stahl You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them moneyDonald Trump YeahLesley Stahl You admitted you used to do it yourself You have a transition teamDonald Trump And when you say lobbyists lobbyists and special interests Lesley Stahl And you want to get rid of all of that Donald Trump I dont like it no Lesley Stahl You dont like it but your own transition team its filled with lobbyists Donald Trump Thats the only people you have down there Lesley Stahl You have lobbyists from Verizon you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry you have food lobbyDonald Trump Sure Everybodys a lobbyist down there Lesley Stahl Well wait Donald Trump Thats what they are Theyre lobbyists or special interestsLesley Stahl On your own transition team Donald Trumpwe are trying to clean up Washington Look Lesley Stahl How can you claim Donald Trump Everything everything down there there are no people there are all people that work  thats the problem with the system the system Right now were going to clean it up Were having restrictions on foreign money coming in were going to put on term limits which a lot of people arent happy about but were putting on term limits Were doing a lot of things to clean up the system But everybody that works for government they then leave government and they become a lobbyist essentially I mean the whole place is one big lobbyistLesley Stahl But youre but youre basically saying you have to rely on them even though you want to get rid of themDonald Trump Im saying that they know the system right now but were going to phase that out You have to phase it out Lesley Stahl Lets talk about your cabinet Donald Trump OK Lesley Stahl Have you made any decisions Donald Trump YesLesley Stahl Tell usDonald Trump Well I cant tell you that but I have madeLesley Stahl Oh come onDonald Trump You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country First of all every major leader and probably less than major le has called me Ive spoken to many of them and Ill call the rest of them but and I said Boy this really shows you how powerful our country is France and UK and I mean everybody all over Asiaand very just to congratulate But it really shows the power of our countryLesley Stahl One of the things youre going to obviously get an opportunity to do is name someone to the Supreme Court And I assume youll do that quicklyDonald Trump Yes Very importantLesley Stahl During the campaign you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights Will you appoint are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v WadeDonald Trump So look heres whats going to happen Im going to Im prolife The judges will be prolife Theyll be veryLesley Stahl But what about overturning this lawDonald Trump Well there are a couple of things Theyll be prolife theyll be in terms of the whole gun situation we know the Second Amendment and everybodys talking about the Second Amendment and theyre trying to dice it up and change it theyre going to be very proSecond Amendment But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned it would go back to the states So it would go back to the states and Lesley Stahl Yeah but then some women wont be able to get an abortion Donald Trump No itll go back to the statesLesley Stahl By stateno some  Donald Trump Yeah Donald Trump Yeah well theyll perhaps have to go theyll have to go to another state Lesley Stahl And thats OKDonald Trump Well well see what happens Its got a long way to go just so you understand That has a long long way to go Lesley Stahl Are you in any way intimidated scared about this enormous burden the gravity of what youre taking on Donald Trump No Lesley Stahl Not at all Donald Trump I respect it But Im not scared by itLesley Stahl Now youre not scared but there are people Americans who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now demonstrating against you against your rhetoricDonald Trump Thats only because they dont know me I really believe thats only becauseLesley Stahl Well they listened to you in the campaign and thatsDonald Trump I just dont think they know me Lesley Stahl Well what do you think theyre demonstrating againstDonald Trump Well I think in some cases you have professional protesters And we had it if you look at WikiLeaks we had Lesley Stahl You think those people down there are Donald Trump Well Lesley Lesley Stahl are professional Donald Trump Oh I think some of them will be professional yeahLesley Stahl OK but what about  theyre in every cityLesley Stahl When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there I mean dont you say to yourself I guess you dont you know do I have to worry about this Do I have to go out and assuage them Do I have to tell them not to be afraid Theyre afraid Donald Trump I would tell them dont be afraid absolutelyLesley Stahl But thats not what youre saying I said it Donald Trump Oh I think no no I think I am saying it Ive been saying it Lesley Stahl OKDonald Trump Dont be afraid We are going to bring our country back But certainly dont be afraid You know we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time I mean people are protesting If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested everybody would say Oh thats a terrible thing And it would have been a much different attitude There is a different attitude You know there is a double standard hereIt has been five full days since the election and antiTrump demonstrations driven in part by Hillary Clintons edge in the popular vote have been significantWhen we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supportersNor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans Latinos and gays by some of his supportersDonald Trump I am very surprised to hear that I hate to hear that I mean I hate to hear thatLesley Stahl But you do hear itDonald Trump I dont hear itI saw I saw one or two instancesLesley Stahl On social mediaDonald Trump But I think its a very small amount Again I think itsLesley Stahl Do you want to say anything to those peopleDonald Trump I would say dont do it thats terrible cause Im gonna bring this country together Lesley Stahl Theyre harassing Latinos MuslimsDonald Trump I am so saddened to hear that And I say Stop it If it if it helps I will say this and I will say right to the cameras Stop itDuring the campaign Mr Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clintons email issueSo we asked him if he plans to carry that outThat part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady Melania Trump when we come backOn Friday Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence Mr Trump also added his three older children to the transition teamBetween now and Inauguration Day the team must fill the new administration with 4000 political appointees Thats 4000 new hires in just nine weeksWhen we talked to Donald Trump on Friday the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in He was subdued We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric lower the flameLesley Stahl I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out I think it was last night or the night before about these demonstratorsDonald Trump YeahLesley Stahl You said that they were professionalsand you said it was unfairDonald Trump I said some of them Some of them are Lesley Stahl But are you going to be tweeting and whatever youre upset about just put out there when youre presidentDonald Trump So its a modern form of communication between Face you know Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram I have 28 million people 28 million peopleLesley Stahl So you are going to keep it upDonald Trump Its a great form of communication Now do I say Ill give it up entirely and throw out thats a tremendous form I pick up Im picking up now I think I picked up yesterday 100000 people Im not saying I love it but it does get the word out When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network or whatever cause of course CBS would never do a thing like that right I have a method of fighting back Thats very toughLesley Stahl But youre going to do that as presidentDonald Trump Im going to do very restrained if I use it at all Im going to do very restrained I find it tremendous Its a modern form of communication There should be nothing you should be ashamed of Its its where its at I I do believe this I really believe that um the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook Twitter Instagram et cetera I think it helped me win all of these races where theyre spending much more money than I spent You know I spent my money A lot of my money And I won I think that social media has more power than the money they spent and I think maybe to a certain extent I proved thatLesley Stahl Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails And are you as you had said to her face going to try and put her in jailDonald Trump Well Ill tell you what Im going to do Im going to think about it Um I feel that I want to focus on jobs I want to focus on healthcare I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill We want to have a great immigration bill And I want to focus on all of these other things that weve been talking aboutLesley Stahl You you know youDonald Trump And get the country straightened awayLesley Stahl You called her crooked Hillary said you wanted to get in jail your people in your audiences kept saying Lock em upDonald Trump Yeah She didLesley Stahl Do youDonald Trump She did some bad things I mean she did some bad thingsLesley Stahl I know but a special prosecutor You think you mightDonald Trump I dont want to hurt them I dont want to hurt them Theyre theyre good people I dont want to hurt them And I will give you a very very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes togetherWith thatDonald Trump You look great honeyWe were joined by the next first lady Melania Trump Shell be only the second foreignborn first lady Shes from Slovenia John Quincy Adams wife Louisa was the firstLesley Stahl You know I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead The enormity Youre about to be first lady Are you a little nervous about it Little tense A littleMelania Trump Well there is a lot of responsibilities And its a lot of work needs to be done And its your stuff on your shoulders And we will take care of it day by day I will stay true to myself Im very strong and um tough and confident And I will listen myself and I

very warm And I think shell have a platform where shell really be able to do a lot of good And thats what she wants to doLesley Stahl You know first ladies usually have a cause And youve already said youre interested in speaking out against bullying on social mediaMelania Trump I think its very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt And we need to teach them how to talk to each other how to treat each other and to to be able to connect with each other on the right wayIts an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaignLesley Stahl What about your husbands tweetingMelania Trump Well sometimes he it got him in trouble But it helped a lot as well He had unbelievable followingLesley Stahl So you never say to him Come onMelania Trump I didDonald Trump She doesMelania Trump IMelania Trump You know of course I did many times from the beginning of the campaign ButLesley Stahl Does he listen to youMelania Trump Sometimes he listens sometimes he doesntDonald Trump Im not a big tweeter I mean I dont do too many but they hit home And they have to get a point acrossLesley Stahl If he does something that you think crossed a line will you tell himMelania Trump Yes I tell him all the timeLesley Stahl All the timeMelania Trump All the timeLesley Stahl And doesMelania Trump AndLesley Stahl he listen Does heMelania Trump I think he hears me But he will do what he wants to do on the end Hes an adult He knows the consequences And I give him my opinion And he could do whatever he likes with itLesley Stahl Did you ask Melania sort of for permission in a way to run for president Did you get her approvalDonald Trump Well I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it Don Ivanka Eric Tiffany Barron to a lesser extent but Barron too Um because in a way hes affected every bit as much Maybe moreLesley Stahl Maybe moreDonald Trump And so we all had a dinner and I said I would like to do this I think I can do a great job And I wanted to get number one a consensus and number two ideally their permission And they all agreedLesley Stahl Your son Barron what is he

Your parents are here rightMelania Trump Theyre hereLesley Stahl Will they go to Washington with youMelania Trump They might We will see We will discuss thatLesley Stahl Are you prepared both of you for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny And you know first ladies are really criticized if one little hairs out of place Are you both prepared for thisMelania Trump We are used to itDonald Trump I will say it is on a different scale now cause Ive had a lot But Ive never had anything like thisLesley Stahl You wont be able to walk down the streetMelania Trump I didnt do that for two years already so you know it will just continue Its another level but it will continueAt that point the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr Trump facesLesley Stahl FBI director James Comey Are you going to ask for his resignationDonald Trump I think that I would rather not comment on that yet I dont I havent made up my mind I respect him a lot I respect the FBI a lot I think Lesley Stahl Even though they leak so muchDonald Trump Well theres been a lotta leaking theres no question about that But I would certainly like to talk to him And see him This is a tough time for him And I would like to talk to him before Id answer a question like thatLesley Stahl Sounds like youre not sureDonald Trump Well sure Im not sure Id wanna see you know he may have had very good reasons for doing what he didLesley Stahl Are you gonna release your tax returnsDonald Trump At the appropriate time I will release them But right now Im under routine audit Nobody cares The only one who cares is you know you and a few people that asked that question Obviously the public didnt care because I won the election very easily So they dont care I never thought they did careLesley Stahl Now for months you were running around saying that the system is rigged the whole thing was rigged You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracyDonald Trump I doLesley Stahl So do you still think its riggedDonald Trump Well I think the electoral ca look I won with the Electoral CollegeLesley Stahl ExactlyBut do you thinkDonald Trump You know itsLesley Stahl its riggedDonald Trump Yeah some of the election locations are Some of the system is I hatedLesley Stahl Even though you won youre saying thatDonald Trump I hated well you know Im not going to change my mind just because I won But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes You know you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win Theres a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play Electoral College and theres something very good about that But this is a different system But I respect it I do respect the systemLesley Stahl What about vacations Youre not going to take any vacations Youve said thatDonald Trump We have so much work Theres so much work to be done And I want to get it done for the people I want to get it done Were lowering taxes were taking care of health care I mean theres just so much to be done So I dont think well be very big on vacations noLesley Stahl Are you gonna take the salary the presidents salaryDonald Trump Well Ive never commented on this but the answer is no I think I have to by law take 1 so Ill take 1 a year But its a  I dont even know what it isDonald Trump Do you know what the salary isLesley Stahl 400000 youre giving upDonald Trump No Im not gonna take the salary Im not taking itIn a moment the Trump children join us and we will ask the presidentelect where he stands on gay marriage Obamacare and ISISOn Tuesday Donald Trump reached deep into Americas ranks of the discouraged and neglected a largely white constituency They feel their America hasnt been great for a long time And they accepted a promise to make it great againBut Mr Trumps appeal wasnt just to the disaffected A map on election night was a sea of red as he won support across the traditionally Republican South but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the MidwestHillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs among minorities and especially women Just 51 percent of collegeeducated white women voted to make her the first female president Her base didnt come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trumps new and energized coalitionOn Friday Mr Trumps four older children  Tiffany Donald Jr Eric And Ivanka  joined us to talk about their fathers surprising victoryLesley Stahl Set the scene Its election night Your father no ones expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you Tell us about being in that roomEric Trump You start to see the states falling You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner And then you saw Ohio you saw North Carolina You saw Pennsylvania You saw Wisconsin I mean you saw all these great states  theyre all falling And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew And it was amazing We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention SoLesley Stahl He went quiet is what I heardEric Trump its itsLesley Stahl is what I heardEric Trump its a moment Ill never forget I can tell you that I mean the team was around and everybodys cheering And it was just it was it was a beautiful nightIvanka Trump It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America We had enormous pride joy Its incredibly exciting And were very grateful for the opportunity And we take that opportunity very seriouslyLesley Stahl TiffanyTiffany Trump I mean I dont think we can really prepare for our father becoming president But we were all there together with everyone thats worked so hard And my dad has worked so hard And its just  its really aweinspiringAt some point that night and into the next day calls from wellwishers started pouring in  including Mr Trump told us from both expresidents Bush Neither of whom supported him in the campaignLesley Stahl What did the bBushes say when they called youDonald Trump Well it was very interesting I got a call from Father Bush who is a wonderful man And he just said Congratulations It was an amazing campaign And then I got a call from George and he said Congratulations It was great And you know look its its a tough situation I went to war with Jeb And Jebs a nice guy but it was a nasty campaign It was a nasty campaign And I mean Im disappointed in one thing He signed a pledge and I dont know how you sign a pledge and then you dont honor it It was a rough primary Its a rough primary Although I think the general was probably just as tough Probably as a combination it was the roughest everLesley Stahl Ivanka you said that your fathers changed in the campaign How has he changedIvanka Trump I think its impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better You meet and in my fathers case literally millions of Americans and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles their challenges They share with you their most intimate stories So you connect with people in a different way And you growLesley Stahl Do you think your fathers changedEric Trump I think as a family weve changed to tell you the truth I mean how big this platform is is incredible And I have to say one of the most rewarding things of my life and I can speak on behalf of really all of us its fighting by our fathers side every single day as youve gone through a grueling grueling process like thisLesley Stahl Don did you discover something about your father that you didnt know beforeDonald Trump Jr You know we we know him pretty well And weve got to you know be by his side for many years both as a father and in business So you know the tenacity that hes always shown was just there But it was just so much more When I was watching him working 20hour days doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying Well it wasnt triage Which state are we gonna do today its Were just gonna do em all Were gonna speak to all of these people And I think people saw that energy They fed off that energy That energy was so much of the movement that he was able to create And you know it it only furthered what I already knewLesley Stahl I want to ask you all about something thats going on right now around the country A lot of people are afraid Theyre really afraid African Americans think theres a target on their back Muslims are terrifiedDonald Trump I think its horrible if thats happening I think its built up by the press because frankly theyll take every single little incident that they can find in this country which couldve been there before If I werent even around doing this and theyll make into an event because thats the way the press isLesley Stahl Do any of you want to say anything about this fear thats out thereDonald Trump Jr I I think the fears you know while they may be there some fabricated some not are totally unfoundedLesley Stahl One of the groups thats expressing fear are the LGBTQ group YouDonald Trump And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention AndLesley Stahl You didDonald Trump Everybody said That was so great I have been you know Ive beena supporterLesley Stahl Well I guess the issue for them is marriage equality Do you support marriage equalityDonald Trump It its irrelevant because it was already settled Its law It was settled in the Supreme Court I mean its doneLesley Stahl So even if you appoint a judge thatDonald Trump Its done It you have these cases have gone to the Supreme Court Theyve been settled And Im fine with thatLesley Stahl One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your fathers temperament And he has himself has said If someone insults me or says something unkind about me Im gonna strike back And now people are saying Well maybe he should kinda soften that control that a little What how do you think hes going to comport himself as presidentEric Trump I think very presidential At the same time my father if he needs to be a fighter he can be a fighter And I think this country quite frankly needs a fighter And I think thats what this country electedDonald Trump They spent 1 billion against me on the word Temperament It was given by Madison Avenue And they thought that by temperament they could maybe you know win the election Obviously it didnt work because were here and theyre not And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and were going to start winning again Were going to win on trade were going to win at the borders were going to knock out ISISLesley Stahl You have said that youre gonna destroy ISIS Now how are you going toDonald Trump I dont tell you that I dont tell you thatLesley Stahl Yeah but what can Donald Trump Im not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is  its a tough fight because number one the people from the leaders of ISIS have left What do you why do I have to tell you thatLesley Stahl Troops on the groundDonald Trump Im not gonna say anything I dont want to tell them anything I dont want to tell anybody anythingLesley Stahl Yeah but what aboutthe American peopleDonald Trump I wanna do the job We have some great generals We have great generalsLesley Stahl You said you knew more than the generals about ISISDonald Trump Well Ill be honest with you I probably do because look at the job theyve done OK look at the job theyve done They havent done the job Now maybe its leadership maybe its something else Who knows All I can tell you is were going to get rid of ISISLesley Stahl Let me ask you about Obamacare which you say youre going to repeal and replace When you replace it are you going to make sure that people with preconditions are still coveredDonald Trump Yes Because it happens to be one of the strongest assetsLesley Stahl Youre going to keep thatDonald Trump Also with the children living with their parents for an extended period were gonnaLesley Stahl Youre gonna keep thatDonald Trump Very much try and keep that Adds cost but its very much something were going to try and keepLesley Stahl And theres going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it when millions of people could lose  noDonald Trump No were going to do it simultaneously Itll be just fine Were not going to have like a twoday period and were not going to have a twoyear period where theres nothing It will be repealed and replaced And well know And itll be great health care for much less money So itll be better health care much better for less money Not a bad combinationLesley Stahl Roles during the administration Any of you want a job in your fathers administration Eric Trump So we have an amazing company You know one of I think the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commanderinchief And I think hes going to rely on us more than ever AndLesley Stahl So youll stay up hereEric Trump So well well well be in New York and well take care of the business I think were going to have a lot of fun doing it And were going to make him very proudLesley Stahl People think that youre going to be part of the administration IvankaIvanka Trump Im no Im going to be a daughter But Ive Ive said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues And that I want to fight for themLesley Stahl But you wont be insideIvanka Trump Wage equality childcare These are things that are very important for me Im very passionate about education Really promoting more opportunities for women So you know therere a lot of things that I feel deeply strongly about But not in a formal administrative capacityLesley Stahl Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brandIvanka Trump I dont think it matters This is so much more important And more serious And so th I I you know thats the focusDonald Trump I think what Ivanka trying to say Who cares Who cares This is big league stuff This is this is our country Our country is going bad Were going to save our country I dont care about hotel occupancy Its peanuts compared to what were doing Health care making people better Its unfair whats happened to the people of our country and were going to change it As simple as that 2016
