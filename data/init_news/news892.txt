Waking Times Supporters of Clinton in the painfully long 2016 presidential campaign warned us before the vote that if Trump lost the election his supporters would stop at nothing to disrupt Clintons inauguration They said riots violence and revolution would break out and that Republicans would claim voter fraud and refuse to respect the democratic process or accept the results should Hillary have won This scare tactic and all the other nightmare fantasies about Trump projected into public consciousness by the left were insufficient to persuade enough voters to go for Hillary and as many suspected would happen Clinton voters are now doing the precise things they had previously declared to be unacceptable Hypocrisy is now as American as apple pie and no one is really all that surprised that phony idealists are taking to the streets destroying property threatening to assassinate the president elect  and organizing to prevent Trumps inauguration  Some are even openly calling for revolution The deeper irony here though is that people from all walks of life should be out protesting the government as well but for much more significant reasons than to protest the outcome of the election In the true American spirit of redressing grievances and as a public service to a nation struggling to find purpose and reason here are four critical issues that any worthwhile protestor should add to their postelection list of complaints against the machine 1 The Orwellian Permanent War and The Military Industrial Complex This is the biggest elephant in the room The US has ongoing military operations in dozens of nations and it has at least 800 military bases in eighty something foreign nations  Hundreds of noncombative foreign civilians a year are killed by US bombs and drones and written off as collateral damage The military industrial complex has fully commandeered the progress and development of technology and sells billions of dollars of weapons each year to countries around the world including severely oppressive dictatorships states like Saudi Arabia  At home expenditures on defense account for over half of every dollar US taxpayers give Uncle Sam diverting resources away from improving our country here at home Surplus military equipment and battle hardened veterans are increasingly moving into the civilian law enforcement sector dramatically exacerbating social issues such as police brutality and racism  The security industry has expanded to include the mass surveillance of every American and continues to invade our privacy in evermore creative ways  Genuine organic terrorism against Americans at home and abroad is the indirect result of destroying foreign nations and entire civilizations  stealing oil and other resources from foreign nations while murdering innocents War has become the health of the state and its poisoning every segment of our society and culture 2 Serious Human Rights Abuses Committed by Government Protestors today are taking to the streets to reject the verbal and emotional abuse of minority and sensitive members of our society while actual physical human rights abuses are going underaddressed Members of America and the worlds elite are involved in covering up and participating in a global trade of sex slaves  and widely believed to be involved in pedophilia child abduction and occult worship and rituals  3 Debt Slavery The toptier of the banking and investment world have created a global system of economic slavery which intentionally creates everincreasing public debt The human race owes so much money that no one really understands to whom it is owed  It could be aliens for all we know but if the status quo remains it would take the daily productivity of many generations to come to pay off only what is owed today and the debt increases every minute This is a stealthy form of slavery that is written into the matrix code of society To be born on earth is to owe money This is utterly unacceptable and so systemically unstable its guaranteed to collapse causing worldwide suffering  4 Environmental Stewardship is Criminally Negligent Viewpoints on the environmental stress we see in our world today vary wildly depending on who you talk to and what their background or agenda may be Call it global warming climate change or whatever you like but at its core our natural world is being sold off and destroyed for corporate profit Massive unchecked pollution and environmental destruction by the energy industry and corporations at large is destroying this planet at an exponentially increasing rate Industrial disasters like Fukushima go unaddressed while the worlds rainforests are being decimated and indigenous cultures driven to extinction  This sad list just goes on and on Its just too much to put down here Final Thoughts You could easily add so much more to this if you like as there are a thousand and one causes rebelling against yet so very few ever seem to make it into public consciousness and onto the corporate mainstream news  If youre outraged about what is happening in America today but havent yet included these issues on your mad as hell list  then your protest isnt living up to its full potential and your idealism is only halfassed Read more articles by Dylan Charles  About the Author Dylan Charles is a student and teacher of Shaolin Kung Fu
