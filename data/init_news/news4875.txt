The first and only vicepresidential debate of 2016 was less a gamechanger than a channelchanger a snippy and probably inconsequential 90 minutes marginally won by Mike Pence  a confident slightly smarmy debater very much in the mold of those calculating Washington DC politicians who are destroying AmericaTim Kaine Hillary Clintons more voluble running mate didnt flop but he was visibly less comfortable than the squarejawed Pence frequently interrupting the Indiana governor jamming his preprogrammed attacks on Donald Trump into every answer with admirable tedious efficiencyTheir performances almost perfectly reflected the priorities of each candidate Kaine was a hyperbriefed Trumpthumping machine barking the GOP nominees name as if it were a slur some 160 times  more than twice the number of times Pence mentioned Clintons according a POLITICO tallyPence on the other hand seemed less concerned with outandout defending his running mate than ropeadoping away from uncomfortable questions His standard response was to pucker his face and mock Kaine as ridiculous for pelting him with facts statistics and actual Trump quotesAnd if Kaine who doesnt have an especially close personal relationship with Clinton warmly referred to Hillary as if the two were the best of friends Pence maintained a wary rhetorical distance from Trump He behaved less like an affectionate pal than a guy getting paid to do a job a pet employee reassuring disgruntled coworkers that their unpopular boss was actually a great guy really if only you guys got to know himIn the end you got the sense that Pence did as much maybe more to burnish his own brand than Trumps  and even if hes widely deemed the winner what lasting good will it do for his undisciplined selfdefeating nominee Here are five takeaways1 Hillary Clinton is lucky shes facing Trump instead of Pence Even after having his leonine head handed to him at the first presidential debate last week theres no decisive evidence that Trump is taking prep for Sundays second round in St Louis any more seriously than he took prep for the first The same cannot be said for Pence a true professional who huddled with Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker for a week and produced a focused performance parrying every attack with a sharp assault on the unholy trinity of Clinton sins emails the foundation and her foreign policy failings as secretary of statePence was as ungoadable as Trump was easily gulled When an aggressive Kaine demanded he defend his running mates comments on everything from declaring Mexican immigrants rapists to Trumps suggestion that the US encourage other countries to develop nukes Pence mocked him Did you work on that one a long time Because that had a lot of creative lines in itIn the real world outside the Farmville Va debate hall Pence has contradicted or contrasted himself from Trump on any number of issues  most notably his flat refusal to entertain the false assertion that President Obama isnt a nativeborn citizen But inside he did a far better job of making Trumps case than the candidate has made on his own behalfDuring his Hofstra meltdown Trump was so occupied defending himself against the selfassured Clinton he forgot his most effective attacks including a muchanticipated hit on the fundraising practices of the Clinton Foundation Pence was a cooler customer who calmly went through his headhunting todo listWhile she was secretary of state the Clinton foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors he said  precisely the kind of targeted attack Trump needs to make in order to recover from his disastrous first debateAlec Baldwin studied Trump for weeks to pull off his uncanny impersonation on last weeks Saturday Night Live Trump would be well served to study the YouTube of Pences performance for pointers2 Tim Kaine wasnt trying to win the debate  he was trying to bash Trump The Virginia senator has a reputation for being a nice guy but he was given a hit mans job on Tuesday And the target was Trump not Pence whom the Clinton campaign regards as a political bit player who will vanish into obscurity after the electionHence Kaines task was a slightly awkward one to aim over Pence and hit Trump It didnt really work and not for lack of tryingHis best moment arguably came when he produced a laundry list of awful things Trump has said about women Mexicans and a disabled reporter Pence juked and refused to answer  which allowed Kaine to declare Hes refused to defend his running mate  and yet hes asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend he said in one of the debates few memorable exchangesBut he came off as a bit nervous like a frustrated school kid trying to disgorge a memorized speech if only his rowdy classmates would allow him to deliver it At times he seemed peevish Pence actually interrupted Kaine a lot but his interjections were punchy often an aspirated no intended to deprive the former Virginia governor a clean sound bite while Kaines frequent attempts to be heard were of the whiny itsmyturntotalk variety which had many viewers and a focus group convened by GOP pollster Frank Luntz judging Kaine to be rude3 Snatching discord from the jaws of victory Clinton and her brain trust according to several Democrats I spoke to were satisfied if not elated by Kaines performance Whether Trump appreciated Pences defenses well thats less clear Moments after the candidates left the stage John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times quoted a Trump adviser saying that the GOP nominee who was watching the debate from a hotel in Vegas was less than satisfied with his running matePence won overall but he didnt win with Trump the adviser told Harwood4 Pence dodged almost every tough question How do you defend a running mate much of America deems as indefensible You dontTrumps chorus of validators fanned out this week to declare him a genius for using the tax code to avoid paying taxes  but the real genius may have been Pence who figured out the best way to answer the thorniest questions about Trump was to respond with an attack on Kaine or the moderator Elaine Quijano Sure he answered a handful but a tiptoe through the transcript reveals what amounts to a master class in rhetorical deflectionWhen it came to the New York Times story on Trumps 1995 New York State tax return  which showed the estate and casino magnate claiming a nearly 1 billion loss Pence shrugged his shoulders and repeated the campaigns talkingpoint with televangelistical conviction Donald Trump is a businessman  he actually built a business Pence intoned Like everybody he faced some pretty tough times 20 years agoPence slipped the hook during the most consequential exchange of the night  a tag team onslaught by Kaine and Quijano pressing for Pence to call for Trump to release his tax returnsQuijano to her credit repeatedly asked Pence why it was okay for Trump to withhold his filings when the Indiana governor had dutifully released the 10 most recent years of his income statements Pence was fumbling for an answer when Kaine who seemed more focused on venting outrage than pinning his quarry interrupted her to make a forgettable point5 Quijano was a weak moderator Tuesday marked the first time a digital division reporter moderated a major debate and Quijano  a wellregarded former CNN anchor who now works for CBSN  showed her inexperience She allowed both candidates to repeatedly interrupt each other at times seeming to whisper her questions and demands for decorumElaine Quijano one and done
