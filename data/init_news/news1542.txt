After five Republican debates most Americans know about Donald Trumps provocative beliefs like his desires to end birthright citizenship stop Muslim immigration and kill families of suspected terrorists Much less attention has been paid to Carly Fiorinas conclusion that the minimum wage is unconstitutional Mike Huckabees pledge to defy Supreme Court rulings he deems incompatible with Gods law Rick Santorums claim that Islam is not protected by the First Amendment or Chris Christies threat to shoot down Russian planes and launch cyberattacks on Chinese leadersThose provocative beliefs believe it or not were also expressed during the five Republican debates They were just overshadowed by the furor over Trump It might be natural for an opposition party to sound bombastic during primary season especially when its frontrunner is blessed with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of bombast but the debate transcripts read like a Democratic opposition researchers dreamThe good news for Republicans arguably is that their rhetoric has been so consistently overthetop that it has started to sound routine academics call this shifting the Overton window the range of whats considered politically acceptable Ive watched all the debates as well as the undercards live but when I reviewed the transcripts I was amazed how many radical statements had slipped under my radar Ted Cruz called for putting the United States back on the gold standard Marco Rubio accused President Barack Obama of destroying the US military Huckabee said Bernie Madoffs ripoffs werent as bad as what the government has done to people on Social Security and Medicare Lindsey Graham said his administration would monitor all Islamic websites not just jihadist ones I had even forgotten Trumps claim that vaccines caused autism in a 2yearold girl he knewVaccines do not cause autism Goldbuggery is crackpot economics The US military is still by far the strongest in the world And what the government has done to people on Social Security and Medicare is give them pensions and health care But none of those statements drew any pushback from the other Republican candidates or for that matter the media moderators Neither did Ben Carsons assertion that if the United States had set a goal of oil independence within a decade moderate Arab states would have turned over Osama bin Laden and anybody else you wanted on a silver platter within two weeks which is wackadoodle on multiple levelsAfter the first Trumpobsessed debate in August I wrote about how the Republicans were racing to the right to try to attract the scraps of attention that werent going to Trump My favorite example that night was Bobby Jindals promise to sic the IRS and the Justice Department on Planned Parenthood on his first day as presidentbasically an impeachable crime But that didnt turn out to be an isolated incident In fact Cruz made the same promise in a later debate except for the IRS part presumably because he also vowed to abolish the IRSThe Democratic candidates have also appealed to their partys ideologically committed base during their primary debates which perhaps for that reason have been scheduled at odd times when few Americans have been watching But with occasional exceptions from socialist Bernie Sanders who suggested that he wouldnt mind 90 percent tax rates on the rich they havent said much that felt particularly surprising or politically damaging Debtfree college may or may not be a good idea but its hard to imagine Republicans turning it into an attack lineBy contrast the GOP debates have felt like madcap purity contests with the candidates competing to demonstrate their commitment to supplyside tax cuts and foreignpolicy belligerence as well as their fierce opposition to illegal immigration and every imaginable government regulation Rubio supposedly the establishment alternative to Trump vowed to repeal Wall Street reform in its entirety and oppose abortion without any exceptions John Kasich supposedly the moderate in the GOP race vowed to punch Russia in the nose Wild accusations by nonTrump candidatesthat the independent Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low to prop up Obama that Obama shows more respect to Irans ayatollah than Israels prime minister that 300000 veterans died last year while waiting for health care that Obama is trying to strip away the sovereignty of the United States that David Petraeus was prosecuted for sharing classified information with his girlfriend because Obama didnt like himhave provoked no reaction whatsoever during the debatesDemocratic leaders have expressed glee about these nationally televised festivals of rightwing metooism but another way of thinking about them is as highly rated mostly unrebutted advertisements for the notion that Obama is a disaster and America is in peril So far the Republicans have had more than 20 hours to tell the public that the idea of America is slipping away that were on a path to socialism that America has been betrayed Nobody on the debate stage disagreed when for example Christie declared that Obama doesnt respect the military or the police or that Americans believed in a more prosperous future in January 2009 when the economy was losing 800000 jobs a month until Obama stole that belief You might not take Christie at his word that Obama is a feckless weakling but when you hear it over and over you might assume he must be missing at least some feckAt times a few of the Republican contenders have dared to challenge the magical thinking that has dominated the debates Rand Paul has been a consistent voice against regime change as a cure for what ails the Middle East Kasich has mocked the fantasy that massive highend tax cuts would create balanced budgets And Trump has bucked GOP conventional wisdom on foreign and domestic issues denouncing the Iraq War as a waste of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars that could have shored up American infrastructure instead while defending progressive taxation as a logical approach to raising revenue from those who can afford itWhen I slogged through the transcripts I also noticed a few interesting ideas buried amid the canyoutopthis rhetoric When he wasnt accusing Obama of criminalizing Christianity while exalting the faith of Guantnamo detainees Huckabee was often calling for more focus on chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer that cause so much pain and cost so much money When she wasnt telling whoppers about Planned Parenthood videos and Obama firing a general who never served in his administration Fiorina kept pushing for zerobased budgeting the idea that every program and agency should have to justify every dollar every year When he wasnt complaining that Obama cares more about antiMuslim sentiment than antiSemitism Santorum suggested that veterans should get most of their care from private hospitals and that the Veterans Administration should become a specialized center of excellence for militaryfocused health issues like prosthetics and PTSDBut policy entrepreneurialism was not the gist of the Republican debates The gist was that the survival of the United States is at risk that Obama has been weak on ISIL and Assad and Russia and China and Iran and Hezbollah and every other distasteful figure on the world stage that calling radical Islam by its name and targeting the bad guys and taking the fight to the enemy will solve all the problems in the Middle East On domestic issues the gist was that the United States in the Obama era has become a dystopia of rampant unemployment high taxes runaway deficits porous borders and jobkilling regulationand that undoing what Obama did would make America great againThese are presumably winning messages in a Republican primary Its not clear whether they would be in a general election The reality of the Obama era for all its warts is that unemployment has dropped to 5 percent the deficit has shrunk by two thirds illegal immigration has plateaued far fewer US soldiers are dying abroad and Americans are more likely to be killed by lightning than by terrorists at home The question is whether the runforyourlives talking points will crash into statistical reality or whether they will gradually help create a new political realityThe Democrats would say the GOP is simply defying realityon climate on economics on the ease with which muscular foreign policies can fix the world on just about everything Then again the GOP isnt the party thats hiding its debates on weekend nights Its views may be extreme but its airing its views for all to see Its acting like a confident partyperhaps an overconfident partywhile the Democrats are acting like theyve lost their feck
