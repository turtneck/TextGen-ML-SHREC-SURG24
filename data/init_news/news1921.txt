California plays an outsized role in American agricultureThe state grows onethird of the countrys vegetables and twothirds of its fruits and nuts That includes 99 percent of almonds 95 percent of broccoli 90 percent of tomatoes and 74 percent of lettuceSo youd think that the Californias fouryear drought and severe water crisis would have a devastating impact on our produceBut that hasnt really happened  certainly not yet Recently the US Department of Agriculture reported that US supermarket prices rose just 29 percent in 2014 and were only expected to increase 2 to 3 percent in 2015 Those numbers are basically in line with average annual increases over the past 20 yearsWhats more the USDA currently projects that overall fruit and vegetable prices will barely budge in 2015  despite the severe and ongoing drought in California So whats going onOver at the Los Angeles Times Russ Parsons lists several factors at play here A key one is that the cost of growing produce only makes up around 10 percent of the retail price you actually see at the supermarket Theres also transportation packaging and distribution plus various markupsThe prices of many foods are driven more by market demand than droughtThat means that difficult conditions for farmers wont necessarily send food prices at the grocery store skyrocketing There could also be countervailing factors at play For example oil priceshave been falling around the world since last June which as the USDA notes can help cut down on food transportation costsIn a similar vein a 2014study from the University of California Davis on Californias drought pointed out that grocery store prices for nuts wine grapes and dairy food are driven more by market demand than by the drought As such that study concluded that Californias water crisis wouldnt greatly affect consumer prices across the nationParsons also points out that Californias farmers arent all being equally devastated by the drought Some agricultural regions of the state particularly on the coast have been less affected than areas like the Central Valley Whats more some farmers facing water shortages have also experienced favorable temperatures and growing conditions  strawberry farmers are one example  which has blunted the impactAdd it all up and you get a mixed picture Carrot prices have risen 48 percent in the last year  but strawberry prices have fallen 8 percent Asparagus has fallen 7 percent The vast majority of those fruits and vegetables all come from California Theres no single drought story hereTheres also another important angle here Many of Californias farmershave found ways to adapt to water shortages albeit in ways that could have longterm ramificationsGroundwater pumping has replaced up to 75 of lost surface waterThe one thats gotten a lot of attention is groundwater pumping The federal governmenthas been cutting back on the amount of water delivered to farmers in the Central Valley due to lowerthanexpected snowfall and runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountainsTo compensate many farmers are pumping the water out of underground aquifers that have accumulated over hundreds of yearsThat has helped stave off shortterm disasterThe UC Davis study found that in the Central Valley groundwater pumping has helped farmers replace about 75 percent of the water theyve lost due to cutbacks from reservoirsThe problem is that those underground aquifers are getting depleted rapidly  and since they built up over a long period of time they dont recharge easily A 2012study in theProceedings of the National Academies of Sciences found that the Central Valleys aquifers dont refill completely even during Californias wet periods because pumping doesnt totally stop Whats more in a few areas groundwater pumping causes the ground to sink permanently which means they can hold less water in the futureThat means farmers are losing a crucial buffer against both this drought  if it persists  and severe droughts to come Agriculture is thriving for now But what about the future For its part the state of California has begun regulating groundwater withdrawals but rules on sustainability will only be slowly phased in between 2020 and 2040Of course just because supermarket prices are staying steady doesnt mean the drought has been completely painless As that UC Davisstudy mentioned above noted farmers have suffered heavy impactsThat study which came out in June 2014 estimated that farmers faced direct costs of about 15 billion last year  including 1 billion in revenue losses about 3 percent of the states agricultural value and 500 million in additional groundwater pumping costsThere was also a loss of about 17100 jobs The costs were particularly high in the Central ValleyThis year the costs could be even higher Arecent survey by the California Farm Water Coalition estimates that roughly 41 percent of irrigated farmland will lose delivery of at least some surface water in the spring and summer All told some 620000 acres of farmland will likely go fallow with potential losses to farmers reaching 3 billion or moreCould things get so bad that eventually consumers at the grocery store notice Its tough to say The USDAkeeps warning that at some point the ongoing drought in California could have large and lasting effects on fruit vegetable dairy and egg prices But that hasnt happened yet For now its been a lot more painful for farmers than for food shoppersA guide to Californias water crisis  and why its so hard to fix
