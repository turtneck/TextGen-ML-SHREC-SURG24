Theres something odd about Marco Rubios presidential campaign He hasnt been doing all that much er campaigning in the early statesUnlike most recent presidential nomination winners who have invested serious time and effort into campaigning and building organizations in at least one of either Iowa or New Hampshire Rubio has taken a positively relaxed approach to both He doesnt show up very often doesnt do much campaigning when he is around and doesnt seem to be building very impressive field operationsAnd its raising eyebrows James Pindell of the Boston Globe wrote last week that Rubios New Hampshire surge was riddled with doubts and that GOP insiders are bemoaning his lack of staff and activity National Reviews Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson reported Wednesday that Rubios weak ground game was angering Iowa Republicans And the New Hampshire Union Leader wrote an editorial headlinedMarco Marco Wheres RubioFor a candidate whos so often deemedThe Republican Barack Obama it sure seems like Rubio has missed some key lessons from the presidents historic 2008 campaign And this isnt good optics for a candidate whos already been criticized somewhat unfairly for missing lots of Senate votes eitherThe conventional wisdom is that a candidate needs to win either Iowa or New Hampshire to win the nomination In fact every nominee for decades has done that except for Bill Clinton in 1992 an odd year in which the Iowa caucuses effectively didnt count because Iowan Tom Harkin was running Candidates whove tried to skip both early states in hopes that a later win will propel then to prominence have failed miserablyFurthermore said conventional wisdom continues the way to win in both Iowa and New Hampshire is to work hard on the ground The candidate should spend a lot of time there The campaign should build up a network of local relationships winning over supporters one by one And the campaign should focus on organizing to identify committed voters and make sure they actually turn out to the polls Organizing like this helped power Barack Obama to victory in Iowa in 2008Yet Rubio doesnt appear to be focusing on any of thisNow its not that Rubio is ignoring Iowa and New Hampshire Indeed his operation has spent millions on ads in each state His team just doesnt appear to be spending time on this nutsandbolts campaign activity that so many political professionals think is crucial to actually winningIf we believe what Rubios advisers are saying they arent using these tactics too much because they genuinely believe their effectiveness is overrated Theyre saying that they think ads and media coverage not field or campaign events are the keys to victoryMore people in Iowa see Marco on Fox and Friends than see Marco when he is in Iowa Rubios campaign manager Terry Sullivan told the New York Times And Alberta and Johnson report that Rubios team believes a sprawling operation weighs down a campaign and wastes precious resources that could be spent on TV ads that reach more voters Presumably Rubio isnt making more campaign trips to the early states so he can spend more time raising money that can fund these crucial adsPerhaps Rubios team is right and most other campaigns are just wasting their resources by spending big on organizing But its a questionable hypothesis So far this year ad spending appears to have had little relation to candidates poll standing It has definitely enriched many political consultants thoughAnother possible explanation is that Rubios campaign is trying to savvily lower expectations for his performance in both states because neither is a particularly good fit for him Iowa has lately tended to elevate evangelical favorites and New Hampshire has sometimes opted for flinty independentthinking outsiders Perhaps Rubio hopes hell get a pass for doing poorly in both states because he didnt really tryBut that may be too clever by half The evidence seems to indicate that if you want to win the nomination you need to do really well in either Iowa or New Hampshire  otherwise you quickly vanish from the media spotlight and from voters thoughts much like Rudy Giuliani did in 2008 If Rubio hopes to avoid this fate he should probably get to work
