Im going to walk away with it and win outright Im going to get in and all the polls are going to go crazy Im going to suck all the oxygen out of the room I know how to work the media in a way that they will never take the lights off of me  Donald TrumpDonald Trumps blend of bombast amorality and media savvy has carried him to the Republican nomination Hes proven that an ability to dominate coverage and dictate the narrative is sufficient in todays political climate None of this is surprising Trumps a TV man with a gift for selfpromotion His entire career has been preparation for this moment this campaign He saw our broken perverted process with clear eyes and hes exploited it with aplombYou have to give him credit for thatWhile the Republican Party is ultimately responsible for Trump they welcomed him into their big tent after all the media is equally culpable for the calamity that is his candidacy Every American is entitled to be as undiscerning and uncritical as they like Theres nothing in the social contract that demands voters educate themselves A democracy for the most part can tolerate its share of credulous citizens But the media has a special obligation in a free society Its the only profession protected by the US Constitution for a reason its a check on power and a gadfly for crooked politicians and abusers of powerThe media has failed spectacularly this election It Trumps campaign may not be good for America said Les Moonves the CEO and executive chairman of CBS but its damn good for CBSMan who would have expected the ride were all having right now The moneys rolling in and this is fun Ive never seen anything like this and this is going to be a very good year for us Sorry Its a terrible thing to say But bring it on Donald Keep going This is the plundering reaction Trump expected They will never take the lights off of me he famously said to Republican officials two years before announcing his candidacyImportantly Trump also understood how to navigate the process without engaging issues that matter To call his campaign substancefree is too generous Its been a cavalcade of insults and ethnonationalist dogwhistling punctuated by populist platitudes If we had a functional media Trump would be challenged by journalists and anchors Instead theyre too busy monitoring the ratings to notice hes using them to prop up his campaignPart of the problem as Columbia journalism professor Todd Gitlin notes in The Washington Post is that Trump has cracked the campaign reporters code Gitlin writes Trump regularly runs circles around interviewers because they pare their followup questions down to a minimum or none at all After 30plus years in the media spotlight he knows how to wait out an interviewer offering noncommittal soundbites and incoherent rejoinders until he hears the phrase lets move on He takes advantage of the slipshod shallow techniques journalism has made routine particularly on TV  techniques that in the past were sufficient to trup up lessmediasavvy candidates  but that Trump knows how to sidestep Examples of this abound Gitlin cites interview after interview in which Trump ropeadopes reporters when they ask questions he cant answer or when they suggest however passively that hes wrong or lied about the record Trump is a master of darting from slogan to slogan Gitlin writes Thats why interviewers must do their homework and be prepared to go at least 23 questions deep on any issue Great idea but its difficult to dive deep when interviewers are forced to shoehorn serious questions in limited time between competing toothpaste commercials Trump gets away with this because of the mutually beneficial relationship he has with the press He knows people like Moonves are interested in selling penis pill ads not informing the electorate Voters for their part are happy to project whatever they want onto the empty vessel that is Trump Meanwhile the truth is an afterthought and the whole sordid circus continues unimpeded Gitlin urges journalists to honor the good name of their profession and take off the kid gloves Sound advice but Im not holding my breath
