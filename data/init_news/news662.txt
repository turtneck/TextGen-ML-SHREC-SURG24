Debby Borza stood before a wall of photos of 40people who died here Sept 11 2001 and gently tapped her daughters face on a computer touch screen not knowing exactly what to expectWhat do they have to say about my dear sweet daughter she said her face brightening as the screen filled with photos of Deora Frances Bodley 20 at her high school graduation working as a volunteer reading tutor visiting Paris  an album of a promising young life cut short 14 years ago Friday when four alQaeda terrorists hijacked United Airlines Flight 93Borza was among the family members given an early look at the 26million Flight 93 National Memorial visitor center that opened this week remembering the legacy of the 911 attacks and honoring the courage of 40passengers and crew members who fought back against their four hijackers preventing the plane from hitting its presumed target the US CapitolIts important to me that the visitor sees what these 40 people took on to take a stand for freedom to take the kind of stand that cost their lives said Borza whose daughter was the youngest female passenger on Flight 93 Maybe there will be some special thing they see about Deora that will inspire themAs Americans mark the 14th anniversary of the 911 attacks thousands will gather at longestablished monuments at Ground Zero in New York at the Pentagon in Virginia and at other sites honoring the nearly 3000 people who lost their lives in the deadliest terrorist attack in US history But those who come to the national monument in Shanksville to honor Bodley and the passengers who kept 911 from becoming even more catastrophic will find a work still in progressThe stunning concreteandglass visitors center and museum are finally open but landscaping and other finishing touches are still underway Yet another structure the Tower of Voices a nearly 100foot bell tower with 40 chimes is scheduled to be built during the next two yearsA memorial plaza close to the crash site in a field that was once a strip mine was completed in time for the 10th anniversary in 2011At the time former president Bill Clinton visiting the site with former president George W Bush expressed frustration with the pace of the projectClinton and Bush soon became personally involved speeding fundraising and development according to Gordon Felt president of Families of Flight 93President Clinton and President Bush both came through for us said Felt whose brother Edward Porter Felt 41 died in the crashFelt said the families were closely involved in all aspects of the complex development working with private donors and state and federal officials  as well as the National Park Service which operates the memorial  to raise money acquire land select a design and complete constructionOur loved ones left a legacy for all of us Felt said noting that the plane which was traveling at 563mph was less than 20 minutes of flying time from Washington If the Capitol building was destroyed that day just think how much more devastating an impact that day would have had on our countryThe legacy of Flight 93 might already have inspired others to stand up against terrorist attacks Felt said Last month three Americans acted to avert a massacre on a train in FranceIts important that we dont forget the events of the day but the individual people who stood up to say no Felt said They could have sat back and let others dictate the end of their lives But they fought back and became heroes in the processIn the chill and rainOn Thursday several hundred people huddled under umbrellas in a heavy chilly drizzle for the official opening of the visitors center Speakers remembered the passengers and crew of Flight 93 who changed the course of American history said Pennsylvania Gov Tom Wolf DThey are modernday heroes who represent the very best in us said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell who also quoted from Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg Address delivered on another remote Pennsylvania field We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might liveAlan Hantman the appointed architect of the Capitol from 1997 to 2007 addressed family members in the crowd noting that he was in the building on the morning of Sept 11 2001 and saying Im one of those who was saved by your loved onesPaul Murdoch the architect of the memorial said it is designed to highlight the power of the story of Flight 93In its raw severity we acknowledge their sacrifice In its solemn darkness we acknowledge their loss In its calm serenity we offer solace at their final resting place And in its monumental scale we praise their heroic deeds Murdoch told the crowdThe visitors center and museum is set between two soaring concrete walls that rise 40feet high one foot for each of those who died It is set directly on Flight 93s flight path with a black stone walkway indicating the precise route that the plane followed On the valley floor below a large boulder marks the point of impact serving almost as a headstone in a place where very few human remains were recoveredThe center presents the events of Sept 11 2001 as they unfolded The first display that visitors encounter features that mornings Wall Street Journal photos of local students entering an elementary school a diagram showing that there were 4500 planes in the air when Flight 93 took off at 842 am from Newark on its way to San FranciscoThe next display features video clips of a stunned Katie Couric telling viewers of NBCs Today that a plane had struck the World Trade Center There follows video of the second plane hitting the South Tower collapsing the voice of ABC News anchor Peter Jennings saying My GodDisplay cases are filled with tiny fragments of the plane bits of metal and wire and electronics a charred seat belt a safety instruction card bent metal spoons and forks the Oracle employee identification card of passenger Todd Beamer the New Jersey drivers license of passenger Colleen Fraser a Visa card that belonged to one of the hijackersAt one display visitors can pick up a phone and listen to some of the 37 calls that were made from Flight 93 that morning some to 911 and some to family members Those calls allowed passengers to understand that what they faced was not a normal hijacking and it also allowed them to say goodbyeI just wanted to tell you I love you Were having a little problem on the plane Im totally fine I just love you more than anything just know that Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas says in a message on her husbands answering machinePassenger Linda Gronlund calls her sister and says I just love you and I just wanted to tell you that I dont know if Im going to get the chance to tell you that again or notAnother wall is dedicated to a lifesize photograph of a Boeing757 cabin showing the plane as the passengers would have seen it after the hijackers forced them all to the back When they decided to rush their attackers they had to move 100 feet to the front of the plane down an aisle 20inches wideEd Root whose cousin flight attendant Lorraine Bay died in the crash stood in front of the photograph contemplating that daunting prospectWe all ask ourselves What would I have done if I was here Root said What would you do Would you have just stayed back there and hoped for the best Or would you have reacted Thankfully they did reactWhile 911 is a defining event for America Root noted that it is getting to be history for younger Americans even those now in collegeWe need them to remember he said This history is not over This is a story that goes on
