Sen Marco Rubio RFla is officially in for the 2016 presidential race telling the Associated Press that he feels he is uniquely qualified to run and serveAnd Rubio is nothing if not unique in todays GOP Hes young 43 years old in an increasingly old partyhes Hispanic in a party that is hemorrhaging Latinovotes hes a very good communicator in a party that struggled to find one in 2012 and he has ties to both the tea party and the party establishment in a party that is very much split between the two And as weve argued before hehas more upside than just about anybody in the 2016 race Republican or DemocratHes also putting a lot more on the line than just about anybody else For a few reasonsSen Rand Paul RKy is also running for president and like Rubio is up for reelection in 2016 But because Paul comes from a red state and the filing deadline for his seat isnt till late January 2016 he could potentially revert to staying in the Senate if his presidential campaign doesnt catch fireRubio doesnt have that luxury He comes from Florida a big swing state in which you need to be focused on that race from day one Democrats already have a solid contender in Rep Patrick Murphyand other Republicans are alreadylooking at running for Rubios seatThe filing deadline in Florida isnt till May 2016 so Rubio could conceivably attempt what Paul is doing he hasnt quite ruled it out though hecame close but national Republicans cant really afford to let Democrats get that much of a head start in a very important state while Rubio figures out whether he can win the GOP presidential nominationAll the otherGOP hopefuls either arent up in 2016  Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and Sens Ted Cruz RTex and Lindsey Graham RSC for instance  or are out of office altogetherRubio as the youngest GOP hopeful in the field is the only one giving up a bird in hand for the possibility of two in the bushWell it doesnt matter if he doesnt win the nomination you might say because hes got a really good shot at becoming the vice presidential pick This makes complete sense with Republicans likely to nominate another white man and likely to face the potential first female president getting some diversity on their ticket will be keyAnd nobody fits the bill better than RubioSome are even joking about Rubio running for VPBut the idea that Rubio could run for president with being VP as a backup plan took a significant hit the day Jeb Bush started running for president Thats because the fellow Floridianis perhaps the likeliest if not likely period nominee and the Constitution basically precludes him from picking Rubio as his running mateItsays that no state can cast its electoral votes for a ticket that includes to people from their own state And given Floridas 29 electoral votes are well kind of important its really hard to see Bush picking Rubio  unless one of them conveniently established residency outside the Sunshine StateIn short at this point Bush seems like the most likely nominee and Rubio the most likely vice presidential pick but Bush wont pick Rubio3 He has a lot more timeRubios youth also means he has more time to wage a political comeback yes But there are no guarantees in a state like Florida and winning office is much more difficult than holding an office you already inhabitWhats more the Republican bench in Florida is teeming with ambitious young pols by virtue of the GOP dominance of the state The GOP controls all statewide offices and about twothirds of the state legislatureNo Republicans havent exactly fielded the greatest candidates in recent years Connie Mack much but there are lots of new faces these days That means that if this whole 2016 thing doesnt pan out Rubio cant count on returning to statewide office in Florida any time soonRubio would certainly be a frontrunner but he would probably have to fight for itTime works both ways Yes Rubio would have yearsto mount a comeback But it also means he has time to wait for another presidential campaign  one in which he wouldnt have to give up his seat in the Senate to runAnd yet he has chosen to strike while the iron is semiwarm and risk his political future on running for presidentWhats clear is that he doesnt enter into it lightlyUpdate Longtime Florida political reporter Adam Smithtells our own Fix Boss about the reasoning for Rubios move
