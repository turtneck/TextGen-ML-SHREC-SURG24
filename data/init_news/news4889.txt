treaty were carried out behind closed doors For over 751 deputies in the European Parliament there are more than 30 thousands lobbyists The Society for European Affairs Professionals SEAP  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in Europe The European worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions Multinational corporations will have unlimited power over European workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggleWill European workers lie down and accept this imposture What concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over European workers Which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic strangleholdThere are currently no political parties running in the major European elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests But there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite We will mention them belowThere are two important geopolitical processes to consider here The first is the EastWest corporate  geopolitical axis America is pulling the European peninsula away from the Eurasian continent With the installation of a neoNazi regime in Kiev Washington attempted to recreate an Intermarium from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and down to the Eastern Mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between Russia and GermanyIn order to facilitate the social transformation of Europe into a America Minor millions of pilgrims are necessary Hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious European workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the PowerEliteIn the new Trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist Fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind In each European country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare These antifa are the modern equivalent to Oswald Mosleys fascist gangs in the 1930s they represent the same class interests Pettybourgeois leftism is the New World Orders avantgardeA favourite passtime of the Antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers One can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs So police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the Spanish Civil War Such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations The agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services French police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over French suburbs They complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents They have been demonstrating in Paris They have been calling for an end to the control of the French police by free masonry Exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target Black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reasonThe recent demonstrations by French police in France against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the French police could be waking up to the reality that France is government by a criminal gang After the Magnanville terrorist attack in June where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of President Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls It was a highly significant act of insubordinationThe police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring massesMany of these dissident police officers are linked to Le Pens National Front A reliable source in French intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left They see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology From the Arab Spring to Nuit Debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism The potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more studyWhat should we make of all this in the context of CETA As I have said on numerous occasions the far right in France are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie But the National Front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing Rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left The prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass familiesAs I have pointed out before looking at a debate between the Trotskyist JeanLuc Melanchon and Marine Le Pen in 2011 one would have thought that Le Pen was was the leftist and Melanchon the rightwing militarist Melanchon shamelessly defended the NATO bombing campaign of Libya while Le Pen opposed itCivil war on the horizonThe rightwing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the French territory between Muslims and nonMuslims He Quote s Francois Hollandes own writings to back up his claims Everyone is talking about an imminent civil war In the bars and cafes of Paris one can hear more and more disgruntled French citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of Russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling classThe scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of French politics But one should not have illusions about the National Front they are following the menacious Zionist narrative on the war on terror Muslims are the problem The partys vicepresident Forian Philippot is close to the ultraZionist lawyer GillesWilliam Goldnagel a friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuPhilippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate Jean Frdric Poisson who said Hillary Clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the Zionists Poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France CRIF where he sought forgiveness He was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget In spite of the National Fronts antiMuslim bias an increasing number of Muslims are voting for the party Many Muslims prefer the National Front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian warsThere have also been major strikes by police in Ireland for similar reasons to France French workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat Meanwhile the French government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to Britain to stay in France The Socialist Party is creating a new electorate It is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants The oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through GMOS Takfiri antiIslam and total reification of life CETA is the beginning of the end for social hope It is the prelude to the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership TTIP  the most evil trade deal in historyFrench vicepresident of the Trilateral Commission Herve de Carmoy wrote a book in 2007 entitled LEuramerique  Euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run by a financial oligarchy CETA is the prelude to that project
