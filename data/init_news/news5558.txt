 Renowned Harvard Psychologist Says ADHD is Largely a Fraud Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century Jerome Kagan r Print Email httphumansarefreecom201611renownedharvardpsychologistsaysadhdhtml Viewed by academics as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century Jerome Kagan ranked above Carl Jung the founder of analytical psychology and Ivan Pavlov who discovered the Pavlovian reflex in a 2002 American Psychological Association ranking of the eminent psychologists He is wellknown for his pioneering work in developmental psychology at Harvard University where he has spent decades documenting how babies and small children grow and is an exceptional and highlyregarded researcherSo it may be surprising to learn that he believes the diagnosis of ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is an invention  and only benefits the pharmaceutical industry and psychiatrists Mislabeling Mental Illness That is the history of humanity Those in authority believe theyre doing the right thing and they harm those who have no power says Jerome KaganIn an interview with Spiegel Kagan addressed the skyrocketing rates of ADHD in America  which he attributes to fuzzy diagnostic practices He illustrated his point with the following exampleSay fifty years ago you have a 7yearold who is bored in school and exhibits disruptive behavior Back then he would be labeled as lazy But today that same child is said to suffer from ADHD  Thats why weve seen such a dramatic increase in the disorderEvery child who is having problems in school is sent to see a pediatrician who then claims its ADHD and prescribes Ritalin  In fact 90 percent of these 54 million kids dont have an abnormal dopamine metabolism The problem is if a drug is available to doctors theyll make the corresponding diagnosis he saidWe could get philosophical and ask ourselves What does mental illness mean If you do interviews with children and adolescents aged 12 to 19 then 40 percent can be categorized as anxious or depressed But if you take a closer look and ask how many of them are seriously impaired by this the number shrinks to 8 percent Describing every child who is depressed or anxious as being mentally ill is ridiculous Adolescents are anxious thats normal They dont know what college to go to Their boyfriend or girlfriend just stood them up Being sad or anxious is just as much a part of life as anger or sexual frustration Kagan told SpiegelWhat are the implications for the millions of American children who are inaccurately diagnosed as mentally ill Kagan believes its devastating because they think there is something fundamentally wrong with them Hes not the only psychologist to raise the alarm about this trend but Kagan and others feel theyre up against an enormously powerful alliance pharmaceutical companies that are making billions  and a profession that is selfinterestedKagan himself suffered from inner restlessness and stuttering as a child but his mother told him Theres nothing wrong with you Your mind is working faster than your tongueHe thought at the time Gee thats great Im only stuttering because Im so smart If he had been born in the present era he most likely would have been classified as mentally illADHD isnt the only mental illness epidemic among children that worries Kagan depression is another In 1987 about one in 400 American teenagers was using an antidepressant By 2002 the numbers leaped to one in 40 He feels its another overused diagnosis simply because the pills are available Instead of immediately resorting to pharmaceutical drugs he thinks doctors should take more time with the child to find out why they arent as cheerful for instance At the very least a few tests should be carried out  and an EEG for certain especially since studies have shown that people who have heightened activity in the right frontal lobe respond poorly to antidepressantsKagan remembers going into a textbooktype depression after a major research project he was involved with failed He had insomnia and met all the other clinical criteria for depression But since he knew what the cause was he didnt seek professional help After six months the depression was gone Under normal circumstances he would have been diagnosed as mentally ill by a psychiatrist and put on medication By Carolanne Wright  Reference Spiegelde Dear Friends HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use If you appreciate my work please help me continue Stay updated via Email Newsletter Related
