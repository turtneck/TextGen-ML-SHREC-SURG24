Morgan Elementary School South in Stockport OhioSTOCKPORT Ohio  Sixthgrader Kayla Hunter considers herself pretty tech savvy She has a computer at home unlike about half her classmates at her elementary school And it matches up well with the one shell use this week to take a new test linked to the Common Core standardsStill the perky 11yearold worries During a recent practice exam at her school in Ohio she couldnt even log on It wouldnt let me she said It kept saying it wasnt right and it just kept loading the whole timeHer stateon Tuesdaywill be the first to administer one of two tests in English language arts and math based on the Common Core standards developed by two separate groups of states By the end of the school year about 12 million children in 29 states and the District of Columbia will take them using computers or electronic tabletsThe exams are expected to be more difficult than the traditional spring standardized state exams they replace In some states theyll require hours of additional testing time because students will have to do more than just fill in the bubble The goal is to test students on critical thinking skills requiring them to describe their reasoning and solve problemsThe tests have multimedia components written essays and multistep calculations needed to solve math problems that go beyond just using rote memory Students in some states will take adaptive versions in which questions get harder or easier depending on their answersBut theres been controversyThe tests have been caught up in the debate playing out in state legislatures across the country about the federal role in education Although more than 40 states have adopted Common Core which spells out what reading and math skills students should master in each grade several have decided not to offer the tests  known as the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium and Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers or PARCC Some states are introducing other new state standardized tests this yearThe Common Core tests fulfill the requirement in the federal No Child Left Behind law for annual testing in reading and math in grades three to eight and again in high school But as Congress seeks to rewrite the education law theres debate over whether the tests should be required by Washington and whether students are being tested too much Parents in pockets of the country have joined a movement to opt out of these standardized testsQuestions also have been raised about students keyboarding skills and schools computer capacitiesIn the Appalachian foothills where Kayla attends Morgan South Elementary School administrators and teachers worry that they dont have the bandwidth to provide reliable Internet connectivity on testing day Both tests offer a paper option PARCC officials anticipate that about a quarter of students will use the paper version Smarter Balanced officials estimate roughly 10 to 20 percent will take it on paperJust eight days before the test the Morgan Local School District in rural southeastern Ohio ordered 200 more Chromebooks which worked best during the practice runThe week before the test Kayla and her classmates huddled in pairs sharing what devices were available at the school Theyll be more comfortable with the technology but it is a worry of mine that as far as the content thats on it theres still stuff I could be doing to prepare for the test says their teacher Carrie YoungElevenyearold Colton Kidd says the screens on the Chromebooks are too small Classmate Josie Jackson 12 prefers pencil and paper But Liam Montgomery likes computerized tests Its easier to get the answers down because I dont have to flip back and forthIn some places school administrators and state leaders are only grudgingly moving forwardReferencing federal law Illinois State Board of Education officials threatened to withhold funds from any district that didnt administer the PARCC exam Chicago Public Schools officials cited technology concerns in announcing they wont give the exam in a majority of its schoolsTrisha Kocanda superintendent of the Winnetka Public Schools in Illinois told parents that shes concerned about the length of the tests and the excessive rigorWe grow wary Ms Kocanda said adding that they believe this test continues the overemphasis on standardized assessments as evaluation tools for students and schoolsIn Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindals effort to stop the PARCC exam was derailed by a state judge who said the governors actions were harmful to parents teachers and students Jindal has said he took the action because he opposes what he views as federal intervention in the adoption of the standardsOfficials from the testing groups stand by the tests In each of the states students will see something thats familiar and something thats new different and exciting said Tony Alpert executive director for Smarter BalancedSmarter Balanced took the best of what states had in their previous systems and we made sure each state had access to that Mr Alpert saidLaura Slover the chief executive officer of PARCC said the tests have an important equity component because parents can compare how their students are doing in comparison to students in other statesEducation Secretary Arne Duncan said states are going to figure this out togetherI think change is hard but anyone who thinks we should just do fill in the bubble tests and not look at critical thinking  I dont quite understand that Duncan saidHefling reported from Washington Associated
