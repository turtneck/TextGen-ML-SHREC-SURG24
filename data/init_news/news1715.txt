Jay Parini  a poet and novelist teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont His newest book is  Empire of Self A Life of Gore Vidal which is forthcoming in OctoberCNN Bernie Sanders my Vermont senator and indeed a friend of many years is now running for president  He noted at his announcement with a familiar note of wise irony People should not underestimate meTo most Americans of course Sen Bernie Sanders is only a name if that He is barely known to the general public which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nationThose who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some leftwing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the Senate as we did in 2006 Let me add this as someone who has followed him closely and with admiration for a long time When people stop to listen to Bernie they realize that  whether or not they agree with his ideas  he is without a question an authentic voice who speaks without fearAnd nobody should underestimate himI remember when Bernie was mayor of Burlington it is the largest city in Vermont which isnt saying much I met him then and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before He spoke with a throaty Brooklyn accent and he was Jewish  not your typical VermonterHe served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of Lake Champlain with remarkable energy for many years listening closely to what people had to say learning about politics at the local level making a real difference in the daily lives of hardworking peopleHe was never a Democrat  and isnt yet Hes a progressive holding his seat in the US Senate as an independent although he votes with the Democrats on major issuesWhen Bernie decided to run for Jim Jeffords seat in the House of Representatives in 1988 many considered him a long shot I remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse where Bernie held the floor for almost two hours answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce funny entertaining passionate voice Bernie won that seat again and againMake no mistake about this Vermont isnt just a rainbowcolored state full of exhippies and leftists in berets Its an agricultural economy and Bernie has understood this well He has thoughtfully supported Vermonts dairyfarming community over many years He has also been a strong supporter of Vermonts hunting culture  much to the annoyance of many on the left who wonder why the NRA doesnt attack himI was never prouder of Bernie than during the runup to the invasion of Iraq He was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the House strongly opposing the 2003 invasion He saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in American history one with endless repercussionsHe was especially outraged by the outing of former CIA spy Valerie Plame in 2006 by an official from the Pentagon and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the Iraq War in the first placeThis was typical of Bernie The clear voice in the midst of the crowd the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudlySo what would it look like if by some bizarre chance Bernie caught fire and became PresidentHe would certainly work hard for universal health care which has been a passion of his Ive heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system  the singlepayer system  that has worked well throughout Europe for decades reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as wellHe would not be Wall Streets best friend Indeed he didnt support President George W Bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers and wrote an open letter to Henry Paulson the US Secretary of the Treasury protesting that bailout Famously on December 10 2010 he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the US Senate opposing the reinstatement of Bushera tax cuts a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand Bernies viewsHe is a socialist of course How many American politicians have ever said this aloud And what does he really mean by that termBernie knows what hes doing By proclaiming himself a socialist he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks many with international bases have controlled American public policy for a very long time usually to the detriment of working peopleAnd its working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme rightwing factions funded by millionaires and billionaires one of Bernies favorite mantras have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recallAnd this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads serve meals deliver the mail drive trucks and teach in schoolsBut does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the Democratic nomination And if he won it could he defeat a Republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposalHes not crazy In fact hes probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes But he cant win and he knows that What he will do however is move Hillary Clinton on matters of importance to progressives The restraining of Wall Street and large corporations the scandal of how America allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class Americans who seems pathetically easy to persuade  again and again  to vote against their own economic interestsA steep climb looms before him But I applaud Bernie Sanders I hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard
