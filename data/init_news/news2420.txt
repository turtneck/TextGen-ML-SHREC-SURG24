The Muslim couple who stormed an office holiday party Wednesday in Southern California mowing down 14 people before dying hours later in a shootout with police possessed a massive arsenal of ammo bombs and highpowered weapons  and investigators were hoping that computer drives and cell phones seized from their home could tell them whether they were radicalized terrorists with more targets in their sightsLocal and federal authorities  as well as President Obama  continued Thursday to resist calling the carnage at a San Bernardino social services facility terrorism even as evidence mounted that the pair who wore tactical gear and moved with grim precision may have been jihadists armed to the teeth and hellbent on slaughtering innocent Americans More than 5000 rounds of ammunition were later found in their home which sources described as an IED factory packed with explosives and bombmaking equipmentAt this stage we do not yet know why this terrible event occurred Obama said in an address from the White House Well get to the bottom of this and be vigilant getting the facts before we issue decisive judgments on how this occurredSyed Rizwan Farook a USborn citizen of Pakistani descent who had traveled to Saudi Arabia for nine days in the summer of 2014 and had recently begun wearing a full beard and Tashfeen Malik 29 burst into the facility Wednesday morning and sprayed up to 75 rounds at Farooks own terrified colleagues in a conference room where his employer the county health department was hosting a holiday party Farook had angrily bolted only minutes earlier The pair escaped in a black SUV after the attack which authorities said was over within as few as 10 minutes only to resurface three hours later and less than 2 miles away in a fierce gun battle on the citys main dragThey came prepared to do what they did as if they were on a mission said San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan who refuted an earlier report by Fox News that the suspects wore GoPro cameras during their initial rampageFarook 28 who authorities said was born in Illinois and raised in California and had worked as a 51000peryear restaurant inspector at the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health for five years was described by coworkers as a devout Muslim who lived with his wife child and grandmother in a home in nearby Redlands which sources described as an IED factory Bomb squads working with robots swept the home late into the night Wednesday and witnesses reported hearing several explosions Malik who had a 6monthold baby with Farook came to the US on a K1 fiance of citizen visa and had a Pakistani passport according to authorities It was not clear how long the couple had been togetherBurguan said Thursday he was not aware of any notes that might shed light on a possible motive A source briefed on the investigation told Fox News Farook had been in contact with individuals who had been the subject of previous terrorism FBI investigations but those investigations had been closedMeanwhile jihadists and extremists took to social media to expressjoy over the American casualties according to the Middle East Media Research Institute MEMRIOne user Muhammad Abu Ubaida tweeted Allah Akbar and thanks for Allah the killing of at least 30 people in a shooting incident in San Bernardino in California under the hashtag America BurningMuslimah a prominent proISIS account shared a photo believed to be of Syed Farook and wrote May Allah accept our brother  sister who were martyred after carrying out an operation against Crusaders in USA MEMRI saidAt an afternon news conference Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the FBI had taken the reins of the investigation and a bureau spokesman said a focus of the probe is digital evidence collected from their homes including hard drives thumb drives and cell phones While those could be part of a terror investigation and FBI spokesman said it was too soon to ascribe religion as a motiveIt is a possibility but we dont know that said Assistant Regional FBI Director David Bowdich Its possible it goes down that road Its possible it does notA law enforcement source told Fox News that the couple were each carrying an AR15 rifle and a pistol when they were shot and killed by police after a brief chase in their rented black Ford Expedition with Utah plates about 2 miles from the initial shooting site The source said the vehicle also contained socalled rollout bags with multiple pipe bombs as well as additional ammunitionThats a military tactic for a sustained fight the source told Fox News of the rollout bagsThe guns found on the suspects two rifles and two handguns were purchased legally according to Meredith Davis a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Burguan said Thursday Farook had purchased the handguns but he did not say who had bought the riflesIt was unclear where the suspects may have been during the hours following the lightningquick attack but they did not get far A police spokeswoman said police came across the SUV while doing followup work and several reports said the car was at a nearby home police were staking out when the suspects got in and tried to flee It was not immediately clear if that home was the one searched later in RedlandsAbout three hours after the shooting with police looking for a dark SUV officers staking out the Redlands home after being tipped off by a colleague disturbed by Farooks exit from the party saw a vehicle matching that description Word that police were hot on their trail came even as emergency responders were treating the wounded on the scene and sparked a flurry of law enforcement racing to the scene just blocks away The gunfight caught on cellphone video by a bystander was a furious exchange in which 23 officers fired a total of 380 rounds at the suspects according to Burguan Two officers suffered nonlife threatening injuriesIn addition to the explosives found in the SUV authorities discovered and detonated three pipe bombs late Wednesday at the Inland Regional Center the complex where the initial shooting took place about 60 miles east of Los Angeles Another source said investigators discovered a dozen pipe bombs in the house as well as small explosives strapped to remotecontrolled cars  a signature of terrorist groups including Al Qaeda according to counterterrorism experts Police also found thousands of 223caliber and 9mm rounds at the homeClearly they were equipped and could have done an other attack Barguan said Luckily we stopped them before that  The initial shooting happened shortly before 11 am local time at the staterun center which includes three buildings where developmentally disabled people of all ages are treated The conference area had been rented out by Farooks colleagues for a holiday banquet according to authorities Burguan said that Farook had angrily left the party before returning with Malik however other investigators doubted the shooting could be chalked up to a workplace dispute due to the apparent planning behind the attack as well as the heavy weaponry used On Thursday officials raised to 21 the number of people injured in the attackPatrick Baccari a coworker of Farook who suffered minor wounds from shrapnel slicing through the buildings bathroom walls told The Associated Press he had been sitting at the same table as Farook at the banquet before his colleague suddenly disappeared leaving his coat on his chairBaccari also said that Farook had traveled to Saudi Arabia for about a month this past spring When Farook came back word spread that he had gotten married and the woman he described as a pharmacist joined him shortly afterward Baccari added that the reserved Farook showed no signs of unusual behavior although he grew out his beard several months ago A fiveyearold profile for Farook on a dating site said he was religious and enjoyed hanging out in the back yard doing target practice with younger sister and friendsCenter employees who undergo monthly training drills to prepare for active shooter situations initially thought the incident was a drill according to the Los Angeles Times But when real bullets flew several hid in closets barricaded themselves in rooms or fled for their livesThe Inland Regional Center is one of 21 facilities serving people with
