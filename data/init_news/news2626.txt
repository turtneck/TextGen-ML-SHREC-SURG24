On Friday afternoon just a few short hours before the Department Homeland Security was set to shut down the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives scheduled a vote to grant DHS three more weeks of funding The idea was to buy John Boehner some time to do something The legislative impasse that led us to the precipice of the shutdown was created by Boehner who passed a bill tying DHS appropriations to the rollback of President Obamas immigration executive actions He spent several weeks insisting that the House had done its job and would not pass any new legislation funding DHS But Senate Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a clean DHS funding bill which forced Boehner to once again act Rather than bow to political reality and take the only route available to him to actually fund the agency Boehner opted to prolong the agony and puntAnd he couldnt even do that The threeweek continuing resolution failed when over 50 conservative Republicans voted against it rebuking Boehner and the leadership and sending the entire process into utter chaos with less than half a day remaining until the shutdownAs has happened so many times over the last four years the rest of the Congressional leadership was impelled to overcome Boehners incompetence and cobble together a lastminute solution Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid pushed a oneweek CR through the Senate late Friday night and Nancy Pelosi instructed House Democrats to support its passage with the promise from Boehner that the House would pass a clean longterm DHS funding bill this week The oneweek bill passed with the overwhelming support of Democrats and Obama signed itSo for all intents and purposes the House minority leader was calling the shots last Friday determining which legislation would pass and mapping out future votes Boehner was along for the ride keeping a low profile with the rest of the Republican leadership while the Democrats held press briefings sketching out the way forward Itd be embarrassing enough of this had never happened before but its getting difficult to keep track of how many times Pelosi has had to bail out Boehner That it is still happening despite the fact that Boehner is now sitting on one of the largest Congressional majorities in decades is about as damning an indictment of his speakership as one could ask forAnd that spells real trouble going forward The story of the first two months of the allRepublican Congress has been complete dysfunction and the inability to perform the rudimentary tasks of government The Republicans are fighting amongst themselves and venting obvious frustration with Boehners shambolic approach to governing On Friday night McConnell passed the oneweek CR and then immediately adjourned the Senate for the weekend  putting all the pressure to act on Boehner and sending a clear message that hes done with this fight Earlier in the day Sen Mark Kirk RIL pleaded with House Republicans to stop the madness Hopefully were gonna end the attaching of bullshit to essential items of the government he saidBut the DHS finding fight is just the first test of basic governance confronting the Republican Congress Sometime later this year the US is going to bump up against the debt limit and theres an excellent chance that the debt limit renewal will coincide with the next appropriations fight the Cromnibus passed last December only funded government operations through this September The difficulty the Republicans have had working in concert to fund a single department doesnt bode well for a combination debt limitgovernment funding showdown with the attendant threats of default and shutdown But before we even get to that point theres a chance the Republican Congress will have to deal with the potentially catastrophic fallout from the King v Burwell decision If the Supreme Court strikes down the Affordable Care Acts subsidies in 37 states Republicans will be under intense pressure to do something to mitigate the damage Can anyone credibly argue that Congress is up to the task when the Speaker of the House has little to no control over onefifth of his caucus And of course the DHS funding fight still has to be resolved Congress bought themselves an extra week and Democrats agreed to the extension with the thinking that cold political logic and a sense of selfpreservation will finally push Boehner to give in and fund the agency without strings But Boehners capacity for illogical and irrational behavior is why theyre in this situation to begin with Boehner will eventually cave but theres no guarantee when that will happen And really this fight never should have happened in the first place From the moment of its inception the Republican strategy was bound to fail But the leaders in both houses of Congress plowed ahead because they had no idea what else to do and now theyre being dragged along as the Democrats push through lastminute legislative patches to keep the lights on at DHS There are a lot of words to describe that process but governance is not one of them
