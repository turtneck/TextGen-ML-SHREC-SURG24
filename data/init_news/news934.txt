by Yves Smith I just received an email from AirBnB which patently violates the CANSPAM Act by virtue of not having an unsubscribe option Its even cheekier for AirBnB to be contacting me since I am deeply opposed to AirBnB and have never once visited their site and never have or would use their service either as a lodger or a host That means they are very likely to have violated the CANSPAM Act in a second manner by virtue of having harvested my email address  A big problem with CANSPAM is the only parties with a right of action are Internet Access Services and not natural persons as in end recipients Here are the relevant provisions of the CANSPAM Act per Wikipedia  The 3 basic types of compliance defined in the CANSPAM Act unsubscribe content and sending behavior compliance are as follows Unsubscribe compliance A visible and operable unsubscribe mechanism is present in all emails Consumer optout requests are honored within 10 business days Optout lists also known as Suppression lists are only used for compliance purposes Content compliance Accurate From lines including friendly froms Relevant subject lines relative to offer in body content and not deceptive A legitimate physical address of the publisher andor advertiser is present PO Box addresses are acceptable in compliance with 16 CFR 3162p and if the email is sent by a third party the legitimate physical address of the entity whose products or services are promoted through the email should be visible A label is present if the content is adult Sending behavior compliance A message cannot be sent through an open relay A message cannot be sent without an unsubscribe option A message cannot be sent to a harvested email address A message cannot contain a false header A message should contain at least one sentence A message cannot be null Unsubscribe option should be below the message Heres the offending message with the subject line Discrimination and Belonging What it Means for You in its entirety The Airbnb Community Commitment Hi Earlier this year we launched a comprehensive effort to fight bias and discrimination in the Airbnb community As a result of this effort were asking everyone to agree to a Community Commitment beginning November 1 2016 Agreeing to this commitment will affect your use of Airbnb so we wanted to give you a heads up about it What is the Community Commitment You commit to treat everyoneregardless of race religion national origin ethnicity disability sex gender identity sexual orientation or agewith respect and without judgment or bias How do I accept the commitment On or after November 1 well show you the commitment when you log in to or open the Airbnb website mobile or tablet app and well automatically ask you to accept What if I decline the commitment If you decline the commitment you wont be able to host or book using Airbnb and you have the option to cancel your account Once your account is canceled future booked trips will be canceled You will still be able to browse Airbnb but you wont be able to book any reservations or host any guests What if I have feedback about the commitment We welcome your feedback about the Community Commitment and all of our nondiscrimination efforts Feel free to read more about the commitment  You can also reach out to us at  The Airbnb Team Sent with  from Airbnb Airbnb Inc 888 Brannan St San Francisco CA 94103 Airbnb Ireland The Watermarque Building South Lotts Rd Ringsend Dublin 4 VAT Number 9827384L 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Guest Post on
