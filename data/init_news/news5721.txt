Having just spent an hour on Sunday evening watching Donald Trump in a town hall setting with Foxs Greta Van Susteren moderating from Madison Wisconsin I am left with one impression I dont want to buy a car from this guyI have no idea what the final outcome of this nomination battle will be  or whether Trump can be elected president of the United States  but I do know this he can dance and hes one hell of a salesmanAfter having experienced  for him probably the worst week of this election cycle I was curious if he would clean up or restate some of his controversial statements on abortion  4 different answers in a week his dismissal of NATO and the United Nations his comments suggesting Japan and South Korea might need to arm themselves with nuclear weapons and  along with Saudi Arabia  pay the US a lot more money for our services because they are all rich and we are 20 trillion dollars in debt Yes its true the United States is not the policeman of the world or nor should we be Trump also didnt add any details for his plan to pay off the debt in 8 years by not raising taxes He didnt restate or make any of it clearerIt was an hour of performance  not substance  and certainly not anything different from what weve heard him say in various debates or in the hundreds of hours he has performed on televisionHes gonna repeal ObamaCare and put in a system of many options not defined or explained  that will be better less expensive and everybody will be covered and everyone will be happy with their coverage And no ones going to die in the streetsTaxes are going to be lower for everyone but the rich hedge fund guys who arent paying their fair share OK I agree with him on that oneHes going to renegotiate all the bad trade deals starting with the most recent Iran deal Again I agree with that one And hes also going to bring all the jobs home from China and Mexico and any other countries that have stolen our them Of course Im not quite sure how this is going to work because there were no details provided in his answersHes going to knock out ISIS stop airline mergers fix the college education program because costs are too high and kids are being ripped offHes gonna stop the drug epidemic in New Hampshire because they are good people and gave him his first real victory He did give details on this oneHe going to make one call into Mexico to someone I assume to Enrique Pea Nieto who is the 57th president of Mexico Hes also the guy to talk to about paying for the 10 billion fence and tell him to cut off the drugs or elseIf you missed the hour on Sunday night dont worry you because you will see a similar version of the Donald Trump show again and the sound bites will be the sameTrump has said that one of his heroes is the great heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali who at the end of his career invented theRope a Dope to keep from getting hit and to wear out his opponents by evading their punchesDonald Trump has perfected his own version of Rope a Dope  keep talking and avoid specificsNow about that used car Dont worry it will be the greatest and it will be the cheapest and best looking and I will be very happyUnfortunately for Trump on Sunday night while he was Rope a Doping in Madison the Cruz team was kicking his tail in North Dakota and picked up at least 18 of the 25 delegates who are either supporting Cruz or are against TrumpThe long fight for the Republican nomination is a long way from finished and Donald Trump is still marching onCruz is running a great grass root campaign and Trump is running a great marketing effort He is the product and he is the number one salesmanEdward J Rollins is a Fox News contributor He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign He is a senior presidential fellow at Hofstra University and a member of the Political Consultants Hall of Fame He is a strategist for Great America PAC an independant group that is supporting Donald Trump for president
