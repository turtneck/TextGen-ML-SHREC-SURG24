There has been a lot of weight placed in Libertarian expectations and hopes for the results for Gary Johnson next Tuesday in terms of getting 5 percent nationally which will make the Partys next presidential candidate eligible for a category of federal election fundsWhile saying things both concise and accurate about ballot access laws in America which vary state by state in this here federal union is difficult you have often heard including from Gary Johnson himself that getting that 5 percent will help the Party with ballot access as wellTechnically the national result whatever it is in and of itself has no effect at all on ballot access anywhere but Georgia There a 20 percent result nationally wins petitionfree accessEvery other states ballot access laws if vote percents affect them at all are dictated only by the percentages gained in that stateThat said under most imaginable circumstances a national 5 percent will mean that the Party also did historically well in lots of individual states alsoWhat follows derived from this statebystate chart from the invaluable Ballot Access News edited by Richard Winger is a list of what the Libertarian Party will get in terms of automatic petitionfree ballot access if certain vote percentages in that state are hit A huge proportion of the Libertarian Partys time and effort goes to petitioning for access so these accomplishments are a big deal for small partiesIts important to note that any such earned automatic ballot access is not eternal and in many cases applies only to the next election 2018 not even to the next presidential election Below I specify which states get that access for just 2018 or for both 2018 and 2020Again all these vote percentages are in the states in question not national In almost all cases it is not just the presidential ticket hitting this percentage that wins the prize but any office the entire state is voting for Thus the Party can rewin the access in 2018 for 2020 with any office voted on statewide even though there is not a presidential race in 2018Now the percentages and what they get the Party and where 05 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Michigan and New Mexico 1 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Kansas Maryland Nevada and WisconsinIt would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in OregonIt would earn such access only for the president slot in 2020 in Connecticut 2 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in IowaIt would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Kentucky Missouri Montana North Carolina and Utah 25 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Oklahoma and Washington DC Correction DCs standard technically is a hard 7500 votes which tends to be around that percentage 3 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in Arkansas Idaho and MassachusettsIt would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Ohio Correction Since Johnson is on the Ohio ballot technically as an independent this year not with the LP banner it will be meaningless for Ohio access alasIt would earn such access only for the president slot in 2020 in Alaska 5 percent gets the Libertarian Party full ballot access without need to spend time and money on petitioning for 2018 in North Dakota Tennessee and TexasIt would earn such access in both 2018 and 2020 in Arizona Louisiana Minnesota correction Minnesota was mistakenly left off in original post Nebraska Rhode Island and Washington stateSome states have even higher hurdles to jump for that states vote totals for president or other offices voted on statewide to earn automatic ballot access or other special cases Election law is hardAnd a group of states give third parties no special ballot access benefits no matter how well the presidential candidate does Those states are California Delaware Florida Indiana Mississippi New Hampshire New Jersey New York South Carolina South Dakota Vermont West Virginia and WyomingFive percent nationally would be an amazing thing for the Johnson campaign and the Libertarian Party But what really matters for ballot access moving forward is what happens state by state
