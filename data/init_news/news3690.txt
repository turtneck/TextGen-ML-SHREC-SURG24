at 439 pm Leave a comment The more you look into Evan Bayhs postSenate career the dirtier it becomes hes running for Senate again this year Earlier this week I published a lengthy article examining Bayhs shameless cash grab since he left Congress in the article Democratic Senate Candidate Evan Bayh Represents Everything Broken Corrupt and Wrong With America  I wrote Many of you will know the name Evan Bayh Hes the son of threeterm Indiana Senator Birch Bayh and went on to become Governor of Indiana from 19831997 and then Senator himself from 19992011 Upon leaving public service he did what most of these government prostitutes do  made millions and millions of dollars doing pretty much nothing As a recent article from Politico reveals the Bayh family had assets worth 2177 million when he left the Senate in 2010 but it has since surged to a range of 138 million48 million Making that kind of money isnt easy for anyone and its particularly suspicious in the hands of a man supposedly dedicated to public service So how did the couple make all this money Evan for one joined law and lobbying firm McGuireWoods and became an advisor to private equity giant Apollo Global as upon leaving the Senate Meanwhile I cant figure out for the life of me what his wife Susan does She seems to be a professional board member for a variety of large companies Just one day after I published the above The Huffington Post came out with a piece that adds additional pieces to the very slimy postSenate history of Evan Bayh Heres some of what we learn Evan Bayh the former Democratic senator from Indiana and current Senate candidate has at least 1 million in holdings with a Bermudabased insurance company Athene that has a business model that a class action lawsuit is challenging as a baitandswitch scam Athenes business plan the suit claims is to buy up the annuities of retirees that had previously been invested in bonds and blue chip stocks and instead pump their money into the risky bets of a private equity firm That firm turns out to be Apollo Global Management  where Bayh is a highly paid senior adviser  which actually owns Athene so if the gamble pays off Athenes parent company gets rich If it flops the retirees take the hit Private equitys push into the onceboring annuity industry was the subject of a 2013 Bloomberg story which found Apollo leading the way Its a headsIwin tailsyoulose game said Lawrence Rybka CEO of wealthadvisory firm ValMark Securities Bayh has been working for Apollo as a senior adviser for public policy since early 2011 shortly after he retired from the Senate On the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month in order to run for Senate in 2016 he states that he has received between 57 million and 209 million worth of assets in the firm He lists his holdings in Athene as valued at between 1 million and 5 million In 2010 when Bayh was still a senator he went to battle on behalf of Apollo and other money managers who were working desperately to thwart attempts to close or narrow whats known as the carried interest loophole which allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pay bargainbasement tax rates With Bayhs help the effort to close the loophole was derailed An analysis of Apollos security filings suggests that the maintenance of the loophole has saved executives tens of millions of dollars on their tax bills since then Bayhs rapacious grab for cash since his retirement has been extraordinary even by Clintonian standards but it is made all the more poignant by the poetic bromides he offered on his way out I want to be engaged in an honorable line of work Bayh told Ezra Klein in October 2010 He said he wanted to find work where he could come home and tell his wife Dear do you know what we got done today Ive got this really bright kid in my class and do you know what he asked me and heres what I told him and I think I saw a little epiphany moment go off in his mind We have since learned  thanks to the Associated Press which obtained his Senate schedule  that by the time he was having this heady conversation he had already been meeting with executives at Apollo as well as the brass at the oil company Marathon and the law firm and lobby shop McGuire Woods He went on to take jobs with all three joining Apollo sitting on Marathons board of directors and working as a strategic adviser at McGuire Woods Earlier this month Bayh warned his supporters in a fundraising appeal that the Koch brothers Charles and David were hellbent on making sure Young won the Indiana race While the claim is true Bayh makes an awkward messenger The Koch brothers are clients of McGuireWoods where Bayh is still a partner Evan Bayh was paid by Koch Industries at his lobbying firm as recently as 2016  and he will work for them after Election Day whether he wins or loses said a source who lobbies for Koch Industries asking for anonymity in order to speak openly about somebody else on their payroll He calls Koch names but hes grateful for the retainer they paid him and Koch knows it Bayh announcing his retirement delivered a sermon in The New York Times that was filled with regret for the decay of the Senate complete with hopeful recommendations for reform But what Bayh actually did while in office has only further degraded the chamber He used his final year to cast industryfriendly votes while interviewing for jobs with those same industries Then he left office and became in a very short amount of time a wildly rich man worth somewhere between 139 million and 48 million Citizens United has nothing to say about that A few months after helping kill the bill Bayh was literally sleeping at the Manhattan home of an Apollo executive according to a Senate schedule the AP obtained It was one of several meetings with the firm hed joined shortly after leaving the Senate His spokesman told the AP he was staying with a friend If Bayh were truly looking for an honorable line of work working for a company that bought up the retirement accounts of the elderly shifted them to risky investments and hit them with big fees is a strange way to go about it Heres my related post from earlier this week in case you missed it Democratic Senate Candidate Evan Bayh Represents Everything Broken Corrupt and Wrong With America  In
