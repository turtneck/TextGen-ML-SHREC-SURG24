Top Republicans joined with President Obama and other Democrats Tuesday in sharply condemning Donald Trumps reaction to the nightclub massacre in Orlando decrying his antiMuslim rhetoric and his questioning of Obamas allegiances as divisive and out of step with Americas valuesTrump  who just a week ago signaled an intent to snap his campaign into a more measured tone for the general election  showed no sign of backing down from his suggestions that Obama was somehow connected to or sympathetic with terrorists telling the Associated Press that the president continues to prioritize our enemy over AmericansIn separate appearances both Obama and his potential successor likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton blasted Trumps proposal to ban foreign Muslims from the United States as dangerous and contrary to the nations traditionsA visibly angry Obama also dismissed Trumps repeated demands for him to use the term radical Islam when speaking about the Orlando shootings and other attacks Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away Obama said This is a political distractionClinton described Trumps response to Orlando as rife with conspiracy theories and pathological selfcongratulationsThe remarkable bipartisan outcry over Trumps positions  coming at a moment of national mourning after the deadliest mass shooting in US history  set off a new wave of alarm within the GOP over whether the real estate moguls promised pivot to the general election would ever materialize The rift also highlighted the enduring tensions between establishment figures who want to be more inclusive and the bulk of the party which backs Trumps proposed Muslim ban and has rallied around him as the presumptive nomineeOrlando gunmans wife under scrutiny in struggle to piece together motivesSome of Trumps most ardent backers defended his response to the Orlando attack saying drastic measures were needed to keep the nation safe But most Republicans on Capitol Hill tried to distance themselves from Trumps comments following the terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando that killed at least 49 people Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ky refused to respond to questions about Trump at his weekly news conferenceHouse Speaker Paul D Ryan Wis denounced Trump for trying to rally support for his antiMuslim policies while others castigated Trump for the accusations he has lobbed at ObamaI do not think a Muslim ban is in our countrys interest Ryan told reporters I do not think it is reflective of our principles not just as a party but as a country He called for a security test not a religious test for immigrantsIn a speech Monday Trump had reiterated his calls for such a ban and expanded its potential reach to include any country with a history of terrorism against the United States and its allies He blamed the Orlando attack  which authorities say was carried out by a man born in America to Afghan parents  in part on a system that allowed his family to come hereAt a rally Tuesday night in Greensboro NC Trump attacked Obama for criticizing him and defended barring foreign MuslimsOnce again weve seen that political correctness is deadly

Corker RTenn who has praised Trump at times for his willingness to shake up politics and recently met with the mogul expressed serious unease Tuesday with how Trump responded to a national tragedyTraditionally it is a time when people rally around our country and its obviously not whats occurred and its very disappointing Corker saidSen Lindsey O Graham RSC a leading national security hawk said he had run out of adjectives for Trump I dont think he has the judgment or the temperament the experience to deal with what we are facing said Graham who does not currently support the mogulGraham like other Republicans took issue with Trumps apparent suggestions in Monday interviews that Obama may identify with the radical Muslim terrorists Obama either is not tough not smart or hes got something else in mind Trump told Fox NewsTrump expanded on that Tuesday saying in an emailed response to questions from the Associated Press President Obama claims to know our enemy and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies and for that matter the American peopleGraham said that Trump seems to be suggesting that the president is one of them I find that highly offensive I find that whole line of reasoning way off base My problems with President Obama are his policy choicesSen Ron Johnson RWis who faces a challenging reelection bid also called Trumps insinuations about Obama offensiveSpeaking after meeting with his National Security Council Obama dismissed Trumps many calls for him to change the way he talks about terrorismThats the key they tell us We cant get ISIL unless we call them radical Islamists  Obama said referring to the Islamic State militant group What exactly would using this label accomplish What exactly would it change Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans Would it bring in more allies Is there a military strategy that is served by this The answer is none of the aboveAt a campaign event in Pittsburgh Clinton excoriated Trump and challenged Republicans to repudiate him Clinton said Trump failed to demonstrate an ability to deliver a calm collected and dignified response to the Orlando attackInstead

politics this is way beyond anything that should be said by someone running for presidentTrump has also said Obama should resign because of his refusal to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism But one of the moguls top backers on Capitol Hill said Trump doesnt expect that to happenWhat I think Trumps saying is You need to get in the game and start leading or get out of here said Sen Jeff Sessions RAla Thats just his way of expressing it And I think people understood that He doesnt expect President Obama to resign but hes saying you cant do this job effectively if you dont understand

major and leading House GOP voice on national security issues broke sharply with TrumpI guess I appreciate Mr Trumps fieriness in talking about it but you dont do it by alienating the very people that

subdued speech that celebrated his primary wins and looked ahead to a matchup with Clinton His campaign told allies that Trump was strategizing for a new phase of the campaignBut by this week  after a
