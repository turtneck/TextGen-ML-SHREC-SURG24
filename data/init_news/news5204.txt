The State Department accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of taking congressional testimony by Secretary of State John Kerry out of context in Netanyahus address to a joint meeting of Congress TuesdayIn a statement released early Wednesday State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki quoted in full an article written on the website FactCheckorg that claimed certain remarks made by Netanyahu about Irans nuclear program misrepresented what Kerry had said in testimony before theHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Feb 25In his address Netanyahu said Kerry had disclosed that Iran could legitimately possess 190000 centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium by the time a deal designed to restrict Irans nuclear capability for a decade would expire The Israeli leader who referred to Kerry as my longtime friend in his speech said that amount of centrifuges could put Iran weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacyHowever the FactCheckorg article circulated by Psaki noted that Kerry had only said that a peaceful nuclear power program could use that same number of centrifugesIf you have a civilian power plant thats producing power legitimately and not a threat to proliferation you could have as many as 190000 or more centrifuges Kerry told committee membersLater in his speech Netanyahu described the proposed agreement as one that doesnt block Irans path to the bomb it paves Irans path to the bombSo why would anyone make this deal the prime minister asked Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse Well I disagreeThe State Department statement was the latest salvo in an ongoing war of words that marked the runup to Netanyahus address and climaxed with harsh criticism for the Israeli leader from congressional Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who branded the speech an insult to the intelligence of the United StatesPresident Obama himself told reporters Tuesday afternoon that he didnt watch Netanyahus address but read the transcript and it contained nothing new Obama claimed the prime minister did not offer any viable alternatives to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weaponAs Netanyahu spoke Tuesday Kerry was holding a threehour negotiating session with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in the Swiss resort of Montreux in hopes of completing an international framework agreement to curb Tehrans nuclear program However in that same Feb 25 hearing Kerry said Netanyahu may have a judgment that just may not be correct here in initially opposing an interim agreement reached this past NovemberNegotiators from the socalled P51 countries a group which includes the US Britain Russia China Germany and France are scrambling to meet a March 31 deadline to finalize the framework of a permanent deal with a July deadline for a final agreementDuring his speech Netanyahu urged negotiators to keep pressuring with economic sanctions because Tehran needs the deal mostNow if Iran threatens to walk away from the table  and this often happens in a Persian bazaar  call their bluff Netanyahu said Theyll be back because they need the deal a lot more than you doIn a sign that Netanyahus speech was resonating outside the chamber of the House of Representatives Zarif decried comments that President Barack Obama made on Monday  as part of an administrationwide effort to push back on the Israelis criticism  in which he said that Iran would have to suspend its nuclear activities for at least a decade as part of any final agreementZarif in a statement quoted by Irans official news agency IRNA said Obamas remarks were unacceptable and threatening aimed at attracting US public opinion while reacting to Netanyahu and other extremist opponents of the talksFor his part Kerry told reporters Tuesday that both sides were working away productivelyThe Associated Press contributed to this report
