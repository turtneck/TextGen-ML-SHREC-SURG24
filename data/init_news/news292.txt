Remember last fall when pundits and politicians were trying to talk themselves into Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House because he would lay down the law with the hardright wing of the Republican caucus When he was the man who could bring some muchneeded order to the ranks Who could maybe end this habit of careening from crisis to crisis that Congress has fallen into because the two parties are unable to agree on anything down to whether toilet paper should be rolled over or under in Capitol Hill bathrooms let alone a budget to fund the basic functions of governmentAs the kids like to say LOLThe release of President Obamas eighth and final budget on Tuesday has forced into the open the seething tensions that never really went away after a spending agreement was reached last year in part to ease Mr Ryans transition into the speakers suite That deal set spending until the end of October of this year at levels that the president adhered to and Senate Republicans hope to make stick But a core group of House Republicans who gave Mr Ryan a pass back then now say they want to toss those numbers out like so much flotsam and pass their own budget with far tighter spending restrictionsThat core group of House Republicans is the House Freedom Caucus the band of 40or so feral meerkats who did much of the heavy lifting in driving John Boehner into retirement But they arent the only Republicans who look like infants here Rep Tom Price RGA and Sen Mike Enzi RWY the chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees last week announced they will not even let the director of the Office of Management and Budget present the proposed budget to the Congress This practice is a common courtesy extended to presidential administrations for the last 40years or soNo one would expect any Congress to rubberstamp a presidents budget proposal of course Not even if the same party controlled both chambers and the White House But whats notable here is this quote from one member of the Freedom CaucusRight except youre not passing a Republican budget any more than President Obama expects you to pass a Democratic budget The presidents proposal is the opening to a negotiation to be hashed out between two parties Is anyone available who can explain the job of legislating to these legislatorsBut like so many other legislative norms that the Republicans in Congress have tossed out the window during the Obama era the practice of two coequal branches of government openly and fairly debating genuine issues that will affect the American people has been given the heaveho Yet Id bet cash money some of these legislators like Mulvaney and Price are also just astonished that bullying idiot Donald Trump is stomping their partys candidates for the Republican nominationPaul Ryan knows how this is supposed to work He was after all the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee for the four years the Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2011 Then when the GOP regained the majority in the chamber he chaired the committee for another four years until 2015 If anyone in the House knows how the budget sausage gets made knows all the little compromises over appropriations levels and priorities that go into funding the government its Ryan But as part of his deal to earn his Republican colleagues votes for Speaker Ryan devolved a fair amount of power for setting legislative agendas back to the committee chairmen This took away one of the tools that past Speakers like Boehner could use as leverage to get bills they favored taken up by individual committees With that gone a weak Speaker is practically a helpless bystander to this sort of spectacle Sure maybe he can still yank the chairmanship away from Price but that will just raise howls of protest from the other chairs who thought they had freedom to run things as they see fit And though Price isnt a member of the Freedom Caucus you can bet that group approves of what hes doing If Ryan punishes him he gets an even louder revolt on his right flank in the middle of an election year But beyond all this insidebaseball stuff is a point that many pundits have hammered on over and over during the primary campaign Which is that this partisan infection of the House is not going away after the 2016 election or even after 2018 and likely not until sometime after the next census in 2020 if it happens at all So even if Democrats still hold the White House next year either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will spend much of his or her time negotiating and fighting these budget fights just to keep the governments lights on let alone pushing through major changes to healthcare or financial industry regulations Plus theres a good chance he or she will be saddled with Paul Ryan as Speaker and hes about as solid as helium By the end of 2017 we may all be longing for the halcyon days when John Boehner ran things
