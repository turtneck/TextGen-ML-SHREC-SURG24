Obama has maintained neutrality in the primary and recently met with Clintons opponent Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders  at the White House Still his comments on the race have seemed to favor his former secretary of state if only slightlyJay Carney told CNNs Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday thats no accident  and the President does want Clinton to winI dont think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what hes achieved said Carney a CNN contributorThe White House declined to comment on Carneys comments Wednesday Carney said Obama wont make an official endorsement until the race is decided but his intentions are clear I think the President has signaled while still remaining neutral that he supports Secretary Clintons candidacy and would prefer to see her as the nominee Carney said He wont officially embrace her unless and until its clear that shes going to be the nominee I think he is maintaining that tradition of not intervening in a party primary Clinton has made a point to draw from her closeness with Obama on the campaign trail attacking Sanders for criticizing the President and seeking a primary challenger to him in 2012
