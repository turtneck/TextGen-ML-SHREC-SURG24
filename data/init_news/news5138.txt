posted by Eddie Scientists studying ancient stone arrangement alongside Aboriginal traditional owners in Australias Victorian bush say the site could predate Stonehenge and even Egypts Great Pyramids But Wurdi Youang as its known by the people of the Wada Warrung nation is apparently not the only mysterious stone circle in Australia  just the most intact Monash University astronomer Dr Duane Hamacher has been studying Indigenous Australian astronomy for years and told ABCs Lateline he believes the Wurdi Youang structure could date back more than 11000 years If thats proven it will be yet another example of the worlds longest surviving cultures innovations predating their better known European equivalents Some academics have referred to this stone arrangement here as Australias version of Stonehenge Dr Hamacher said on the program Wednesday I think the question we might have to ask is is Stonehenge Britains version of Wurdi Youang Because this could be much much older Traditional owners like Bryon Powell and the scientists theyre working with say the stones have possible solar indications marking the movements of the sun over the year including the summer solstice equinox and winter solstice A sacred sundial if you will The eggshaped area is fifty metres wide and contains over 100 basalt boulders After being noted by early European settlers and recorded by archaeologists in 1977 Wurdi Youang was only relatively recently given the attention it deserves as a site once sacred and significant Local custodian Reg Abrahams sees the site as playing a role in contesting the increasinglydated disproved notion that Indigenous Australians were simply nomadic huntergatherers If youre going to have a stone arrangement where you mark off the seasons throughout the year with the solstices and equinoxes it kind of makes sense if youre at least most of the year in one specific location to do that he told the ABC He continued You see a lot of agricultural and aquacultural practices so evidence of this agriculture may go back tens of thousands of years predating what anthropologists commonly think of as the dawn of agriculture which is about 6000 years ago in Mesopotamia Mysterious Mullimbimby site Wurdi Youang is just one of many stone arrangements created by Aboriginal nations that have been recorded across Australia including in Carisbrook Victoria and outside Mullumbimby northern New South Wales The site 40 kilometres outside of Mullumbimby is the stuff of legend But a few amateur archaeologists say its based on much more than hearsay It was said to contain 181 large standing pieces of sandstone  with the nearest sandstone deposit located over 20 kilometres away In 2015 a teacher at the Brunswick Valley Historical Society Richard Patterson unearthed letters from 1939 president of the Australian Archaeological and Education Research Society Frederic Slater  The mound is one of the oldest I should say the oldest forms of temples in the world and dates back to the Palaeolithic age with the advent of first man Slater is alleged to have written Slater documented inscriptions from the sites stones which he said were made up of hand signs letters and sacred signs that amounted to 28000 words in the ancient language In the 1940 the site was reportedly bulldozed by the farmer with a deed to the land following government threats to seize his property making further investigation virtually impossible A documentary on Indigenous astronomy called Star Stories of the Dreaming was released earlier this year featuring the CSIROs Ray Norris and Euahlayi lawman Ghillar Michael Anderson sharing Indigenous belief systems associated with astronomy Source
