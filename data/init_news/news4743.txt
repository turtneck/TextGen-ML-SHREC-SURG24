Orrin Hatch one of the senior Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee is on a oneman mission to save the American judiciary As Hatch sees it this branch of government is under terrible and imminent threat from a malign force that threatens to undermine its legitimacy and corrode the foundations of American democracy What evil power could produce such menacing terror What fantastical horror can possibly align itself against the institutions of American justiceIn a Bloomberg OpEd this week Hatch writes about a harrowing experience he went through at the monthly lunch meeting of a wellrespected legal organization He had been invited there to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy left by the late Antonin Scalia when without warning a group of protesters holding professionally printed signs began chanting do your job at the senator They were protesting the decision by Hatch and other Republican leaders to deny President Obamas nominee to replace Scalia appeals court Judge Merrick Garland a confirmation hearingAs Hatch writes those protesters and their suspiciously wellprinted signs were all the confirmation he needed that obstructing Garlands nomination is the right thing to doNow that a majority of states have held presidential primaries and as this hostile election cycle turns from those contests to general election organized disruptions of any thoughtful discussion about the Supreme Court will only intensify Make no mistake These protesters are not interested in seeing the Senate take seriously its constitutional duty to provide advice about and determine whether to give or withhold consent to a consequential Supreme Court nomination They care little about the Senate operating as a check and balance to the executive branch and instead simply insist that the Republicanled Senate do what progressive activists want and rubberstamp a presidential appointmentAh the beauty of motivated reasoning Hatch and his buddies shut down the nominating process because they claims theyre concerned about politicization and when Hatch is protested for adopting this controversial stance he claims justification by pointing to the political reaction he provoked The liberal left is seeking to bully the Republicanled Senate into ignoring its constitutional responsibilities and further destroying our nations delicate system of checks and balances Hatch concludes I am more resolved than ever to move forward with the confirmation process only after this toxic election season is overThis is a variation of the argument Judiciary Committee chairman Sen Chuck Grassley made a couple of weeks ago when he lashed out at the president and the Democrats for trying to score as many political points as possible by putting forth a nominee and demanding a hearing Both Hatch and Grassley want to obstruct the nominating process and make it seem like the reaction to their obstruction  protests and the routine business of governing  is the real abuse of power Its too clever by half if theyd allow hearings to go forward the politicization theyre complaining about from Democrats and liberals wouldnt be happening Just as significant as the weakness of their arguments is the fact that they keep having to go back to the well to defend their position Blocking a Supreme Court nomination for the length of time Republicans have in mind was never going to be an easy sell politically but they determined that it would be worth a little political trouble to prevent Obama from getting another court pick But theyre already absorbing a ton of damage over this and cracks are forming in the obstructionist wall Vulnerable bluestate Republican senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania are running into angry constituents and are being forced to break with the Republican leadership Toomey said this week that hell agree to a meeting with Garland out of courtesy and respect for both the president and the judge Others like Sen Jerry Moran of Kansas are stating outright that Garland should get his hearing and his vote I would rather have you complaining to me that I voted wrong on nominating somebody than saying Im not doing my job Moran told constituents this week These arguments from Republican senators run directly counter to the leaderships position which is that the courteous and respectful action is to deny Garland any consideration until after the election and that the job of the Republican Senate is to protect the judiciary from the deleterious effects of electionyear confirmation hearings So while Orrin Hatch may twist himself in knots to argue that a bunch of protesters ruining his fancy DC lunch meeting is proof that hes right to block the Garland nomination what it really shows is that the Republicans obstructionist plan is going to be far more painful politically than they hoped
