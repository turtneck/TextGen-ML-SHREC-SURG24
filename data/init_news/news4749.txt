The Iowa caucuses are seven weeks away Donald Trump is still the Republican frontrunner Sen Marco Rubio is for now the establishments best only hope And Sen Ted Cruz is the guy who looks best positioned to winYes you heard that rightCruz RTex as of today has the most direct route to the Republican presidential nomination  assuming that the past history of GOP nomination fights works as a broad predictor of where the 2016 race is headed1 Cruz is positioned as the most conservative candidate in the race Although Trump gets all the attention for his overthetop statements Cruz has staked out a position on the far right on virtually every major hotbutton issue including immigration Obamacare national security and the fight against the Islamic State militant group And tonally Cruz comes across as aggressively and unapologetically conservative  a less controversial and more electable version of real estate magnate TrumpA Washington PostABC News November poll showed that Cruzs numbers are in the stratosphere among voters who identify themselves as very conservative 69percent had a favorable opinion of him while just 21percent regarded him in an unfavorable lightIn a Republican primary  particularly one in which the GOP electorate is mad at everyone including those in their own party for an alleged lack of commitment to conservative principles  being the guy all the way on the ideological right is a very very good thing2 Cruz has raised the secondmost money in the Republican race Bet you didnt know that Yes former Florida governor Jeb Bush is by far and away the fundraising leader in the race Not only did we know that would be the case but we also now know that it has done him roughly zero good Cruzs money on the other hand is  or at least was  unexpectedCruzs 65million raised is all the more impressive because unlike Bush who raised the vast majority of his money with the support of his Right to Rise super PAC Cruz has a relatively even balance between the funds raised for his campaign committee 265million and those collected by a universe of supportive super PACs 38million Having so much money in his campaign account means that Cruz will get more bang for his buck because candidates get the lowest unit rate on TV ad buying while super PACs have to pay full freight for their airtimeCruzs money is also what separates him from other candidates who secured the mantle of most conservative candidate in the primary Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses during past campaigns  more on Cruz and Iowa below  but they were unable to capitalize on that win or sustain their support because they had so little moneyCruz is the bestcase scenario for those who want to see a movement conservative nominated Hes of the conservative movement but has the fundraising ability of an establishment Republican3 Cruz is the Iowa frontrunner Recent history makes clear that you need to win one of the first three states  Iowa New Hampshire or South Carolina  to have a realistic chance of being the partys nominee Remember how well former New York City mayor Rudy Giulianis wait until Florida strategy worked in 2008 Thought soCruz is emerging rapidly as the favorite in Iowas caucuses Three polls released in the past five days put Cruz at the front of the pack in Iowa  including the influential and almost always right Des Moines Register survey which had the senator from Texas 10points clear of TrumpWinning Iowa would give Cruz momentum going into New Hampshire  where he currently sits at third  and into South Carolina a state like Iowa whose Republican primary electorate is quite socially conservative4 The calendar beyond the Big 3 favors Cruz Winning one of the first three states is almost certainly the way a candidate makes it to March But assuming Cruz can win Iowa at least the calendar starts to look very favorable to him beyond February On March 1 whats being referred to as the SEC primary takes place Alabama Arkansas Georgia Tennessee and Texas will vote on that first Tuesday in MarchIts difficult to handicap how those states might play out because of how much the first three states in the past have influenced who stays in the race and what their poll numbers look like Still Cruzs profile as the one true constitutional conservative in the race coupled with his Southern roots and his fundraising should make for an attractive package for voters going to the polls that dayThe next big primary day is two weeks later on March 15 when Florida Illinois Missouri North Carolina and Ohio vote There are less obvious wins in those states for Cruz but he would almost certainly run well in North Carolina and Missouri under any circumstance and might do well in the other three states depending on who else was left in the contestYes Cruz has weaknesses  most notably that he has shown little ability to appeal beyond his conservative base and that he is far less likable than say Rubio if it comes down to a oneonone fight between the two Rubio of Florida is also trying to make an issue of Cruzs immigration stance  insisting that Cruz has less of a hard line on the issue than he lets onBut Trump being Trump and Rubio what early state does he win also have problems And Cruzs strengths are considerable particularly when you consider how these races typically play outCruz has begun his ascent up the early state and national polls at just about the right time The race will go into deep freeze from around next week through the beginning of 2016 His campaign is perfectly positioned to make him the last man standing Believe it
