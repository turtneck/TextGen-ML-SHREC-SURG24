Donald Trump said it Jeb Bush said it tooFrankly a whole range of people have used the term anchor baby this week in public discussions about Trumps immigrationrelated policy ideas  ideas that include an end to the nearly 150yearold practice of granting citizenship to anyone born in the United StatesIts the former known as birthright citizenship which is delineated in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution And as all sorts of public figures have discussed the future of the 14th Amendment this week the more colloquial  many say pejorative  term anchor baby has come up over and over againBut the anchor baby while potent politically is a largely mythical ideaHeres the basic concept People namely women come to the United States illegally and give birth to children generallyfor the specific purpose of bolstering legal attempts of the childs parents remain in the United States or even become citizens themselvesLooser definitions suggest anchor babies can simply be intendedto helpillegalimmigrant parents access taxpayerfinanced public education andor social services through their citizen children  another political hot button to be sure Even herethe law limits those benefits to the children themselvesButusuallythe debate has been about the residencyof the parents who after all are supposed to be using the child as their anchorThis is the definition that has little legal underpinningFor illegal immigrant parents being the parent of a US citizen child almost never forms the core of a successful defense in an immigration court In short if the undocumented parent of a USborn child is caught in the United States he or she legally faces the very same risk of deportation as any other immigrantThe only thing that a socalled anchor baby can do to assist either of their undocumented parents involves such a long game that its not a practical immigration strategy saidGreg Chen an immigration law expert and director of The American Immigration Lawyers Association a trade group that also advocates for immigrantfriendly reforms That long game is this If and when a US citizen reaches the age of 21 he or shecan then apply for a parent to obtain a visa and green card and eventually enter the United States legallyIn order to apply for such an option the parent of a socalled anchor baby would need to do all of the followingIf a person has lived in the United States unlawfully for a period of more than 180 days but less than one year there is an automatic threeyear bar on that person ever reentering the United States  and thats before any wait time for a visa So thats a minimum of 21 years for the child to mature plus the threeyear waitAnd for the vast majority of these parents a longer wait alsoapplies If a person has lived in the United States illegally for a year or more there is a 10year ban on that person reentering the United States So in that case there would be the 21year wait for the child to mature to adulthood plus the 10year waitAll told the parents of the socalled anchor baby face a 24to31year wait to even enter the United States much less obtain a visa and green card or become a citizenWant proofSee Sections 212a9i and 212 a9ii of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA or spend an afternoon in your nearest severely backlogged immigration courtImmigration Court backlog grows to more than 450000 casesImmigration courts routinely reject claims that an undocumented parent must remain in the United States to care for a US citizen child The main but rarelegal exceptions are for children who are so seriously ill or profoundly disabled that one parent must care for them fulltime or for a child in need of medical care unavailable in their parents home countryThese parents are given something called humanitarian parole Chen explained And this isvery rarely applied to people already living in the United States illegally It is more often given to the parents of say an Afghan war burn victim who want to accompany their child to the United States for medical care And even then humanitarian parole is generally granted for limited period of timeAlternatively these parents can apply for something even more rare an extreme hardship exception according to Deborah Anker a clinical professor of law and director of the Harvard University Law Schools immigration and refugee clinical programVery rarely they can apply for a waiver that may allow them to reenter the United States sooner Anker said But if that request is denied there is no form of appeal available Decisions are finalYes it is true that some undocumented immigrants come to the United States and have children with or perhaps even because of the mistaken belief that this will strengthen a legal bid to remain in the United States Mistaken beliefs have spurred previous surges in illegal immigration  including last yearsAnd it is true that some people  such as breastfeeding mothers children brought to the United States illegally as children and others  have benefited from the immigration system equivalent of proprietorial discretion known as deferred actionBut with the exception of anObama administration program known as DACA limited to an estimated 12 million young adults brought to the United States illegally as children and a second programcurrently blocked by a federal courtthat would have granted deferred action to another 300000 people mostly the parents of those eligible for DACA deferred actions typically come with a short and limited timeline They also do not include a pathway to a visa or legal work in the United States And these programs did not exist when the concept of ananchor baby was politically popularized so it becomes harder to accept the idea thathaving an anchor baby was the express goal ofmany people immigrating illegallyIts also important to note that as of August 2014 only about 550000 DACA applications had been approved according to a Pew research Center analysis of federal data Andeven these applicants must wait until their 21st birthday to begin the lengthy process described above to attempt to help an undocumented parent And attempt is the key word hereAnd if youre still skeptical heres the real proof that having a baby in the United States does little to help an undocumented parent remain in the United States theres thisIn 2011 there were at least 5000 children in state custody or foster care because an undocumented parent or parents has been deported according to a study released by the Applied Research Center a New Yorkbased think tank that focuses on racial and social justice issues Some estimates put that figure even higher today Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent mandatory reports to the Senate that among other things revealed that during 2013 the agency deported 72410 people who told federal authorities they have one or more US citizen childrenEach of these children and their parents certainly know the anchor baby is not real
