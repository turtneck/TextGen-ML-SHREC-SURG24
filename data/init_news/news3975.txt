Email Well if this doesnt inspire you to do your civic duty nothing will When California resident Candice Payne woke up this morning she wasnt totally sure she was up to going through the hassle of voting She figured the lines would be long the wait would be awful and the stress probably wouldnt be worth it But just when this 26yearold woman was feeling too lazy to vote something absolutely amazing happenedher ovaries burst out of her body and dragged her to the polling place Amazing Now THAT is how you rally on Election Day Like so many Americans Candice spent her morning lying in her bed kicking herself for not having voted early but as soon as it seemed like shed go back to sleep her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen curled themselves around the side of her bed and threw her to the floor After dragging her body to her living room her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open What started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby Jefferson Public School where she dutifully filled out her ballot for President of the United States If thats not getting out the vote we dont know what is Its definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls but once Candices ovaries had shot out of her body they werent going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty While it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting no matter how much she tried to resist Candices ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote Sure she would rather have been sleeping or at work but three miles and several forceful tugs later she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet casting her ballot and exercising her fundamental American right Awesome If youre thinking of just staying inside going to work and skipping the polls altogether its not too late to change your mind Candice felt just like you once but after being violently dragged by her ovaries to a polling station shes never felt better
