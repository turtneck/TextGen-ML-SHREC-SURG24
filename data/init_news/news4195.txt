Jeb Bushs nascent presidential campaign has already won over many of the bigdollar donors and GOP elites What he needs to prove now is that he can win over the crowdsUntil visits to South Carolina and other early states this month the former Florida governor hadnt been on the campaign trail for himself in 13 years He hadnt sold himself to the deeply conservative tea partyinspired crowds that have emerged as a driving Republican force in the Obama era Hed never snapped so many selfies with admirersAnd he admits his delivery is a work in progress Im learning along the way how to get better he told reporters in South Carolina this weekAnd what has he learned I think if youre on a long journey and you start at X if you have any kind of aspirational nature in who you are youre expecting to get to 2X 3X 4X he said Im goaldriven and I can assure you Ill get better at whatever it is I need to doThe exchange sums Bush up well One moment hes lofty the next hes granular There are fleeting moments of personal connection but mostly hes proudly workmanlike  and unafraid to come off as the smartest guy in the room He has a Bill Clintonlike ability to speak on multiple issues with fluency but with a mechanical delivery in place of a friendly drawlBush is casting himself as the experienced adult in a Republican field packed with younger crowdpleasing contenders from Gov Scott Walker of Wisconsin to Sen Ted Cruz of Texas The question is whether his wonky somewhat stilted approach will have appeal beyond the ranks of the establishment GOPClearly hes smart theres no question about that said Bob Knight a lobbyist who watched Bush speak in Greenville and Columbia SC You can buy that  but can you buy charisma Does he have the charisma to winBush starts his standard stump speech with a quick nod to his family history In Cedar Rapids Iowa he introduced himself as Georges boy and Ws brother but quickly put distance between himself and the former presidentsAll of my mistakes I made in my life are my own doing They have nothing to do with my family I have a great family But Ive been on my own journey he saidWhen he made his first stop on the tour in Las Vegas a man asked Bush how he would be a different president than his father and brother were He deflected by turning the question around at the crowdYou have brothers and sisters he asked the manAre you exactly the same Bush askedMost Bush appearances last about an hour He poses for a few pictures and shakes hands before giving about seven minutes of introductory remarks Then he fields questions for at least 45 minutes on immigration energy policy Common Core education standards Alzheimers research or the national debtHe traveled Thursday to the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta for a brief stop which coincided with a visit by Georgiaborn rapper Ludacris who was being honored for his charitable foundationBush joked that he came because I heard Ludacris was gonna be here Photos of Bush and Ludacris circulated widely on TwitterRepeatedly during events this month Bush marveled about the future Pointing to the Pebble Smartwatch on his wrist Bush said most Americans will soon be wearing such devices to track their health bank accounts and sleep patterns  part of a technological revolution as he put it in both New Hampshire and South CarolinaBush is 6foot4 a few inches taller than his brother He has a slight hunch in his shoulders something he admitted hes working to correct He has lost more than 20 pounds in the past few months as he prepares for the expected campaign Audience members commonly say that hes much taller than they expectedWhile talking with voters he calls men brother says hes all in on his positions and frequently labels things cool He goes out of his way to thank Hispanic waiters at restaurants and speaks to them in his fluent Spanish He uses outdated expressions such as Holy schnikes and Holy Toledo and decries the yapping and food fight in WashingtonHe also has a dry deadpan sense humor  so dry it often evaporates quickly There are some people that have been dying to ask a question back there he told the Las Vegas crowd I dont want them to do thatAt this early stage most of Bushs public appearances are hastily arranged In the hotel ballrooms community centers and restaurants there are no campaign placards no booming music no bright Tshirts and very little staff Sometimes hes showing up as the headline act at somebody elses event such as a Chamber of Commerce meetingHis traveling posse includes similarly lanky bespectacled men Theres Josh Venable who worked for Bushs education foundation and advises him on policy matters Coleman Lapointe is the body guy who once worked for Bushs father and is tasked with taking photos on the cellphones of supporters Tim Miller Bushs communications directorinwaiting is the freshest face in the packOther traveling companions have included Kristy Campbell his press secretary who held a similar job when he was governor Sally Bradshaw a longtime consigliere tasked with recruiting top staffers and donors and David Kochel his campaign managerinwaitingIn each state the group piles into a rented SUV and Bush sits in the front passengerside seat  never in the back He snacks on unsalted almonds as part of a strict paleo diet That meant eating takeout from Ruths Chris Steak House on the ride from Columbia to Myrtle Beach on Tuesday night or pulled pork with no barbecue sauce during a recent stop in Waukee IowaVirtually all the voters who show up to see Bush say they are reserving judgment until they see other candidatesI want to know more about him Dennis Cavanaugh of Murrells Inlet SC said after Bushs visit to Myrtle Beach Cavanaugh said that after Obama the country needs to do a better job vetting the next president Anybody and his brother can run for office  literally I think thats part of what the big problem isHis wife Anne seemed won over by Bush for a simple reason He encouraged people to email him questions to his personal address jebjeborgI like that because I think if I emailed President Obama I wouldnt get an answer she saidAs his travels continue Bush seems increasingly convinced that he can outlast others in the fieldIts been a blast he told reporters late one day in Columbia Just for the record Im not a candidate  but as Ive gone about listening to people and hearing their questions its been fun truly it has been joyful
