Washington CNN Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader  and hed like to keep it that wayHeading into the final year of his first session leading the chamber  which begins Monday when the Senate returns from its winter recess  the Kentucky Republican is developing a carefully tailored legislative agenda It is designed to support his top priority which is not losing power to Democrats who controlled the Senate for most of the past decade and who are committed to reclaiming it in the November electionsTo complicate his effort the softspoken and methodical McConnell must accomplish this against the backdrop of a wildly unpredictable 2016 GOP presidential nominating campaign that has two antiWashington agitators  businessman Donald Trump and Sen Ted Cruz of Texas  leading the pack The controversial tone of their campaigns has mainstream Republicans deeply concerned about the impact on downticket candidates  such as moderate GOP senators from purple states who must be reelected if Republicans are to hold the Senate  especially if Trump or Cruz win the Republican nominationRepublicans currently have a narrow 5446 advantage and must defend 24 seats this fall seven in swing states that voted for President Barack Obama Democrats need to protect just 10 seats only one of which is considered competitiveA constant and challenging task in the months ahead for McConnell will be to protect incumbent senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire Mark Kirk of Illinois Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin from politically difficult votes on free trade guns abortion and other sensitive social issues that could cause them trouble back homeMcConnell who is firmly rooted in the establishment wing of the GOP spent his first year running the chamber with a strategic eye toward the 2016 Senate elections He believes he made an important down payment to voters by proving Republicans can govern more effectively and successfully than DemocratsBy any objective standard I think the Senate is clearly back to work McConnell said at a yearend news conferenceHe pushed through a number of major bills  such as highway funding and education reform  that were signed into law by Obama and he diligently prevented any real threat of government shutdowns or other dramatic fiscal cliffs that have shaken voters nerves in recent yearsI wanted to end those sort of rattling experiences that the American people dont like It never produces a positive result anyway McConnell said I took those off the table the day after the election and we began to figure out how to get the Senate working againMcConnell is tightlipped about exactly which bills he will put on the floor and when ahead of the November election Aides say many of those decisions need to be made after a joint House and Senate Republican retreat in Baltimore later this week But hes made clear that restoring a regular appropriations process  where all 12 government spending bills will be debated and voted on separately  is keyDemocrats fought that approach last year because Republicans were demanding higher spending for defense needs than domestic programs a standoff that led to a breakthrough budget deal that set topline government spending figures for 2016 and 2017 Because of that Democratic leaders believe McConnells ambition to take up all the spending bills may be doableThat seems to be pretty fertile ground for bipartisan compromise said Sen Chuck Schumer DNew YorkIt may be ambitious to believe all these bills can actually pass the partisan Congress especially with a legislative calendar truncated by the political conventions and other campaign activities But if the parties could agree on some individual spending bills it would lower the risk of major government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins October 1 That would be a relief to GOP leaders and a sign to voters they kept their word to avoid calamityWhile there is a laundry list of other bills the Senate could take up this year  including a massive international trade deal and sweeping criminal justice reform  McConnell might be reluctant to negotiate anything major with a lame duck Democratic president and hold out to see if a Republican can win back the White HouseI think no matter which party controls the White House during a presidential year everything is overtaken by that election said Brian Walsh a former top official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee which works to elect GOP Senate candidates I think both parties are in a waitandsee mode in terms of who is going to control the White House in the following year I think its only prudent to hold off on big issues like this and see where things are in 12 monthsMcConnells aim for a more modest legislative agenda differs dramatically with the priorities of the new House Speaker Paul Ryan who has said he wants his chamber to be an ideas factoryRyan also must placate a restive right flank that wants to push highprofile legislation that will draw sharp campaign year contrasts with Obama and congressional Democrats Some of those hotbutton issues  dealing with abortion guns climate change and more  will be politically complicated for McConnell if they are sent over from the House just as he is trying to protect swing state senators from tough votesOther issues will compete for McConnells attention Many Republicans want to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against ISIS something that has regularly stalled in the past over policy differences Ryan has approved a fresh look at an AUMF and if the House approves one if could put pressure on McConnell to actThe House is also readying to act on new sanctions against North KoreaOn the domestic front a battle is expected on a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration over a push by some Republicans to privatize air traffic controllersDemocrats will demand votes on their agenda too Helping Puerto Rico solve its debt crisis is a top priority for Democrats as is passing more gun control laws Republicans leaders have signaled they are open to possible legislation for the troubled US territory but are flatly opposed to any new gun law despite Obamas recent push on the issueWere going to do more on guns said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid Were not going to be silent on thatDo no harm to GOP senatorsMcConnell has already signaled he doesnt want to take up the TransPacific Partnership measure  a legacy item for Obama  until after the election Putting off votes on the controversial multination free trade pact could benefit GOP senators up for reelection in rust belt states like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio where the loss of jobs to free trade deals is a sensitive subjectMcConnell also has said he doesnt intend to draft a major overhaul of the tax code this year even though its a top goal of RyansBecause government funding levels were set in last years budget deal McConnell could skip doing a budget resolution this year several congressional aides told CNN Dropping the timeconsuming budget process could give GOP Senate candidates more time at home campaigning It would also allow them to avoid the ritual votearama when senators can offer up an infinite number of amendments many of which are aimed at putting political squeezes on those running for reelectionA spokesman for McConnell denied that was trueWere planning on a budget Don Stewart saidWalsh who as an official at the NRSC helped Republicans win back the Senate two years ago after eight years of Democratic majorities said the key for McConnell and his conference is demonstrating that they are doing the business of the American people in terms of funding the government passing bills on time And that will benefit their candidatesI think the big issue is do no harm he said
