The Republican Party has put itself in an impossible position For months theyve told us over and over and over again how unstable Trump is how unfit for office he is Theyve told us hes a con artist a clown a bigot Now that hes decimated their party now thats he toppled every hackneyed candidate hes faced theyre forced to perform an aboutface and endorse him as their nominee for presidentIt wont work And no one will buy itHillary Clintons campaign has already done the easy work of compiling the statements made by Republicans about Trump The result predictably is brutal In less than 90 seconds we hear  mostly from other Republican presidential candidates  why Trump is a menace who must be stopped Heres a few highlightsThis is an individual who mocked a disable reporter who attributed a reporters question to her menstrual cycle  Mitt RomneyThe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency  Marco RubioThe man who only feels big when hes trying to make other people feel small  Carly FiorinaThe man is utterly amorala narcissist at a level I dont this country has ever seen  Ted CruzHes a racebaiting xenophobic religious bigotThis guy is so unfit to be commanderinchief  Lindsey GrahamSome party elders will have the dignity to follow their conscience and hold to their convictions Both George W Bush and George HW Bush for instance informed The Hill that they do not plan to participate in or comment on the presidential race Neither Bush attended the previous convention but the decision not to comment at all is revealing It says as clearly as possible We cant support Donald Trump for presidentOthers like South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley who accused Trump of cynically exploiting an angsty public during her response to the Obamas State of the Union address are already falling into line I have great respect for the will of the people she told The Charleston Post and Courier and as I have always said I will support the Republican nominee for president She quickly added however that shes not interested in serving as vice presidentAnd there will be many Republicans like Sen Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and former Florida Gov Bob Martinez who know Trump is cartoonishly unqualified but nevertheless support his candidacy From a New York Times report this morning Senator Kelly Ayotte of New New Hampshire who is in a tough reelection race signaled that she would support Mr Trump but not endorse him as a spokeswoman put it a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately Representative Raul R Labrador of Idaho a staunch conservative said he would support Mr Trump but derided him for not knowing much about the Constitution or politics Former Gov Bob Martinez of Florida who retains a strong network of donors said he would raise money for Mr Trump but was unsure about his proposals like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States This is what happens when politicians put reelection or party over the moral imperative to do right by the country You cant say in good faith that Trump doesnt know anything about the Constitution or politics but that you support him nonetheless This is the presidency after all  its rather important that the candidate know such things Nor is there any room to equivocate about Trumps proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country  its both wrong and unconstitutional Republicans let this monster into their house Hes their problem They have a responsibility to do whats right  the stakes are too high to do otherwise If they choose blind fidelity to the party over their obligation to the country theyve lost the right to call themselves public servants
