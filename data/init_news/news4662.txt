While facing budget cuts the IRS nevertheless prioritized worker bonuses union activity and the implementation of President Obamas health care law over assisting taxpayers during tax season according to a new report released Wednesday by the House Ways and Means CommitteeThe findings in a Republicanled report were released ahead of a subcommittee hearing Wednesday morning with IRS Commissioner John KoskinenAt the hearing Koskinen stressed that the agency is significantly underfunded and those cuts have consequencesHe said less funding means there will be a decline in service for taxpayers and pledged that service would improve if they got more moneyCustomer service  both on the phone and in person  has been far worse than anyone would want Its simply a matter of not having enough people to answer the phones and provide service at our walkin sites as a result of cuts to our budget he saidBut Republicans argued the IRS is making bad spending choices I would just suggest to you that theres hardly a person in America today that isnt doing more with less that hasnt tightened their belt and learned how to work with less Rep Mike Kelly RPa saidThe IRS has faced congressional budget cuts of 12 billion since 2010 and has faced criticism in recent years over the targeting of conservative groups applying for taxexempt status and reports of wasteful spending The new report said the cuts were intended to force the IRS to manage its resources more effectively and immediately stop inappropriate activitiesHowever while cuts were made in part to focus the agency on customer service the report asserted that spending decisions entirely under the IRSs control led to 16 million fewer taxpayers receiving IRS assistance this filing seasonThe panel found the IRS had cut customer services while continuing to hand out bonuses to employees allowing staff to conduct union activities failing to collect debt owed by employees of the federal government and spending over 12 billion on implementing ObamaCareEven though the IRSs budget for taxpayer assistance remained flat from fiscal year 2014 to 2015 the level of overthephone customer service significantly decreased with the agency shifting staff in customer service to focus on written correspondence instead of telephone calls Meanwhile the number of calls doubled in that periodThe panel found that wait times increased from 187 minutes to 344 minutes and answered calls decreased from 66 million to 53 millionIn January 2015 the IRS commissioner estimated that taxpayer service would decline while delays in tax refunds would increase While the IRS commissioner has blamed this solely on budget cuts in reality the IRS deliberately diverted resources away from taxpayer services the report foundDespite the drop in service there was no significant decrease in bonuses for IRS employees Notably in November 2014 despite another round of budget cuts at the IRS Koskinen announced that employees would receive bonuses at the same level as for the previous year unless they had substantiated conduct issues the report saidWhile acknowledging that the agency has cut the amount of time spent on discretionary union activity the report questioned why it could not have been decreased further asserting that the amount of resources spent on discretionary union activity could have assisted nearly 25 million taxpayersThe report noted that while the IRSs implementation of ObamaCare was deemed a success by Koskinen the IRS achieved this supposed success by prioritizing  implementation over other activities including core responsibilities like taxpayer assistanceThe panel also claimed the agency had failed to pursue recommendations for streamlining and reducing waste and abuse It concluded that what it called large areas of systemic waste and inefficiency present in 2010 remained unaddressed in 2015 and highlighted in particular that the IRS spent 21 million on litigation services that the government could have conducted itself
