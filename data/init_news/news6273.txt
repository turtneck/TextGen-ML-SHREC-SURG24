Obergefell vs Hodges a combination of four cases concerning the matter of samesex marriageThe high court is dedicating twoandahalfhours to this monumental case not the usual one hourThe only thing before the Supreme Court is will they force all states to have samesex marriage Regent University law professor Brad Jacob told CBN NewsThe stakes couldnt be higher with the high court possibly determining the very nature of marriageCBN News Paul Strand shows us the sometimes unique sights one sees when thousands of samesex marriage advocates and traditional marriage advocates fill the Supreme Court Plaza at the same time Watch belowJacob said gays and their allies see marriage as an institution that brings with it certain exclusive benefitsAnd they look at that and say Its just discrimination to not allow a couple that consist of two men or two women to have that same privilege of having that kind of relationship Jacob explainedThe judges who say This is just about admitting everybody to a relationship that already exists theyre going to say Yes the states cannot deny that to people just because theyre gay he saidTo hear audio of the arguments on samesex marriage before the Supreme Court today click here The case is Obergefell v Hodges questions one and twoTraditional marriage advocates see it as the agesold sanctioning and blessing of men and women uniting producing children and giving them a mother and a fatherRyan Anderson is a leading traditional marriage advocate with the Heritage Foundation saidThe states in the marriage business because the union of a man and a woman can produce a child And a child deserves a mother and a father he saidMarriage is not just two people making a commitment to love one another Jacob said as he described the beliefs of traditional marriage advocatesIts an institution thats been around for millennia that involves a husband and a wife in a complementary way that can lead to the procreation of children and the core family unit as the building block for all of our society he explainedOn the other hand Anderson suggested Samesex marriage sends a signal that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and therefore mothers and fathers are replaceable Itll be very hard to say that fathers are essential if the law has redefined marriage to say fathers are optionalDo the People Rule or JudgesAnother huge issue Should citizens and the states decide this most fundamental matter or federal courtsThe Supreme Court case is going to determine whether or not citizens or judges get to define what marriage is in the 50 states Anderson explainedJacob stated Traditionally family law including marriage has been state law Its been primarily something that states controlled in their sovereigntyCathy Ruse of the Family Research Council added And the law in this case is clear states have always had authority to make marriage policy decisions So the question before the justices is Do we now take that away from statesSo this is a really big constitutional question concerning the powers of the federal government and the state government Jacob explainedAnderson stated Historically the citizens and our elected representatives got to make marriage policy Now we have the chance that nine unelected judges are going to redefine marriage for the entire countryBut one thing this case is not about is the Supreme Court banning gay marriage Even if the court rules it should be left up to the states its already legal in 37 of them  in some cases because judges ordered itTheres no outcome of this case that would make gay marriage go away Jacob said And if the justices rule the states should decide on samesex marriage themselves he added states will continue to consider it Some states will adopt it At least for the present some states wontLet the Labs of Democracy Do Their WorkThe Supreme Court shouldnt cut it short Anderson advocated We should let the discussion continue let the laboratories of democracy do their work We dont need the Supreme Court settling it once and for all for all 50 statesThats what the court thought it did with Roe v Wade But 42 years later abortion still fiercely divides the nationRuse suggested It will just like Roe be a social experiment conducted  really untested unresearched  on the entire country The social implications of this case are so reminiscent of Roe v WadeThe Supreme Court said they were going to solve the abortion issue 42 years ago in Roe v Wade There is no issue less settled in American public life than abortion Anderson suggestedAnd every four years at election time we have a giant culture war over this he continued Look at Europe Europe has much more commonsense compromise positions on abortion because they solve it democraticallyOur court cut short the democratic process on abortion and thats why our politics are so polarized Why would they want to do it again on the marriage issue Anderson askedCritics of samesex marriage warn that legalizing it means that one harmful effect will be on religious liberty something thats already been seen with government bludgeoning believers at businesses that refuse to back gay marriagesAs society redefines marriage it then starts to violate religious liberty rights Anderson explainedChristianrun adoption agencies have been shut down because they wanted to find homes for orphans with married moms and dads and the government said thats discrimination he continuedWeve seen bakers florists and photographers who have no problem serving gay and lesbian customers who only object to helping to celebrate a samesex wedding  theyve been harassed by the government theyve been penalized by the government coerced by the government Anderson saidRarely does a country come to a moment like this where the course of a nation a society a culture is all hanging on twoandahalfhours in a courtroom
