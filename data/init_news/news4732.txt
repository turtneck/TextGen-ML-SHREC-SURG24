CNN The Democratic primary race heads west this weekend  way way out westDemocrats will hold presidential contests in Hawaii Alaska and Washington state on Saturday three states expected to be friendlier to Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders than former Secretary of State Hillary ClintonBut with Clinton leading Sanders by about 300 pledged delegates and because none of the contests are winnertakeall Sanders needs stunning wins in each state to give the Clinton campaign any real anxiety about the outcome of the raceIn the runup to the votes Sanders has left nothing to chance His campaign has spent millions on ads in Washington Alaska and Hawaii including a powerful television spot featuring Hawaii Rep Tulsi Gabbard  who resigned her position with the Democratic National Committee earlier this year to endorse SandersGoing into Saturdays contests Sanders needs to net an estimated 75 of the remaining pledged delegates while Clinton only needs 35Dont be surprised if Sanders sweeps on Saturday His campaign has received endorsements from influential players and his campaign has invested in a strong air and ground game in each stateThere are 142 total delegates at stake Saturday 16 in Alaska 24 in Hawaii and 101 in WashingtonAll three will hold caucuses to choose delegates  a method that has favored Sanders in the past  instead of primaries Alaska and Washington are also largely white and rural demographics that typically have given Sanders a boostIf Sanders does as expected the headlines declaring him a winner thrice over will surely provide a gust of wind for Sanders campaign for fundraising purposes even if it doesnt change the calculus of the raceDelegate math is still on Clintons sideClinton heads into the weekend with 1229 pledged delegates to Sanders 925 not counting the superdelegates The magic number needed to clinch the nomination is 2383So even if Sanders posts strong numbers Saturday he still faces an uphill battle to overcome Clintons lead All three states dole out delegates proportionately or by county so even if Sanders wins a majority in each Clinton will still nab pledged delegates along the way And because of the relatively low populations in these states there simply arent enough delegates on the table this weekend to make a significant dentLooking at the lineup ahead this could be Sanders final big night The next states on the calendar particularly New York Pennsylvania and Maryland where a combined 531 delegates will be up for grabs look good for ClintonNowhere on Saturday are expectations higher for Sanders than in Washington stateSanders has visited the state multiple times throughout his campaign and the states liberal urban centers have been especially welcoming of his message of ideological purity over Clintons pragmatismIn Seattle which last year approved a measure to raise the citys minimum wage to 15 an hour over time support for Sanders is especially strong The citys largest newspaper The Seattle Times endorsed Sanders  He spent the week before the election touring the state holding six rallies including a major event at Seattles Safeco Field the night before the caucuses His campaign has invested 24 million in radio and television advertising in the state according to Sanders campaign manager Jeff WeaverSanders is expected to win but with more than 100 delegates at stake it will be imperative for him to make that win count by scooping up as many delegates as possible His results in Washington will help set the tone for the upcoming electoral boutsTurnout is anticipated to be high another factor that aids Sanders Some 35000 people have already voted in Washington state using absentee ballots and about 200000 are likely to participateCampaigns on the ground even if candidates arentIts not easy to pop in and out of states like Hawaii and Alaska and with the small number of delegates on the table the campaigns have largely determined their time is better spent elsewhere But that doesnt mean they arent making plays in each using surrogates ad buys and family visitsIn Alaska Sanders wife Jane visited Anchorage on Thursday and will remain through Saturday Sanders campaign has dropped at least 56877 on radio and television spots in the stateClintons campaign meanwhile has invested in a phonebanking effort in rural parts of Alaska emphasizing climate change and veteran issues and expressing her opposition to a controversial Alaska mine project according to The Anchorage Daily News Clinton called into Alaska radio last Tuesday morning and talked about working briefly in a salmon cannery in Alaska in 1969Both campaigns are spending money on ads in Hawaii although Sanders is outspending Clinton 192680 to 54300 Sanders this week touted his endorsement from Gabbard a popular Hawaii Democratic lawmakerHow states will dole out delegatesAlaska 16 Delegates will be rewarded by state House districts and determined by a caucus system
