Panama City Florida CNN Donald Trump is tearing the Grand Old Party apartThe tension that has simmered in the Republican Party for years  shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default  escalated into an outright civil war Tuesday The conflict not only threatens the partys ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump losesOn one side is Trump who spent much of Tuesday lashing out on social media at his GOP foes such as Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen John McCain and lamenting the lack of party unity Hes backed by conservative lawmakers including Iowa Rep Steve King and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies including the one here in Panama City Florida Tuesday where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent Hillary ClintonSome are even raising the potential of denying Ryan the speakership after the electionOn the other side is Ryan who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority That dominance of Capitol Hill is suddenly threatened  and not just in the Senate where there are many competitive races but also in the House where the GOP majority was considered untouchable until recentlyThe infighting  sparked by the release Friday of a 2005 video depicting Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms  isnt likely to ease in the 27 days before Election Day Trump made clear Tuesday that if he loses in November he wont go down quietly  or aloneHe began the day with a series of shots  taken over Twitter  at Ryan saying its hard to do well when the speaker isnt supportive He followed up about an hour later calling Ryan a weak and ineffective leaderAnd nearly two hours after that Trump posed his most explosive tweet of the dayShackles have been taken off meTrump continued his attacks on Ryan Wednesday during a rally in central Florida where he said hes at a disadvantage when you have leadership not putting their weight behind the peopleHe also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his Sunday night debate performanceWouldnt you think Paul Ryan would call and say good job he said It got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country Youd think theyd say great going Don lets beat this crook No he doesntTrumps turn on his own party may seem counterproductive  it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching Clinton But it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this yearAnd by blaming Republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign Trump also opens up the possibility of a facesaving excuse if he crashes to defeat in NovemberBut the cost to the Republican Party of Trumps burnitdownaroundhim strategy is already high could become more extreme and potentially leave the GOP badly damaged long after he has left the political sceneTo begin with the estrangement between Trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the partys grass roots and its establishment leaders that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summerIt is a divide that will be hard to overcome if Trump loses the election Forging unity could be impossible if hordes of Trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other Republican has managed in decadesKing the Iowa Republican congressman warned Tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary saying the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort thats going on right nowTheyve gone so far out on this limb King said on the Laura Ingraham radio showThe meltdown in the GOP is the culmination of forces that have been building for years Intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose President Barack Obama gave rise to the Tea Party and sent waves of antiestablishment lawmakers to Washington in successive electionsTrumps adoption of a factuallychallenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the GOP presidential ticket through the role of Stephen Bannon the head of Breitbart News who serves as the CEO of the Trump campaignTrumps turn against his own party could also reverberate in downballot races Republicans have long known that their hold on the Senate was tenuous  whoever ran at the top of their ticket  but Trumps slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents tooAt the very least a Trump implosion that cuts deeply into Ryans majority could complicate the Speakers already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition If an antiTrump landslide sweeps away House GOP members in more moderate districts it could hand more relative power to the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on John Boehner his predecessorThe dilemma is especially difficult for Republican senators running for reelection Some are rejecting Trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters But at the same time they risk alienating Trump supporters in statess where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary raceNew Hampshire Sen Kelly Ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing Trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider GOP conundrum Ayotte finally said she could not vote for Trump after the video emerged on FridayBut another star of the GOP Florida Sen Marco Rubio said Tuesday hes not yet ready to back away from Trump Rubio looks certain to need Trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his reelection race But at the same time if more explosive video emerges about Trump Rubio who has presidential ambitions in his future risks being tarnished by association with the Republican nomineeAnother lawmaker in a tough reelection race who is hedging his bets is North Carolina GOP Sen Richard Burr who said that while Trumps comments were indefensible he still plans to support himFor her part the turmoil consuming the GOP would seem to provide a substantial boost to Clintons White House bid An NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found the Democratic nominee enjoying a 9point lead among likely voters in a fourway raceBut her aides caution against excessive optimism Theres concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race  which could only become darker in the days ahead  could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls In that instance a lower turnout could create an advantage for TrumpThis seems to be their strategy disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they wont come out to the polls John Podesta Clintons campaign chairman told reporters Tuesday I think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidateClinton said as much herself during an interview with a Florida radio station TuesdayDespite all of the terrible things Trump has said and done he is still trying to win this election she said And we cannot be complacent we cannot rest
