Lights Camera Propaganda Washingtons AntiRussia Campaign Invades Hollywood Keep those Russian baddies coming Originally appeared at RT For years the influence of the CIA in Hollywood was hidden and unacknowledged Now its more of an open secret not publicized but pretty easy to read up on if you care Just ask the spy agencys Entertainment Industry Liaison Yes such a thing really exists  You see the CIAs man in Hollywood wants to help actors authors directors producers and screenwriters gain a better understanding of the intelligence agency in order to ensure accurate portrayals of its activities It even wants to help fire up the neurons and actually give you some good ideas if youre coming up short in that department Indeed the CIA provides inspiration for future storylines and lists them on its website Of course its all in the interest of creating authentic and balanced portrayals of US intelligence agencies and the US military And theyre quite busy too Between 2006 and 2011 the CIA public relations office had input into at least 22 film and movie projects In a column for the Washington Post in 2011 David Sirota noted that the Pentagon too enlists the help of Hollywood for PR purposes when things are going awry and Americans are becoming weary of war Movies like Top Gun in the 1980s and Zero Dark Thirty more recently were made in consultation with the Pentagon and White House The result of thiscreative input for Pentagon assistance bargain created an entertainment culture rigged to produce relatively few antiwar movies and dozens of blockbusters that glorify the military and which amounts to government subsidized propaganda The CIA has had a hand in creating TV shows like 24 Homeland andAlias The Americans  an FX show about two Russian spies living undercover in the US  was created by a former CIA agent and the agency reportedly approves the scripts for each episode A piece in the Guardian in 2008 called the CIAs involvement in Hollywood a tale of deception and subversion that would seem improbable if it were put on screen Of course its unlikely to be put on screen given that the agency which provides guidance on CIArelated movies  is the CIA Enlisting Hollywood help with antiRussia messaging Remember the inspiration for future storylines list mentioned earlier Well guess what The liaisons current pick for a possible future movie project is about one Ryszard Kukliski  a Polish colonel and spy for NATO who spent years passing secret Soviet documents to the CIA I wonder why theyd be interested in that sort of thing right now It couldnt be anything to do with deteriorating relations between Russia and the West could it It may sound like conspiracy theory but the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed that the the US State Department has actively sought out the biggest players in Hollywood and tried to enlist their help with what they calledantiRussia messaging for the publics consumption through innocent entertainment In other words the government asked Hollywood for help producing propaganda  although Im sure the State Department would call it something nicer Richard Stengel the US under secretary for public diplomacy wrote to Sony CEO Mark Lynton explaining that the government needed help countering both ISIS and Russian narratives and said this wasnt something the State Department could do on its own He suggested convening a meeting of media executives to discuss ideas content production and commercial possibilities Lynton responded with a list of media executives at other entertainment companies including Disney and Fox Its unclear from the emails whether that meeting Stengel requested ever happened but judging by much of the recent entertainment industry output one might be forgiven for assuming it did Negative depictions of Russia in American and British news and entertainment media are hardly new  but at least as far as I can tell theres certainly been an uptick over the past 1218 months and it coincides nicely with a major US governmentled antiRussia messaging campaign which has also spilled over into much of Western print and broadcast media Gratuitous mentions of Russia and Vladimir Putin where they are not necessary are becoming tiresome For me the last straw was sitting down to watch Bridget Joness Baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the antiPutin punk band Pussy Riot and their struggle for free speech It was the last straw because it was just one more in a long line of useless allusions to big bad Russia that seemed to come from nowhere For me the last straw was sitting down to watch Bridget Joness Baby last month and being subjected to an entirely unnecessary and irrelevant subplot about the antiPutin punk band Pussy Riot and their struggle for free speech In the Netflix political drama House of Cards Pussy Riot  the real ones this time  got their own cameo alongside evil Putin not the real one But even when there isnt a major storyline attached to Russia somehow the country frequently gets thrown in anyway Russia is still the goto country when there needs to be a joke about scary or immoral foreigners There are endless examples In NBCs Scandal one character suggests Putin might randomly invade Belarus In CBSs Madam Secretary one character spews the line I cant go back to Russia its a pigsty In the recently released movie Bad Moms one of the bad moms protesting something or other which I cant recall shouts What is this Russia The shortrunning show Allegiancewas entirely about a Russian sleeper cell in the US which was suddenly reactivated and whose members  now fully adapted to blissful life in America  no longer wanted anything to do with Russia How original NBCs Blacklist has given us multiple Russian baddies and the sitcom 2 Broke Girls has made its fair share of Putin jokes The third installment of The Purge introduced us to a gang of menacing Russian murder tourists who take advantage of the annual 12hour period during which any crime including murder becomes legal I could go on but you get the idea Russians are bad Is it all CIA influence Is it all the result of the State DepartmentsantiRussia messaging campaign Not necessarily While the CIA does have huge influence in Hollywood on specific projects many of the random negative references to Russia are probably the result of a media information war which naturally spills over into the creative output of writers and directors Many of them probably shouldnt be blamed too harshly Theyre fed a diet of antiRussia messaging through the news media so its no wonder these kinds of lines end up in their movies and TV shows Interestingly in June the Senate Intelligence Committee included an amendment to Congress annual intelligence spending bill which would require the Director of National Intelligence to submit reports detailing the relationship between the CIA and Hollywood But the Senate committee is no doubt less worried about the propaganda effects and more worried about the CIA divulging sensitive and classified information to movie directors as was the case controversially with Zero Dark Thirty Anyway tip for aspiring filmmakers and TV producers Leave the Russia jokes out Its getting boring Did you enjoy this article  Consider helping us Russia
