If theres one message the Republican presidential candidates not named Donald Trump aimed to get across at the final debate before Iowas caucuses it was this 50 states still have to vote and a lot could change when they doWere just starting The first vote hasnt been counted Why dont we let the process work Jeb Bush said in Des MoinesThe GOP contenders are barnstorming the Hawkeye State Friday on the heels of the Fox NewsGoogle debate where Trumps absence put a spotlight on candidates like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  but also gave the races underdogs a chance to engage on the issues and even capture airtime that eluded them when the frontrunner was onstageBush and Kentucky Sen Rand Paul in particular were getting high marks Friday from analysts The former Florida governor was seen as having one of his best debate performances of the campaign  including pointed criticism of his former protg Rubio  perhaps benefiting from not having to worry about Trump belittling his every comment And Paul after missing the cut in the last debate returned to the main stage with a firm critique of his rivals alleged inconsistencies on immigration surveillance and moreIn Iowa those candidates may simply be too far behind in the polls for a strong debate showing to make much differenceBut the night helped show that few candidates are conceding anything to frontrunner Trump or the other two toppolling candidates Cruz and RubioAsked Friday if he changed any minds at the debate Bush said I hope soNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie too played the role Thursday of disenchanted Washington outsider scolding the Florida and Texas senators after an immigration spat and quipping that he needed a Washington dictionary to decipher what they were sayingThis is why you need to send someone outside of Washington to Washington Christie said Stop the Washington bull and lets get things doneWith Trump out of the picture  boycotting the debate over complaints about Fox News instead hosting a veterans event nearby  Cruz absorbed much of the criticism from the other GOP candidatesHe and Rubio tangled the most as Rubio tries to make up ground against Cruz in both Iowa and New HampshireIn their most heated exchange Rubio accused Cruz of falsely describing himself as the most conservative candidate and changing his position on immigrationThis is the lie that Teds campaign is built on the Florida senator said Throughout this campaign youve been willing to say and do anything in order to get votesHe said Cruz used to talk about bringing immigrants out of the shadows and now you want to trump Trump on immigrationThe Texas senator flipped the allegation saying it is Rubio who vowed to fight against amnesty and then reversed course for political expediencyI like Marco hes very charming hes very smooth Cruz said before accusing him of siding with donors in the immigration debateBush later sparred as well with Rubio on immigration Bush said Rubio sponsored the gang of eight bill that allowed for legalization but then he cut and run because it wasnt popular with conservativesThe debate marked a particular opportunity for Paul  who did not qualify for the recent Fox Business Network debate but returned to the primetime stage Thursday after making the cut this timeIts great to be back Paul said ThursdayPaul despite struggling with low poll numbers seemed to have plenty of supporters in the audience as his responses drew applause from the crowd several times He also took shots at both Cruz and Rubio on their recordsEchoing Cruz criticism he said Rubio made a deal with Democrats on immigration and suggested he was weak on border securityAt the same time Paul suggested Cruz was being disingenuous by claiming he was never for amnesty He said Cruz has an authenticity problemThe debate Thursday with 125 million viewers was the secondhighest rated telecast in Fox News historyAlso on stage Thursday night were retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov John KasichCarsons standout moment seemed to come at the end of the debate when he used his closing statement to recite the Preamble to the US ConstitutionPlease think of our founding fathers as you listen Carson asked After reading aloud the Preamble  including its call for a more perfect union  he said Folks its not too late Enough saidThe polls in the Hawkeye State show essentially a twoman race for first between Trump and Cruz in the final stretch Rubio has been holding steady in third position while Carsons numbers have been on a downward course in recent weeksAfter Iowa the candidates head to New Hampshire where Trump also leads but several other candidates are jockeying for position behind him
