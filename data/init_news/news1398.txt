Its hard to imagine a discussion on the barbarians who make up The Islamic State having anything to do with Goldilocks and the Three Bears But if Congress is going to approve any formal authorization to sanction US military action against the extremist group it needs to engineer a resolution thats not too hot not too cold but just rightAnd therein lies the challengeHow does Congress author a resolution that allows lawmakers to exercise their Constitutional authority about deploying US military force  yet doesnt fully commit boots on the groundLawmakers are leery about the latter because the public long ago lost its appetite for a protracted conflict Yet at the same time how does Congress make sure the resolution is muscular enough to actually make a difference in fighting ISIS and not just a fig leafAnd if Congress doesnt concoct something that is sufficiently stout what are the consequences if ISIS hits the United States keeps incinerating people in cages lopping off heads or seriously threatens Israel and JordanWhat is the composition of a resolution that doesnt hem in the president and the military  yet gives them appropriate agility to react and respond and fightAnd how about a time frame How can one possibly say the US is committed only to fighting this long And if its openended some lawmakers fret its not appropriate for the US to wage perpetual conflicts that never seem to have exit strategiesNotice this resolution to combat ISIS isnt even called a Declaration of War Its euphemistically called an AUMF short for Authorization for Use of Military Force The Constitution grants Congress war powers But Congress has officially declared war only five times The most recent was in 1941 when the US entered WWII The US is very worried about declaring war on ISIS lest it be perceived its at war with Islam or Muslims So an AUMF for ISIS will just have to doStraightforward but curved Structured but limber A ceiling but no floor A floor but no ceilingIts almost Zenlike Or to Goldilocks porridge Not too hot Not too cold But just rightChatter about crafting a resolution to manage the US fight against ISIS ramped up this week White House spokesman Eric Schultz indicated that a resolution would come relatively soon Sources tell Fox News that the presentation of a draft resolution could land on Capitol Hill in a number of daysIt was clear that leaders on the Hill wanted to get this done It was also clear this was a priority for the president and they wanted language from the White House They also wanted to be consulted in advance of sending that language up said Schultz who characterized the talks as robustSome senior lawmakers indicated that the video of the live burning of a Jordanian pilot this week could be the impetus for increased discussionsI dont know how these two things are disconnected said one source who spoke on the condition they not be identifiedHowever other sources disagreed with that suggestionTheyve been talking about this since State of the Union said one source This isnt newStill another source said that the timing of the increased talk was natural because they have to give us a resolution at some point The source noted that additional conversations about a resolution would intensify after President Obama presented his annual budget to CongressObama dropped off his budget on Capitol Hill on Monday National Security Advisor Susan Rice discussed the finer points of the presidents national security on Friday at the Brookings Institution after the White House sent a copy of the blueprint to the Capitol earlier in the daySo the resolution appears to be coming togetherWeve gotten our hopes up before said a sourceHouse Speaker John Boehner ROhio has been resolute that such a request come from the White House and not be something engineered by CongressSources have pointed to two prominent proposals as a potential framework for the AUMFOne is plan crafted by California Rep Adam Schiff the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee The other blueprint comes from Democratic Sens Tim Kaine Virginia and Sen Bob Menendez New JerseyMenendez is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee The panel authored such a resolution to combat ISIS late last year when Democrats still controlled the Senate The panel approved the resolution but it never went to the Senate floor for a voteThere are similarities between the Schiff and KaineMenendez proposals Schiffs outline bans boots on the ground and limits the geographic footprint to fight ISIS to Iraq and Syria The KaineMenendez offering doesnt restrict boots on the ground and has no geographic structureThe Schiff provision also would require Congress to reevaluate the strategy after three yearsThe threeyear window is designed as such to force the next Congress and president to reconsider the issueBoots on the ground appears to be one of the most contentious issues in approving a resolution One Republican lawmaker who asked for anonymity indicated they liked the Schiff plan so long as they didnt restrict the president from putting forces on the groundAnother issue to resolve is whether Congress sunsets the 2001 authorization to fight in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the global war on terror and the 2002 authorization which launched the 2003 war in Iraq Some liberal lawmakers view the 2001 provision as war without end Others maintain that particular authorization must be preserved Still some assert that the 2002 authorization specific to Iraq requires a sunset so it may be superseded by a new authorizationWriting an AUMF to fight ISIS is a dicey enterprise Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle want a new AUMF And how will they find the votes to pass this though Something on which most lawmakers can agreeI have always believed that when it comes to fighting a war that Congress should not tie the presidents hands said Boehner this week Its not going to be an easy liftIf we go in and rescue somebody we have a troop on the ground We have boots on the ground So what is the language around boots on the ground  asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif I think its going to be a challengePelosi knows many of her members will argue for repealing the 2001 and 2002 authorizations so the US doesnt find itself in a boundless war And by the same token some Republicans will look askance at the presidents request for Congress to grant him authority to fight ISIS In an interview with Fox News Rep Ron DeSantis RFla suggested Obama may try to use the document for political coverIf its not successful he wants the Congress to share the blame with him DeSantis predicted As the mission continues to be muddled and it doesnt succeed the president will says you guys didnt authorize ground troops so there was nothing more I could do My hands were tiedAnd so thats why the mission to find the right mix of votes is going to be demanding To pass the administration and lawmakers must forge a resolution thats not too hot not too cold but just right
