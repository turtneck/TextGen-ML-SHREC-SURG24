In a speech on Wednesday afternoon Sen Patty Murray DWash called on any deal to relieve the forthcoming spending cuts to follow four guidelines Reflecting the extremely low bar that Congress has set for itself the first of those guidelines is that the deal can be small in natureSure Murray said according to excerpts of her prepared remarks it would be great to work together to address some of the big challenges we face when it comes to our longterm budget challenges  but if we cant find a path to another small deal we are not going to discover the way to a big oneThe remaining three guidelines are similar to past Democratic demands for any negotiated budget settlement Sequester relief Murray said needs to be done equally for defense and nondefense investments  this is nonnegotiable it should be paid for by a responsible mix of spending cuts and new revenues and finally it should be aimed at broader economic growthHonestly this doesnt have to be this difficult Murray the fourthranking Senate Democrat said during an appearance at law firm BakerHostetlers legislative seminar Working across the aisle to set topline budget numbers and then working together to fill that budget out with spending bills is pretty much the least we should be able to do here in Congress  That Murray feels compelled to tout the relative simplicity of a prospective budget deal suggests that lawmakers are worried that negotiations wont succeed As much as anything else her speech excerpts reflect an attempt to frame in advance the causes of a potential government shutdown this fallSequestration spending cuts  a policy that was put in motion by the deal to raise the debt ceiling back in 2011  are set to return this October after a twoyear semihiatus And with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress the president increasingly protective of his domestic priorities and the presidential campaign in full swing the likelihood of political retrenchment seems highAlready Republicans have passed budgets that further cut nondiscretionary defense accounts while adding spending to the defense budget through an account that isnt subjected to sequestration caps That lack of balance has been sharply criticized by congressional Democrats Even earlier President Barack Obama said he would not sign a governmentfunding bill this fall that didnt include sequestration relief for nondefense priorities significantly raising the stakes for a shut downRepublicans have a choice Murray said They can either work with us early on a bipartisan budget deal that will set the topline budget levels and allow the Appropriations Committee to work on bills that can be signed into law Or they can wait until we reach a crisis until we approach or hit another completely unnecessary government shutdown  and work with us thenIn the past all of the shutdowns and threats of shutdowns occurred because Republicans were trying to change current law the aide said in an email listing congressional Republican fights in the spring of 2011 as well as attempts to defund Obamacare in 2013 as examples Democrats were trying to move forward legislation along the lines of current law and we were the ones trying to cause a ruckusNow the tables have turned the aide pointed out Its Democrats advocating changes to current law with a shutdown as a consequence if they dont get what they want By that logic they cant blame Republicans for causing a shutdown if theyre just following the statutory caps that Democrats voted for in the Budget Control ActObamas own budget calls for a full busting of the sequestration spending caps as part of a nearly 7 percent increase in discretionary spending But budget documents are mostly aspirational And in reality both he and Congress are likely to see a reprisal of a sequestrationrelief deal that was cut nearly two years agoBack then Murray and Rep Paul Ryan RWis then the House Budget Committee chairman successfully put together a package providing 63 billion in sequestration relief over a twoyear period divided equally between defense and nondefense accounts Democrats agreed to the deal because it helped rescue some of their domestic priorities Republicans signed off in part because an extra 20 billionplus in savings was set aside for deficit reduction and the deal also extended a cut to Medicare providers that was part of the initial sequestrationAn aide to Murray who no longer chairs the Senate Budget Committee said she would support a deal similar to the last one both in scope and length Though he has moved on to chair the House Ways and Means Committee Ryan said that he too would be comfortable with a second agreement
