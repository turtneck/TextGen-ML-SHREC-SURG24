Seven years ago in the Czech capital of Prague Barack Obama delivered his first major foreign policy speech as president To rapturous applause he laid out his vision for the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons It earned him that years Nobel peace prizeOn Friday he will bookend his two terms in office with another appeal for nuclear disarmament this time during a historic trip to Hiroshima No other sitting US president has ever visited the Japanese city that was razed to the ground by a single atomic bomb in the final days of the second world warAn estimated 140000 people almost all of them civilians perished instantly in the vast inferno or died within a few months from severe burns blast injuries or radiation sickness Many more succumbed years later to cancers and other radiationrelated illnessesThe president will make no apology on behalf of his nation for this horrific attack That he has made clear But most of the remaining survivors known as hibakusha have not demanded one Their focus instead is on the future  how to realise the oftcited longelusive goal of a nuclear weaponfree world lest anyone else ever suffer as they haveMany hibakusha have been dismayed by the presidents dismal record on disarmament Setsuko Thurlow who was 13 years old when the building she was in collapsed around her from the atomic blast wrote in the New York Daily News last week We are frustrated by Obamas eloquent propensity to say one thing and do anotherUnder the Obama presidency contrary to perceptions the pace of nuclear warhead dismantlement has slowed not hastened Indeed the two presidents Bush and Bill Clinton each made greater gains in downsizing the colossal US nuclear stockpile amassed during the cold warBut more alarming than this failure to destroy old nuclear weapons has been the Obama administrations aggressive pursuit of new smaller ones for which the threshold of use would be lower according to former military commandersAt great expense the president has bolstered all three components of the nations nuclear triad the strategic bombers intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarinelaunched missiles This was the price paid for securing Republican support in 2010 for the ratification of a modest bilateral arms reduction treaty with RussiaObamas muchpublicised nuclear security summits largely ignored the greatest source of nuclear insecurity in the world today 15000 nuclear weapons including 1800 on hairtrigger alert Instead they focused on measures to keep vulnerable nuclear material out of terrorists hands  a vital endeavour certainly but for all the fanfare the results were smallNow the United States is stridently resisting diplomatic moves by twothirds of the worlds nations to declare nuclear weapons illegal It boycotted UN talks in Geneva this month aimed at setting the stage for negotiations on a prohibition treaty But it cannot veto this initiative just as it could not veto the processes that led to bans on landmines in 1997 and cluster munitions in 2008While a prohibition on nuclear weapons will not result in disarmament overnight it will powerfully challenge the notion that these weapons are acceptable for some nations It will place them on the same legal footing as both other types of weapons of mass destruction  namely chemical and biological weaponsIn Geneva Australia spoke neither for nor against a ban Under the caretaker government it was compelled to remain silent on matters for which there is no bipartisan agreement The Coalition government has fervently opposed the ban the bomb movement arguing that the socalled US nuclear umbrella guarantees Australias security and prosperityLabor by contrast has declared its firm support for the negotiation of a global treaty banning nuclear weapons welcoming the growing global movement of nations that is supporting this objective This was an important addition to its revised national platform in 2015Its new policy no doubt will prove unpopular with our powerful ally  whoever may serve as the next commanderinchief  but it is in harmony with the policies of our nearest neighbours from whom we have grown increasingly isolated on this issue in recent years Among the most outspoken proponents of a ban are New Zealand Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines and ThailandAustralia should look to these and other nuclearfree nations in our region and beyond for guidance on disarmament matters  not to a nation bristling with 7000 nuclear weapons The US will not alas lead the way to a world without these horrible weapons Even under one of its most progressive presidents it has failed abysmally to do soThe promise of Prague was broken Let us not get caught up in the hope and hype of Hiroshima To succeed in eliminating nuclear weapons we must begin by stigmatising and prohibiting such weapons The US will not support us in this endeavour But the overwhelming majority of nations will We must stand firmly on the right side of historyThe problem is not North Korea or Russia or China or whoever else we may perceive as the enemy The problem is the weapons these and others possess and threaten to use every day through the doctrine of deterrence They are inherently indiscriminate inhumane and immoral weapons Soon too they will be illegal Australia must stop defending them simply out of deference to its ally
