The second presidential debate  bloody muddy and raucous  was just enough to save Donald Trumps campaign from extinction but not enough to restore his chances of winning barring an act of God a medical calamity or of Putin a cosmically incriminating WikiLeakThat Trump crashed because of a sextalk tape is odd It should have been a surprise to no one His views on women have been on open display for years And hed offered a dazzling array of other reasons for disqualification habitual mendacity pathological narcissism profound ignorance and an astonishing dearth of basic human empathyTo which list Trump added in the second debate and it had nothing to do with sex It was his threat if elected to put Hillary Clinton in jailAfter appointing a special prosecutor of course The niceties must be observed First a fair trial then a proper hanging The day after the debate at a rally in Pennsylvania Trump responded to chants of lock her up with Lock her up is right Two days later he told a rally in Lakeland Fla She has to go to jailFareed Zakaria The GOP is history What about the country Such incendiary talk is an affront to elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse In democracies the electoral process is a subtle and elaborate substitute for combat the ageold way of settling struggles for power But that sublimation only works if there is mutual agreement to accept both the legitimacy of the result which Trump keeps undermining with charges that the very process is rigged and the boundaries of the contestThe prize for the winner is temporary accession to limited political power not the satisfaction of vendettas Vladimir Putin Hugo Chvez and a cavalcade of twobit caudillos lock up their opponents American leaders dontOne doesnt even talk like this It takes decades centuries to develop ingrained norms of political restraint and selfcontrol But they can be undone in short order by a demagogue feeding a vengeful populismThis is not to say that the investigation into the Clinton emails was not itself compromised by politics FBI Director James B Comeys recommendation not to pursue charges was both troubling and puzzling And Barack Obama very improperly tilted the scales by interjecting while the investigation was still underway that Clintons emails had not endangered national securityBut the answer is not to start a new process whose outcome is preordained Conservatives have relentlessly and correctly criticized this administration for abusing its power and suborning the civil administration eg the IRS Is the Republican response to do the sameWasnt presidential overreach one of the major charges against Obama by the antiestablishment GOP candidates Wasnt the animating spirit of the entire tea party movement the restoration of constitutional limits and restraintsIn America we dont persecute political opponents Which is why we retroactively honor Gerald Ford for his pardon of Richard Nixon for which at the time Ford was widely reviled It ultimately cost him the presidency Nixon might well have been convicted But Ford understood that jailing a president for actions carried out in the context of his official duties would threaten the very civil nature of democratic governanceMichael Gerson Donald Trump is right The GOP is utterly patheticWhat makes Trumps promise to lock her up all the more alarming is that its not an isolated incident This is not the first time hes insinuated using the powers of the presidency against political enemies He has threatened Amazons Jeffrey P Bezos owner of The Post for using the newspaper as a tool for political power against me and other people  We cant let him get away with itTrump has gone after others with equal subtlety I hear he tweeted the Rickets sic family who own the Chicago Cubs are secretly spending s against me They better be careful they have a lot to hide And after National Review editor Rich Lowry made a particularly cutting remark about him on Fox News Trump tweeted He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine himTrump also promises to open up libel laws to permit easier prosecution of those who attack him unfairly Has he ever conceded any attack on him to be fairThis election is not just about placing the nuclear codes in Trumps hands Its also about handing him the instruments of civilian coercion such as the IRS the FBI the FCC the SEC Think of what he could do to enforce the fairness he demands Imagine giving over the vast power of the modern state to a man who says in advance that he will punish his critics and jail his opponentRead more from Charles Krauthammers archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
