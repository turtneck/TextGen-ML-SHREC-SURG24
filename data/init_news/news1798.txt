Under new overtime rules employees will be injured as wellThe Labor Departments change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees According to NFIB research approximately 44 of small businesses would be affected The department claims that 42 million workers could potentially benefit from the change Thats not consistent with the departments own analysisIn fact buried within the regulation the department projects that many workers wont receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay According to Labor 60 of the newly eligible employees dont work overtime right now The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017 The talking points say this is a raise for workers but the economic analysis says something completely differentMost small businesses have razorthin margins and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers Moreover the median personal income for small business owners is roughly 68000 annually according to NFIB research Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country Those arent options for most small firmsEmployees will be injured as well Managers who havent punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call Essentially theyll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobsThe overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns Government regulations consistently rank at the topEvery minute that business owners must devote to keeping records filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they dont have to run their businesses Every dollar it costs to comply with all of those rules is a dollar they cannot reinvest in new jobs better equipment or customer serviceJuanita Duggan is president and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business
