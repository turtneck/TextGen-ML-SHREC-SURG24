Ive been living in South East Asia for almost a decade now and over that time Ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so Like most people who come here I set off thinking I was going to live in paradise Thats far from the reality let me tell youLiving in South East Asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else While I myself have decided to return west for a while Ill always have a connection to Asia and Im sure Ill be back many times throughout my lifeSo whats the REAL story with living in Asia Is it all its cracked up to be What does a man have to be aware of when coming here Lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in South East Asia and assess them in the light of reality1 Asian Women Are Kind Gentle And Compliant To Their Husbands So sweet Not so fastThis is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakeningIts definitely true that Asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional They give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely dutiesHowever the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense Theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs 90 pounds if you disrespect herThe idea that Asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to Western women is also nonsense While its not the norm Ive met several Western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their Asian wives and girlfriends When you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizenAsian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go Theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among themRead this guide to dating Asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue Its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it2 Asia Is Ridiculously Cheap This is one Id have to lean slightly towards agreeing withMost things in Asia are a lot cheaper Eating out for my entire family often costs less than 15 meaning I can afford to do it basically every day My rent for a condo apartment costs less than 150 a month although thats mostly because I live in the sticks and am not in a major cityA general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like Bangkok Singapore and KL you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimateNote this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price It certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governmentsAsia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same Life in South East Asia CAN be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle3 You Can Become A Citizen Of An Asian Country And Stay Forever Becoming a citizen in an Asian country is nigh on impossible Even if you could you probably wouldnt want toYou can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank However youll not become a CITIZEN with all of the various rights they enjoyIts also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them Even if you live here for 30 years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals This has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the groupYoull get undue respect from some for being a Westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter4 The Weather In Asia Is 247 Sunshine The weather in South East Asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that typeThe sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the cityHowever when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside The rainfall and wind in many countries in South East Asia is truly terrifying Just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the Philippines and youll see what its likeThankfully after 15 years of living in the Philippines  Ive never been caught directly in a major storm although Ive seen the tail end of plenty of themThe weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad Check this clip out to see how bad it can get5 Asia Is 100 Years Behind The West In Terms Of Development This is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go toTrue countries like Laos and Bangladesh are miles behind any Western nation but head to Singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and developmentAsia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country It wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the West although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for nowTheres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees Asian countries will catch up to and surpass the West quickly Leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is India where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobileIf you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale I salute you but I have to laugh There are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce themOn the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities6 Asians Are Extremely Family Oriented Again this is one I lean towards agreeing with There are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in Asia especially countries like the PhilippinesI dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is Its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case 90 of the Asian people I have ever met and gotten to know from Indonesia to the Philippines to Thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most Western countriesI pass no judgment on this whatsoever It can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective I personally like it and think its something weve lost in many European countries and America tooThis is an idea about Asia I agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an Asian woman be prepared for thisThe family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most Asian countriesLiving In Asia Summary Sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in South East AsiaWhat you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which I do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes storyI came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade However Ive decided that time is now over and its time to go homeId love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in Asia Do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different viewRead More Why Western Men Prefer Foreign Women Over Their Own
