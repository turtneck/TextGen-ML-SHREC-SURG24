EXCLUSIVE A World Food Program initiative that handed out hundreds of millions of dollars of food vouchers has been confronted with persistent diversion and sale of the vouchers to middlemen for cash by the growing flood of Syrian refugees in neighboring Jordan and Lebanon according to its internal auditorsOne reason for the diversion the agency did not have systems in place to identify valid recipients and its procedures were not detailed enough to provide assurance that voucher transfers reached the correct beneficiaries in the correct amount the auditors have saidThe full extent of the desperation voucher sales was not made clear in the most recent audit document obtained by Fox News which covered WFP operations from July 2013 to March 2014During the audited period however spending on the Jordan and Lebanon voucher programs amounted to more than 230 million in 2013 alone nearly threefourths of the 317 million that WFP spent that year on vouchers across the entire region affected by the Syrian conflictA WFP spokesman declaring that the agency has taken steps to meet the problem indicated to Fox News that the cashouts were continuing at a reduced rateThe voucher issue is only one of a host of challenges that cloud the WFP relief effort in Syria and neighboring countries One of the most glaring is that much of the Syrian food distribution is in the hands of charities and nongovernment organizations picked by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent which is considered by many critics to be too close to the Assad regime and WFP was not involved in the assessment or selection of these charities according to the agencys auditorsNor could WFP check consistently on how well those agencies were reporting in all according to the recent internal audit less than 40 percent of its distribution sites were visited in 2014 by WFP or what auditors called a thirdparty facilitator who went where WFP staffers couldntMoreover that facilitator was not required to report on the results in the same way that WFP staffers do including an assessment of the impact of WFP programs meaning how well they actually workedCLICK HERE FOR THE AUDIT REPORTBeyond all that is the brutal reality of Syrias ongoing war as WFP spokesman told Fox News in response to questions about the food delivery audit insecurity and access continue to be WFPs greatest challenge inside SyriaA big part of the problem is that the agency is still being handcuffed by the Assad regime in getting aid to hundreds of thousands of desperate people across the countryThe WFP spokesman cited a report by UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon which noted that between December 2014 and the end of February 2015 719000 people have been denied access to UN relief convoys or are waiting for approval by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic at the national and governorate levelsThe same report also noted that relief had managed to reach about 158000 people during that periodroughly 18 percent of the total mentionedThe fact that huge problems have arisen in making sure food relief gets to the suffering as planned are not exactly surprising in a relief operation as massive chaotic and dangerous as the one that the war is continuing to generateThe UN overall has appealed for some 84 billion to cover the relief effort this year for Syria and its neighborsroughly the size of the annual UN peacekeeping budgeteven as the brutal civil war continues calamity and additional waves of refugeesOverall some 122 million people are currently said by the UN to need humanitarian assistance with 76 million of them Syrian internal refugees and the remainder now living in surrounding countriesAt the same time donor fatigue may be setting in after the 84 billion appeal the UN claimed that some 38 billion in pledges had been received However the UNmanaged Financial Tracking Service FTS notes that so far only some 15 billion has been receivedSpecifically for its Syria response plan this year WFP has so far received about 137 million according to FTSless than 20 percent of its 714 million announced requirementsThe huge size of the required effort also calls for extra caution in dealing with the highrisk problems the WFP auditors have uncovered For its part a WFP spokesman told Fox News that many of the issues detailed in the recent audit were under controlalthough how much was still not exactly clearWhen it came to checking on distribution efforts by charities it had not selected the spokesman saidWFP continues to as much as possible monitor distributions organized by all its partners throughout the countrya sizeable caveatAt the same time that the spokesman acknowledged that the Syrian Arab Red Cross or SARC collaborates with other charities outside WFPs ambit to support food distributions he added that the Syrian organization provides detailed reports to WFP on the activities of the charities it works withThe extent to which WFP can crosscheck those reports however is part of the problem the auditors were noting The spokesman also said that in 2014 WFP had carried out 76 percent of its planned 1760 monitoring visits in 2014 in a very unpredictable and volatile context a significantly higher number than the auditors indicatedThe spokesman added however that much of this significant achievement was the result of the thirdparty monitors that auditors had said used different and less discriminating measures of the actual achievements of the aid deliveriesThis year the spokesman said WFP is further enhancing its monitoring capacity by adding more WFP field monitorsand also more of the thirdparty monitors that auditors had criticizedLikewise the spokesman said WFP voucher programs had been overhauled The agency he said had purged an electronic voucher system in Lebanon deactivating those deemed invalid and declared that encashment trends are decreasing in both Lebanon and Jordanwithout specifying by how muchHe also did not answer a Fox News question asking how many people in Lebanon had received such electronic cards overallThe spokesman also underlined one of WFPs bigger new achievements the launching of a school feeding program in Syria that he said currently reaches almost 112000 children along with 75500 young children who get specialized nutrition supportTo put that in perspective however the UNs 2015 Strategic Response Plan for Syria declares that more than 56 million children are in need of some kind of assistance about 25 million children under age 5 need food aid and some 370000 need special nutritional helpGeorge
