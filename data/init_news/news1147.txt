and the Battle for the Great Society  The opinions expressed in this commentary are hisCNN What could possibly motivate a Republican to formally endorse Donald Trump and join his raucous brigade With each primary and caucus victory the pressure for prominent Republicans to take a stand on his candidacy greatly intensifies But taking this step is not easyAnnouncing that you will back Donald Trump is to enter into an alliance with a person who is controversial explosive and who can often get extremely nasty on the campaign trailThis is someone who has repeatedly said things that offend women Latinos and Muslims who was slow to disavow white supremacist support and who has chosen to stoke rather than calm flareups of violence at his ralliesThis week he predicted riots should he fail to be given the GOP nomination even if he lacks the required delegate total And even if a politician is willing to be associated with the incendiary things Trump has already said it is impossible to know what he will do next and that can be frightening for anyone in the political arenaAs New Jersey Gov Chris Christie learned last week you might even find yourself humiliated by Trump after you take the risky step of supporting and going out to campaign for himThus far Trump has received a few highprofile endorsements including those of Christie Sarah Palin Sen Jeff Sessions Ben Carson Jerry Falwell and at a much lower level Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi This is still a pretty limited list for someone as far ahead as TrumpSo why would any other Republicans decide to take this step The question is becoming much more important with each week As Trump closes in on the delegates that he needs to secure the nomination in this threeperson race though it is not clear he will reach the required majority he will be pressing harder to secure more endorsements so that he can avoid a brokered convention in ClevelandObtaining a job in a Trump administration will be a major motivating factor for many Republicans As the possibility of a Trump presidency becomes more real a larger number of Republicans will make the calculation that if they want to be part of his administration they will need to get off the fence sooner rather than laterTrump is the kind of person who punishes anyone who stands in his wayThose officials who come out in the next few weeks and play a role in helping him win some of the bigger states that loom ahead are hoping to be in a good position to be part of the White House should Trump manage to win the electionLoyalty to party is a powerful force in our current era of polarized politicsWhile the primary season is about deciding what kind of person you want to represent your party the general election is about making sure that your party has power Gradually the path forward for Trumps opponents is becoming less clear If Trump demonstrates the potential to build a diverse electoral coalition that can defeat Hillary Clinton this will be enough for some Republicans to line up behind himAs Ben Carson explained when he announced his support I didnt see a path for Kasich who I likeor for Rubio who I like As far as Cruz is concerned I dont think hes gonna be able to draw independents and Democrats unless he has some kind of miraculous changeThese Republicans will separate their support for the campaign from the manGiven that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic candidate the intense feelings that she elicits within the GOP will be enough to move some Republicans into Donald Trumps camp There will be the moment perhaps in the near future when Republican turn their attention to the competition against the Democrats rather than among themselvesIf the antiTrump coalition headed by Mitt Romney does not show any signs of strength some Republicans may decide that it is time to heal the divisions in the party by accepting Trump to maximize their chances in the fallAs Trump looks more and more like a winner in the party contest there will be Republicans who actually like the candidate or at minimum are excited about what he can offer in the electoral arena who will finally step forwardThere might be a tipping point where this insurgency becomes legitimate becoming less of a political circus than an actual competition Once this happens this will be a key moment for Trump to start securing a huge number of endorsements as more candidates are willing to stand up for a candidacy that once may have seemed too dangerousNor will Republicans necessarily be worried about the risk of endorsing Trump only to have a brokered convention select a different candidate this summerIf the nomination is decided at the convention Cruz or Kasich  or anyone else who enters the competition  will need the support of everyone who backed Trump and have reason to court their voteThe final factor that can move Republicans into the Trump camp will be animosity toward his opponents particularly Ted Cruz Though he is trying to position himself as the new establishment choice Cruz has been as much if not more of an insurgent to the party than TrumpHe is also a politician who has personally burned many bridges with fellow party members in the Senate and the campaign If Kasich no longer looks like a viable choice for a brokered convention some Republicans might support Trump as a way to pay back their anger toward CruzTaking the step of standing on the podium with Donald Trump will not be easyEvery politician realizes the high costs that can come with this particularly since the outcome of the fight might not be totally settled until the summerFor many Republicans this will come down to balancing political and selfinterest with the difficulty of supporting a candidate who is genuinely distasteful to them and who risks bringing them embarrassment and anger from people they respect But as Trump looks like the only real game in town well see more Republicans deciding that this is a risk worth taking
