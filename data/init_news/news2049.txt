A former military intelligence officer claimed Tuesday that the White House was delaying the announcement of its decision to file desertion charges against Sgt Bowe Bergdahl who was released by Talibanaligned militants last year in exchange for five Guantanamo prisonersIn defending claims he originally made Monday on The OReilly Factor that Bergdahl would be charged retired Lt Col Tony Shaffer told Bill OReilly that there was no doubt the White House was dragging out its decisionHis original accusation had resulted in a strong denial from the Pentagon earlier in the dayThey said theres no time limit on this decision Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm John Kirby even said theres no pressure  Of course the moment you say that theres pressure said Shaffer who works at the London Center for Policy Research What they didnt say was more compelling than their denialShaffer who believes the White Houses alleged decision to delay its announcement is politically motivated added that he stands by all of those facts referring to his report on Monday that Bergdahls lawyer has been given a statement of chargesKirby meanwhile on Wednesday stood by his claim that no charges have been filed Asked whether there was political pressure to delay the charges he said that is the most ludicrous claim Ive heard in the last few daysMaj Gen Ronald F Lewis the Armys chief of public affairs put out a statement Tuesday afternoon calling the reports including a similar one by NBC News patently falseTo be clear there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt Bergdahl investigation he said The investigation is still with the commanding general of US Army Forces Command who will determine appropriate action  which ranges from no further action to convening a court martialKirby earlier said Bergdahl has not been charged and no charges have been referred No decision has been made with respect to the case of Sgt Bergdahl none he said And there is no timeline to make that decision He said he would not speculate about what might happen in the futureEugene Fidell Bergdahls lawyer did not comment when reached by Fox News earlier TuesdayShaffer said Monday that Bergdahls attorney has been given a charge sheet outlining the section of the military justice code Bergdahl allegedly violatedAs a corporate entity the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation Shaffer saidShaffer said theres a huge battle going on inside the Obama administration as some try to suppress this development This is shaping up to be a titanic struggle behind the scenes he saidShaffer said the Army wants to do the right thing but the White House wants this to go awayHe said The White House because of the political narrative President Obama cozying up to the parents and because of he President Obama releasing the five Taliban  The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come outBergdahl was held for five years before his release was secured in 2014But while the president joined with Bergdahls parents in the Rose Garden at the time in celebrating his return home the prisoner swap swiftly became a matter of severe controversy Fellow soldiers accused Bergdahl of deserting his post on a base in Afghanistan in 2009 And the trade itself of his freedom for five Guantanamo prisoners drew criticism in Congress from lawmakers who said it sent a troubling signalOn Monday former diplomat Richard Grenell claimed the administration has sent the message that the US will negotiate on such matters He cited an alleged offer made around the same time as Bergdahls release by the Qatari government to trade two Americans held in Qatar for an Al Qaeda agent held in a US federal prison The Obama administration denies there was any deal Those prisoners were ultimately released over the past two months
