Washington CNN President Barack Obama announced Thursday that US forces will remain in Afghanistan at their current levels throughout much of 2016 yet another delay in their scheduled withdrawal and an acknowledgment that Americas longest war wont be concluded on his watchObama campaigned as the president who would end two wars and Thursdays decision was a major political reversal that jeopardizes a cornerstone of his legacy Taliban gains in Afghanistan and appeals from Kabul for ongoing US assistance contributed to postponing the troop withdrawal and underscored Obamas continuing difficulty in fulfilling his intention to remove all American forces by the time he leaves officeOn Thursday however he told reporters at the White House that he wasnt disappointed at having to make the announcement that plans for the withdrawal had been put on hold Instead he said his job was to make necessary adjustments given events on the groundHe also stressed that the formal combat mission there has ended and that he is a president who does not support the idea of endless war He ended the Iraq war and removed American troops there in 2011The plan announced Thursday keeps 9800 US troops in Afghanistan before an anticipated drawdown to around 5500 by the time Obama leaves office The troops mission will remain the same Obama emphasized  to train and support Afghan security forces and carry out counterterrorism operationsObama began his announcement by highlighting US gains in Afghanistan and noted that the Afghan government and its security forces are now fully responsible for securing their country But he also said that the US still needs to bolster those forces to maintain the progress achieved and because its the right thing to doWhile Americas combat mission in Afghanistan may be over our commitment to Afghanistan and and its people endures Obama said from the Roosevelt Room As commander in chief I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation againObama stressed that the decision to maintain 9800 troops in Afghanistan until late 2016 came after months of discussions with Afghanistans president Ashraf Ghani and the nations chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah  a nod to the fact that the US is maintaining a presence in the country with the support of its leaders unlike in Iraq where the Obama administration could not reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on leaving a residual military forceThe decision to maintain the current level of the United States forces in Afghanistan once again shows renewal of the partnership and strengthening of relations of the United States with Afghanistan on the basis of common interests and risks he saidNATO also welcomed the move saying in a statement that it paves the way for a sustained presence in Afghanistan for the organization and its alliesObama also noted that he had consulted with US military commanders on the ground in Afghanistan as well as his entire national security team before deciding to maintain the current troop levelWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest later told reporters that Obama chose to go with the Pentagons greatest suggested number of troopsThe highest recommendation that came into the President was the level that the President announced today he saidDefense Secretary Ashton Carter said in a news conference Thursday that while the fight in Afghanistan remains a difficult fight the adjusted force numbers will ensure that the US can carry out its mission and help Afghans confront the continued challenge posed by the TalibanTodays decision from the president to adjust our troop presence in Afghanistan honors that sacrifice of US troops and gives us a chance to finish what we started Carter said at the PentagonThe decision comes on the heels of recent Taliban gains in Afghanistan notably the militant groups takeover of Kunduz the first major city to fall to Taliban hands since 2001 Two weeks later the Taliban pulled out of the city  but the incident sent ripples through Afghanistan and shook WashingtonObama noted as much when he said that while Afghan forces are taking the lead and fighting bravely and tenaciously those forces are still not as strong as they need to beThe US plan is to now maintain 5500 US military personnel in Afghanistan after a drawdown set to take place in late 2016 or early 2017 more than five times the number of troops previously set to remain in the country at the start of 2017 Only about 1000 troops had previously been set to remain in Afghanistan at the US Embassy in KabulObama said the 5500 troops postdrawdown would be based at the US embassy and at military bases in Baghram Jalalabad and KandaharCarter said the Pentagon viewed that figure as enough to sustain the US mission and accomplish the twopronged goal of assisting the Afghan security forces and carrying out counterterror missionsThough the decision clearly was a break from the game plan he had laid out and pitched to the American public on Thursday he downplayed any suggestion that the delay in the withdrawal was a major setbackObama said the decision was not disappointing and said his mission has consistently been to assess the situation on the ground and make adjustments as necessaryThis is not the first time those adjustments have been made Obama said This wont probably be the lastWhile Obama highlighted the sacrifices of the Afghan people and American forces who have circulated in and out of the wartorn country for more than 14 years of US operations Obama stressed that casualties are down overall and that US troops will not be heading back into combatThe nature of the mission has not changed and the cessation of our combat role has not changed Obama saidStill speaking to the American service members who will need to deploy to Afghanistan he said I do not send you into harms way lightlyThis is the second drawdown delay announced by Obama this year In March Obama said he planned to reduce US forces in Afghanistan 5500 US military personnel by the end of this year and then to an embassyonly presence by the end of 2016The timeline for a withdrawal down to a embassy center presence a normalization of our presence in Afghanistan remains the end of 2016 Obama said in a joint press conference with Ghani last MarchAdministration officials stressed US military personnel in Afghanistan would continue to serve under two missions  to root out remnants of al Qaeda as well as train and equip Afghan security forces US forces could also conduct counterterrorism operations against elements of ISIS in Afghanistan should the group present a threat to the US homeland senior administration officials addedThe original White House goal was to hand over the counterterrorism side of the US mission to Afghan security forces this yearIts in our interest to build up the Afghan security forces said a senior administration officialThe estimated annual cost of maintaining current US force levels in Afghanistan is 146 billion a separate senior administration official saidObama had previously vowed to conclude the US commitment in Afghanistan before he leaving officeWe will bring Americas longest war to a responsible end Obama said at a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2014Retired Lt Col Rick Francona a CNN military analyst and former intelligence officer said Obamas decision is simply kicking this can down the road for the next president Obama will be out of office by the time troops are set to be drawn down againThis is this administration pushing this off to the next administration because the next time they have to make this decision it will be a different president in the White House Francona saidRepublicans who have been seeking higher US troop commitments gave a lukewarm response to Obamas announcement ThursdayWhile this new plan avoids a disaster it is certainly not a plan for success House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry said in a statement Given the troubling conditions on the ground in Afghanistan and the other security problems in the region keeping 9800 troops there through at least 2016 is necessary to our security interests
