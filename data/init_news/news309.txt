Republican Rep Kevin McCarthy stunned Washington with another development in the race for speaker of the House  the frontrunner announcedThursdaythat he was dropping out  names of new candidates began circulatingInevitably the chatter quickly reached Rep Paul Ryan R of Wisconsin  former vice presidential candidate chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee and budget hawk who many members believe is the person most capable of uniting the deeply divided and turbulent House Republican conferenceBut Chairman Ryan promptly put down this second attempt to draft him As his Texan GOP colleague Rep Blake Farenthold tweetedCan you blame him The speakership is one of the toughest jobs in Washington  especially this speakership which is tasked with trying to end or contain a Republican civil war in the chamberIts going to take a lot of gumption and a lot of finesse and talent to bridge the gap So yeah its a difficult chore that very few people are willing to take on Rep Harold Rogers R of Kentucky told a scrum of reportersThursdayafternoonJust hours earlier majority leader McCarthy an affable Californian known for his listening skills and outreach capitulated in the face of revolt from the hardline House Freedom Caucus Its 40 or so members were set to vote against him in secret ballotingHis unscripted comments about the political nature of the Benghazi special committee which is callingDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to testify later this month also played a role in his decision he said McCarthy was attacked from all sides for that comment from Democrats Republicans and the media when he was tagged as a future speaker who cant speakMcCarthy was likely to survive the hardliner defectionThursday and win the majority support from his GOP conference needed to nominate him for the speakership But it was not at all clear that he could win the 218 votes needed to elect the speaker on the House floor later this monthStanding before cameras in the brightly lit marbled lobby of the Longworth House Office Buildinghis wife beside him the leader capitulated Weneed a new face If were going to be strong we gotta be 100 percent united he

crying at the newsWho knows whatll happen People are crying they dont have any idea how this will unfold at all Rep Peter King R of New York told the PostWhat most people see of the speakership is what shows up on television But the job carries awesome responsibility second in line to the presidency manager of the Capitol complex presiding officer of the House And thats the easy partThen theres the role of chief messenger of your party shaping the agenda and trying to keep your members in line every day to cross the 218vote threshold  the number of votes it takes to pass a bill in the 435member body And dont forget incessant fundraising which takes up most weekends Oh and negotiating with the White House and SenateThen add the hell no caucus of 40 to 50 rightwingers to this mixThe hardliners drove Speaker John Boehner R of Ohio to announce his early retirement forOct 30 In light of the decision of his No 2 to withdraw Speaker Boehner says he will stay on until the House votes to elect a new speaker McCarthy says he is willing to stay on as leader No date has been set for another leadershipelectionSome Republicans want Boehner to finish out his term as a congressman and speakerIts a very difficult job and having someone like John Boehner there who has a lot of experience and has the courage to do whats right  is a good thing says Rep Carlos Curbelo R of FloridaCongressman Curbelo who describes the speakership as more difficult than being the president says he doesnt see any candidate from either party able to get 218 votesThat hasnt stopped new names from being floated even while the other two candidates  Rep Daniel Webster of Florida backed by the Freedom Caucus and Rep Jason Chaffetz of Utah the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee  kept their hats in the ringRightwingers were pleased to see McCarthy drop out They see him as Boehner 20In a statement the Freedom Caucus said it respects his decision to put the conference ahead of himself and said the next speaker needs to yield back power to the membershipThe Republican caucus is going through a period of transition says John Feehery former spokesman to Dennis Hastert R of Illinois the longest serving Republican speaker McCarthy represented a new generation of leaders in the Housewhere nearly half of the members have served four years or lessTheyre going to have to chart their own course and theyre going to have to figure out how the House works together and theyre going to make mistakes he saysThats one way to learn
