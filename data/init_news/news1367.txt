But then the sobering realization sets in these are elected members of perhaps most prestigious governing body in the worldLet this sink in for a moment each of these dolts is chosen by voters to be one of 535 elites who are tasked with authoring and voting on legislation that impacts the entire country and beyond Think about that Louie Gohmert who once said the wall of separation between church and state is a one way wall whatever the hell that means gets to vote on laws that could potentially and irreversibly alter the course of your lifeOur only possible defense against being utterly confounded and horrified by the power granted to men and women who have no business wielding such power is to laugh at their flaming stupidity Otherwise itd be way too easy lapse into inextricable despair and in some cases moroninduced alcoholismIn spite of the rapid dumbingdown of the GOP see also Mr Trump they continue to churn out more dummiesEnter Kevin McCarthy The Bakersfield California Republican is the most likely conservative whiteguy to ascend into John Boehners post as Speaker of the House And he shouldnthave beenallowed anywhere near Congress much less a leadership postBy now were all aware of McCarthys admission that the congressional select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is almost exclusively designed to undermine Hillary Clintons presidential aspirationsThey say gaffes are merely the truths spoken out loud This was certainly the case with McCarthy By the way we should underscore at this point how McCarthy isnt just another ambitious member of Congress Hes the House Majority Leader So yes the House Majority Leader accidentally spilled the beans on one of the longest running scams in congressional history  one of the biggest wastes of taxpayer money since Ken Starrs probe into President Clintons pantspartiesEither McCarthy is incapable of reading or he has the worst speechwriting staff in the history of American politics  and that includes Sarah Palins selfauthored Patriotic Mad Libs Three days after Boehner announced his resignation from Congress McCarthy was propped up for a foreign policy speech before the John Hay Initiative The ostensible goal wasto burnish McCarthys political heft but the exact opposite happened and frankly even the dumbest Republicans ought to be embarrassed to caucus with this idiotHere are some highlightsWar of radical Islam On or against makes more sense of course And shouldnt it be lives and not life Honestly the rest of the quotes will make this passage seem comparatively ShakespeareanTheres no such phrase as stem a flow Theres something called stemflow One can also stem the flow of something which is possibly what he meant But politically strategy is just ridiculousWe have isolated Israel while bolding places like Iran The absence of leadership over the past six years has had a horrific consequences all across the globe Was anyone fired for this How the hell is he still a contender for Speaker In the past few years alone I have visited Poland Hungria Estonia Russia and Georgia Hungria Which is north of Freedonia and adjacent to that fake island where Balki from Perfect Strangers came from It defies belief that the president would allow the ban on Iranian oil exports to be lifted And also stand by while Russia blackmails an entire continent all the while keeping the place of the band on America I have no idea what any of that means Which continent Lets get real here we should amend the Constitution so that when any elected politician mutilates the English language this badly their desk chair turns into an ejectorseat that summarily launches them out of Congress Lets get on this now before its too late We dont have the same as difficult decision that this White House is managing the decline and putting us in tough decisions for the future To be fair gaffes are part of being a public figure Spend enough time in front of a microphone and weird crap will inevitably fall out However a stem a flow of gaffes like this is inexcusable for a leader whos stepping into an office thats two heartbeats away from the presidency Again was it his speechwriter Was he unable to read the prepared remarks Why was he incapable of correcting the remarks onthefly Was he having a stroke Even the party of George W Bush and Sarah Palin should in a sane world stand up and in a unified voice block this nincompoop from becoming Speaker They wont of course and Boehner will likely hand his gavel over to the guy who with a straight face said he visited a place called Hungria The good news on the other hand is that well all have another GOP doofus to kick around for a while Silver linings etc Ever since Karl Rove and the Bush administration systematically altered the political landscape making it perfectly acceptable to be completely incompetent and still get reelected by lowinformation voters who think politicians shouldnt be any smarter than the people who elect them weve mostly settled for idiots Sadly the demystification of the presidency and electoral politics has convinced us that anyone can hold these jobs and that leaders should be just like us Sorry but the guy you might want to have a beer with shouldnt control the nuclear launch codes or the destiny of the free world We should demand leaders who are devastatingly smart engaged disciplined centered and intellectually curious We should be gravitationally drawn to leaders with impeccable schooling and robust speaking skills The salient question is this Why dont Republicans want the same Why are they so willing to settle for feckless trolls like Donald Trump or marblemouthed dilettantes like Kevin McCarthy It might be somewhat acceptable if they actually took responsibility for putting us all in tough decisions for the future but the party of personalresponsibility will never do that And its hurting America
