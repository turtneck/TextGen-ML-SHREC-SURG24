Its called Project X according to the clapperboard seen briefly deep into the footage roughly 15 hours of raw unedited video meant for use in making ads for Ted Cruzs presidential campaign Vast swaths are just Cruz and his wife and their two young daughtersmatching dresses a mustwalking talking smiling laughing fishing eating holding hands riding horses doing puzzles reading stories saying grace Cruz spends some time toting a shotgun around a field and firing it at unseen targets in the skyFilmed the last week of last yearsome three months before Cruz made his candidacy official with a speech at Liberty Universityit was discovered this past summer on YouTube labeled online simply as Cruz TX Footage 01 to 16Clips have been surfacing on TV and the Internet showing odd glimpses of the life of a highly scripted candidate Some of the things in the clips we already know Cruz and his father for instance are gifted talkers What they say on camera is rehearsed and familiar as in nearly verbatim to anybody who has seen their stump speechesBut watch all of it and you learn some things about Ted Cruz that are hard to imagine ever showing up in a campaign ad Despite the stagecraft you encounter a family thats messier than the one youll almost certainly see portrayed as the Cruz campaign enters the thick of the primaries The footage offers an intriguing familial mishmash of single mothers halfsiblings and stepparents bearing burdens of modern Americadepression drinking drugsCruzs wife an executive for Goldman Sachs currently on a leave of absence because of the campaign describes herself as a traditional mom albeit one who cops to not cooking and likens her handling of multimilliondollar investment portfolios to her familys missionary work in AfricaCruzs daughters adore him youre told and yet you learn that they sometimes consider him a guest in their Houston homeIt also becomes clear that the death of Cruzs half sisterand what he then did for her sonis a story he thinks reflects well enough on him that he wants to tell it in all its winceinducing detailCruzs mother is the least willing participant herethe most interesting too in part because she is at times so obviously reluctant to play alongWhy is this available all of it to anyone Evidently shooting video like this and posting it in a public space lets campaigns and their supportive PACs share the content without technically communicating which would be against the rulesWhats great about this footage is the camera keeps rolling people keep talking and Cruz keeps rubbing and rubbing and rubbing his family members shoulders and backs The staged hugs the awkward outtakes the nevertobeprimetime scenes the unrehearsed offscript interactionsthese are the moments that feel the most revealing the most captivating the most authentic Its an unexpected window into the orbit of a candidate who is otherwise disciplined and relentlessly onmessageHere seated on an overstuffed chair is a person youre not expecting a heavyset blueeyed young man wearing a buzz cut a red and white shirt with horizontal stripes and a smattering of tattoos on his arms Does one of them say menace On a matching chair to his left the Princetoneducated Harvardeducated former Supreme Court clerk and current US senator and presidential candidate to whom hes relatedMy name is Joe Maykopet he says to the camera and everybody else Im 29 years old from Philadelphia Pennsylvania and this is my uncle Ted CruzIts unclear what purpose hes supposed to serve in this contextYou know my nephew Joey Cruz says reaching over and placing his hand on Maykopets back is someone who Ive known his entire life I remember holding Joey when he was a newborn babyI was 15 when he was born His mom is my oldest sister Miriam Miriam is nine years older than I am I have two older sisters Miriam and Roxana who are a year apart in age And theyre half sisters Theyre sisters from my fathers first marriageAnd when both of them were little girls our father and their mom divorced Cruz continues And you know kids react differently to divorce They react differently to their parents splitting apart It was very hard on my sister Miriam It was very hard on her She like a lot of kids unfortunately do think she blamed herself as a little girl for her parents not staying togetherCruz doesnt say howbut she died in 2011 in Pennsylvania of an accidental drug overdose It remains unclear at this point in the footage how this information might find its way into a political adUm when Miriam got older um she struggled he says She had a difficult life Miriam had a lot of problems with alcohol abuse and substance abuse pretty much her entire adult life Um she took a lot of pain meds she took a lot ofshe made a lot of bad choicesHe keeps talkingabout how she raised Joey as a single mom how she had problems with the law how she fell in with some pretty unsavory characters how he and his father once went to Philadelphia where she was living in what was basically a crack house leaving behind their rings and watches and wallets to try to help her get back on her feetAll of this unspools uncomfortably as Maykopet sits listening to Cruzs version of his sad challenging upbringing with his late mother at the end of which finally Cruz gets to what appears to be the takeawayThe loan he took out on his credit card to pay for Maykopet to go to boarding schoolAll told Cruz says it was about 20000Maykopet then talks for a while about his life ever sincehe works in a chocolate factorybefore a man behind the camera cuts to the cruxLets wrap it up comes the voice from behind the camera and say I look back and really appreciate the sacrifice my Uncle Ted made when I was younger It really helped me get some discipline and it turned my life around I really appreciate itOK can you say that again Maykopet says working to remember what theyre wanting him to sayOne more hug and were out of here says the cameramanWhat is Daddy doing Why is Daddy in DCOK Im going to say what I really think You guys can decide if you want to use this Heidi Cruz says into the camera with a laughAbout to say something she knows she shouldntyet clearly she has things to say
