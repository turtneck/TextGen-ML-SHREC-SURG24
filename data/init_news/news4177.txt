Veterans Claims PTSD Identification and Compensation By Matt Hill on November 8 2016 Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is a condition thats both underestimated and misunderstood especially when it comes to the Veterans Association PTSD is actually a common condition The Mayo Clinic estimates that more than 3 million Americans are diagnosed with PTSD every year  and that doesnt take into account those individuals who never receive a diagnosis PTSD develops when an individual has witnessed or experienced a traumatic or terrifying event Unsurprisingly its a condition thats particularly prevalent among veterans Although the VA estimates that 1015 of veterans will develop PTSD at some point following their military service its entirely possible these numbers might actually be much higher in reality PTSD is classified as a trauma and stressorrelated disorder According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders the condition is characterized as a repetitive reexperiencing of an extremely traumatic event or stressor usually accompanied by increased arousal nightmares and flashbacks Those who have PTSD often have trouble concentrating remembering and sleeping But a PTSD diagnosis is not always easy to come by The manifestation of the condition is not always straightforward and doesnt appear in the same way from person to person It may take months or even years to develop and symptoms may shift or appear over time To diagnose a case of PTSD physicians will look at specific criteria for symptoms There are four distinct groups of criteria all with different symptoms These groups are Intrusion Symptoms Nightmares intrusive memories or thoughts or psychological and physical reactions to memories of the event Avoidance Symptoms Avoiding situations thoughts or feelings that you associate with the traumatic event Negative Changes in Cognitions and Mood Memory issues negative thoughts about themselves or others severe emotions like shame or sadness lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed or feelings of detachment isolation or disconnection Changes in Arousal and Reactivity An easy startle response or feeling constantly jittery or alert Its easy to see how these symptoms could easily disrupt a persons life and take a significant toll on their mental health as well as their personal and professional life If you or someone you love may be suffering from PTSD its important to seek out help Because PTSD presents itself differently in every patient treatment must be sought and tailormade for each individual Although there is no cure for PTSD treatment has proven to be very effective for the majority of patients Typically this treatment includes psychotherapy  including cognitive and exposure therapy as well as regular appointments with a psychiatrist  and in some cases medication If you are a veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD you may be entitled to receive benefits and compensation from the VA There are many things that you need to know to get the benefits that you deserve and the veterans advocates at Hill  Ponton have published a PTSD guide covering everything regarding a PTSD claim In years past veterans were required to provide evidence of the traumatic event that led to the development of their condition Below are some of the important points in the guide on how to establish service connection and get the proper rating The first thing is to establish a service connection for your PTSD in order to be eligible for benefits The three things the VA requires are Current Diagnosis you must have a current PTSD diagnosis that was given by professionals who the VA has deemed qualified to perform PTSD Compensation and Pension examinations These professionals have doctorallevel training in diagnostic methods clinical interview methods and psychopathology They also need to have a working knowledge of the DSMV and have extensive clinical experience with both the diagnosis and treatment in veterans with PTSD Typically these are boardcertified psychiatrists and licensed psychologists but may also include psychiatric residents and psychology interns as long as theyre under close supervision of an attending professional in the field Essentially if youve received a current PTSD diagnosis from a licensed professional that analysis satisfies this requirement Please note most VA hospitals and clinics employ licensed mental health social workers to treat veterans Their diagnosis of PTSD alone is not enough to meet this requirement InService Stressor This might be the most difficult requirement to satisfy Sometimes trauma is easy to determine but other times proving its occurrence can be challenging There are a lot of different regulations regarding the type of trauma you experienced For example the rules for determining fear of terrorist activity are different from veterans who engaged in combat or sexual trauma Its recommended that you consult with your psychiatrist or psychologist as well as a qualified lawyer to address this requirement Nexus Basically this is the link between the first two requirements Its what connects the traumatic event you experienced with your current diagnosis of PTSD A medical expert is required in order to explain how your symptoms are a direct result of your inservice stressor  which is especially important if you have multiple stressors Its vital you establish that the traumatic event is the definitive link to your diagnosis and cannot be explained by any other events that took place outside of your military service Once these requirements have been satisfied you can then file a claim through the VA If you file a claim youll need to undergo a Compensation and Pension Examination sometimes called a CP Exam to verify your diagnoses assess symptom severity and definitively determine whether your PTSD is directly related to your military service The VA treats the CP exam with a lot of weight and it will determine the amount of compensation you receive When you go to your exam remember to be as honest and as forthcoming as possible You should bring written statements from family or friends that say how your PTSD has impacted your life You should also bring a list of symptoms youve experienced to help you when being questioned during the exam After the exam you will be assigned a disability percentage rate This percentage reflects how severe your condition is and how much the symptoms affect your ability to work and maintain social relationships Depending on the severity of your PTSD you could potentially receive a disability rate of 0 10 30 70 or 100 Overall the compensation you receive will be related to your estimated impairment of working ability Above all its important to demonstrate evidence of occupational impairment due to PTSD Even if your symptoms dont constitute a 100 disability rating you may still be able to receive one through a TDIU which stands for total disability based on individual unemployability A TDIU may be assigned if an individual fails to meet the criteria for 100 disability but is still completely unable to obtain and maintain employment Because the way the VA determines disability percentages can be highly confusing and complex working with a lawyer who specializes in VA claims may be to your benefit The various rules and regulations for determining physical disability can be hard to navigate but mental conditions like PTSD can be even more difficult to prove Thats why having an expert on your side can be vital If you or someone you love may be suffering from PTSD as a result of military service seek out assistance from an attorney who specializes in veterans issues Alternatively if you are dissatisfied with a disability rating you have received and arent receiving the benefits you need there may be other options at your disposal This guest post was written by Matthew Hill from Hill  Ponton PA a veterans
