Reasons to Risk Nuclear Annihilation   latest neoconliberalhawk scheme is for the US population to risk nuclear war to protect corrupt politicians in Ukraine and Al Qaeda terrorists in east Aleppo two rather dubious reasons to end life on the planet says Robert Parry By Robert Parry Obviously I never wanted to see a nuclear war which would likely kill not only me but my children grandchildren relatives friends and billions of others Wed be incinerated in the blast or poisoned by radiation or left to starve in a nuclear winter But at least I always assumed that this horrific possibility would only come into play over something truly worthy assuming that anything would justify the mass extinction of life on the planet Peter Sellers playing Dr Strangelove as he struggles to control his right arm from making a Nazi salute Now however Official Washingtons neocons and liberal interventionists are telling me and others that we should risk nuclear annihilation over which set of thieves gets to rule Ukraine and over helping Al Qaeda terrorists and their moderate allies keep control of east Aleppo in Syria In support of the Ukraine goal there is endless tough talk at the think tanks on the oped pages and in the halls of power about the need to arm the Ukrainian military so it can crush ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine who dared object to the USbacked coup in 2014 that ousted their elected President Viktor Yanukovych And after liberating eastern Ukraine the USbacked Ukrainian army would wheel around and liberate Crimea from Russia even though 96 percent of Crimean voters voted to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia  and there is no sign they want to go back  So the world would be risking World War III over the principle of the Wests right to sponsor the overthrow of elected leaders who dont do what theyre told and then to slaughter people who object to this violation of democratic order This risk of nuclear Armageddon would then be compounded to defend the principle that the people of Crimea dont have the right of selfdetermination but must submit to a corrupt postcoup regime in Kiev regardless of Crimeas democratic judgment And to further maintain our resolve in this gamble over nuclear war in defense of Ukraine we must ignore the spectacle of the USbacked regime in Kiev wallowing in graft and corruption  While the Ukrainian people earn on average 214 a month and face neoliberal reforms such as reduced pensions extended years of work for the elderly and slashed heating subsidies their new leaders in the parliament report wealth averaging more than 1 million in monetary assets each much of it in cash A Troubling Departure The obvious implication of widespread corruption was underscored on Monday with the abrupt resignation of former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili who was the appointed governor of Ukraines Odessa region A scene from Dr Strangelove in which the bomber pilot played by actor Slim Pickens rides a nuclear bomb to its target in the Soviet Union Though Saakashvili faces charges of abusing power back in Georgia he was nevertheless put in charge of Odessa by current President Petro Poroshenko but has now quit or was ousted amid charges and countercharges about corruption Noting the mysterious wealth of Ukraines officials Saakashvili denounced the countrys rulers as corrupt filth and accused Poroshenko and his administration of sabotaging real reform Odessa can only develop once Kiev will be freed from these bribe takers who directly patronize organized crime and lawlessness Saakashvili said  Yes that would be a good slogan to scribble on the side of a nuclear bomb heading for Moscow Defending the corrupt filth and bribe takers who patronize organized crime But the recent fingerpointing about corruption is also ironic because the West cited the alleged corruption of the Yanukovych government to justify the violent putsch in February 2014 that drove him from office and sparked Ukraines current civil war Yet the problems dont stop with Kievs corruption There is the troubling presence of neoNazis  ultranationalists and even Islamic jihadists assigned to the Azov battalion and other military units sent east to the front lines to kill ethnic Russians On top of that United Nations human rights investigators have accused Ukraines SBU intelligence service of hiding torture chambers  But we consumers of the mainstream US medias narrative are supposed to see the putschists as the white hats and Yanukovych who was excoriated for having a sauna in his official residence and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the black hats Though US officials such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland helped organize or midwife the coup ousting Yanukovych we are told that the Ukraine crisis was a clearcut case of Russian aggression and Crimeas decision to secede and rejoin Russia was a Russian invasion and an annexation So all stirred up with righteous indignation we absorbed the explanation that economic sanctions were needed to punish Putin and to destabilize Russian society with the hopedfor goal of another regime change this time in Moscow We werent supposed to ask if anyone had actually thought through the idea of destabilizing a nucleararmed power and the prospect that Putins overthrow even if possible might lead to a highly unstable fight for control of the nuclear codes Silencing Dissent Brushing aside such worries the neoconsliberalhawks are confident that the answer is to move NATO forces up to Russias borders and to provide military training to Ukraines army even to its neoNazi shock troops Nazi symbols on helmets worn by members of Ukraines Azov battalion As filmed by a Norwegian film crew and shown on German TV After all when have the neocons and their liberal interventionist sidekicks ever miscalculated about anything No fair mentioning Iraq Afghanistan Libya or other lucky countries that have been on the receiving end of a benighted regime change An American who protests or even mentions the risk of nuclear war is dismissed as a Kremlin stooge or a Putin puppet or a useful fool repeating Russian disinformation and assisting Moscows information war against the US government But if youre still a bit queasy about risking nuclear annihilation to keep some Ukrainian kleptocrats in power there is the other cause worth having the human race die over protecting Al Qaeda terrorists and their moderate rebel comrades holed up in east Aleppo Since these modern terrorists turn out to be highly skilled with video cameras and the dissemination of propaganda they have created the image for Westerners that the Syrian military and its Russian allies simply want to kill as many children as possible Indeed most Western coverage of the battle for Aleppo whites out the role of Al Qaeda almost completely although occasionally the reality slips through in ontheground reporting  along with the admission that Al Qaeda and its fellow fighters are keeping as many civilians in east Aleppo as possible all the better to put up heartrending videos and photos on social media Of course when a similar situation exists in Islamic Stateheld Mosul Iraq the mainstream Western media dutifully denounces the tactic of keeping children in a war zone as the cynical use of human shields thus justifying Iraqi and US forces killing lots of civilians during their liberation The deaths are all the enemys fault However when the shoe is on the SyrianRussian foot were talking about war crimes and the need to invade Syria to establish safe zones and nofly zones even if that means killing large numbers of additional Syrians and shooting down Russian warplanes After all isnt the protection of Al Qaeda terrorists worth the risk of starting World War III with nucleararmed Russia And if Al Qaeda isnt worth fighting a nuclear war to defend what about the thieves in Ukraine and their neoNazi shock troops Calling Dr
