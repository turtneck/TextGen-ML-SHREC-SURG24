Barack Obamas signature as a speaker is his ability to stay ontopic While most politicians try to cram everything plus a stash of kittens and a stray puppy to boot into their speeches POTUS is known for writing speeches that stray little and focus heavily on the thesis at hand Last night in his speech supporting Hillary Clinton was the last big foreseeable speech of his career Last night of all nights he should have really brought his mighty oratory skills to bearSadly however his speech was a bitmehNot that it was bad mind you Obama hit a lot of high points both shading Clintons opponent Donald Trump and highlighting how progressive and successful the Democratic agenda was an especially important topic with all the illinformed Bernie Sanders deadenders in the audience who were convinced that Clinton is basically a RepublicanBy most political speech standards Obama was a 9 out of 10 But Obama is a better speaker than most Unlike most politicians hes an actual writer  the author of a bestselling memoir  and he understands certain basics about speechifying most politicians dont Keep it short Keep it on topic Dont be digressiveAnd yet for some reason Obama delivered a Bill Clintonesque performance meandering around his own record taking random digs at Donald Trump and hitting applause lines YES WE CAN almost at randomIt was especially confusing in light of his wifes outofthepark performance on Monday night which stuck to his more classic formula of short wellstructured speeches that tell coherent stories Michelle Obama told an easytoremember tale of sacrifice and reward of watching her little girls cash in the hard work by women and people of color to make America truly a land of opportunityIts hard to put a thesis statement into Barack Obamas speech He roamed around hattipping Black Lives Matter and Clintons hard work but one never got the sense from him of Clinton as a friend Michelle Obama sold Clinton that way portraying her as an older woman she had grown close to and come to admire Bill Clinton had done it portraying his wife as she frankly as a human deserves to be seen As a kindhearted woman who loves her child and can set human male hearts aflutterBut to Barack Obama the man who sat with her as they watched their hard work result in the death of the man who inflicted 911 on us No real warmth was detected Its hard for me to imagine going through that with someone and not feeling bound to them How our president a man who is a genius at making the incomprehensible seem downright folksy failed to convey that is a great mystery That said I dont think Obama should pull himself off the trail or feel like a liability to Clinton His comments about how they reconciled postprimary offer an important example to Bernie Sanders holdouts who dont understand the basic facts of politics He is also as much as it pains me to say better at delivering sick burns in the direction of Donald Trump better than any other politician on the planet Trumps impotent smallfingered response already indicates that But that was a crowd that was fully ready to be united and scream its head off at the chance of electing the first female president and for some reason Obama just fell a bit short of the task As he noted in the speech being the leader of the free world is hard work  which is why we should want Clinton in the job  so perhaps he didnt have time to tell a better story Still a shame Most of us wanted to hear the real story of how these two former foes became friends Obama could have told that story in style and made history while he did it His failure to do so is on him But well always have his wife Michelle 2024S se puede
