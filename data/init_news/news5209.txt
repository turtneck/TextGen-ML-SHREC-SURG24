Washington CNN Donald Trump drew a distinction between eligibility questions surrounding Marco Rubios run for the presidency versus those clouding Ted Cruzs bid saying the Florida senator is qualified because although his parents were not US citizens at the time of his birth he was born in the US  unlike CruzIts a different very different thing because he was born here He was born on the land Trump told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the Union Ted was not born on the land and theres a very strict reading that you have to be born on the land Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe actually said based on Teds views he would have to be born on the landCruz was conferred American citizenship at birth because his mother is an American citizen and legal experts have largely agreed that would qualify him for naturalborn citizenship The Texas Republican also had Canadian citizenship until he renounced it in 2014He was born in Canada He was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago if you can believe that Trump saidHe says he didnt know Tapper repliedHe didnt know Well he didnt know about his financial papers either You know how are you going to be president if you didnt know about a million dollar loan from Goldman Sachs Trump asked referring to a controversy that surfaced earlier this week over Cruzs 2012 Senate bid And you said its something you dont know about Now he doesnt know that he was a Canadian citizen I mean thats in a way maybe worse than all the other things were talking aboutThere have been lawsuits filed And I said lawsuits are going to be filed he said The Democrats are going to file lawsuits They filed lawsuits Now hes got a problemTrump also hammered Cruz over his criticism of New York values which the Texas senator said referred to the Empire States support of abortion rights samesex marriage and a focus on money and greed Trump called those remarks very very insultingI immediately thought of the World Trade Center and the bravery of New Yorkers and the genius of New Yorkers to be able to take that whole section and rebuild after the tragedy he saidAsked if Cruz was making a subtle ethnic dig with his New York values comment Trump said he didnt know adding probably you would have to ask himBut Trump said I thought it was disgraceful that he brought that up  I think he came across badly Some people gave him pretty good reviews on the debate I think he came across as very strident and not a nice person and people dont like thatTrump said the only place Cruz is doing fairly well is in IowaI you look at these other places hes not doing well and certainly not doing well nationally Trump addedStill he doesnt want to take any chances which is why hes been spending on ads recentlyIm going to start spending money for two reasons Number one I feel guilty because Im 35 million under budget he said Number two I dont want to take a chanceTrump pointed out that spending millions has not helped former Florida Jeb Bush emerge as a leading candidateJeb is spending so much money Think of it he spent 69 million I spent nothing Hes at the bottom of the pack Im at the top of the pack he saidHe then attacked former presidential candidate Lindsey Graham for endorsing BushI think its incredible First of all Lindsey Graham got out with zero He had zero He had nothing Thats number one so hes not gonna get any voters and I think its a very bad thing for Lindsay Graham Trump saidA lot of people think that was a shameful chapter in American history though Tapper saidWell some people do and some people think it was a very effective chapter and what happened was when they removed some meaning brought them back when they brought them back they removed some everybody else left Trump said And it was very successful everyone said So I mean thats the way it is Look we either have a country or we dont If we dont have strong borders we have a problemTrump said the American political process is in need of campaign finance reform adding that he  a candidate who has repeatedly touted his decision to selffund his campaign as a selling point for his candidacy  hasnt decided if he would accept public financing for the general electionI dont know yet I havent thought of it I am thinking about this one he saidThats the way it is Somebody gives them money Not anything wrong just psychologically when they go to that person theyre going to do that he said They owe them and by the way they may therefore vote negatively towards the country Thats not gonna happen with meThe American political process is in need of campaign finance reform Trump saidWell I think you need it because I think PACs are a horrible thing he said First of all everybody is dealing with their PAC You know its supposed to be like this secret thing  theyre all dealingTrump says he wasnt mocking reporter with disabilityTrump was previously criticized for appearing to mock Serge Kovaleski a New York Times reporter with arthrogryposis a chronic condition which limits the movement of his armsAt a South Carolina rally in November Trump waved his arms in an awkward manner while discussing a comment made by Kovaleski But Trump said he wasnt mocking himIf you could go back and do it again would you do it differently Tapper askedYes I would But let me just tell you something I had no idea what this reporter looked like or that he had difficulty Trump saidTrump told Tapper he would never mock a person with a disabilityI was not imitating I would never  who would ever do that If somebody had a disability who would mock a disability I would never Im a smart person  Who would ever mock somebody especially if youre running for office Trump saidI would have not done it because its confusing he added Some people believe me when I say it I mean I swear to you thats true I had no ideaNo I have a great relationship with God I have a great relationship with evangelicals he saidTrump said he doesnt ask for forgiveness because he doesnt do a lot of bad thingsI dont like to have to ask for forgiveness And I am good I dont do a lot of things that are bad I try and do nothing thats bad I live a very different life than probably a lot of people would think Trump saidTapper asked Trump how it felt to be implicitly criticized by South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley in her Republican response to President Barack Obamas State of the Union address last weekIt was my great honor because Im angry and they both said I was angry And I get along very well with Nikki and you know Nikki said were friends and we are friends I supported her but I am angry Trump said And when she said theres an anger that we shouldnt have I said well I disagree with one thing Theres an anger that we should have Our country is going to hell
