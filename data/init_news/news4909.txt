WASHINGTON  Anyone who wants to understand the current state of the Democratic Party should pay close attention to what happened this week in the House of Representatives where Democrats cut down a GOPbacked Wall Street deregulation bill In response the bills supporters avoided talking about who the legislation would have helped hint two big banks focusing instead on calling its victorious opponents a bunch of flipfloppersThe atmosphere is a little bit different Himes said I think there were 35 Democrats who voted yes On similar legislation in the last Congress that number was more like 75 or so So yes there were some folks who looked at the same thing this Congress and thought that they felt differently about itActually 95 Democrats supported a very similar bill as recently as September Both bills were 11point packages chipping away at the 2010 DoddFrank financial reform law The most serious attack of the bunch came in the form of a partial twoyear delay of the Volcker Rule which would ban banks from speculating in securities markets with taxpayer money The bill would have allowed Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to hold onto almost 50 billion in risky corporate debt packages known as collateralized loan obligations through 2019 Since that perk wasnt included in the September version of the bill the alleged flipfloppers can make a case that this time around things just went too farBut that doesnt seem to be whats really going on among todays Democrats For one thing Democrats approved a previous twoyear delay of the same Volcker Rule provision last spring pushing it to 2017 and dozens of House Democrats spent much of 2013 and 2014 lining up to support bill after bill that dealt blows to the partys secondbiggest policy achievement of the Obama eraThis infuriated financial reform advocates In isolation many of these bills would have meant only minor trouble for DoddFrank Others however were quite serious and collectively they functioned as a repeal strategy that may ultimately prove more effective than the GOPs straightforward assault on Obamacare They never became law because thenSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid DNev didnt bring them up in the Senate but with Republicans now in control of the Senate that firewall is goneThe Democratic domestic policy agenda is remarkably uniform across the caucus with one major exception Nearly every House Democrat supports samesex marriage stronger environmental protections and increasing the minimum wage But on bank reform the party remains divided Things have been shifting lately however and the 44 Democrats who switched their votes between September and January show which way the wind is blowing Theyre listed at the bottom of this article As for the other supporters of the September bill 12 arent in Congress anymore  a politically significant point in its own right  and four didnt voteTheres nothing inherently terrible about flipflopping Historically its a pretty important part of the legislative process on everything from the Democratic Partys embrace of the civil rights movement in the 1960s to the passage of the Wall Street bailout in 2008 Even Himes mourning his defeat on CSPAN noted that a lot of people who thought unfettered finance was a good idea in the late 1990s recanted after the banking crashElections in particular have a way of changing politicians opinions and November was horrible for Democrats in almost every possible way Economic policy factors stuck with a lot of liberals Ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage passed all over the country in districts blue and red even as Democrats took a beating everywhere Exit poll data showed that the economy remained the most important issue to voters as it has in every election since 2008 and shepherded in Republicans even though a robust majority didnt think the GOP had a plan to make things betterThe public is still angry about the bank bailouts And even with the economy showing signs of improvement voting for more Wall Street financial aid is an easy way to convince many constituents that you arent playing for their teamAll of that came to a head in the December vote on a major government funding bill When top negotiators from both parties included a provision subsidizing risky derivatives trading in the package many Democrats who had been quietly going along with the piecemeal dismantling of DoddFrank began trying to take down the spending bill over the bank perk They came pretty close and the final events of the vote  President Barack Obama and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon personally lobbying lawmakers for support  only added fuel to the bank reformers fireThey appear to be picking up converts as demonstrated by the 44 Democrats who came out against the Volcker Rule delay Wednesday Several of those 44 were frequent Wall Street supporters in the last Congress  House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer DMd and Reps Joe Crowley DNY Greg Meeks DNY and Carolyn Maloney DNY stand out as interesting changesOf course House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif whipped Democrats hard on Wednesday to oppose the Volcker Rule delay and issued a statement after the vote blasting the bill as a GOP ripoff of the American people Pelosi is obviously a powerful person in the caucus and when Republicans bring the same Volcker Rule bill up again next week under rules that will guarantee its passage shell have less leverage and some of the financial reform converts may revert to backing big banks
