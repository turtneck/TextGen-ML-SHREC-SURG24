By Lambert Strether of Corrente  TPPTTIPTISA TPP A Podesta mail where Nikki Budzinski Labor Outreach Director discusses Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson I have received four calls from labor about a district meeting that Congresswoman Johnson a HRC public supporter held in Dallas Texas where she discussed TPP She claimed in the meeting that she speaks with HRC 23 times a week and that she was told by the Secretary that the only reason she opposes TPP is to get labor off her back and that once she is elected President she will reverse position I have worked with our Western Political Director Jessica Meija and she has connected with the Congresswomans COS to clarify the inaccuracy of what she said and push back on her comments This was not helpful with labor  Wikileaks attachment Inaccuracy Of course of course TPP Our Revolution the progressive group founded by Sen Bernie Sanders has begun a targeted campaign to sway at least five House Democrats to oppose the TPP in hopes it could change the outcome of a ratification vote  and its getting some results  Politico  Our Revolution which Sanders formed in late August to support liberal candidates has set its sights on at least five other fencesitting lawmakers In a vote thats expected to have razorthin margins plundering just a few Democratic votes the White House hoped to gain could make all the difference The target list includes Reps Seth Moulton Mass Ed Perlmutter Colo Beto ORourke Texas Derek Kilmer Wash and Pennsylvania state Rep Dwight Evans TPP In Thursday Obamas Council of Economic Advisers published a report warning that if the TPP isnt passed a Chinabacked trade agreement will takes its place That could put US manufacturers at a disadvantage when they try to sell to customers in Japan and other Asian nations The report argues that if Chinas Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership goes into effect at least 35 US industries as diverse as plastics fishing and footwear will be at risk of increased competition from China in the Japanese market  FiveThirtyEight  So theyve settled on this messaging now And If Clinton wins Obama might be able to put together a coalition of Republicans and tradefriendly Democrats to support the treaty In other words TPP isnt dead yet  Especially those looking for jobs on K Street TPP If TPP is not passed and RCEP is enacted which is what all these countries say they are planning to do then US businesses would face a direct loss of competitive position said Jason Furman the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers  Reuters  This would displace US goods and be worse than simply maintaining the trade status quo Furman said The study identifies 35 industrial sectors employing 47 million people with 53 billion in sales to Japan that would face such a disadvantage TPP Japans ruling parties push TPP through committee after opposition walkout  Nikkei Asian Review  The next hurdle for the trade deal is a vote during a plenary session of the House of Representatives expected early next week It will then be sent to the Diets upper house the House of Councillors TPP Workingclass US residents already lose about 1800 annually because wages have been depressed by global competition on labor rates according to the leftleaning Economic Policy Institute TPP would deepen this problem  Detroit Free Press  I know the cheap goods are supposed to make up for this but when your jobs and and what you can afford to buy are both crapified 2016 Days until 3 Corruption Two former Christie administration insiders charged in a bizarre scheme of political retaliation against a mayor who refused to endorse the governor for reelection were found guilty Friday on all counts in the longrunning Bridgegate saga  Newark StarLedger  In keeping with the disgrace that was this trial one of the things the US Attorneys Office should be ashamed of is where it decided to draw the line on who to charge and who not to charge Baronis attorney Michael Baldassare said  They should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people and they did not Hmm I wonder which powerful people Baldassare has in mind Our Famously Free Press Behind all the Times fawning profiles of Clinton  and the denigrating pieces not only on Trump but also Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders  was a cozy understanding between Times reporters and the Clinton campaign WikiLeaks has shown us that getting Clinton elected is something of a collaborative effort  MarketWatch  Editors at the Times the Washington Post and elsewhere justify this hostility because they have determined that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and the worst presidential nominee in history and cant be treated as an ordinary candidate So why do the polls show the worst nominee ever running neckandneck with the candidate President Barack Obama has praised as the most qualified person ever to run for president Do these editors know something that tens of millions of American voters are missing Whose job is it really to decide what poses a threat to our democracy  a handful of editors in the corporate media or the voters The Voters New Hampshire  Clinton 44 Trump

even if Trump wins Florida Of course last I checked NH was dead even not Clinton up 4 and I dont have the chops to assess how good any of these polls are Trump is finishing the race the way many Republicans wished he could have run it from the start fiercely on message and on offense  RealClearPolitics  Trump has largely adhered to his teleprompters and resisted controversial tweets this week As Clinton campaigned a few days ago with Alicia Machado the former Miss Universe winner with whom Trump has infamously feuded the GOP nominee focused primarily on higher costs for Obamacare and the revived FBI investigation into emails pertinent to Clintons private server The campaign believes those issues bolster his closing argument that Clinton is corrupt and a vestige of old politics while he says hes an agent of change Our polling data suggests that the missing whites arent exactly conservative populists who support Mr Trump Theyre just dissatisfied They dont like their candidate and they dont like the other partys candidate much either  New York Times  The registered white missing Democrats for instance support Mrs Clinton by only 61 percent to 19 percent The missing registered white Republicans support Mr Trump by only 69 to 13 Election Update Why Clintons Position Is Worse Than Obamas Nate Silver FiveThirtyEight  In the table below Ive run a headtohead comparison showing how many electoral votes each candidate was projected to have at various margins of victory or defeat For instance Obama had a lead in states and congressional districts totaling 332 electoral votes in our final 2012 forecast Clinton leads in states totaling only 272 electoral votes just two more than the minimum she needs to win the Electoral College In brief Clinton is stronger than Obama among highly educated voters in states that she would win anyhow  and weaker among white voters without college degrees in states that are close War Drums The US government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next weeks presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling American officials told NBC News The effort is being coordinated by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security but reaches across the government to include the CIA the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department current and former officials say  NBC   Officials are alert for any attempts to create Election Day chaos and say steps are being taken to prepare for worstcase scenarios including a cyberattack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet But what is more likely multiple US officials say is a lowerlevel effort by hackers from Russia or elsewhere to peddle misinformation by manipulating Twitter Facebook and other social media platforms For example officials fear an 11th hour release of fake documents implicating one of the candidates in an explosive scandal without time for the news media to fact check it The Trail With Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump breathtakingly close in polls of key states analysts are beginning to factor in the possibility of recounts that would delay the outcome  MarketWatch  Bear in mind that a candidate would have limited time to contest the vote This year the Electoral College is due to meet on Dec 19 By law electors meet on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December A recount would make Florida 2000 look like a walk in the park especially because Clinton bless her heart is unlikely to let herself be rolled unlike Gore Michigan Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow 4point lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesdays election with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat  Detroit Free Press   The number of undecided voters  13  remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle speaking to the high unfavorable marks voters give both major party candidates Normally Id say a 4 lead is a lot but those undecideds Wowsers Realignment Who Broke Politics Paul Krugman

that on one side sets up I mean it wasnt mean Republicans who prevented Obama from throwing the banksters in jail was it America and the Abyss Andrew Sullivan New York Magazine  Of course if Trump really were a fascist the Democratic Establishment would fight him tooth and nail Right Donald Trump didnt break one of our two great and ancestral political parties He won the nomination because the Republican Party was already broken and those responsible for the party the elected officials and thinkers didnt know Now they do Peggy Noonan Wall Street Journal  Democracys Majesty and 2016s

been a sound route to all of this You may have to bend rules to be part of it accept unsavory deals and characters but it is warm and cozy in there And One thing I saw this year was that sincere conservatives wholly opposed to socialism had real respect for Bernie Sanders because they saw his sincerity He wasnt part of the web and they honored him for it I never thought Id find myself writing

about Hillary Clintons campaign and what they dont  Los Angeles Times  Death of a thousand cuts The real Clinton email scandal is that a bullshit story has dominated the campaign Matt Yglesias Vox  Oh Matty Stats Watch Employment Situation October 2016 Unemployment Rate  Level 49  Participation Rate  level 628  Econoday  Solid payroll growth is not the whole story of the October employment report Average hourly earnings are rising up an outsized 04 percent in the month with the yearonyear rate at 28 percent suddenly near 30 percent and at its recovery peak The unemployment rate is down 1 tenth to 49 percent and for some is already signaling full employment for the labor marketBut negatives are scarce in this report where strength is emphatically underscored by the unexpected acceleration in average hourly earnings which further includes an upward revision to September Todays report marks a solid opening to fourthquarter data and will raise talk of a wageinflation flashpoint Gotta take the punchbowl away from lower orders But  The number of persons working part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged in October This level suggests slack still in the labor market  Calculated Risk  Moreover ts also worth noting that the standard measure of unemployment  now at 5 percent  doesnt capture the lingering weakness in the market seen in the broader U6 measure which includes discouraged workers other workers marginally attached to the labor force and those in temporary jobs because they cant get fulltime work The conventional unemployment measure is a hair below its mean from 20037 which is 52 percent The broader U6 however at 97 percent is higher than its 20037 mean of 91 percent This is just another sign that theres still slack in the labor market  Bloomberg  And Should we believe the employment numbers in this report There is little evidence of political bias in past election cycles  Econintersect  To sum this report up  employment is continuing to tread water  growing little better than the theoretical working population growth However note that the household survey removed 43000 to the workforce which is the reason the unemployment rate declined There was really nothing good or nothing really terrible  although manufacturing declined The yearoveryear rate of growth significantly declined this month Again the Econoday summary is just a little too breathless for this Maine bear International Trade September 2016 A decline in imports helped pull down the nations trade gap sharply in September to 364 billion from a revised 405 billion in August Imports reflecting declines for capital goods and also consumer goods fell 11 percent while exports showing an especially strong gain for capital goods rose 06 percent  Econoday  Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays And Declining imports are a plus for the GDP calculation but are not signals of strength for domestic demand whether business demand for capital goods or business expectations for consumer imports ahead of the holidays  Econintersect  Jobless Claims However comparing initial claims today with the past is the proverbial apples to oranges An important fact in looking at claims data is that vastly fewer people today are eligible for unemployment benefits In other words the number of unemployed people who cant receive jobless benefits  and thus are not in the initial claims data  has risen relative to those who have unemployment insurance  Bloomberg  As Mosler has been saying Housing Residential remodeling has recovered to 38 of the peak it

recognition that capitalist economies are subject to boomandbust cycles With a managed socialist economy business cycles are much less severe though they cant be eliminated entirely for example in years when agricultural production is unexpectedly low due to the weather because the government manages production and employment But these economies tend to grow slower than capitalist economies and they often have substantial inefficiencies in the way resources and labor are used Mark Thoma CBS  What Makes Scandinavia Different  Jacobin  The only way to get Scandinavian levels of redistribution
