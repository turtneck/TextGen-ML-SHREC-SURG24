Rules are made to be broken is a saying that has many variations but perhaps no one has summed up Hillary Clintons attitude and Bills too about rules more than the late sciencefiction writer Robert A Heinlein who said I am free no matter what rules surround me If I find them tolerable I tolerate them if I find them too obnoxious I break them I am free because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything I doIn its report on how Hillary Clinton handled her private emails while serving as secretary of state the State Departments inspector general IG has found that Hillary Clinton disregarded cyber security guidelines when she used a private computer server She continues to deny she did anything wrong and falsely claims she turned over all of her emails to the State Department after she left office In fact she or members of her team deleted about 30000 of them before an investigation of her practices beganThe IGs report chides her saying she should have preserved any federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary At a minimum Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and because she did not do so she did not comply with the Departments policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records ActThere are federal penalties for tampering with a smoke detector on an airplane and disobeying flight attendants that can include fines and even jail time Isnt what Hillary Clinton did far worse than that if she potentially compromised US secretsThe IG also says she stonewalled requests by the government for access to her server which was in her Chappaqua NY home with another discovered at an unsecured location in a Denver bathroom closet Marcel Lazar the Romanian computer hacker calling himself Guccifer claims to have hacked into Clintons servers He pled guilty to the charge before a Virginia judge this week Might there also be Chinese and Russian hackers out there whove also had a look at Clintons emailsHillary Clinton has claimed she only used private email for her daughters wedding and yoga classes Who believes that other than her partisan supporters and uninformed voters Highranking government officials are aware of the regulations governing their tenure while in office and their responsibilities for the handling of records once they leave it Will Hillary Clintons failure to comply with the State Departments policies on records necessarily lead to an indictment That is what an FBI investigation is attempting to determineHillary Clinton has invoked the everybody has done it defense but again thats not true She often cites former Secretary of State Colin Powell who also used a private email server but as a Wall Street Journal editorial notes Mr Powells use of private email was limited and he never set up an unsecure server in his home not to mention a Denver bathroomSomething else from the IGs report that firmly rebuts Hillary Clintons defense Notification is required when a user suspects compromise of among other things a personally owned device containing personally identifiable information But the IG found no evidence that she or her aides compliedFor years the Clintons have skirted laws and practiced disinformation rhetorical gymnastics It depends on what the meaning of the word is is obfuscation changing the subject non sequiturs and anything else that might block their enrichment or achievement of political goalsThis time Hillary Clinton should not be allowed to get away with it nor should she have her incidents of malfeasance rewarded by being elected president of the United StatesCal Thomas is Americas most widely syndicated oped columnist He joined Fox News Channel in 1997 as a political contributorHis latest book is What Works Common Sense Solutions for a Stronger America is available in bookstores now Readers may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditorstribunecom
