Bill Clinton Inc Billions for the Foundation 116 Million for the Clintons October 27 2016 Call it the unintended revenge of Doug Band Band used to be Bills Huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks The Clinton Foundation was a Band project The waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating Doug Band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running Bill Clinton Inc And Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton Under the heading ForProfit Activity of President Clinton ie Bill Clinton Inc Band wrote We have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements In support of the Presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the President and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than 50 million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the 66 million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements Band mentions four such arrangements without naming them Bill Clinton was paid nearly 18 million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college Laureate International Universities according to reports and the familys tax returns A Dubaibased firm GEMS Education paid Bill Clinton more than 560000 in 2015 according to the tax returns Band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the Clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS Ericsson BHP and Barclays In 2011 alone according to the Clintons tax returns Bill Clinton earned 13454000 in speaking fees Of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between Dougs Teneo interests and the entire Clintonworld octopus We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in forprofit activities Band wrote He also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at Teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation Bands memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneos 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation how much they had paid Bill Clinton and in some cases how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of 8 million for the foundation and 3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out 66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place Band also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner In the ensuing years UBS upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches Band wrote Band was actually making the case that the entire network of the Clinton Foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the Clintons Not to mention the interests of people around them Banks and major corporations were doing business with Bills toady paying Bill money and donating to the Clinton Foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part Band described in the memo how he combined his work for CGI and Teneo He wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the 2011 CGI gathering to meet with Teneo clients He also acknowledged giving free CGI memberships to target Teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors Memberships generally cost 20000 a year Teneo meanwhile named Bill Clinton its honorary chairman Clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to Teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate June 2011 memo that Band wrote to the State Department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment Bill Clinton was initially paid 2 million by Teneo according to Man of the World a book written with the former presidents participation by author Joe Conason And heres where it gets appropriately entertaining But Band outlined that Kelly his Teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between 2009 and 2011 as an unpaid economic envoy to Northern Ireland appointed by thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included Coke UBS and Dow Band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with Kellys State Department ethics agreement Kellys multiple roles came together during one State Department event in 2010 when thenSecretary Clinton recognized Dow among other companies for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and thanked Kelly for his work on the issue Dow became one of Teneos first major clients According to Bands memo Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris had been introduced to Bill Clinton over a round of golf with Kelly in August 2009 Thats not consistent with mafia ethics agreements but its all good in Clintonworld
