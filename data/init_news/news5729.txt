Theres a lot of disgust in America with politicians inability to get things done In the race to win the Republican presidential nomination that disgust has so far benefited outsider candidatesNoncareer politicians Donald Trump Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson have all promised to ride in and fix WashingtonBut new research by Nolan McCarty a professor at Princeton University and other political scientists suggeststhis disgust  and Americas political dysfunction  wont be that easy to fixWorking with political scientist Boris Shorand economistJohn Voorheis McCarty has released a new study thatshowsthat thegrowing ideological gap between the Republican and Democratic parties  a common obstacle to getting anything done in Washington  is not just due to politicians incompetence or their unwillingness to work together Its due at least in part to a deeper structural problem the wideninggap betweenthe rich and poorMcCarty says he shares some of the disgust that Americans feel about polarized politics and gridlock in WashingtonBut I think its important for readers and voters to understand    thatthese problems are not just simply because career politicians are acting in bad faith or as Donald Trump would say theyre stupid losers Theyre really deep structural problemshe saysBy looking at extensive data on US states over the past few decades the researchers showthat the widening gap between the rich and the poor in recent decades hasmoved state legislatures toward the rightoverallwhile also increasingthe ideological distance between those on the right and those on the leftThis map below shows the Gini coefficient a measure of income inequality for each state going back to 1997 A lower Gini figure indicates that people in the state are earning more equal incomes while a higher one marked here in darker green shows that incomes are more unequal You can disregard theaxes here  they just showlatitude and longitudeThe paper argues that this trend has gone hand in hand with thegrowing political divideThe states that have the highest levels of inequality or the fastest growth in equality have also tended to see the most political polarization the paper saysUsing a scale of state legislator ideology that looks at annual surveys of the beliefs of candidates since the mid1990s the researchers map whereDemocrats haveshifted to the left and Republicans have shifted to the right at the state levelThemap belowgives an ideological score in each state for each chamber  in most states aHouse of Representatives and aSenateA more negative score and a deeper blue color on the map indicate that the state chamber is more liberal while a positive score and deeper red color show the state is more conservative You can see that blue states have become bluer and red states redder since 1997A look at party composition in each state shows the same trendIts not just that these two trends of inequality and polarization are happening simultaneously The researchers use statistical methods to eliminate other factorsand show that a states income inequality has a large positive and causal effect on its political polarizationFurthermore these results have increased in magnitude in recent years and seem to be concentrated in the states that are reddest by the end of the sampleIn other wordsgrowing inequality is astrong force pushing both parties farther from the centerThepaper doesnt specifically say why this happens except that politics gets more polarized with each election It appears that people on either end of the economic spectrum have beendeveloping even more differentpolitical preferences and electing people to represent those preferencesInterestingly however the study showsthatinequality is affecting the two parties in different waysFirst the researchers find that Democrats as a whole have shifted farther to the left than the Republicans have to the right with very liberal Democrats becoming even more liberal Butat the level of the state legislature they find that ideology as a whole has shifted slightly to the rightThe reason is that there has been a change in the partisan balance with Republicans winning more seats from moderate Democrats over timeAs the Democrat party has shrunk nationally over the course of the last 15 years the disproportionate effect has been the replacement of moderate Democrats with Republicans and that has tended to happen most often in states with high levels of inequality or where inequality is growing the fastest McCarty saidThe map below which showsthe percentage of seats held by Republicans illustrates how that has happened The percentage of seats held by Republicans has increased especially through the South and middle America since 1997This study offers evidence that inequality leads to political polarization Though they have yet to produce definitive findings the researchers also believe as many others in their field do that political polarization also in turn produces more inequality creating a vicious feedback loop of inequality and polarized politicsHow does that work Not only are more conservative lawmakers less likely to favor redistribution the political gridlock that results from having a more polarized system makes it harder to pass bills that might reduce income inequality such as increasing the minimum wage strengthening union bargaining power or increasing redistribution through welfare researchers sayThe researchsuggests that political polarization is not just a product of gerrymandering the way districts are drawn or caused by features of the state political system such as having closed partisan primaries McCarty saysInstead heargues that Americas political polarization is areflection of bigger broader changes in the United States in particular that thecountry has become much more diverse in terms of its economic racial and ethnic makeup than it was in the 1950s The diversity unsurprisingly has a direct impact on the political system and we have yet to figure out how to repair the system to reflect a more diverse society McCarty saysSo what does this mean for average voters in the near term For one they should be skeptical of candidates who promise an easy fix to political dysfunction in WashingtonThese are deep complicated problems and people need to think big picture about what underlies them They werent solved by electing Barack Obama theyre probably not going to be solved by electing Donald Trump McCarty saysYou might also likeWhat its like to be a part of the worlds richest 1 percent in 15 incredible
