  Hillary supporters can stop panicking The reopening of the FBIs email investigation story blasted out by every hungry reporter and desperate Republican has already completely fallen apart It took less than two hours The initial headlines were as grim as they were overblown Shortly before an official announcement NBC News leaked the news that the FBI would be looking into newly discovered emails related to the previous Clinton investigation NBC News FBI reopening investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server  Jesse Rodriguez JesseRodriguez October 28 2016 This was important because despite Republicans hanging every last one of their hopes on Hillary being indicted before the election the FBI investigation found zero evidence of criminal wrongdoing A new investigation made all those dashed hopes come rushing back They Freaked Out Especially Trump  Hallie Jackson HallieJackson October 28 2016 However even as Trump took a meaningless victory lap the story itself was falling apart The bombshell turned out to be a dud Over on MSNBC veteran reporter Pete Williams did what almost no other reporter bothered to  he got to the bottom of it NBCs Pete Williams Sr officials sayDuring separate investigation a device led to addl emailsnot from Clinton httpstcoQmmNoxXhOx  Bradd Jaffy BraddJaffy October 28 2016 All the big things turned out to not exist No there is no evidence to suggest these new emails were covered up No they havent found anything incriminating No this isnt a reopening of the case  it was never closed to the begin with and this is a small update not a gamechanger And perhaps most importantly these emails did not even come from Hillary Clinton  Bigger than Watergate Hardly Like Wikileaks before it this nonscandal will be used on the right to give the appearance that Hillary Clinton is corrupt without providing any concrete proof beyond it There is no big story here but the conservative movement will use it as a pretext to continue harassing Clinton and her campaign with baseless accusations FBI Director James Comey may have scored a few political points with his Republican colleagues but his investigation will likely yield zero fresh controversies This is the maddening world we live in A sham built on a sham built on a sham Its shams all the way down Featured image via Alex WongGetty Images Share this Article
