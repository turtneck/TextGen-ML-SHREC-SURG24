Dad in weird mood since 2004 071116 A 54YEAROLD man has been in a bit of a mood for the past 12 years his family has noticed Engineer Roy Hobbs has seemed reluctant to spend time with family members for the last decade or so preferring to be in the shed or slumped in his chair with a can of lager and a forbidding look on his face Son Paul Hobbs said Come to think of it dad has seemed a bit pissed off since a few years after I was born Maybe something happened near the start of the 20th century that annoyed him I suppose we could ask him but that might just make it worse I sometimes hear whistling from the shed so he seems to be okay when hes on his own Hobbss wife Linda said He was quite chirpy during the 90s Hes probably just hungry Share
