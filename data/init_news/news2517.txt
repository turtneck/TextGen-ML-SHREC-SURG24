Read the latest on the Chattanooga shootingAs investigators sought to decipher the motives of the gunman who targeted US troops in Chattanooga Tenn they also began to confront the uncomfortable question of whether counterterrorism agencies are reaching the practical limits of what they can do to detect homegrown plotsOn Friday federal officials said they were investigating the shootings Thursday in Chattanooga as a possible terrorist attack but were a long way from drawing conclusions They said the gunman 24yearold Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez had not previously drawn the attention of authorities save for a drunkendriving charge a few months agoOn Saturday the Navy said a male petty officer died at 217 am of wounds received in Thursdays shooting  bringing the number killed in the rampage to five The sailors name had not been releasedAbdulazeezs travels to the Middle East his acquisition of several firearms and his recent online musings about the meaning of Islam were coming under fresh examination as hundreds of federal agents sought to reconstruct his movements and mindsetAt this time we have no indication he was inspired by or directed by anyone other than himself Edward Reinhold the special agent in charge of the FBIs office in Knoxville Tenn told reporters FridayUS officials said that devices including a computer and cellphone believed to have belonged to Abdulazeez were being examined by FBI technicians in a laboratory at Quantico VaThe FBI said that Abdulazeez was armed with at least two rifles or shotguns as well as a handgun when he opened fire on a military recruiting center and a Navy Reserve facility in Chattanooga Authorities did not give a more detailed description of the firearms or say how he obtained themSome of the weapons were purchased legally and some of them may not have been Reinhold saidVideo Who was the Chattanooga gunmanUS counterterrorism officials have become increasingly worried about the ability of the Islamic State and alQaeda offshoots to attract and radicalize followers in the United States At the same time authorities have expressed concern that their ability to detect such contact has been eroded by the spread of encrypted communicationFederal authorities have arrested more than 10people over the past six weeks who are suspected of having ties to the Islamic State US officials said the crackdown was part of an effort to suppress a surge in suspected plots aimed at unleashing violence on US targets during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan which ended the day of the attacks in ChattanoogaBut officials have also said that homegrown radicals have gotten better at hiding their intentions and cloaking their contacts with overseas groups despite a massive expansion in US surveillance capabilities since the Sept11 2001 attacksTwo US law enforcement officials said Abdulazeez traveled to Jordan on four occasions prior to the shootings The last trip he took was from April 2014 to November 2014 One of the officials said there was no information the trips were connected to attempts to enter Syria or establish contacts with a terrorist groupJordan has been a way station for foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria including a 22yearold US citizen who similarly went undetected during trips to Jordan before carrying out a suicide attack in Syria last yearBut Jordan is also a popular tourist destination one of several nations bordering Syria that account for more than 2million travelers who arrive in the United States each yearMoreover Abdulazeez had a grandmother and other relatives in the country according to neighbors and court papersAnd while his father Youssuf Abdulazeez was investigated by the FBI in 1994 and again in 2002 for donating to Palestinian groups suspected of having ties to terrorism US officials said the father was removed from a terrorism watch list a decade agoBased on the limited information available so far the younger Abdulazeez appears to have repeatedly brushed up against US screening systems without triggering an alert said Rep Devin Nunes RCalif chairman of the House Intelligence CommitteeYou have to do something that would set off some type of alarm Nunes said in an interview Because of the mounting odds against disrupting plots as well as the countermeasures being taken by terrorist groups Nunes said that stopping attacks is becoming tougher and tougherNunes said the FBI has warned lawmakers repeatedly in recent months that the bureau was facing a surge in the number of threats it is tracking  many based on intelligence gleaned overseas  but has been unable to connect those tips to individuals or specific targets in the United StatesThe FBI has warned us that there are a bunch of threats that they know about but cant find Nunes said They have enough specifics to say something is being planned We know the Islamic State is talking to someone but we cant find the personUS counterterrorism officials emphasized Friday that they have no evidence so far that the attack by Abdulazeez fell into that troubling security gapFour Marines were killed in Thursdays attack Gunnery Sgt Thomas J

Navy petty officer and a Chattanooga police officer were wounded Abdulazeez was killed after exchanging gunfire with policeWhile the FBI was cautious in making judgments other lawmakers said there was clear reason to suspect that Abdulazeez had been inspired directly or indirectly by the Islamic State or a similar groupBased on my experience I think he was radicalized by these individuals in Syria Rep Michael McCaul RTex chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told reporters The threat is real and it comes from the Internet he added They dont have to travel to Iraq and Syria  Theyre already hereAbdulazeez could trace his heritage to several parts of the Middle East  he was born in Kuwait as a Jordanian citizen although his parents identified themselves as Palestinians He came to the United States with his family while very young and grew up in Chattanooga attending a local high school and earning a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee at ChattanoogaIn addition to his visit to Jordan last year he traveled there on at least one prior occasion during a combined trip to Kuwait in 2010 according to the official Kuwait News AgencyA high school friend Levon Miller added that Abdulazeez traveled abroad once every few years Hed take off for a month or two mostly during his college breaks Miller said although he said he didnt know details about where he wentOther signs emerged Friday that Abdulazeez and his four sisters had grown up in a troubled household afflicted by marital strife and debtHis father filed for federal bankruptcy protection in 2002 Seven years later his mother filed for divorce charging that her husband had sexually and physically abused her and had threatened to take a second wife The couple later
