October 27 2016 Ivy Pollard 73 from the backend of Brighton was all set for a bingewatching session of her favourite TV series when the tradesman who said he would arrive between 7am and Midday arrived between 7am and Midday Id just finished skinning up the first spliff of the day when the miracle took place she said There was this unexpected knock at the door which I was hoping would be the new clown costume and accessories that I ordered 3 weeks ago But it wasnt It was the guy from Swirlpool The one thing I wasnt expecting Someone actually doing what they said they were going to do The only time I experience that level of followthrough is on the toilet or in my pullups but even that doesnt happen all that often It was all a bit embarrassing actually because there wasnt anything wrong with the oven yet The warranty had just expired so I knew it was only a matter of time I thought I was being clever by booking an engineer straight away confident that by the time he turned up there would be something wrong with it Mind you he didnt mind It turns out hes a big Game of Thrones fan as well So we had a smoke and cracked on with the show We had a jolly old day in the end much to the chagrin of the other customers he was scheduled to see that day but then again thats tradesmen for you Jodster
