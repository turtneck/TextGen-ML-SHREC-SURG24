continuing the empire have been met with countermoves Russia appears to be building strength in every way Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb and are developing rapid resistance as the US petrodollar loses its grip and China Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order What lies ahead It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well Prepare for a changing economic landscape and one in which selfreliance might be all we have Russia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate  The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies by Jay SyrmopoulosWith all eyes on Russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM which NATO has dubbed the SATAN missile  as tensions with the US increase Moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically differentThe rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as Russias native currency the rubleTake a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might thinkimage httpthefreethoughtprojectcomwpcontentuploads201610bankofrussiae1475520013798png The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble Russias national currencySimilar to how the US uses the dollar sign  the UK uses the pound sign  and the European Union uses the euro symbol  Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationallyAfter the failed reset in USRussian relations by the Obama administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into complianceInstead of decimating Russia what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the US petrodollar and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isnt solely controlled by Western interests see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank  New Development BankAccording to the Corbett Report New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the BRICSled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the USled Washington ConsensusFor those who dont know SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions Still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT networkThis is why delisting from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaignsRecently financial guru Jim Rickards author of the book Currency Wars wrote that Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency the ruble will all benefit Rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within Russia and that this comeback will benefit the rubleWhile still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the US Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington The Bank of Russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its websiteMonetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of Russian citizens The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to 4 by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium runIn laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in Russia While many analysts have noted the increased buildup in Russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of Russian gold reserves over the past decadeBelow is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year 2015Since 2006 there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend The chart clearly reveals that Russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold Additionally the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets From 2006 to 2015 Russias state holdings of gold tripledWithin just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdingsAccording to the Business Insider In July of this year the central bank of Russia added 200000 ounces of gold to its reserves The onemonth uptick in Russian gold reserves  200000 ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Golds Turquoise Ridge gold mine in NevadaAt that same rate  200000 ounces per month  in a mere five months Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barricks massive Goldstrike mine in NevadaCurrently Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world Its clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United StatesRickards in his 2011 book Currency Wars theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the US dollar Currently Russian reserves stand at roughly 1500 tonnes with Chinese reserves totaling over 1800 tonnes according to China  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3300 tonnes of goldThe US is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund IMF thus the US lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to Business InsiderImagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that RussianChinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the IMFs gold reserve of over 2800 tonnes Russian Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6100 tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the US gold reserves estimated at 8100 tonnesRussia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigmThe reality is that the United States is 20 trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the US economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on Hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the US using the petrodollar as a weaponUltimately the United States Russia and China are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF the World Bank SWIFT New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment BankIts not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack The true threat to America is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people This article was written by Jay Syrmopoulos and originally published at The Free Thought Project
