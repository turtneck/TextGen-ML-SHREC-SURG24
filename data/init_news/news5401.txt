Theres a conceit that says everything at Facebook is run by data not people And we prefer it that wayFor the sites billion users believing theres no human puppet master behind the scenes makes its growing control over life more palatable Its just a clever machine reflecting our desires better and better with every interaction right For news producers we have to believe that the platform treats everyone equally that its a publisher not an editorIn retrospect this was always naiveA conservative whistleblower at Facebook yesterday claimed in a report that the influential trending news tab was deliberately biased toward liberal news  something the social network deniesId come on shift and Id discover that CPAC Conservative Political Action Conference or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldnt be trending because either the curator didnt recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz the former news curator told the tech blog GizmodoSilicon Valley loves using the word algorithm to cover the word judgment but any platform built by humans is always political The engineers building the products want to skew them toward quality content but its hard to determine what quality is exactly without making a choice influenced by valuesWhen I read suggestions that Facebook might be skewing its trending bar my first reaction as a San Francisco liberal was to be slightly pleased any help we can get against Trump right But what if the tables were turned I wonder what the psychological effects of it are said Vince Coglianese editor of the conservative news site The Daily Caller Millions of Facebook users now have no idea that the things theyre concerned about are the concerns of a lot of people Its scary to think Facebooks intentionally isolating vast swaths of the countryFacebooks in a tricky spot because curation is necessary Truly viral news content tends to be terrible The front page of Reddits hot section an imperfect but useful barometer for the viral stories of the day currently has headlines like Chameleon unsure bug is food or not and These condoms are around 60 years old found in my basement Meanwhile my Facebook trending bar has Federal Trade Commission Judge Rules Against Agencys Bid to Block Health Care Systems Merger Its probably fair to assume that the FTC news was not going as viral as that old condom but a Facebook employee decided it was more importantFacebook is the dominant player in the media today As news websites lose relevance to readers who find content socially and as stories are published directly onto Facebook as Instant articles the companys power will only grow To turn Facebooks trending bar into a Reddit page is not the answer But Facebook has to be more honest about how it operates as an editorJust be transparent about how the words on the screen are getting there Coglianese saidIf theres one thing Silicon Valley loves more than the conceit of an amoral algorithm it is secrecy And as a social network with a newsfeed of vacation pictures Facebook could get away with being secretive about their curationAs the most powerful publisher and now editor in the world today Facebook owes it to its billion users to be clear about how the site plans on distributing news
