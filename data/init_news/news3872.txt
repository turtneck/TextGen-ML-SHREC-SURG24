Gay rights advocates are hoping to parlay the momentum from their legislative victories in Indiana and Arkansas this week into further expanding legal protections for gays and lesbians in those states and othersFacing widespread pressure including from big businesses such as Apple and WalMart lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas rolled back their states new religious objections laws which critics said could be used to discriminate against gays Amid the uproar the Republican governors of Michigan and South Dakota urged their own legislatures to extend antidiscrimination protections to gaysTwentynine states currently dont include protections for gays and lesbians in their nondiscrimination laws according to the American Civil Liberties Union But the Indiana and Arkansas laws along with court rulings or legislatures legalizing samesex marriage in 37 states and an expected US Supreme Court decision on gay marriage this year are fueling efforts to change that as the 2016 elections approachWere not going to let any of these people off the hot seat said Kathy Sarris cofounder of the gayrights group Indiana Equality Action This ultimately is going to happen in IndianaMost of the states without sexual orientation protections are in the South or the Plains which tend to be more conservative As public opinion has become more supportive of samesex marriage and other gay rights in recent years many businesses say such protections factor into their decisions about expansions and help them attract top employeesArkansas state Rep Warwick Sabin a Democrat from Little Rock said the issue isnt going awayOther states are moving ahead of us and Arkansas is being left in the dust We need to make an affirmative statement about our values as a state and I know that the vast majority of Arkansans believe in fairness and opportunity for all of its citizens he saidIndianas Republicancontrolled Legislature took a first step by adding language to its new religious objections law stating that service providers cant use the law as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods services facilities or accommodations based on sexual orientation gender identity and other factors It is now the first Indiana state law that explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender identityArkansas amended law only addresses actions by the government not by businesses or individuals The laws supporters say the changes would prevent businesses from using it to deny services to individuals even though it doesnt include specific antidiscrimination language similar to Indianas lawGay rights proponents want Arkansas to go further though and are trying to build support for adding sexual orientation to the protected statuses covered by the states civil rights laws The states attorney general Leslie Rutledge last week approved the wording of a proposed ballot measure that would add such protections clearing the way for supporters to begin gathering the signatures needed to get it on the November 2016 ballotToday LGBT Arkansans are still unequal and todays battle points toward a broader struggle ahead  a fight where full and complete equality for all Arkansans that cannot be undermined is the only acceptable outcome Chad Griffin president of the Human Rights Campaign the nations largest LGBT rights group said in a statement after Republican Gov Asa Hutchinson signed that states lawHutchinson meanwhile has left open the possibility of issuing an executive order that would prohibit workplace discrimination against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people at state agenciesSimilar debates are going on elsewhere In North Dakota on Thursday the Republicancontrolled Legislature voted down a measure that would have prohibited discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation in the areas of housing and employment Gov Jack Dalrymple rebuked lawmakers saying such discrimination wasnt acceptableIn Michigan meanwhile GOP Gov Rick Snyder warned legislators that he would veto a religious objections bill unless they also sent him a measure that would extend antidiscrimination protections to gays He cited the Indiana outcry in making his warningIndiana Gov Mike Pence and fellow Republicans maintained that the states religious objections law never sanctioned discrimination against anyone They said considering changes to the states civil rights law was too major of a policy change to take up with less than a month left in the legislative sessionState Senate President David Long acknowledged its probably likely that extending antidiscrimination laws to cover sexual orientation will be on next years agendaYou can see that this discussion has been elevated in Indiana and its an important one Long saidSome gayrights supporters say the push for religious freedom laws proposed in about a dozen states this year amounts to a consolation prize for conservatives dismayed over the legalization of samesex marriages across much of the countrySome conservative activists have a different takeEric Miller the executive director of an Indiana group Advance America called the national outcry over the states law an orchestrated effort of misinformation led by those pushing for government recognition government approval adding to our civilrights laws protections for sexual orientation and gender identity
