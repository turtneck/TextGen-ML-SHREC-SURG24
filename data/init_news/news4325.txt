Washington CNN Texas Sen Ted Cruz is standing his ground in his belief that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice opens the door for predators dismissing criticism from Caitlyn Jenner who mocked him over the issue last weekThis is not a matter of right or left or Democrat or Republican This is common sense It doesnt make sense for grown adult men strangers to be alone in a restroom with a little girl Cruz told CNNs Jake Tapper on State of the UnionThis is the height of political correctness Cruz continued And frankly the concern is not of the Caitlyn Jenners of the world but if the law is such that any man if he feels like it can go in a womans restroom and you cant ask him to leave that opens the door for predatorsJenner a reality TV star and activist for transgender causes posted a video to Facebook on Wednesday knocking Cruz for his support of a controversial North Carolina law that requires people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex stated on their birth certificate rather than how they selfidentifyAfter using a womens bathroom in the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City  following a recent comment by Trump in which he said Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted at the tower  Jenner a Republican quipped By the way Ted nobody got molestedIve spent a lot of years in law enforcement dealing with child predators that are sick individuals Cruz told Tapper That doesnt mean that that is the people who are transgendered But there are predators in the world and just saying that youre a man you can go in the girls restroom if you feel like it opens the door for criminalsThis is the height of political correctness for Donald Trump to say yes let grown men in the bathroom with little girls he saidCruz told Tapper that Fiorinas words owed to her being a tough competitorShe was a competitor in this primary She was a fierce competitor in a primary people take shots at each other Thats part of the process Cruz said You know we all remember when Ronald Reagan picked George Herbert Walker Bush as his vice president and they had to explain why Bush had called Reaganomics voodoo economics Listen that happens when you come through a primary and you uniteCruz added I can tell you Carly and I have spent weeks and weeks and weeks together on the road barnstorming the state of Indiana barnstorming the country and I have gotten to know and respect Carly Shes an extraordinary leaderBoehner let out his inner TrumpAsked about the criticism Cruz shrugged it offI think Boehner kinda let out his inner Trump and he had some colorful imagery there But its interesting when Boehner was attacking me he praised Hillary Clinton He thinks shes terrific and he praised Donald Trump He said Donald is his friend his golfing buddy his texting buddy Cruz said And theres a reason  if you like if you want to see the next president as a Boehner Republican then Donald Trump is your manSo why does Boehner dislike CruzIf you look at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and John Boehner theyre all part of the same corrupt Washington system where the rich get richer and the powerful and the lobbyists use government power for personal benefit Cruz saidBehind the Donald Trump mask is Hillary ClintonYou know who I feel the worst for I feel the worst for Donalds supporters who believe his role Cruz said But every day if he gets closer to the nomination he starts taking his mask off and behind the Donald Trump mask is Hillary ClintonThat is quite an image Tapper said
