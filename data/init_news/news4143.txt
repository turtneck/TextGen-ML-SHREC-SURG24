There has always been an odd tenor to discussions among climate scientists policy wonks and politicians a passiveaggressive quality and I think it can be traced to the fact that everyone involved has to dance around the obvious truth at risk of losing their status and influenceThe obvious truth aboutglobal warming is this barring miracles humanity is in for some awful shitHere is a plotting of dozens of climate modeling scenarios out to 2100 from the IPCCThe black line is carbon emissions to date The red line is the status quo  a projection of where emissions will go if no new substantial policy is passed to restrain greenhouse gas emissionsWe recently passed 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere the status quo will take us up to 1000 ppm raising global average temperature from a preindustrial baseline between 32 and 54 degrees Celsius That will mean according to a 2012 World Bank report extreme heatwaves declining global food stocks loss of ecosystems and biodiversity and lifethreatening sea level rise the effects of which will be tilted against many of the worlds poorest regions stalling or reversing decades of development work A 4C warmer world can and must be avoided said the World Bank presidentBut thats where were headed It will take enormous effort just to avoid that fate Holding temperaturedown under 2C  the widely agreed upon target  would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination sustained over decades Theres no sign of that happening or reason to think its plausible anytime soon And so awful shit it isNobody wants to say that Why not It might seem obvious  no one wants to hear it  but theres a bit more to it than that Well return to the question in a minute but first lets look at how this unsatisfying debate plays out in publicThe latest contretemps was sparked by a comment in Nature by Oliver Geden an analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs In it he made a simple argument Politicians he says want good news They want to hear that it is still possible to limit temperature to 2C Even more they want to hear that they can do so while avoiding aggressive emission cuts in the nearterm  say until theyre out of officeClimate scientists Geden says feel pressure to provide the good news Theyre worried that if they dont if they come off as alarmist or hectoring they will simply be ignored boxed out of the debate And so they construct models showing that it is possible to hit the 2C target The message is always Were running out of time weve only got five or 10 years to turn things around but we can do it if we put our minds to itThat was the message in 1990 in 2000 in 2010 How can we still have five or 10 years left The answer Geden says is that scientists are baking increasingly unrealistic assumptions into their modelsGeden focuses on one such assumption that substantial negative emissions will be possible in the latter half of the 21st century We will be able to suck thousands of megatons of carbon out of the atmosphere so humanity can go net negative by 2100 even if we emit a bunch more carbon in the short termThe mechanism for negative emissions is supposed to be bioenergy  burning plant mass  coupled with carbon capture and sequestration The combo is called BECCS and in theory it buries more CO2 than it emitsIf you work enough BECCS into your model you can almost double humanitys carbon budget  the amount of carbon we can still pump in the atmosphere without passing 2C After all if you can suck half the carbon out you can afford to pump twice the carbon inBut is largescale BECCS plausible Theres the problem of finding a source of biomass that doesnt compete with food crops the harvesting of which does not spur additional emissions and which can be found in the enormous quantities required The IPCC scenarios that come in below 2C require BECCS to remove between 2 and 10 gigatons of CO2 a year from the atmosphere by 2050 By way of comparison all the worlds oceans combined absorb about 9 gigatons a year all the worlds terrestrial carbon sinks combined absorb about 10 gigatons a yearThese scenarios mean potentially doubling the capacity of terrestrial carbon sinks capturing and burying  permanently without leaks  gigatons of CO2 a year How will it be monitored What if it leaks or is breachedTheres no consensus on the viability of widespread BECCS which after all doesnt exist yet One 2014 commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change cobylined by 14 researchers raised serious doubts about the feasibility of largescale BECCS and the wisdom of betting the climate farm on it They note that deployment of largescale bioenergy faces biophysical technical and social challenges and CCS is yet to be implemented widely and that widespread deployment of BECCS in climate stabilization scenarios might become a dangerous distractionBut BECCS isnt the only way to make models produce happier results The scenarios that show a high likelihood of avoiding 2C also presume policy regimes that are positively utopian a rising price on carbon harmonized across every country in the world the availability maturation and rapid deployment of every known lowcarbon technology all bets paying off for 50 years straight It would be quite a run of luckIs it possible in models Yes Is it possible IRL Climate modeler Glen Peters doesnt think soThere are other ways to shape model outcomes Peters draws attention to this chart from the IPCC AR5 reportRow four is the total carbon budget available to humanity this century in gigatons As you can see if you move right or left on the chart relatively small changes substantially alter the carbon budget If you tweak the scenario from having a 66 percent chance of staying under 2C to a 33 percent chance the carbon budget goes from 1000 gigatons to 1500  50 percent more breathing roomIf you decide 2C is too difficult and maybe 3C is okay your carbon budget goes from 1000 gigatons to 2400 more than doubling That sure looks a lot easier Though important note even hitting that easier target would require substantial BECCSKevin Anderson of the UKs Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research is another frequent critic of these model assumptions He says that models have often included unrealistically low estimates of current and future emissions growth unrealistically early peaks in global emissions and unequitable estimates of emission curves in developing countries implicitly assuming stunted developmentAdd to all these considerations the high rate of decline in emissions necessary after global emissions peak It used to be that 2 percent annual global emission reductions was considered the maximum feasible without serious economic contraction Now models routinely show 4 or even 6 percent annual reductions a rate of emissions decline that has never been achieved by anyone anywhere ever much less consistently over 50 yearsPeters also shares this figure from researcher Robbie AndrewIn these scenarios emissions never go net negative though BECCS can get used As you can see for each year that emissions continue rising the rate of decline afterward has to be steeper to stay within the budgetNow policymakers are being told that emissions can peak in 2030 and still keep temperature rise under 2C To get that result in a modeling scenario emissions have to fall 6 percent a year even with large amounts of BECCS thrown in To find that plausible one has to imagine all of human society turning on a dime beginning in 2030 deploying massive amounts of nuclear bioenergy wind and solar and doing so every year for decadesIts possible yes but at a certain point that term loses much meaning Something that would require human beings to quickly and fundamentally change their collective behavior may not violate the laws of physics but it is unlikely given what we know about human beings path dependence and political dysfunction This is what I once called the brutal logic of climate changeThe question is who is responsible for publicizing the truth about the assumptions behind these scenarios Is it scientists Niklas Hhne director of the New Climate Institute offered a reasonable response to GedenI think theres a good bit of truth in this The integrated assessment models IAMs used to produce these scenarios are not meant to yield predictions or even plausible alternatives They show what outcomes result from a particular set of inputs they reflect their assumptions Theoretically policymakers ought to know this but political misuse of modeling is as old as modelingNonetheless the heated reactions elicited by Gedens piece do show that hes on to something You can see some of those reactions on BuzzFeed ClimateWire and Responding to Climate Change RTCC A few are just crazy and kneejerk like Bill Hare of Climate Analytics who lumped Geden in with climate skeptics and other naysayers who systematically downplay the risks of climate change and argue against action to reduce emissions on spurious and illfounded grounds That is roughly the opposite of what Geden doesOthers respond by in my view missing the point Stefan Rahmstorf and Michael Mann both insist that Geden is wrong that 2C is still physically possibleI dont take that as the main thrust of Gedens argument though Lots of things are physically possible that nonetheless require heroic assumptions about collective human behavior like say aggressive mitigation policy in the face of powerful vested interests harmonized across the globe sustained for decades  and also many gigatons worth of BECCS The question is not whether 2C scenarios violates laws of physical science but whether they are reasonable given what we know about human beingsThats not really a scientific judgment though is it Geden makes the same mistake when he writes the climate policy mantra  that time is running out for 2C but we can still make it if we act now  is a scientific nonsense No It may be a nonsense but its not a scientific nonsense No branch of science certainly not climatology can tell us what the humans of 2050 are capable of We are all on that score making educated guesses and a knowledge of history politics and economics will be just as important to that judgment as any knowledge of the physical sciencesI imagine the scientists want to blame the policy advisors and the politicians  after all they didnt hide the unrealistic assumptions they are right there in Appendix 17 for anyone interestedAnd yes theoretically the policy advisers surrounding politicians should make clear to them exactly the assumptions required to produce the 2C outcome And politicians should be straight with their constituents about those assumptionsHowever as the kids say these days politicians gonna politic They all have enormous incentive to try to thread the needle to accept the 2C target on one hand while maintaining that current policy commitments are adequate or might some day be adequate on the other To do that they need evidence that success is still within reachThere is not a politician on earth wants to tell his or her constituents Weve probably already blown our chance to avoid substantial suffering but if we work really hard and devote our lives to the cause we can somewhat reduce the even worse suffering that awaits our grandchildren crowd roarsAnd Geden is right that scientists have very little incentive to tell the unpleasant truths either They can stick to physical science and the possibility of 2C for quite a bit longer I would imagine Geden fears that the next big thing the next deus ex machina to save the 2C target is going to be solar radiation managements aka geoengineering If theyre told to model it what can scientists do Theyll model itThe sad fact is that no one has much incentive to break the bad news except ahem my colleague Brad Plumer Humans are subject to intense status quo bias Especially on the conservative end of the psychological spectrum  which is the direction all humans move when they feel frightened or under threat  there is a powerful craving for the message that things are basically okay that the system is working like its supposed to that the current state of affairs is the best available or close enoughTo be the one insisting that no things are not okay things are heading toward disaster is uncomfortable in any social milieu  especially since in most peoples experience those wailing about the end of the world are always wrong and frequently crazyYet here we are The fact is on our current trajectory in the absence of substantial new climate policy we are heading for up to 4C and maybe higher by the end of the century That will be on any clear reading of the available evidence catastrophic We are headed for disaster  slowly yes but surelyEven as many climate experts are now arguing that 2C is an inadequate target that it already represents unacceptable harms we are facing a situation in which limiting temperature even to 3C requires heroic policy and technology changesAnd yet  the world doesnt appear to be ending theres no big visible threat Climate change moves so slowly that its pace is evident primarily through graphs and statistics It rarely rises above the background noiseSo people want to hear that theres hope of 2C Politicians want to say that theres hope of 2C When asked modelers are still able to produce scenarios that show 2C And nobody wants to be the one to pee in the punch
