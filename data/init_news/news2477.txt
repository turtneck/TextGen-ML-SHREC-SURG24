Dragging on for an excruciating eternity this election season has demeaned democracy elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable Intellectually with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance ethically with a complete disregard for integrity and character and morally driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriolGiven that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera  it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonkBut whats doubly disappointing  as we head into the crucial presidential debates  is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates but also by the topics they gravitate to which the media frenzy then exacerbatesThese are topics that dont matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country the size of a candidates hands and therefore other body parts the nowmoot birther issue the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals the namecalling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom who is healthier than whom
