Attorney general nominee Loretta E Lynch carefully backed the Obama administrations policies on immigration and drug enforcement Wednesday sidestepping political tripwires before lawmakers deeply critical of the department she has been picked to leadDuring an allday confirmation hearing that highlighted Republican anger with the administration Lynch declined repeated opportunities to disavow actions taken by the Justice Department under Attorney General Eric H Holder JrInstead the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general cast herself as a career federal prosecutor determined to uphold the rule of law and willing to provide honest counsel to the president even when he might disagreeIn calm polished replies Lynch also acknowledged Republican concerns and pledged to foster a better relationship with lawmakers if confirmedYoure not Eric Holder are you Sen John Cornyn RTex asked at one pointLynch 55 the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York said she supports the use of the death penalty as an effective punishment and considers waterboarding torture and thus illegal She said it was the Justice Departments job to enforce the laws Congress passes but when pushed about Holders decision not to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act she said there are rare instances when careful analysis of existing laws raises constitutional issuesImmigration proved to be the most significant flash point during the hearing with Republicans voicing continuing outrage over the administrations executive actionsAt the start of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing which was interrupted many times as senators left to vote Chairman Charles E Grassley RIowa asked whether the president could defer deportations for millions of individuals in the country illegally and grant them permits and other benefits regardless of what the US Constitution or immigration laws sayLynch said that it was important for the Justice Department to ensure that any executive action be legal but that she was not involved in the decisions leading up to the presidents actionsReferring to a Justice Department memo on the presidents authority on immigration matters she said I dont see any reason to doubt the reasonableness of those viewsSen David Vitter RLa who has said he plans to vote against Lynch said he was very disappointed and frustrated with her responsesI have a huge concern regarding what I think is the presidents illegal unconstitutional executive amnesty and I have a huge concern of the fact that you think it is within the law Vitter said Sen Jeff Sessions RAla agreed with Vitter and said after the hearing that he will vote against LynchLynch is the first Obama Cabinet nominee to face a confirmation hearing since Republicans took over the Senate this year The department she has been selected to oversee has been a regular target of Republicans ire on a range of issues including investigations into the Internal Revenue Service and the attacks in Benghazi Libya and a botched guntrafficking operation run by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and ExplosivesSen Charles E Schumer DNY asked his colleagues not to turn this exceptional nominee into a political pointscoring exercise by badgering her on immigration and the controversy over the investigation into the IRSHe described Lynch as one of the keenest legal minds that our country has to offer someone who has excelled at every stage of her education and her career while cultivating a reputation as someone who was levelheaded fair judicious and eminently likableHolder  whose sixyear tenure overshadowed Wednesdays hearing  had a particularly rocky relationship with Congress Lynch has chaired the Justice Department committee that advises him on policy decisionsAmong the points of contention between the administration and Congress has been the Justice Departments policy on marijuana in response to the legalization of the drug in Colorado and Washington state The department announced that it would not challenge those state laws and said that in prosecutions it would prioritize marijuana offenses such as distribution to minorsAsked about her own views on marijuana Lynch said she does not support legalizationSessions asked Lynch whether she agreed with a remark made by President Obama  and published last year in the New Yorker magazine  that the drug was no more dangerous than alcoholI certainly dont hold that view and dont agree with that view of marijuana Lynch said I certainly think that the president was speaking from his personal experience and personal opinion neither of which Im able to shareWhen pressed on the legality of the National Security Agencys controversial surveillance programs Lynch replied that she believed they were constitutional and effectiveIf Lynch is confirmed as the 83rd attorney general she will take the reins of the Justice Department at a moment of high tension between law enforcement and minority communities across the countryIn her testimony she emphasized her strong bonds with law enforcement and her desire to heal the rifts between police and the communities they are tasked with protectingOne of her priorities she said will be to work to strengthen the vital relationships between our courageous law enforcement personnel and all the communities we serveIn my career I have seen this relationship flourish  I have seen law enforcement forge unbreakable bonds with community residents and have seen violenceravaged communities come together to honor officers who risked all

and the values instilled in her by her parents both from North CarolinaMy mother Lorine who was unable to travel here today is a retired English teacher and librarian for whom education was the key to a better life Lynch said She recalls people in her rural community pressing a dime or a quarter into her hands to support her college education As a young woman she refused to use segregated restrooms because they did not represent the America in which she believedShe instilled in me an abiding love of literature and learning and taught me the value of hard work and sacrifice Lynch saidLynchs father a fourthgeneration Baptist preacher opened his Greensboro church in the early 1960s to those planning sitins and marches standing with the protesters while carrying her on his shouldersAs I come before you today in this historic chamber I still stand on my fathers shoulders as well as on the shoulders of all those who have gone before me and who dreamed of making the promise of America a reality for all and worked to achieve that goal Lynch said I believe in the promise of America because I have lived the promise of America
