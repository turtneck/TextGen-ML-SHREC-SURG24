As the national furor continues over a controversial religious freedom law in Indiana that critics say could allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT customers one troubling fact is being left out of the debate in 29 states its already legal for a store owner to deny service to a gay person based on his sexual orientationWhile legal experts doubt Indianas Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA could be used to justify discrimination when it takes effect on July 1 most states including Indiana have long allowed it to happen because they dont have civil rights laws that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace housing and public accommodations hotels restaurants and other places that serve the general public Its not the religious freedom laws that allow discrimination its the lack of civil rights lawsAs a result in many states an employer can legally fire someone because hes gay a landlord can legally evict someone because shes lesbian and a hotel manager can legally deny service to someone whos transgender  without citing religious groundsIts not the religious freedom laws that allow discrimination its the lack of civil rights lawsIndiana in particular has no statewide nondiscrimination law for LGBT people although about a dozen cities including Indianapolis have local measuresThats whats missing in the Indiana debate Robin Wilson a law professor at the University of Illinois said If theres a license to discriminate its the fact that the state hasnt said this is an unacceptable basis for saying no to peopleBut its not just Indiana Depending on how you add it up as many as 33 states dont have full protections for all LGBT people because a few states with nondiscrimination protections dont protect trans people and some dont ban all antiLGBT discrimination in public accommodationsCurrently 19 states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity while three additional states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation Some other states protect public but not private employees from discrimination Many municipalities have nondiscrimination laws that only apply within their local borders And some companies prohibit discrimination in their own policiesThe protections sometimes vary from state to state Massachusettss protections for gender identity and Utahs protections for sexual orientation and gender identity dont apply to public accommodations Some states like Utah also include exemptions for discrimination based on religious groundsLGBT advocates argue the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already protects LGBT workers from discrimination but that interpretation of the federal law hasnt been proven in court
