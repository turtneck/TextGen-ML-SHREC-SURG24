AQ is a special series that inverts the classic QA taking some of the most frequently posed solutions to pressing matters of policy and exploring their complexity In modern politics nothing brings people together more than talking about how far apart they are Twelve years ago a speech denouncing political polarization thrust Barack Obama into the national spotlight and that very premise will outlast him when he leaves the White House next January The American public is dividedover economic policy social policy foreign policy race privacy and national security and many other things A host of factors from partisan gerrymandering to exclusionary party primaries are driving them further apart Here we break down those factors behind our polarized politics along with some of the most common proposals to fix it Political polarization is worse now than its ever been Lets stop right there Is this really true Its a common cry of politicians governmentreform advocates pundits journalists and disaffected voters to bemoan the state of politics and declare that Washington is broken perhaps irrevocably But people often forget that American history is rife with examples of debilitating polarization that make the partisan battles of today pale by comparison This was a key point President Obama made in his recent speech to the Illinois General Assembly where he said that it isnt true that todays issues are inherently more polarizing than the pastA fundamental dispute over the institution of slavery plunged the nation into a civil war a centuryandahalf ago In 1856 violence over slavery erupted in the august chamber of the US Senate when an antislavery lawmaker from Massachusetts Charles Sumner was caned on the Senate floor by a member of the House from South Carolina Preston Brooks Fans of the Broadway hit Hamilton have also been reminded of another black mark on US political history when the nations first Treasury secretary was killed in a duel by the sitting vice president Aaron Burr in 1804 More recently look at the emotional debates over racial equality and the Vietnam War during the 1960s and 1970s The country witnessed the assassinations of John F and Robert Kennedy Martin Luther King and Malcolm X The segregationist former governor of Alabama George Wallace was shot and paralyzed while he campaigned for president in 1972 Rioting and civil unrest plagued major cities and college campuses across the countries for long stretches at a time Fine the 1860s and the 1960s were bad But the fact that the nation hasnt fallen into civil war and our leaders havent been gunned down is a pathetically low bar for a firstworld country with the greatest military and strongest economy on Earth Even during the tumult of the 1960s Congress created Medicare and Medicaid enacted landmark civilrights legislation and passed a sweeping education bill that still serves as the foundation for federal funding of public schools todayEver since Obamas first two years in office Congress hasnt done anything except shut down the government and come close to tanking the economy with a neardefault on the nations debt Immigration reform stalled Gun reform went nowhere Congress cant even agree to declare war on ISIS and now that Antonin Scalia has died it might leave the Supreme Court shorthanded for more than a year Congress is hopelessly gridlocked and we need major political reform to fix it Whats wrong with Congress Or more precisely Is anything actually wrong with Congress or is it simply functioning how it was designed to function The confrontations over the last few years have led to rampant complaints that the national legislature is dysfunctional which in turn has contributed to a stunninglylow approval rating for Congress It sunk to single digits and has recently hovered in the lowtomid teens For one lawmakers in Washington have struggled not only to pass big bills but theyve had trouble completing even the most routine tasks of governance In 2011 Republicans refused for months to raise the debt limit and nearly caused an unprecedented default that could have sunk the fragile economic recovery Two years later conservatives forced a twoandahalf week government shutdown over funding for the healthcare law In the Senate both partiesand particularly Republicans until last yearhave used the filibuster more frequently than ever before to stall legislation and presidential appointments This has led to calls to either reform the filibuster or scrap it entirely as a way to speed up the legislative process and make it easier for Congress to reflect the will of the people In 2013 Democrats did change the rules to make it easier to confirm executive and judicial appointees below the Supreme Court and Republicans didnt bother to reverse those changes when they took control last yearYet for all of the consternation if you are a Democrat Congress functioned quite well in the first two years of Obamas term The House and Senate passed so much significant legislationthe stimulus bill health care student loans and Wall Street reformthat the White House and congressional Democrats had trouble explaining it all to voters Then came the Tea Party wave of 2010 and the American people elected a Republican House to serve as a check on the Obama administration Its only natural that divided government would lead to some gridlock because Congress was designed to only pass laws if there is a consensus in favor of themespecially in the Senate which was created as a check on the inflamed passions that would lead to political overreactions by the House So if you dont like how Congress is working blame the Founderswhich is exactly what my colleague Yoni Appelbaum did last year when he wrote that the gridlock on display in recent years may be a product of flaws inherent in the Constitutions design Sure but the Founders never imagined that partisan gerrymandering would render the House of Representatives so polarized that most lawmakers now fear a primary challenge from the right or left more than they fear losing to the other party in a general election They have no incentive to compromise We need nonpartisan redistricting commissions to redraw the lines and make House members more accountable to people other than the extremes of each partyWell the Founders never imagined political parties at allbut that doesnt mean the system cant work Is redistricting reform possible and would redrawing House districts help reduce polarization The 435 congressional districts are redrawn every 10 years after the Census and historically it has been the purview of state legislatures to determine the districts in their state Naturally the party in power tends to draw them to maximize its advantage a process that over time has resulted in some totally ridiculouslooking districts that stretch horizontally or diagonally across states or connect two population centers with a strip as thin as a single road The Washington Post did a good rundown of the most oddlyshaped districts in 2014 The Republican wave election in 2010 which extended from Congress down to governorships and state legislatures gave the GOP significant power in redistricting after the decennial Census that year The results were obvious in 2012 when Republicans retained a large majority in House seats 234201 despite the fact that Democrats won 14 million more votes than GOP candidates in House races Yet complaints about gerrymandering cross party lines When Obama spoke in Illinois it was the Republicans in the state legislature who cheered his call for reform knowing that in the Land of Lincoln it is Democrats who draw the districts And two retiring members of the GOPs Tea Party class of 2010 Representatives Richard Hanna of New York and Scott Rigell of Virginia blamed gerrymandering for some of the hyperpartisanship they experienced during their years in CongressGoodgovernment groups have been pushing for states to turn over their redistricting process to nonpartisanor at least truly bipartisancommissions as a way to keep politicians from picking their voters rather than the other way around This past June the Supreme Court gave a boost to these efforts by upholding the congressional map drawn by an independent commission in Arizona that had been created through a successful ballot initiative The Republicancontrolled state legislature had tried to invalidate the commissions map by arguing that the Constitution vested the power to draw districts in the legislatures hands not the voters In a 54 opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg the high court sided with the voterempowered commission A dozen states including California currently use some form of a commission to draw districts and New York will turn to one after the 2020 Census According to NYUs Brennan Center for Justice there are serious reform efforts underway in an additional nine states Given the intense interest state legislators have in keeping power over redistricting both on the local and federal level even reform advocates acknowledge it is difficult to see the total elimination of partisan gerrymandering across the country anytime soon As for whether redistricting commissions actually lead to less polarization that answer also is likely a long way off When California implemented its new map in 2012 there was a big increase in turnover in the states congressional delegation But it will take a while to assess whether those new legislators are any less partisan or more accountable to their constituents than their predecessorsIts the parties themselves that are the problem They were never supposed to have this much influence over elections More and more voters consider themselves independent but in many district and statewide elections in heavily Republican or Democratic areas the only race that matters is the primary and independent voters often find themselves shut out Every state should follow the California and Nebraska model and adopt nonpartisan elections which empower more voters earlier in the electoral process Would nonpartisan elections in place of party primaries reempower the political center by engaging more independent voters Thats the argument from the advocates behind Open Primaries a group that is pushing states nationwide to replicate the models in California which went to a toptwo primary system in 2012 and Nebraska which has had a nonpartisan state legislature since 1936 Toptwo or jungle primaries are tailormade for districts or states that are dominated by one party In those elections whether in deepred rural areas or heavilyliberal urban districts often the party primary is the only competitive race and the general election becomes a onesided affair If the primaries are reserved only for registered Republicans or Democrats independents are effectively shut out of the voting process and the election becomes a race to the right or left and rarely the center The idea behind creating a toptwo primary thats open to everyone is that voters would have two opportunities to legitimately weigh in And in districts or states where two members of the same party end up going up against each other it would force them to compete in the general election for the votes of the entire electorate not just the party baseAdvocates hold up Nebraska as an exemplar citing the fact that even though its a conservative state its nonpartisan legislature has been able to reach agreement on bills to raise the gas tax abolish the death penalty and give drivers licenses to undocumented immigrantspolicies that would be unthinkable in many Republicandominated states There are now efforts to enact nonpartisan elections through ballot initiatives in Arizona and South Dakota although supporters acknowledge that the idea hasnt yet gained much support in Congress or reached a tipping point in many other states And opponents argue that nonpartisan elections would disproportionately benefit wealthy candidates who want to circumvent the party system as Michael Bloomberg did when he was elected mayor of New York and promptly triedand failedto implement nonpartisan elections in the city The solution is automatic voter registration or even compulsory voting like they have in Australia Would more engagement decrease polarization Its possible One big critique of the current state of politics is that because such a low percentage of people typically vote those that do hold more power and they are more likely to be either very liberal or very conservative This is especially true in party primaries which often determine the winner in lopsided states and districts and in which the most motivated people are likeliest to vote Oregon and California have enacted laws to automatically register people who have drivers licenses and who are otherwise eligible to vote Hillary Clinton has endorsed the policy nationally Why Americans Are So Polarized Education and Evolution Two Versions of America Emerge in the Presidential Campaign In Australia eligible citizens are required to vote and can face a fine or a court date if they dont Not surprisingly the turnout rate there is more than 95 percent In a 2010 policy paper William Galston of the Brookings Institution recommended that states experiment with compulsory voting as a way to reduce polarization and force candidates to appeal to a broader electorate Needless to say that is unlikely to happen in the United States on a large scale anytime soon Even the push for universal registration with the potential to opt out has drawn opposition from Republicans who argue that people shouldnt be forced to participate if they dont want toThere is also skepticism among conservatives that the effort is more about Democrats trying to increase voting among minority and young voters who tend to lean their way and who vote less frequently than older white citizens Lets be honest The real issue isnt gerrymandering or the parties Its money The influence of wealthy donors has only gotten more pronounced over the years and the Supreme Courts 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case only tilted the scales even more in the direction of corporations and billionaires We need to overturn Citizens United and fully adopt public financing of elections Isnt money the root of all thats wrong in politics today Do we have any hope of reducing polarization if we cant get rid of the corrupting influence of money Theres no denying that politics is awash in money The presidential campaign is now a billiondollar industry and it takes millions of dollars to win races for governor senator and even some for the House The Citizens United decision allowed wealthy interests to spend unlimited sums of money to run ads in support of or in opposition to candidates and the result has been an even greater flood of negative ads on television around election time Yet while there are legitimate concerns about candidates being beholden to the billionaires supporting them money in politics doesnt flow entirely in the direction of polarization Take Bloomberg for example Inarguably the billionaire businessman would not have been mayor of New York without the tens of millions he spent to win his elections But he is seen as a centrist figure in politics and has spent money on the national level decrying partisanship and dysfunction even though he has taken partisan positions on certain issues like guns and climate changeBigbusiness groups like the US Chamber of Commerce also spend large sums of money to influence elections But while the Chamber ardently opposes Obamacare and environmental regulations costly to industry it sides with the establishment against the Tea Party in other areas and has spent heavily to back compromises on things like infrastructure bills and immigration reform Money may tip the scales in favor of corporate interests and the whims of the wealthy but that doesnt always benefit the extremes In the end there may not be any oneshot solutions or simple answers The present degree of political polarization didnt arise overnight and seems unlikely to dissipate that quickly either But even if they dont solve the entirety of the problem many voters are drawn to particular solutionsand theres evidence that some can make at least an incremental difference These are some of the intriguing questions left to consider What does the shocking popularity of Donald Trump say about political polarization Is his success a reflection of a deep split or does it actually transcend polarization because he is winning support among Republican voters despite having so many positions that contradict conservative orthodoxy If the Republican Party really does split this summer what are the chances of a viable thirdparty or independent candidacy and what impact could that have on political polarization Beyond this election is the creation of a viable third party or centrist movement another possible solution to polarization Is polarization strictly a national problem Does the fact that we see more bipartisanship in state government offer hope that polarization in Washington will begin to soften On what issues are Americansand their elected representativesactually not polarized What are the remaining areas of consensus Maybe theres an answer we havent considered yet Drop your thoughts into an email to hellotheatlanticcom
