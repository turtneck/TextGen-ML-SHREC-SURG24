CNN CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the CNN debate of Republican presidential candidates Who were the winners and losers The opinions expressed in these commentaries are theirsThe Republican race for president just got a lot more seriousAt the second Republican presidential debate there was minimal namecalling and personal insults by Donald Trump and all of the candidates not named Donald Trump rushed into the void taking advantage of an opportunity to make a good impression  succeeding more often than notThe clearest winner of the debate was Carly Fiorina who successfully challenged Trump  criticizing his wisecracks about her personal appearance and challenging his credentials as a global businessman by deftly ticking off hotspots around the world and suggesting ways she would tackle themBut other candidates took turns at laying out specific plans and contrasting their ideas with those of their rivals Sen Rand Paul a libertarian took issue with Jeb Bushs vow to crack down on recreational marijuana and Chris Christie jumped into the conversation to warn about the dangers of marijuana use leading to abuse of harder drugs  a point underscored by Fiorina who talked about the death of her stepdaughter who was a drug userThe big news in all of this was that the field of candidates werent dancing to Trumps tune Instead they talked in a serious way about serious issues and for considerable swaths of the debate it was possible to forget Trump was onstage at all Marco Rubio and Christie went back and forth on climate change and Ted Cruz debated Bush over the process and criteria for naming Supreme Court justices Ben Carson argued for a twotier minimum wageIt remains true that a large percentage of the Republican voting base is disgusted by politicians and convinced that a brash straighttalker like Trump might fix this But the debate served as a reminder that Trumps 30 support also means that 70 of Republican voters are looking for a different candidate to support The debate proved they have plenty of viable choicesTo be taken half as seriously as a man goes an old adage a woman must be twice as good Her male rivals ought to be taking Carly Fiorina a lot more seriously than that today because she was better  a lot better  than most of them in the CNN debateShe came prepared with crisp coherent responses to nearly every issue raised and delivered two of the best monologues of the night  one when she spoke movingly about burying a child lost to drug addiction the other about empowering every woman to realize her aspirations She also put down Donald Trump on his slur about her face he lamely praised her looks when instead he should have apologizedTrump seemed tight at the start needlessly picking fights but he got his bearings halfway through and finished upbeat I doubt he will pay much of a price for his early bombast but he may well see Fiorina more than Ben Carson soon nipping at his heelsA debate that seemed long did have one major virtue it allowed other candidates far more openings to distinguish themselves Marco Rubio and Chris Christie took the most advantage both were much more effective than in the first debate The race itself like the debate is likely to seesaw back and forth for many weeks to comeDavid Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been a White House adviser to four presidents A graduate of Harvard Law School he is a professor of public service and codirector of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy SchoolCarly Fiorina won on style and substance Unlike Marco Rubio who dominated the few times he spoke Fiorina made sure she had more than a few bites at the mic Unlike Jeb Bush who could only politely respond to Donald Trumps insults while still losing most of the exchanges Fiorina proved to be the only candidate who could effectively push back on Trump and his substancefree assertionsHer perfectly calibrated and classy response to his insult of her face was an instant classic destined to dominate debate highlight reels Now Trump is calling Carly Fiorina a wonderful person and beautiful Thats the TrumpEnglish definition for apology  Thats FiorinaEnglish for a winFiorina handled the attacks on her business record deftly and then attacked Trumps habit of hanging creditors out to dry in the wake of his bankruptcies For a GOP generally in trouble with women shes the only candidate that could get away with calling the move to change the face on the 20 bill a pander And shes right We should know our history and make new history  today  by considering Carly Fiorina the breakout top tier candidate of Round 2Margaret Hoover is the president of the rightleaning advocacy group American Unity Fund and author of American Individualism How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party She is the host of SiriusXMs Get It Right with Margaret HooverTrump came out swinging  but ended up missing Not only wasnt he substantive  again  but he made some pretty bizarre statements He thinks a flat tax is more complicated than a regressive tax He said that vaccines cause autism He wants Syria and ISIS to fight each other He will get along with Putin This stuff doesnt hold up to scrutiny The question is whether any is ever applied to TrumpBen Carson also suffered some serious stumbles that will likely hurt him namely the bizarre suggestion that a bully pulpit would have been a better response to 911 than fighting terrorists Saying that Americans arent willing to perform agriculture jobs that our Air Force isnt capable and our Marines arent ready is pretty irresponsible stuffI think Carly Fiorina on the other hand managed to beat already high expectations She was sharp quick on her feet and delivered more than one great applause line Particularly effective was her emotional plea to defund Planned Parenthood And she used every opportunity to get as granular and specific on policy as she could I expect her poll numbers to riseSE Cupp is the author of Losing Our Religion The Liberal Medias Attack on Christianity coauthor of Why Youre Wrong About the Right and a columnist at the New York Daily NewsNo big themes no clear sense of vision emerged from the three hours of jawing in tonights debate Such are the downsides I suppose of putting 11 candidates on a stage and divvying up 1minute slots for each candidate to make a markSo we saw flashes of Christie the populist Fiorina the Trump slayer Kasich the sunny multilateralist Trump the bombast Rand the constitutionalist Carson the logician But their claims didnt add up to much that was especially comprehensible certainly not memorableTo be sure there were moments  the best perhaps being Fiorina telling Trump that women across America know exactly what he meant when he insulted her looks Rubio gave another strong performance though it remains unclear whether he can capitalize on these performances on the campaign trail Huckabee and Walker by contrast couldnt seem to nudge the conversation much at allMy wish for the next debate on October 28 We narrow down the list dig a little deeper and force the candidates to say something serious about the confluence of urban challenges associated with class race and drug enforcement that just now only Rand Paul seems willing to discussBiggest winner George W Bush long forgotten who was invoked as the man who kept America safe  a claim that received the loudest applause of the nightBiggest disappointment Once again no serious or sustained discussion of issues involving race poverty and violence in American cities These were barely recognized last go around They werent so much as mentioned tonightWilliam Howell is the Sydney Stein professor in American politics at the University of ChicagoCarly Fiorina was the big winner tonight She is the only candidate to date to take on Trump and come out a winner She was polished showed policy depth and has the outsider bio that is so in vogue this year Fiorina now has more momentum than any Republican candidate not named Trump has had in this campaignRubio was also very sharp tonight but he seems unable to have the sorts of moments that get shared online and talked out around the dinner table which is why he went down not up in the polls after a similarly solid performance in the last debateJeb Bush was markedly better than the last debate which is like being the tallest of the seven dwarves but his most memorable moment was passionately defending his brother whose legacy is an albatross around his neckUltimately the eventual Democratic nominee was the biggest winner because the Republicans continue to unlearn all the lessons of 2012 by taking far right positions on immigration womens health and climate changeDan Pfeiffer is a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and served in the White House in a variety of roles including communications directorAt nearly three hours this was a debate for the true political junkies To me the most resonant memory was that of the various Republican presidential candidates on and off the camera crying Jake Jake to moderator Jake Tapper signaling their desire to jump into the discussionIronically for a debate that took place at the Ronald Reagan library the 2016 hopefuls showed that they differ in style from our 40th president Reagan was known for his sunny disposition He was a genial man who did not hurl insults at his rivals He appealed to Americans best selves with his innate optimism By contrast the Republicans on the stage tonight presented a gloomy vision of our nation and at time acted peevish and petulant with one another  a far cry from the courtly ReaganYet for all the attacks on each other the candidates also missed opportunities to call each other out Nobody pointed out that for much of her adult life Carly Fiorina did not bother to vote at all Nobody mentioned that under Sen Marco Rubios proposed overhaul of our immigration policies people like his working class parents would not have been allowed in the country Nobody asked Mike Huckabee about the religious liberties of American Muslims or MormonsThe immigration portion of the debate meanwhile was a disappointment The immigration proposal that merited the most discussion was Donald Trumps impractical inhumane plan for mass deportations It was disheartening to see legitimate questions about immigration reform devolve into sniping about speaking Spanish birthright citizenship and  of course  border securityAny serious consideration of what to do with the estimated 11 million undocumented people already here was missing  as was any mention of the fact that conservative icon Reagan signed the Immigration and Control Act of 1986 which allowed nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants to get amnesty after entering the country illegallyEqually troubling was the fact that the Black Lives Matter movement  one of the most powerful social justice movements of our time  did not merit any discussionThe winner tonight That would be Fiorina She faced up to personal and professional attacks with aplomb Her experience in corporate America has clearly given her the skills necessary for making a strong presentation Not at all hesitant about asserting herself she proved that she belonged on the big stage tonightThe loser tonight was Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker He has been fading in the polls lately and this was his chance to show potential supporters and donors that he is still a major player Instead between Trumps bravado and the occasional flourishes of the other candidates  Rubio on foreign policy Fiorina on her business record  Walker seemed to get lost in the shuffle Unlike nearly every other candidate Walker did not have one strong momentLike most I thought Carly Fiorina was tonights big winner I think her strongest moment had nothing to do with Donald TrumpThe weak field helped Trump kicked Jeb Bush around like a failed prospect on The Apprentice Bushs biggest applause line was defending his brother which Im sure the Hillary Clinton campaign loved Nearly all rushed to promise magical toughness fixes to the Middle East and more deportations while failing to mention the economy until it was an excuse not to act on climate changeFiorina reminds me of a more human Mitt Romney She is a polished and poised debater The question is whether her business track record of mass layoffs comes back to haunt her as it did RomneyBut on Wednesday tonight she combined personal stories with policy specifics better than anyone else on the stage Asked about drug policy reform she gave a heartbreaking account of the loss of a child that moved every watching parent of all parties  and then transitioned seamlessly into a conservative case for reforming our criminal justice systemThat answer was all the more impressive because it came in the midst of a number of strong responses that showed the broad consensus on scaling back our system of mass incarceration Kudos to CNNs Jake Tapper for posing a question that moved us past Trumps noisy racism and provoked Bushs apology to his mom Fiorinas tearjerker and a healthy dose of substanceJulian Zelizer Rivals figure out how to undercut TrumpIn the first half of the debate Donald Trump succeeded in his basic campaign strategy make the entire contest about him When most people were watching Trump was continually a focal point of the discussion Early on he launched a series of ad hominem attacks like telling Rand Paul he shouldnt even be on the stage and making quips about his looksThis has been his strategy since entering the race  constantly attack and constantly be attacked Either way the result is that Trump is the story In an age of mediadriven politics where video clips and quick sound bites are the currency of choice he advances his causeDuring the first two hours the moderators often used Trumps statements on immigration or on Fiorinas business record for example as the basis of their questions to other candidates Very often the split screen would show answers by someone like Christie with the other half of the screen still on Trump whether or not this was relevantBut during the last hour of the debate when fewer people were watching his opponents started to show that the best way to undercut is to talk about issues Besides all the blows Trump suffered including the basic message that he is an entertainer rather than a leader the camera was no longer focused on himMany of the candidates had their moments Carly Fiorina scored points with conservatives when she talked about defunding Planned Parenthood as well as her call for policies to help women in the workplace Her overall performance including her retort to Trumps comments about her appearance won applause Sen Marco Rubio offered emotional answers to the questions about immigration and showed his chops on foreign policySen Ted Cruz got in a few criticisms of the Supreme Court while John Kasich boasted of his deep experience and ability to move to the centerWisconsin Gov Scott Walker touted the record of his administration while New Jersey Gov Chris Christie finally had a chance to talk about issues other than scandalous bridges including economic growth and law and order His performance gave a boost to a dying candidacyPaul discussed drugs and criminal justice as well as the need to limit American involvement overseas Ben Carson spoke about vaccine policies and defending free markets and wealth Jeb Bush had a chance to defend his brothers policies after 911 connecting his statements to how he would address terrorismWhenever foreign policy came up Trump almost seemed to duck down behind his lectern Just as important all of the candidates started to make tougher statements about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remembering that ultimately she would be the main target of the GOP Who will prosecute Hillary Clinton asked ChristieWhile this debate probably wont knock Trump off from his pedestal it offers a road map to his opponents about how to undercut his success Shifting to issues and shifting to policies  not allowing him to shape the entire conversation  is the best way to trump TrumpWinner Anyone but Trump although Trump was not a clear loserMaria Cardona Rivals knew it was make or breakTonights debate finally started to break the Trump fever The other GOP candidates found their inner adults stood up to Trump  somewhat  and importantly demonstrated their command and experience on policy details and their more realistic solutions to the countrys problemsWhile they are all wrong on the issues  their immigration divisiveness and their focus on defunding Planned Parenthood to the point of forcing a government shutdown are dangerous territory and weaken the partys general election viability  it was clear they all knew how much was riding on their performancesCarly Fiorina was masterful throughout the debate She was adroit witty and showed she would not back down but did so in a very graceful way She also schooled Donald Trump and many of the others on foreign policy and other issues She played and looked the partMarco Rubio shone brightly when discussing foreign policy and his and Fiorinas command of subject matter was a stark contrast with Trump who was completely absent from the discussionJeb Bush did a much better job this time around but still lost tonight He is such a cringeworthy awkward candidate And while he went toe to toe with Trump at times and had a good funny line towards the end when asked what Secret Service code name he would choose  Eveready he said looking at Trump because its high energy  he looked uncomfortable in his own skin every time he tried to defend himself or get tough with TrumpWill this be the beginning of the dimming of Trump who up until now had gotten away with myths bluster distortions and outright lies in the place of facts solutions pragmatic approaches respect and grace Still early to say but at least the candidates scored some important points against Trump and used the opportunity to let voters get to know them betterThe biggest winner from Thursday nights CNN Republican presidential candidate debate Carly Fiorina Not only did she speak with expertise and fluency on policy but Fiorina added some emotional inflection and personal touches to connect with the voters Most importantly of all she managed to be the first candidate to go toetotoe with Trump on stage and come out the clear victorFiorina was joined by several other candidates with standout performances Sen Marco Rubio who if not the eventual president might make a great secretary of state came off as polished on stage and wonky on policy The same was true for Sen Ted Cruz who burnished his constitutionalist credentials at every opportunity and focused his fire on President Barack Obamas administration rather than his fellow GOP candidates Gov Chris Christie for his part also turned in a solid performance as he managed to pull off both bravado and charm  even managing to sound earnestly conservative a few timesThe biggest loser tonight Donald Trump not only because he clearly didnt win but he even failed to be the center of attention beyond the opening minutes of the debate Trump is of course style over substance but even his style faltered tonightAnd while he had a few entertaining humorous moments Trump also had some headshaking blunders His nonapology to Fiorina where he called her beautiful crashed and burned  you could almost hear the groans across AmericaOthers in the not good enough category were Sen Rand Paul Gov Scott Walker and Gov John Kasich all of of whom may be following Gov Rick Perrys lead in exiting the race much sooner than they anticipatedSurprisingly this was not episode No 2 of the Trump and Friends reality show that many expected and frankly some hoped for from an entertainment point of viewThis was much more of a substantive debate in part because the candidates refused to fight with each other or the moderators  with a few exceptions ie Donald Trump versus Rand Paul This allowed the debate to reveal a contrast between the candidates who were pandering offering conservative GOP primary voters red meat on issues and those candidates who were being realistic and responsible such as on issues like immigration and the Iran nuclear dealFor example Jake Tapper challenged Donald Trump using a quote of Ben Carson about his plan to deport the 11 million plus undocumented immigrants as being unworkable We heard Ted Cruz boast that he would tear up the Iran deal if elected president But Trump and Ohio Gov John Kasich focused on enforcing the agreement And Carly Fiorina called out Trumps proposal to end birthright citizenship as being wholly impracticable because it would require amending the 14th AmendmentThe race is now moving from the reality show mode to one of substance which might be a little less exciting but better for voters in assessing the candidatesOnce again Carly Fiorina stole the show Her comfort level on stage command of the issues and her ability to deliver razor sharp responses cut down Donald Trump with the precision of a political scalpel Fiornia accomplished something no other candidate on that stage was yet to do She made Donald Trump and his egomaniacal larger than life candidacy look smallWhile Trump engaged in his typical nonsequitur ad hominem attacks Fiorina came across thoughtful prepared and tough on issues both foreign and domestic When Jake Tapper asked Fiorina to respond to Trumps insult of her face during a Rolling Stone interview and his attempt to walk it back by claiming that he meant her persona not her looks she simply said to thunderous applause I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump saidAt that point Trump pulled up lame He responded I think she has a beautiful face Shes a beautiful woman which was met with crickets and collective incredulity from the audience It was one of the most memorable exchanges of the night It felt as though Trump showed up prepared for a Comedy Central roast not a debate to help decide the next leader of the free worldAnother standout moment came during a discussion on defunding Planned Parenthood over its fetal organ harvesting controversy when Fiorina looked into the camera and challenged President Obama and Hillary Clinton to watch these tapes  Watch a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain  This is about the character of our nation and if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill shame on us A man sitting next to me said I just got goose bumps As did IBoth Carly Fiorina and Sen Marco Rubio who in his own right had another very strong night especially on foreign policy matters came across as the adults in the room and delivered powerful performances on issues that resonate with the American people Well see if thats reflected in the polls moving forwardTara Setmayer is former communications director for Rep
