President Obama is under fire fromThe Washington Posts factchecker over a series of recent farfetched gun claims including suggesting the countrys homicide rate is higher than that of other industrialized nations by like a mileThe comments made during a stop in South Carolina last week earned the president three out of four Pinocchios  the factcheckers scale for measuring inaccuracyThe first factcheck involved a comment Obama made  at a town hall at South Carolinas Benedict College  where he said What we have to recognize is is that our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrial countries I mean by like a mileThe president seemed to be telling students the US had the highest homicide rate in the industrialized world which isnt true according to the newspaper According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development the average homicide rate among the 36 countries is 41 per 100000 people Brazil tops the list with a homicide rate of 255 The US and Chile tie for fourth Both have a homicide rate of 52The president also told those attending the South Carolina event that its easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetableThis is just a very strange comment that appears to have no statistical basis the Washington Post wrote The paper added that some of its readers suggested Obama was talking about the US Department of Agricultures food desert locator which identifies areas in the country where fresh vegetables are hard to buyThe columnist acknowledged that some of the analysis in the factcheck turns on what the listener believes the president was trying to sayFinally the factcheck took the president to task after he told students he was not exaggerating when he claimed lawmakers are backing plans that would allow firearms in kindergarten and machine guns in barsWhile some states like Georgia allow firearms to be carried into bars and restaurants they do not allow machine guns in bars And while there have been proposals floated to allow guns in schools  mainly college campuses  none of the proposals specifically address kindergarten
