President Obama plans to propose raising 320 billion over the next 10 years in new taxes targeting wealthy individuals and big financial institutions to pay for new programs designed to help lower and middleincome families senior administration officials said SaturdayIn his State of the Union address Tuesday night Obama will propose raising the capital gains and dividend tax rates to 28percent for high earners imposing a fee on the liabilities of about 100 big financial institutions and greatly broadening the amount of inherited money subject to taxesObama will also seek to boost private retirement savings by requiring employers without 401k plans to make it easier for fulltime and parttime workers to save in individual retirement accounts which could assist as many as 30million people The administration would provide small employers tax credits to cover costsSenior administration officials said that the package would highlight the presidents desire to boost taxes on the nations wealthy households and help lower and middleclass families New tax credits would help those in need of child care and households with two earners they said while other proposals  such as covering community college tuition  would help studentsThe moves would eliminate the biggest tax loopholes and use the savings to let the middle class get ahead said one of the senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity during a conference call with reporters to describe the plan before the presidents speech This person also said that 99percent of the impact of the tax increases would fall on the top 1percent of earnersThe ambitious  and controversial  proposals demonstrate the White Houses increasing confidence about the trajectory of the US economy For the past year and a half it has debated how much it could trumpet the recovery when so many Americans have not felt any change in their own economic outlookBut the plan drew immediate fire from Republican  and could face criticism from some Democrats  who have in the past increased the amount of money exempt from inheritance taxes they branded death taxes Most Republicans have long opposed increases in capital gains rates and many favor eliminating the tax altogetherThis is not a serious proposal wrote Brendan Buck a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan RWis in an email late Saturday We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler flatter tax code not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spendingSlapping American small businesses savers and investors with more tax hikes only negates the benefits of the tax policies that have been successful in helping to expand the economy promote savings and create jobs Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G Hatch RUtah said in a statement Saturday nightThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax codeThe administration tried to head off some of that attack by asserting that elements of the package resembled proposals endorsed by Republicans Officials also said that the capital gains tax rate was 28percent during President Ronald Reagans terms in office The Obama administration would also seek to limit the impact of the tax increases by saying the higher capital gains and dividend rates would apply only to couples earning more than 500000 a yearOfficials said that the relatively low capital gains tax rate with a top rate of 20percent has enabled the 400 highestearning taxpayers  with 139million or more of income  to pay an average rate of 17percent when the top income tax rate is 35percentThe proposal to impose a 7 basis point fee on financial institutions with assets of more than 50billion will also run smack into opposition from big banks and insurance companies The administration compared the fee with a proposal by former House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp RMich for an excise tax on large financial institutions And last week the House Budget Committees ranking Democrat Rep Chris Van Hollen DMd proposed a 01percent surcharge on financial market transactionsOne of the senior administration officials Saturday said that the goal of the proposed fee from the White House was to discourage big financial institutions from excessive borrowing He said that despite banking revisions after the 20082009 financial crisis highly leveraged financial institutions still pose risks to the broader economy adding that this fee is designed to make that activity more costlyThe economic recovery has freed the president to push for more ambitious domestic policies many designed to help those in the poor and middle class who are still lagging behind In the past week alone Obama has announced new proposals on paid sick leave free community college tuition and expanded broadband access And while he might have trouble pushing those through the GOPcontrolled Congress Obama could still end up defining key issues for the elections in 2016The battle for the next American agenda is already on said Donald A Baer chief executive of BursonMarsteller and formerly chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton Theres this effort to define a new growth and share agenda  growth but not only growth alone and sharing the growth but not just sharing the wealth He said Obamas college and broadband access are examples of proposals that could add to growth and give poor and middleclass people the tools to increase their share in itBut Obama has to balance his rhetoric  between optimism and caution  by talking up the strong recovery while acknowledging that wage growth remains weakTheres always been a tension between things are in fact getting better and people are not feeling great said Wade Randlett a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and major Democratic donor One is economic fact and the other is polling which always catches up over timeNow the president is so comfortable with the idea of talking up the economic recovery that his advisers have branded it  Americas resurgence  and made it a regular talking point in Obamas stump speeches and weekly radio addresses And it is likely to be a centerpiece of the State of the Union addressIn bragging about performance Obama administration officials point to factors including the best streak of job growth since the 1990s a recovery in the housing market and healthier balance sheets for households companies and the federal government And they have contrasted that performance with the anemic economies of Europe and Japan as evidence that the United States has regained its global economic dominance in what Obama has called a breakthrough year for AmericaBut wages have been a stubborn reminder of the recoverys shortcomings In November average hourly privatesector nominal wages inched up 6cents but in December they fell 5 cents After adjusting for inflation wages for the entire year crawled up 07percent a modest amount in an economic recovery It is a point that has been featured prominently in comments by Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass who has emerged as a leader of the Democratic Partys liberal wingIm feeling better about the economy but I dont think we have in place a set of policies that will assure that this recovery will be either sustained or fully inclusive said Lawrence H Summers a former top adviser to Obama former Treasury secretary and now a professor at Harvard University Thats why I think more needs to be doneThe White House typically aims its messages directly at the middle class but partly in response to Warren Obama administration officials are more comfortable talking about how some of its proposals benefit poorer AmericansWere on offense on minimum wage and the environment Randlett said Thats the kind you only do when you have the leash of good economics
