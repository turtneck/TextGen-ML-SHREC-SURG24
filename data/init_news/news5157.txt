Editors Note  Disgusting This country just gets more and more corrupt by the day its insane Pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruptionThe Pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers names for up to 30 days after a policerelated death has occurred It was backed by Philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by Democratic Governor Tom WolfThe measure passed Thursday after the Republicancontrolled legislature voted along party lines If the bill becomes law it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or  serious bodily injury  for up to 30 days after the incident or until the conclusion of an official investigationThe bill HB 1538 was sponsored by state Rep Martina White RPhiladelphia and is a direct contradiction of the Philadelphia Police Departments policy of releasing names within 72 hours of a shootingThe 72hour rule was created by the Department of Justice and put into place by former police commissioner Charles H Ramsey in 2014 after it was recommended Speaking in support of the rule at the time Ramsey said   I dont think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous However the influential Philadelphia Police Union has defended HB 1538 Were just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down especially if its an investigation that could lead to protests in the community  John McNesby president of the 14500strong union told the Pittsburgh PostGazetteWhite claims the bill is needed due to the dangers faced by police officers I was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing and to me the 72hour rule is really just an arbitrary number  White told the PostGazetteHowever neither McNesby nor White could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identifiedMcNesby told the PostGazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place but said  thats what were looking to stop before it becomes a reality The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania has criticized the bill calling it  a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve and accusing it of being completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality Rep Margo Davidson DDelaware County has also spoken out against the bill saying it undermines  the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color  She added that  this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion Davidson along with many other Philadelphia Democrats opposed the bill in the 15132 voteGovernor Wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill which passed the Senate and House with a vetoproof majority If Wolf still decides to veto an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next electionRead Also War on Cops Debunked More Cops Died by Accident Than Violence in 2015 Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  Click for details  Contributed by RTcom of RTcom
