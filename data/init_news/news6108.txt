When I think of freedom of the press what comes to mind is the Pentagon Papers Watergate Abu Ghraib NSA surveillancethe tough terrain of investigative reportingNot the handiwork of people trying to get a few laughsYet satire it seems has suddenly become the new battleground for free expression And that requires some rethinking for all of usI love a good comedic skewering as much as the next person But satire fairly or not has always seemed less serious than other forms of journalism more of an indulgenceYet as the massacre at Charlie Hebdo reminds us cartoonists satirists and funnymen are often on the front lines of very risky battles Perhaps because their barbs sting in a personal way that news stories and commentary do not Perhaps because the comedic overlay gives them license to tackle incendiary subjects from which others shy awayAnd heres the rub Sometimes what they peddle is truly offensivemaybe to me maybe to you And that makes it harder to defendWho wants to go to bat for the Piss Christ photo or the Virgin Mary covered in cow dung or depictions of Mohammad that obviously make Muslims angry But we must defend the right to publish if not the content Free speech is meaningless if it doesnt apply to unpopular even repulsive speechIf you think about the North Koreanbacked hacking of Sony Pictures it was triggered by a movie whose idea of comedy was a plot to assassinate Kim Jung Un that ends with his head exploding That as I said at the time was an incredibly stupid and needlessly provocative project Yet I also ripped Sony for caving to threats and deepsixing the film before bowing to public and Hollywood pressure and making The Interview available In America you have the right to make a moronic movieNor would I defend the content of such Charlie Hebdo cartoons as one in which rolls of toilet paper were marked Bible Torah and Quran with the caption In the toilet all religions But the satirical French newspaper has the right to publish outrageously offensive material without being attacked by terroristsThe issue has surfaced before because of Charlie Hebdos pokeintheeye editorial approach The papers offices were firebombed in 2011 after it published a cartoon mocking Muhammad The following year both the White House spokesman and the French foreign minister criticized the newspaperbut not its right to publishfor another Muhammad cartoon following the Benghazi attack that the administration initially blamed on an antiIslam filmStephane Charbonnier the papers courageous editor and one of the 12 killed in Wednesdays attack told ABC in 2012 We cant live in a country without freedom of speech I prefer to die than to live like a ratChuck Lane made the broader point in his Washington Post column It turns out that such political jokesters take big risks bigger than perhaps even they realize or anticipate  and the repercussions affect us allYet it is vitally important that the United States and all other Western democracies rally to their unequivocal defenseLane faulted the officials who criticized Charlie Hebdo in 2012 for mixed messages that ran the risk of conveying how dangerous it is to give violent extremists a veto over what your citizens can and cannot sayThe Washington Post ran of one of Charlie Hebdos Muhammad cartoons in a gesture of solidarity yesterday Other news organizations including Fox News CNN the AP and the New York Times have since made an editorial decision against running the images Some critics say thats cowardly I think its a tough callI would prefer that they continue aggressive reporting commentary and yes satire if warranted against Islamic terrorists and those who would extinguish free speech at the point of a gunIn one encouraging sign Google Guardian Media and several French publishers have donated money to ensure that Charlie Hebdo will publish next week That is a message that even terrorists can understandClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
