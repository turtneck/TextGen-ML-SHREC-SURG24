Washington CNN For months the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powersAnd now less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measureOn Tuesday the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen Bob Corkers Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on itFor many in Congress its a very simple premise Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with IranBut for the White House and some Democrats in Congress thats an explosive idea that could derail the talks  and therefore must be stoppedSo whats in the billSupporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations June 30 deadline Backers think thats only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemyThe bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments And it spells out what the President needs to do visavis Congress if Iran is found violating the termsBut most important it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress 60day review period And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval then sanctions could not be lifted even after that timeDoes this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final dealIrans primary reason for agreeing to the deals limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions reliefIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions  to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program  the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitmentsThe Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted and lifted in a timely way which gives less encouragement to IranWithout the bill could Obama lift all sanctions on IranNot all but most  at least for a limited timeWithout the CorkerMenendez bill named after Corker and lead Democratic cosponsor Sen Bob Menendez Iran could see nearly all nuclearrelated sanctions at least temporarily lifted Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive themIf the CorkerMenendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized Obama wouldnt be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 daysDuring that 60day review phase the bill says Obama cant waive suspend reduce provide relief from or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctionsHow can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anywayThe biggest sanctions package approved by Congress widely credited with crippling Irans economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment ActIt included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines its in the US national security interestHe wouldnt be able to permanently sunset the sanctions though unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soonThe administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal  by repealing them  but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good oneHow would Congress weigh in during the 60day review periodCongress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief Or it could do nothing allowing Obama to implement the sanctions and by implication the deal after the 60 days are upA joint resolution disapproving of the deal would need to muster a twothirds majority though to override the veto Obama has promised  an unlikely but not entirely unthinkable scenarioAre there other reasons that Obama opposes this billFirst hes facing a combative Republican majority in both houses of Congress Those Republicans have sought to undermine his negotiations with Iran at every turn Giving those lawmakers a legislative avenue to slam the terms of an eventual deal would at best be a political blow to Obama and his administrations efforts to broker an agreementTheres also the White Houses argument that the executive branch has the power to broker international agreements without Congress meddling while congressional oversight of the Iran deal would set a dangerous precedent Most international agreements arent treaties ratified by Congress and Obama has argued that US allies need to know they can count on those agreements holding upVirtually every Senate Republican supports the bill and nine Democrats have signed on as cosponsors including independent Sen Angus King who caucuses with Democrats Several more on the left are leaning toward supporting the billThat means backers will likely pass the bill with a filibusterproof majority Its unclear though if they can muster enough Democrats willing to vote to override Obamas vetoIts not just the numbers though Some powerful Democrats are supporting the legislation Sen Chuck Schumer of New York the No 3 Senate Democrat who will become the chambers Democratic leader when Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada retires at the end of his term is a big proponent of the legislationMenendez of New Jersey who has been working to rally Democrats around legislation on Iran throughout the negotiations remains the most vocal Democrat on the issue He was the topranked Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping aside to face corruption charges handed down earlier in the monthAlso Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia one of the earliest Obama backers during the 2008 campaign has been insistent on the need for Congress to weigh in and has worked behind the scenes to make Corkers bill more palatable to Democrats  and the White House But so far that effort hasnt succeeded as the White House remains opposed
