In just a week or two Congress will consider actually consider may be too generous a term in this instance the negotiated agreement between Iran and the P51 the five permanent members of the UN Security Councilthe United States Great Britain France Russia China and Germany curbing Irans nuclear ambitions The United States and its negotiating allies claim the agreement will prevent Iran from developing an atomic bomb Opponents say thats not soButand this may upset people on both sidesthe arguments for and against the agreement are not what interest me most In fact I am most troubled by what the debate has revealed about the disintegration of our political institutions and traditions and of the increasing inability of those institutions to function on behalf of the American people and their interestsOpposition to the Iran nuclear deal has been fomenting for years Aroused and whipped by Israels hardline prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his troops in AIPAC American Israel Public Affairs Committee congressional Republicans long ago decided to make this a make or break showdown with President Barack Obama Fortyseven GOP senators led by a young freshman rightwinger from Arkansas Tom Cotton even went so far as to write the leaders of Iran disavowing the deal before it was finalized Few longtime students of the presidency or Congress can remember an affront of similar magnitude or possible consequenceshort or longterm The one that comes closest even though we didnt learn about it until decades later and then only after all the key players were dead was candidate Richard Nixons interference with the Paris Peace Talks aimed at ending the war in Vietnam in 1968What strikes me in particular is that the Republicans behavior visvis the negotiations with Iran stands in sharp contrast to the debate and the votes on the two Panama Canal treaties in 1978The Panama Canal issue in the 1970s was every bit as contentious as the situation with Iran is today Negotiations of the treatiesone guaranteeing the neutral operation of the canal and the second ceding control of the canal to Panama effective at midnight Dec 31 1999began in the Nixon administration continued under President Ford and were finalized by President Carter in August of 1977The uproar from the far right to Carters decision was immediate and intense after all former California Gov Ronald Reagan had used the issue to bludgeon Gerald Ford in their fight for the Republican nomination in 1976 and he damn near succeeded Reagan won the North Carolina primary largely because of the Panama Canal issue as his chief instate backer the late Sen Jesse Helms was leader of the oppositionOnce Carter decided that he was going to agree to the treaties terms Vice President Walter Mondale congressional relations chief and my boss at the time Frank Moore and the president himself divided up a call list of all 100 senators to let them know where things were headed and to make a simple and singular request That they not make any public statement one way or another until each senator had been briefed by officials from the administrationWhite House State Department Defense and the intelligence communityon the details and ramifications of either acceptance or rejection Ninetynine of the 100 agreed to and abided by the request the only one who refused to do so was North Carolinas HelmsThe ensuing debate was as vigorous and heated as one might imagine and it went on for many months Carters chief aide Hamilton Jordan orchestrated the administrations campaign on behalf of ratification Leading citizens from states whose senators were on the fence or shaky were invited to the White House for briefings and were subsequently dispatched to Capitol Hill to lobby for ratification Newspaper editors columnists and commentators were briefed by the president himself My colleagues on the White House Congressional Liaison staff worked nonstop advocating and counting Former Presidents Nixon and Ford made calls to key Republican senators even conservative icon and Hollywood star John Wayne weighed in with his supportOn March 16 1978 the first of two treaties guaranteeing neutrality was ratified by the Senate with only one vote to spare 68 to 22 the second treaty the one conveying the canal to Panama was approved on April 18 1978 by the exact same number The vote breakdown is telling 52 D16 R Aye to 10 D22 R No Among the yes votes was that of Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker RTenn Baker not only voted right but he brought several of his Republican colleagues along with himIt is important to note as well that the administrations strategy was to reach at least 68 votes rather than the minimum 67 required so that no single senator could be accused of being the one who gave away the Panama Canal Even so many Democrats lost in the 1978 midterm elections and also in 1980 at least in part because of the courageous stand they took on the treaties It will be interesting to see how political courage plays out on the Iran nuclear agreement so far at least two Democratic senators Charles Schumer of New York and Robert Menendez of New Jersey have failed the testWere the votes on the Panama Canal treaties examples of good old days in American politics Perhaps not But they sure beat the hell out of what we are being subjected to today and the price our representative democracy is paying as a result
