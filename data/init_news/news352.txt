Ten days after he appointed new campaign leadership Donald Trump and many of his closest aides and allies remain divided on whether to adopt more mainstream stances or stick with the hardline conservative positions at the core of his candidacy according to people involved in the discussionsTrump has been flooded with conflicting advice about where to land with the tensions vividly illustrated this week as the GOP nominee publicly wrestled with himself on the details of his signature issue immigrationA particular flash point has been whether to forcibly deport an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants from the country a move Trump long advocated but is now reconsideringHe has been listening to a wide range of opinions on that said former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani who has been at Trumps side nearly constantly over the past week As you might imagine there are different opinions on this even in his campaign In a very thoughtful way hes trying to figure what the right position isBy the way Giuliani added thats what everybody criticized him for in the past that hes not able to do that He actually is able to do thatThe conversations in recent days have featured voices from a range of Republican views all jockeying to tilt the businessmans politics in their direction according to those involved Trump tends to echo the words of the last person with whom he spoke making direct access to him even more valuable the people said speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal campaign discussionsThose pushing Trump to soften his stances and tone  and who have gained immense influence in recent days  include Giuliani New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Fox News chief Roger Ailes a longtime ally who has no formal role with the campaign but talks to the candidate frequently and attended a strategy session last weekend At recent private fundraisers many Republican donors have also urged Trump to adopt a different pitch and rethink his prioritiesTrump softening on immigration Many supporters dont seem to mindMeanwhile Trump continues to discuss immigration policy with Sen Jeff Sessions Ala who is seen as the populist force behind much of his candidacy While he has defended and encouraged Trumps deliberations Sessions is considered a balancing force against more centrist appeals So is new campaign chief executive Stephen Bannon the former head of Breitbart News the hardcharging conservative websiteTrump was joined on the trail this week by Giuliani and Sessions along with Stephen Miller a former aide to Sessions who has become a welltrusted confidant His New Yorkbased children continue to play an outsize roleBut any suggestion of change has alarmed some conservatives and ardent backers Firebrand commentator Ann Coulter declared this week that it was a mistake for Trump to consider abandoning his support for mass deportations and said his tone sounds very consultant to meThe backandforth over immigration comes amid broader efforts by Trump to reach out to voters beyond the disaffected whites who compose his base including events such as a roundtable Friday with Hispanic business leaders in Las Vegas Trump also lashed out this week at his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for accusing him of appealing to racist elements repeatedly labeling her a bigot because he says her policies dont help minoritiesLast year Trump cast illegal immigrants as being mostly violent criminals and he rolled out an immigration plan that embraced ideas that had long dwelled at the fringes of the GOP no longer granting citizenship to children born in the United States to illegal immigrants constructing a massive wall along the border with Mexico and perhaps restricting some legal forms of immigration In interviews Trump added that he would form a deportation force to remove the millions of immigrants living in the country illegallyBut Saturday Trump asked a panel of Hispanic advisers for alternate ideas and made clear that he was willing to change on the issue The next day newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway who has advised GOP candidates for years on how to win over swing voters said in a CNN interview that Trumps position on creating a deportation force was to be determinedOver the next few days Trump took a variety of positions that created a frenzy of confusion over where exactly he stands On Tuesday Trump said he was open to softening the rules for the millions of immigrants who came to the country illegally but are living peaceful and prosperous lives only to say Thursday that his position is hardeningAt an immigrationfocused town hall in Texas on Tuesday which was later broadcast on Fox News Trump repeatedly polled his audience on what he should do allowing his internal conflicts to play out publiclyCan we go through a process Or do you think they have to get out he asked the audience Tell me I mean I dont know you tell meTrump provided the crowd a sympathetic portrait of a theoretical illegal immigrant who has been in the country more than a decade building a life with children and a stable job He repeatedly asked if that sort of person should be allowed to stay or be kicked out of the country getting results that were often difficult to measure At one point Trump asked who in the crowd wanted all illegal immigrants thrown out even the lawabiding ones and a man stood up and bellowed I doFox Newss Sean Hannity then asked Trump You heard from the audience What does your gut tell you you want to doWell look this is like a poll this is like a poll Trump said And I love the guy that stood up and said  where is that guy I love this guy Thats my guy I mean I get it I get it And I understand what youre saying But this is sort of like a poll And this is what Im getting all over the countryTrumps often contradictory comments on deportations came during interviews with Fox News or CNN not during his campaign rallies For two weeks Trump has been reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter a machine he had long cursed As the week progressed his control slipped and he went offscript more often  saying at a rally in Ohio on Monday that some urban areas are more dangerous than war zones and making a joke in Tampa on Wednesday about Clinton being medicatedThis week the campaign twice started to plan an event where Trump could give an immigration speech  an opportunity for him to settle on a position and document it  only to cancel without a clear explanationInside Donald Trumps new strategy to counter the view of many that he is racistTrumps comment about being open to softening laws to help illegal immigrants came Tuesday the same day Coulter released her new book In Trump We Trust in which she writes that anything Trump does could be forgiven except change his immigration policies During an MSNBC interview that night Coulter was obviously frustrated and threatened to cancel her book tour if the candidate clearly changed his positionI think this is a mistake Ive thought hes made other mistakes and Ive given him constructive criticism when I think he makes a mistake she said I think this is a mistakeMSNBCs Chris Matthews asked Does he take your criticismUm Coulter responded I havent had a lot but yeah No he does listen to people And Im not advising him or anything but I did write this magnificent bookBy Wednesday Coulter seemed confident again in Trumps candidacy as she attended a book party in Washington and told Bloomberg Newss Joshua Green My worship for him is like the people of North Korea worship their Dear Leader  blind loyalty Once he gave that Mexican rapist speech Ill walk across glass for him Thats basically it  Ill criticize him and I have but its all minor stylistic stuff We all want to shoot him at various timesThursday Trump took a different tone in an interview with CNNs Anderson Cooper and said that he foresees a lot of people being deported although he admitted such deportations could not all happen at once Trump also doubled down on the notion that a majority of illegal immigrants are violent criminals who will be the first to goAnd there are probably millions of them but certainly hundreds of thousands he said Big numbers Theyre out Theyre outAt one point Cooper asked Trump So if you havent committed a crime and youve been here for 15 years and you have a family here you have a job here will you be deportedWere going to see what happens once we strengthen up our border Trump replied describing that strength in detail And then were going to see what happens But there is a very good chance the answer could be yes Were going to see what happens
