Nearly one year after a new VA secretary vowed to clean up a broken health care system for Americas veterans a vital new hospital hangs in the balance as lawmakers and the agency fight over how to pay for itThe dispute came to a head this week as construction on the medical center in Aurora Colo was poised to grind to a halt Sunday without congressional approval for more spending beyond the current 800 millionJust in time lawmakers found a stopgap solution After what one aide called grueling discussions between lawmakers and the VA the House on Thursday was able to pass a temporary fix that would keep things moving  for three more weeks The Senate followed suit late Friday afternoonBut for a project whose estimated costs have ballooned to 173 billion the funding BandAid does not solve the longterm issueThis is by no means a solution to the problems in Denver which VA leaders created and are refusing to take responsibility for said Rep Jeff Miller RFla chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee Rather it is a lastchance effort to convince VA and Obama administration leaders to take the departments problems seriouslyThe latest agreement would raise the authorization cap to 900 million though the estimated price tag for the hospital is expected to hit 17 billion According to a spokesman for Rep Mike Coffman RColo who was against stopping construction for any reason the deal would hand the VA another 20 million for now as the project had already reached 880 million in costs since it beganThe VA ignored my warnings for two years that the Aurora hospital was outofcontrol and their refusal to heed my warnings has made a bad situation much worse Coffman said in a statement on ThursdayThe hospital is meant to replace the citys aging overcrowded facility and could help relieve a system whose long wait times were at the center of last years scandal over veterans care But the standoff over construction was just the latest problem for the overbudget behindschedule project beset by allegations of waste and mismanagementOriginal designs for the hospital which is supposed to include a series of nearly a dozen outbuildings for specialty care estimated a total cost of 328 million Further changes led Congress to authorize 568 million for the project and last year the VA was still saying the facility would cost 630 million and be complete in 2015 When it was clear the campus could not be finished for under 1 billion the general contractor KiewitTurner walked off the job and sued the VA A panel of judges sided with the contractor in December 2014 The project is now under the auspices of the Army Corps of EngineersAs the project was turned over to the Army VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson apologized for the mess I apologize to veterans and to American taxpayers for the delays and the added costs he said at an April 2 news conference blaming a lack of communication with planners and incomplete designs at the outset among other thingsBoth sides in the VACongress dispute have been pointing the fingerRight now VA is essentially asking taxpayers to bail it out of a massive problem of the departments own creation Miller said in a lengthy letter to VA Secretary Bob McDonald on May 20Miller and others had been willing to turn off the spigot and let work stop this weekend on the project which has been in the works since 2004 Hes going along with the stopgap plan but he and other lawmakers say they are still waiting for the VA to offer a plan for how it would pay for the rest of the constructionRep Tim Huelskamp RKan who sits on the same committee told FoxNewscom that the threeweek extension is a BandAid and he is firmly against continued funding if the VA does not show willingness to pay for their mistakes and their screw upsThey need to go back to the drawing board he said And I just dont see a bailout coming from the HouseSeveral senators on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee also expressed frustrationBut McDonald who officially replaced former Secretary Eric Shinseki in July 2014 after it was revealed workers were falsifying records to cover up long wait times rejected the idea that the VA has not offered detailed options on how to pay for the projectI have provided multiple proposals  the options were rejected and the result has been inaction Our veterans deserve better than that he said in a statement WednesdayI have presented a plan Congress has not proposed a counter planMcDonald said the VA wants to repurpose and reallocate fiscal 2015 funds Lawmakers want to make sure the VA wont take money away from other projects or services for veterans to do that There was talk earlier about dipping into the 5 billion fund that offers private care to veterans who need it but that was opposed by lawmakers who told the VA it would have to concentrate on costcutting measures and other solutions Lawmakers like Huelskamp and Coffman have suggested the money come out of top employee bonusesGlenn Haggstrom the VA construction chief who earned 64000 in bonuses as he was overseeing the project was pushed into retirement in March Critics said Haggstrom though should have been available for an ongoing investigation and instead was going home with a fat pensionTo date not a single person has been fired for this blatant waste of taxpayer money Miller said in his letter to the secretary A Government Accountability Office GAO report in 2013 on the VAs largest medical center projects including the Denver facility showed that combined all four were responsible for 15 billion in cost overruns and were an average of three years behind schedule eachHouse Speaker John Boehner expressed frustration Wednesday with what he said was the VAs inability to correct itself over the last year  not just in the area of construction but in its long wait times and backlogs for veterans seeking benefits and careAt this point the VA cant even build a hospital he said on the House floor
