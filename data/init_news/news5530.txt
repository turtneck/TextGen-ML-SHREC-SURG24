Email In an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds its often difficult to separate fact from fiction That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online with many insisting that the image was the real unedited deal But today that picture was officially debunked The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying Islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored Wow This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt Take a look at the photo in question above In it you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith At first glance the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most farright critics who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs But when the image went viral on Twitter one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring Many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in A graphic designer named Brendan McCann whose Twitter bio says hes been in the industry for over a decade quickly answered the call But it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest After scouring the internet far and wide they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph taken during one of the presidents official White House photo ops and theres no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight Take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved Well there you have it It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the presidents head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top Its a powerful effect but its definitely not real Remember When it comes to the internet always question your sources
