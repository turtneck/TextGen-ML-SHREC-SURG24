It is always interesting to watch democracy in action and Iowa is ground zeroMany political pundits and media analysts complain about the attention Iowa receives from candidates and the media because it goes first But it also is a state filled with people who are willing to pay attention to go to small events and forums more than 1500 have been held and to show up at a caucus on a cold often snowy night to participate in a ritual few states duplicateMillions of dollars are spent on TV commercials over 60000 and organization thatMonday night produced a record turnoutIowa doesnt always produce the eventual winners but it does eliminate the losers With 17 Republican candidates starting this process there are really only three or four real candidates now with voter support and sufficient monies to go on to the remaining contestsWith a record voter turnout in Iowa the winner Ted Cruz goes on with his extraordinary organization and conservative supporters with a big upsetMarco Rubio the best debater came on strong and gained real momentum He came very close to coming in second Certainly he has to be viewed as a very serious candidate and the best bet to become the establishment candidateTrump is Trump and his special appeal to new voters and the angry antiWashington element will go on too but with unpredictable results He also paid a price for missing the last debate and fighting Fox NewsBen Carson held his 10 percent base but his candidacy is short lived and beyond Iowa has minimal supportThe biggest losers are Bush Christie and Huckabee Bush spent the most money and dropped like a rockChristies bluster unlike Trumps didnt sell He has no money and no future in this raceAnd Huckabee who won this race eight years and thought he could be a serious challenger against Romney in 2012 was a bottom dweller getting less than 2 percent of the vote He raised no money and has no appeal and barely has enough money left to buy a bus ticket back to Arkansas He quickly waved the flag of surrender and wisely quit the raceOne more may make the cut after Iowa but this is the field now and it will be fascinating to watchMonday nights win is a giant victory for Cruz and his team He won in spite of a greater turnout than in years past and benefited from the dramatic increase in new voters And now on to New HampshireEdward J Rollins is a Fox News contributor He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign He is a senior presidential fellow at Hofstra University and a member of the Political Consultants Hall of Fame He is a strategist for Great America PAC an independant group that is supporting Donald Trump for president
