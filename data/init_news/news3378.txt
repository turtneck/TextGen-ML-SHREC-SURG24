SAN FRANCISCO  Hillary Clintons campaign accused Republican Donald Trumps campaign Thursday of increasingly close involvement with the release of stolen emails that detail the internal and sometimes unflattering workings of the Democrats inner circleThe antisecrecy site WikiLeaks has a huge trove of emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and is releasing batches of the communications in the final four weeks of the presidential campaign The Clinton campaign had refused to authenticate communications released so far and accuses Russia of being behind the hack and WikiLeaks of doing Moscows biddingWere not going to let it throw us off Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters on a conference call I think its important for Americans again to reflect on why this is happening who perpetrated it and for what purpose he saidThis isgetting closer and closer to the Trump campaign itself Mook said citing the admission from Trump supporter and former adviser Roger Stone that he had back channel discussions with WikiLeaksMook said he expects to see more evidence of coordination or collaboration intended to benefit Trumps candidacy He spoke from the campaigns Brooklyn headquarters Clinton is in California for two days of fundraisingI think its important to always recognize the context of this situation and that is that the Department of Homeland Security took the unprecedented step of saying  beyond any doubt that this hack and then the leaking of the emails was perpetrated by the Russian government for the purpose of intervening in the election and trying to affect the outcome in favor of Donald Trump Mook saidClinton campaign chairman ties email hack to Russians suggests Trump had early warningThe correspondence reveals a campaign that has struggled all year to improve a flawed candidate As far back as March aides were keenly aware that she was resistant to the media perhaps out of touch with regular Americans and unable to convey a clear message to votersRepublicans have said some of the emails show corrupt dealings among the campaign the Clinton family charity and outside advisers and donorsThe email dumps have provided plenty of fodder for Clinton criticsto seize upon and the sixth batch released Thursday morning was no differentIn one March 2015 email chain for example Clinton aides were discussing how well Clinton knew Loretta Lynch who the following month would become the US attorney generalShe knows Loretta wrote close Clinton aide Huma Abedin Not an extremely close relationship and dont remember the last time they connected  Regardless definitely a cordial relationshipThat could reignite criticism of a private airport meeting that Lynch held with former President Bill Clinton held in Phoenix shortly before the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton in relation to her use of a private email server as secretary of stateAcross Podestas inbox there was concern about how Clinton was handling revelations about her server In early September 2015 he exchanged messages with Neera Tanden head of the liberal Center for American Progress who weighed in on a Clinton interview with ABC News anchor David Muir in which Clinton expressed remorse for her decisionThis apology thing has become like a pathology I can only imagine whats happening in the campaign Tanden wrote to Podesta Is there some way I can be helpful here I know if I just email her she will dismiss it out of hand Are there people she can hear from that will have some impactPodesta responded You should email her She can say shes sorry without apologizing to the American people Tell her to say it and move on why get hung on thisThe latest release also included another email exchange between advisers to Clinton discussing how to deal with pressure to release transcripts of her paid speeches In the exchange Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon and speechwriter Dan Schwerin propose leaking the transcript of one paid speech she delivered in October 2014Schwerin explained to colleagues that he had written a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat catsSchwerin continued that the section was not as tough or pointed as we would write it now but its much more than most people would assume she was saying in paid speechesMandy Grunwald a senior strategist however responded that she worried about going down this road She referred to a story by Maggie Haberman then a reporter for Politico in 2013 in which Haberman wrote that Clinton had praised the financial industry in paid speeches to Goldman SachsMaybe you think the Deutsche Bank speech takes the sting out of the Goldman report  but I am concerned that the passage below will exacerbate not improve the situation Grunwald wroteThe emails also allude to staff tensions including a March 2015 missive from former State Department aide Tom Nides to Podesta in which Nides talks about tension between Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and longtime Clinton aide Cheryl MillsSorry to bug you but on Friday I got a bit wigged out Nides wrote Its clear which I assume you know tThere sic is already a bunch of noise about Robby and Cheryl not getting along Robby getting very frustrated I have zero idea what the deal is but you and I both know this is a disaster for her if it doesnt stop This is the kind of stuff that could open the door to someone I am sorry to dump this on you and maybe I am full of s so take it for what its worthThere is no response from Mook in the emailsMatea Gold Rosalind Helderman Ed OKeefe and Anu Narayanswamy
