CNN CNN commentators and guest analysts offer their take on Monday nights presidential candidate debate The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authorsDavid Gergen Clinton crushed Trump but was that enoughComing into the presidential debate I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively she would virtually lock up the election Coming out it was clear that she did win decisively but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously closeBy all traditional standards of debate Mrs Clinton crushed She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle with a smile She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump often damaging By contrast he came in unprepared had nothing fresh to say and increasingly gave way to rants As the evening ended the media buried him in criticismsEven so I doubt she has put him away For one thing Trump supporters arent judging him by traditional standards They have heard establishment politicians overpromise and underdeliver for so long that they crave something different They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias Trump was an angry figure yes but he is also giving voice to their anger Those who are for him are likely to stick despite his ineffectual performanceEqually to the point Mrs Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters She has been vexed with the issue of likeability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully Her arguments last night should have made voters think but I am not sure they will make them marchPerhaps I am wrong Perhaps Hillary did lock up the race Monday night Trump certainly blew it But I imagine the race goes on and the ultimate decision will be left where it should be with the voters Stay tuned for the vice presidential debate next TuesdaySE Cupp Trump mostly did the jobI had two criteria upon which I would judge Monday nights debate Not who looked more presidential or who factchecked whom the best Those aspects go to their bases not the voters who will determine this election outcome undecidedsHillary Clinton had one job She had to make Donald Trump look dumb For undecideds it will matter less that hes a bully or a liar She has issues with trust too What will scare them is how unprepared he is Every chance she gets to point this out has the potential to add points Unfortunately for Clinton she didnt take many of them While she pointed out that his cavalier attitude toward nuclear weapons was dangerous time and again she punted at opportunities to point out how illinformed and unprepared Trump is Instead she preferred to argue his vague platform on its merits For her this wasnt damaging but it didnt move the needle in her favorIn contrast Trump mostly did the job he had to do To move undecideds he had to hammer one point home Clinton is a politician who doesnt get it Over and over again he attacked her as more of the same out of touch and a politician who hasnt gotten it right He didnt go after her character or personal issues for the most part  which voters know well She outmanned him on specifics and details But his attacks were far more effective than hersWhile Clinton was right to suggest the factcheckers get busy on his statements  many were misleading  if Im looking at who moved the needle tonight with voters it was Trump not Clinton And Robby Mook I assure you this antiTrump conservative isnt grading him on a curveHillary Clinton did her homework on Donald Trump in the week leading up to tonights debate and the prep work paid off especially when it came to his business recordIt must be something really important even terrible that hes trying to hide Clinton said of Trumps tax returns turning the tables on allegations that shes hiding something in her deleted emails It just seems to me that this is something the American people deserve to seeClinton even took a step further and pointed out that Trump didnt pay any income tax returns in certain years a strategy designed to chip away at the bluecollar demographic that hes cultivated in the last few years Trump whos worked up a populist campaign saying that the government has stiffed the little guy put his own foot in his mouth butted in and said that makes me smartIt was a tough attack to which Trump will need an answer in future debatesAs a Clinton supporter it pains me to say Trump wonClinton was too restrained too smart  and as much as I hate to say it  she was too presidential And being presidential wont help her win the election She spoke to the intellectuals tuning in she did not speak to the average AmericanHer advisers told her to restrain from attacking Trump She got the wrong counsel and it could cost her the electionHer rebuttal to Trumps incoherent rants was to chuckle and tell viewers to check in with the fact checkers The fact checkers wont win the election for herShe needed to take him out at the knees We know Clinton is smart what we needed to see was a woman who is tough and wont take nonsense from anyone She failed to do that tonight Tonight she was nice Nice wont win the presidencyDonald spent the night sniffing constantly before he spoke To paraphrase one tweeter Hes allergic to his own crapHe lost the 400pound vote but he won the debate and unless Clinton changes tactics hes going to win the electionAs a real estate mogul Donald Trump is more than familiar with the expression location location location In presidential debates its temperament temperament temperament History has not been kind to Dan Quayles perceived weakness George H W Bushs time check or Al Gores sighs And it wont be kind to Trumps undisciplined defensive rantsTrumps debate performance was a combined rehash of the insolence of his primary debates the rambling hyperbole of his rallies with a sprinkle of detail to bolster his message of economic populism Although Trump scored points on that issue he whiffed badly when confronted about his failure to release his taxes and struck out on the issues of race birtherism and foreign policy It was frankly surprising how easily Trump took Hillarys baitComing into Monday nights debate national polls were essentially tied and battleground states were tightening With expectations set historically low all Trump had to do was behave well enough to convince undecided voters he was in fact fit to hold the highest office in the land In order to win the White House Trump needs more moderates minorities and women to support him Yet he engaged in juvenile attacks on Hillarys looks and stamina instead of her failed record Trump had an opportunity to put Hillary Clinton away and failed miserably He is who is he is and continues to act unworthy of the officeHillary Clinton was the closer She pulled off a victory but only after Trump looked as if he might run away with that victory in the first half of the debate Clinton was clearly in command of the facts but Trump was making the simpler  if highly inaccurate  case for defending American jobs Substance aside he initially came across as caring about those who have lost jobs to trade But Trumps initial strength unraveled as the debate progressedBy the time it was over Clinton unmasked Trump as a con man over his failure to release tax returns and penchant for not paying his workers He all but acknowledged he doesnt pay taxes saying they would be wasted seeming more like an abusive onepercenter than a man of the people His birther explanation made no sense and his claim that Hillary has been fighting ISIS your entire life was as ridiculous as his notion of stealing Iraqs oil His denial of the wellestablished fact that he supported the Iraq war was a most awkward danceThat was probably the first and last debate in presidential history to include a discussion of Rosie ODonnells looks As such it was tremendous entertainment  pure reality TV But it was also very hard to pick a winner Donald Trump won on the basis of spectacle Hillary Clintons strategy was to rise above the occasion and let him talk himself into losing That actually allowed Trump to land one blow after another without Clinton fighting back She wittily put him down a couple of times But mostly she just smiled oddly at the camera She was to use a Trumpism low energy That was a mistakeYes Trump sunk to new lows when discussing the birther issue  claiming that he helped put it to rest when he actually stirred it up Yes he was barely coherent on defense taxes etc There was a threeminute section when he detailed a phone call with Sean Hannity about Iraq Yes The Donald was low on specifics too But he did have clear themes that he rammed home After 90 grueling minutes I looked down at my pad and read back the key words that Id jotted down Law and order Country doing badly Bad experience Emails Clintons policies on solar panels and equal pay did not cut through It could not compete with his passion his articulation of populist angerSo I give this a technical win to Trump because he understood the format he blew it apart and he dominated the evening But that will alienate as many people as it will attract Moreover Im not even sure itll make that big a difference Objectively deducing who won or lost is almost impossible when partisan tensions are this high Most viewers either agree with him or with her And a small minority watched it and thought How the hell did things come to this The debate will likely harden impressions not soften hearts The impression is that Trump has matured into an effective champion of the working class But Clinton looks like a presidentinwaitingTimothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britains Daily Telegraph He is the author of Citizen Hollywood How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American PoliticsOut of control Thats how Id describe the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump What a train wreck for any voter who wanted to hear details about policy Instead we got Trump shouting insults and oneliners interrupting Clinton trying to take over the conversation Shockingly Trump admitting to the world He was smart not to pay his federal income taxes he supported a return of stop and frisk policing even though it was ruled racial profiling and unconstitutional by the courts and he defended his familys housing discrimination practices against blacks and Latinos essentially saying it was just something everyone did back thenClintons sitbackandwatchhimimplode strategy was frustrating at times but it worked She could however show more passion when discussing her policies On the issue of race Clinton missed a perfect opportunity to talk more about her plan for law enforcement reforms and systematic racism in our justice system Still for me Trump lost the debate tonight Talking loud and saying little shouldnt be a path to the White HouseRoxanne Jones a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN has worked as a producer and as a reporter at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer She was named a 2010 Woman of the Year by Women in Sports and Events is a coauthor of Say It Loud An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete and CEO of the Push Marketing She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidencyJulian Zelizer Debate unlikely to have dramatic impactOverall it is unclear that Monday nights debate will have a huge impact on the direction of the polls The best moments for Donald Trump came in the first half hour where he baited her into defending unpopular free trade dealsThere were many reasons that Hillary Clinton supporters could be pleased with her performance At several points Trump was irritated and angry He delved into some of his more controversial claims He referred to Sean Hannity as evidence to support his claims about the Iraq WarClinton consistently appeared poised and attacked with methodical precision The most effective part of Clintons attacks was to connect him to a kind of trickledown economics and raise questions about his business record Clintons best moments came when she attacked him on birtherism In the final half hour Trump was mired deep in his Trumpian statements about womens looks and moreBut Clintons greatest advantage remains the dynamics of the Electoral College and the continued doubts about his capacity to be president It is very hard for a single debate to change the game And it is unclear that this debate had the kind of dramatic moment that will fundamentally reshape public opinion  overwhelming all of the other factors that have caused her lead to shrink The most unfavorable moments for Trump are not worse than anything hes done before  and those moments have not undercut his campaign thus farHaroon Moghul Trump lost but so did all of usNear the end of Monday nights debate Hillary Clinton looked straight into the camera to address Americas allies She wanted our friends and partners in NATO and allies like Japan South Korea and others to know that we meant to honor our obligations In that moment Donald Trump entirely disappeared and Clinton no longer looked like a candidate for President She sounded like she was already PresidentTrump He managed to incorporate his very large portfolio into nearly every comment he made Eventually I expected him to announce he knew best how to defeat ISIS because he built a hotel in Mosul So yes Trump lost But we lost too All of us as Americans Its a disaster for any democracy when there is only one responsible candidate running for office let alone the highest in any landTrumps language over the campaign has been racist and authoritarian he has indulged antiSemites and winked at white supremacists when he was not busy with plans for mass deportations or Islamophobic bans Its not a good thing that 100 million people are watching these two candidates debate because 100 million people shouldnt take a wouldbe fascist seriously enough to debate his case for the White HouseOne of my favorite new shows is Netflixs Stranger Things Unfortunately were the ones living in the upside downHaroon Moghul is a senior fellow and director of development at the Center for Global Policy His next book How to be a Muslim will be out in 2017Civility went south fast in Mondays debate Donald Trump lost his composure early ranting interrupting over 20 times and sniffing Under the weather or out of his comfort zone Hillary Clinton started out soft playing the grandmother card but quickly escalated to tough talk and occasional sarcasm It could hardly have gone otherwise Clinton hit hard at Trump bringing up his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin his long record of engaging in racist behavior his denial at having supported the Iraq war and his refusal to allow the American people to see his tax returnsIn doing so Clinton did Americans a big favor she revealed Trumps limitations He is simply unable to make those leaps of imagination and generosity necessary to transform from a businessperson to a national political leader The candidate who claims to do everything big showed the smallness of his thinking tonight With his offkey rejoinders he demonstrated repeatedly how he sees everything  people properties cities and entire countries  in terms of how they factor into his business and personal universe which seem to be one and the same Ill get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or another he said tonight as though the White House and his new Trump hotel are entities of equal importance Perhaps they really are in his mindClinton alone demonstrated the composure wisdom and broad vision necessary for executive office She won the debate hands downRuth BenGhiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University a specialist in 20thcentury European history and a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion Her latest book is Italian Fascisms Empire Cinema She supports Hillary Clinton for the presidencyThe reality TV star and businessman who loves giving nicknames earned himself one tonight Sniffles From the beginning through the end of the first debate Donald Trump seemed to have something going on with his sinuses It seemed a fitting metaphor for a night on which the usual expert showman was seriously off his game Besides the sniffles Trump made faces and sighed He scowled He interrupted He took innumerable drinks of water something for which he used to mock Marco RubioIn so doing Trump lost this debate to a clearly uptothetask Hillary Clinton Either Trump failed to prepare or his prep sessions did not stickThis is a debate that will likely be studied in college communications advertising and gender courses for years to come Without the benefit of a live audience cheering his oneliners Trump seemed deflated and not on his best form at all His constant interruptions of Clinton will do him no favors with women voters His bragging in effect about forcing President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate will not go over well with black voters And his rambling answers at times descended into incoherence In response to a question about cybersecurity he mentioned that cyberattacks could be coming from someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds Uh whatClinton did not let opportunities go by to score points with independents or moderate voters reminding viewers that Trump once saw the mortgage crisis as a business opportunity and she discussed race relations in thoughtful terms Meanwhile Trump made truly bizarre statements such as she has been been fighting ISIS for 30 years and AfricanAmericans and Hispanics are living in hell you walk down the streets you get shot Note to Trump Testiness is not a presidential lookThe fact that at several points Trump was arguing with moderator Lester Holt showed that things were not going his way In one of the most notable moments of the night Trumps declaration that he had a much better temperament than Clinton earned spontaneous laughter from the audience at Hofstra University As Trump might say SadUnusual omissions tonight No mentions of Trumps feuds with everyone from a distinguished MexicanAmerican judge to a Gold Star family More glaringly no discussion of immigrationWhether viewers agree with Clintons positions or not she was able to articulate them in a reasonable and rational manner She did well and she knew it She was obviously ready to discuss problematic issues like her emails The grin on her face near the end of the debate was evidence that she was aware that she had had a great night Once youve traveled the world negotiated treaties and testified before Congress for 11 hours she said to Trump with a hint of mockery then you can talk to me about stamina Mic drop Game over Tonight at least Hillary Clinton wonThis was a remarkable moment in American political history Has there been a prior event in which a candidate has so completely and remarkably demonstrated his unfitness for the presidency in character temperament preparation and aptitudeDonald Trumps nowfamiliar pattern of winning debates through sheer bluster and braggadocio was effective when he was facing a gaggle of opponents all of whom had similar ideologies but less exaggerated stage personas But faced with a single rival with clearly distinct ideas and experience and a staunchly unflappable attitude he seemed rude ignorant volatile and churlish Despite pundit assertions that Hillary Clinton had the burden of proof in this debate the truth is that she simply needed to hold strong and let Hurricane Trump blow itself out And she didSadly moderator Lester Holt was a nonpresence in the debate But his inability to restrain Trump proved an asset to Clinton who spent much of the time leaning back and smiling to herself knowing that her opponent was weaving his own hanging ropeJeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows including PRIs The Takeaway and WNYCs The Brian Lehrer Show He is the coauthor of I Am Jackie Chan My Life in ActionDonald Trumps supporters like to refer to his movement as The Trump Train Well tonight The Trump Train went off the rails Big timeBut for those who somehow thought up until Monday night that Donald Trump might somehow be qualified to be president Mondays debate was a wakeup call He seemed like a defensive petulant bully who could only insult Hillary Clinton and America  and couldnt offer a single solution let alone details He came across as not only dreadfully unprepared for the debate but dreadfully unprepared to be president Which is the truth And its high time all Americans know itIn moment after moment Hillary Clinton presented a knowledgeable and cleareyed vision for how to help working families and continue America on the path to security and prosperity Donald Trump in contrast lied and got defensive He was petty and insulting and then lied some more Lies apparently can only get the Trump train so far Eventually it runs out of steamHillary Clinton showed herself to be the kind of person you want in the White House And Donald Trump showed himself to be the kind of kindergartner who should have his train taken away and instead given a timeoutThe conventional wisdom going into the first debate was that Donald Trump would have to tone it down and appear more presidential Trump definitely took a more staid and steadied approach but it didnt work His bravado and charm were largely absent from the stage Trump the showman can dance around policy pitfalls and distract from some of his less than successful business dealings Sedate Donald had far fewer tools at his disposal and looked like he couldnt wait for the 90minute snoozefest to endHillary Clinton didnt give a memorable performance but she didnt have to Most Americans expect Madame Secretary to drone on joylessly about policy and wave her curriculum vitae like a club against her enemies She met expectations which was enough and during some of the actual policy exchanges clearly had the upper hand on knowledge and backgroundTrump had huge areas of vulnerability to exploit in his opponent and he barely touched her on them  from Benghazi to her emails to the allegations of Clinton Foundation corruption He will need a much stronger showing in his next debate or this thing will be over long before NovemberNayyera Haq Trump looked more like Grumpy Cat than a leaderTrumps glass jaw was exposed throughout Clintons onslaught of policy laden counterpunches Trump came into this debate attempting to appeal to a broader audience so he needed to leave behind the showmanship and bravado that worked for him in the primary and instead carry himself with presidential composure But his calm voice lasted only 20 minutes and his listening face made him look more like Grumpy Cat than a leader showing that rehearsed moves just dont work for himTrump had Clinton momentarily against the ropes early on about NAFTA and TPP but then he allowed his emotion to take over and did not regain his own footing for the remainder of the debate His heavy handed depictions of Americas problems didnt hold up against Hillarys detailed solution oriented answers His snorting asides were countered with some surprising zingers from Hillary  Donald criticized me for preparing for this debate You know what else I prepared for To be PresidentTrump crumbled under Hillarys attacks on his business record lack of transparency on taxes and understanding of AfricanAmerican communities By the time it came around to national security the contrast in experience was even more clear with Clinton nimbly moving around the globe and Trump invoking his 10yearold sonwho he told us is good at computers  in a discussion of cyber security Trumps abrupt defensiveness especially on the issue of his temperament allowed Clinton to come across as the champion of those who have been taken taken advantage of by big business and systemic racism Calling this fight for Hillary
