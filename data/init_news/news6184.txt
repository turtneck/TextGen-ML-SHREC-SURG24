  Its always nice to know that some people arent as concerned with the election as they are with the big picture For Lance Wallnau that constitutes turning America into a Fundamentalist Christian nation Wallnau is a Seven Mountains Dominionist so is Ted Cruz who thinks that there is a vast leftwing conspiracy even though he says hes not really a conspiracy buff Theres some cognitive dissonance for you Appearing on The Jim Bakker Show on Wednesday Wallnau opened up his big bag of blarney and laid out his theories about the leftwings diabolical plans to destroy conservatives especially Christian conservatives Wallnau thinks that the left has a web of progressive organizations like MoveOnorg Media Matters and Right Wing Watch that controls the media and decides what Americans think and talk about They are all independent organizations coordinated by one group of people like us who handle the money So theyll show up where theres race issuesboom and make them inflammatory Theyll show up where theres a campus issueboom and make it inflammatory Then the media machine kicks in Media Matters which is run by one of their organizations and they come in and they get it into the social media channels so its in Facebook and everything And you would think all of Americas ablaze Its a handful of funded executed strategists with entities called 527s that are disciplining America Where to start with this stew of projection No one group handles the money for all the liberal advocacy groups The idea is absurd These groups do not plot to turn any single issue into an inflammatory one that happens organically depending on what life brings us Hes never heard of the shit happens theory I guess Media Matters is not a media group unto itself it exists to keep the actual media honest Social networks You think anyone can control those If so you really are stupid And those horrible 527s that are controlling this disciplining of America There are plenty of those on the right as well The 527 designation just means its a nonprofit advocacy group A quick look at the top fifty 527s in this election cycle shows that all sorts of issues and ideologies are represented But Wallnau hasnt emptied his can of crazy yet Showing an amazing capacity for projection he explains why Christians are feeling that things are not quite right The web literally is coming down on America And whats sad is how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times Do you feel that Its almost like everythings going wrong And that fog thats on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released He goes on to blame the imaginary leftwing syndicate for authorizing Satan to run things Authorize So Satan has to get a rubber stamp of some kind Is he the one authorizing the release of those spirits If he is he must have mountains of paperwork One wonders when he has time to tempt anyone Like most pseudoChristians Wallnau loves to fall back on the idea that his devil is running things when those things arent going his way Thats toddlerlevel thinking What else would you expect though from someone who thinks God sent Donald Trump to be their savior The charge of witchcraft obliges me to repeat things I may have said before but that always bear repeating Witches do not sit around in groups of 13 trying to figure out ways to ruin the lives of others We have our own problems and we dont need or want more stuff to deal with We are not some cabal intent on turning America into a macrocosm of our own ideology Thats the Dominionists thing We are quite happy to live out own lives and let others do the same That said we do get involved in elections Just like any other American we volunteer for our candidates We phone bank and go doortodoor We vote and encourage others to do the same If we are working any witchcraft it is the magic of working together to better the lives of everyone Jim Bakker and Lance Wallnau ought to try it sometime Heres the clip from our conspiracy mates friends at Right Wing Watch Featured Image via Screen Capture Share this Article
