The jobs report met expectations for once and thats good news for stock and bond investorsThe US economy added 223000 jobs in April according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Economists missed by just a whisker The consensus from Action Economics was 225000 new jobs The unemployment rate at 54 would be the lowest since May 2008For once there wasnt much to hate about the jobs report Stock investors liked the signs of a growing economy For example construction added 45000 jobs and those are good jobs that pay wellThats a very good sign for things to come says Joanie Courtney senior vice president market development at MonstercomAnd the bond market which is usually only happy when it rains rallied on the report as well The bellwether 10year Treasury note yield fell to 219 in early tradingIt wasnt all puppies and unicornsThe March report was revised down strongly to 85000 jobs from 126000 Manufacturing added just 1000 jobs and the oil sector lost 3000 jobsBecause all investment questions these days seem to revolve around when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates the April report didnt add much pressure to the Fed to nudge its key fed funds rate higher You need strong wage increases to create a wageprice spiral and the 01 increase in hourly wages wasnt strongIm surprised were not seeing more movement in wages Courtney says Usually in a recovery you start to see more movement But the April report looks only at hourly wages and not the wages of salaried workersFor investors then the April jobs report was the best of all possible worlds It showed decent hiring but nothing so exuberant that would push the Fed to tap the brakes
