Mothers Lauren Ioli l and Julie Nardi read to their children in the public library in Frederick Md which holds story time for children on Tuesdays Like other cities Frederick still has many middleincome jobs but they are harder to findIn Cincinnati Steve Raven has just moved his family into a faster economic lane He recently started a truckdriving job that pays a lot better than his previous work making shock absorbers It comes with solid health insurance the hope of more vacation travel and the prospect of his pay rising further from hereIn San Francisco Jessica Beard is also doing work shes excited about but the similarities stop there Her job title is adjunct professor but the notsolofty reality is that her teaching schedule in English literature is uncertain from one semester to the next  and so is her income and her health insurance She says shes making less than she did in another job she had 15 years agoIn Maryland Hope Harley is a young student at Frederick Community College Shes hopeful about earning a good living and about the economy getting better for most people in general But she adds a cautionary qualifier I feel like if you dont go to college you wont have a good life Shes carefully choosing among some career options in health care while working as a receptionist to avoid taking on student debtThree people three stories But together they provide a pretty good hint of the blend of progress and tribulation that defines todays middle class in the United States  including those who aspire to it and those who arent sure theyre in itThe old image of the middle class as an aspirational state of being  upward mobility coupled with a measure of financial stability  hasnt disappeared But its under stress as much as at any time in the postwar era Fewer Americans these days call themselves middle class and many who do use that label see it as a badge of struggle as much as a badge of opportunityThe middle class is being redefined partly by demographics In 1970 fully 40 percent of US households were married couples with at least one child under 18 years old By 2012 that share had declined to 20 percent of US households  a shift that includes more singleparent breadwinners Its also being redefined by a changing job market  notably by the rising importance of education on rsums as well as the disappearance of punchthetimecard jobs in offices and factories that once produced comfortable lifestyles but were vulnerable to automationAll this doesnt mean that living standards for average middleincome families are languishing in a state of permanent deterioration A good deal of evidence suggests thats not the case And while some deride the insecurity of the Gig Economy  the growing legions of people doing freelance contract temporary or other independent work  the changing job market has a bright side for many Americans greater flexibility creativity and selfdetermination for ones careerIn fact optimism about the future persists among moderateincome Americans to a degree that may seem surprising It has just been tempered The new watchword is realism  the awareness that the economically ascendant America of the baby boomers has now been superseded by an era of sluggish wage growth and financial setbacks People who saw the dotcom boom go bust and then the housing boom collapse are more focused on carefully managing their debt and careers than on becoming the next Warren Buffett Workers have little faith that their employer will look out for them So they are finding ways to either look out for themselves look out for each other or bothFrom Maryland to California Americans are longing to see a patentleather shine return to the American dreamThats why the challenges of average Americans loom as a central issue in the budding 2016 presidential race Both Republican and Democratic candidates talk with varying degrees of passion about the need to rebuild the middle class They just have different blueprints for how to do itYet beneath all the political rhetoric and nagging insecurities myths endure about just how doomed todays middle class really is while other forces at work weighing on Americans living standards may be getting too little attentionIts a paradox of the 21st centuryAlongside all the anxiety felt by millions of working families the stuff that symbolizes middleclass life is as ubiquitous as ever Americans live in larger houses drive better cars are better educated and have more choices from clothing to recreation than ever before Everyone it seems has a smartphone in his or her pocket and a billboardsize TV on the wallYet stagnation in real incomes has many people feeling that a middleclass life is harder to sustain or at least more precarious And many firmly believe living standards are fallingJust ask Maurice Evans Hes sitting on a shady stoop in downtown Frederick a small Maryland city with a sizable middle class and a cluster of historic church steeples Mr Evans marvels at both the material progress hes seen and the challenges he still faces At first what stands out to him is the price hikes in basic expenses Moneys not worth what it used to be he saysHes closing in on traditional retirement age and he recalls once buying an entire Tbone steak for a dollar He recounts having a good 35000ayear job at the Marriott hotel chain in the early 1980s when he lived in the District of ColumbiaThats what people are making now even though the cost of living is much higher today he saysStill on reflection he says Americans are generally getting better off over timeIn fact from homes to food to schooling thatis the case according to an analysis by economist Stephen Rose at George Washington University Many other economists concur that living standards have risen substantially in the past 35 years wage stagnation notwithstandingIndeed for all the consumer laments about rising prices official measures of inflation probably are skewed to actually understate the gains in income and living standards A May survey of several dozen prominent economists for instance found that 6 in 10 agreed with this statement The 9 cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically compared with 35 years agoOnly 1 in 10 disagreed some quibbling over the word substantially with the rest uncertainTrue there are endless complications with this kind of comparison across the decades Consider just one example To the degree that median household incomes have risen over the past half century a big reason is because of the longer hours worked more than rising wages as women have joined the workforce In other words two people are now working in many households instead of oneOther caveats Real median income still hasnt caught up to prerecession 2006 levels and in some prominent areas of middleclass spending costs have truly jumped in the past quarter centuryAlmost everyone who thinks of themselves as middle class wants their kids to go to college and the cost of college has shot up a lot faster than inflation in general says Lane Kenworthy a sociologist who studies the changing fortunes of different income groups in AmericaStill hes persuaded that living standards have kept rising for most people One simple benchmark of wellbeing Back in 1960 Americans overall spent twothirds of their income just on food clothing and housing By 2013 that had dipped below 50 percent Another Average US life expectancy rose seven years to age 78 between 1970 and 2007So the question arises Why do peoplefeel as if its tougher to maintain a middleclass life if living standards are up One reason is that fewer Americans are in fact part of the comfortable middle The great mass of people with middle incomes has declined as a share of the overall population Call it the barbell effectThe number of Americans who have moved into upperincome brackets has expanded and so have the ranks of those in the lowerincome brackets In other words the weight on each end is getting heavier while the middle is getting thinnerPart of this stems from the restructuring of the American economy For decades the demise of factory jobs has sent rolling shocks through communities large and small spawning the term Rust Belt in the 1980s Midwest and leaving some towns with a persistent glut of boardedup shop windows Key drivers of change have been technology and a globalizing labor marketThe upheaval has swept through the service sector too swallowing up loads of whitecollar jobs that could also be automated out of existence or outsourced overseas Demand for highskill workers has continued to expand as has demand for lowskill laborers who cant be replaced by machines  from janitors and landscapers to childcare workersThese changes are on display here in Frederick pop 68000 where the median income is a bit above the national level and homeownership is a bit below average Nestled in the first folds of the Appalachian Mountains the city has a redbrick downtown with a creekside promenade The job mix here ranges from buttondown lawyers heading in and out of the modest county courthouse to the foodservice workers who serve their lunches at places like Cafe Nola where the entrees include shrimp hominy and Chesapeake eggs BenedictYou have to look a bit harder to find the middleincome jobs but theyre still here The challenge is that they  like the higherend jobs  generally require more education than they used toWe have to have a piece of paper to get a job says Kelly Billigmeier a young student who is earning a degree in digital media design at Frederick Community College Her dad was able to have a familysupporting career working on computer software and security without ever getting a degree beyond high schoolStudents like Ms Billigmeier are thinking hard about their financial futures as well as how they can be of service to the world Technological change has made their choices more transparent A career website offered by the college shows students all the local jobs available in each degree program and their payIts the job opportunity that draws people into our classes says Jerry Boyd an administrator at the collegeOne sign of educations rising importance In 2008 only about a quarter of Americans with some college experience but no bachelors degree placed themselves in the lower or lowermiddle classes in Pew Research Center surveys Now that proportion is twice as high 47 percentStill even if you have a lot of education there is no guarantee of a highpaying job or lavish lifestyle today Consider the situation of Ms Beard the adjunct professor in San FranciscoShe has a PhD in English literature but her combined jobs teaching at two colleges dont pay as well as a coffeeretail managerial position she had a decade and a half agoI love what I do I just hate the working conditions she saysBeards concerns are ones that legions of workers now face high living costs even with a rentcontrolled apartment student loans to pay off and the unpredictability of knowing when  or if  their next contract will comeThat last point uncertainty is key for the large and probably growing share of workers in the Gig Economy Whether you attribute it to new technology and managerial strategies or to the sagging bargaining power of workers a growing chunk of the US workforce is essentially on call  contractors freelancers and parttime workers who sometimes get little advance notice of whether they will work a shift or notAnd the challenges dont stop with people who lack fulltime salaried positions Lifestyles may be improving but the prevalence of singleparent households and sandwich earners who are helping to support their children and a parent or two at once adds to the financial struggles of familiesThe lack of two incomes in a family is an enormous factor for many households says Michelle ZukowskiSerlin a mental health counselor who was a single mother after her partner diedNow married she says burdens have eased in part as she and her husband Troy can juggle responsibilities like ferrying Julia their teenage daughter to volleyball games But to Ms ZukowskiSerlin many costs still seem higher than they used to beThere was no school fee when I was in school to be on a team she says When Julia was heavily into gymnastics the annual outofschool fees alone training camps travel etc came to 6000 adds ZukowskiSerlin who lives in Kalamazoo MichNor are those the only rising costs confronting families today On several fronts the squeeze is more acute Health care Even though a record share of Americans has health insurance  with recent gains spurred by the 2010 Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare  the number of those who are insured through their employer continues to decline That coupled with rising copayments in the employer plans keeps pushing outofpocket costs for the average family higher Emergency funds Many households have little money in the bank to handle a layoff or financial crisis As of 2013 most US households could replace less than one month of their income through liquid savings according to a Pew analysis of consumer surveys by the Federal Reserve Wealth From home foreclosures to cashedout retirement plans the Great Recession ravaged the net worth of millions of Americans In 2013 middlerung households of workingage people had lower wealth assets minus liabilities than they had two decades earlier according to the Fed surveys Retirement The share of privatesector workers getting access to a definedbenefit pension was small before World War II but soared to about 45 percent by 1970 Since 1980 however its been in steady declineAll this helps explain why so many middleclass Americans feel anxious The biggest benefit were looking for is just some sense of job security  of being able to plan your life says Beard of herself and her colleaguesBeard has health insurance as long as she teaches at least two classes per semester at San Francisco State University Last summer when she had no classes she turned to unemployment insurance to surviveEven as she weighs a possible career change Beard says shes finding some optimism about the future  through what she sees as rising momentum for labor unions Ive started to get a little bit excited about something that I never thought would happen as those with PhDs who are unionized join lowskilled workers to push for better employment contracts and legislation on things such as raising the minimum wageIn Kalamazoo Troy ZukowskiSerlin Michelles husband and fellow counselor at the clinic they run together also voices a battletested optimismRight after World War II with the baby boom the economy just took off he says We did not have a lot of competitors around the world at that time In his view the path forward is partly to realize that that era was a blip an unusual experienceHe expects living standards to keep rising and that new policies can revive the health of the middle class Expectations dont need to be low he adds just reset for times that arent so boomingWhat does the future holdfor Americas middle classThe blend of hope and realism voiced by workers from Frederick to Kalamazoo is the tenor of the times  at least for now A brighter mood may arrive if the economy keeps improving for a few more years without a recession says Mr Kenworthy of the University of California San DiegoEven today though most Americans persist in believing their own kids will be better off than their parents In a 2012 AllstateNational Journal survey 6 in 10 Americans said they are generally living the American dream defined as the opportunity to go as far as your talents and hard work will take you and to live better than your parentsAmericas next economic chapter may well involve some tug and pull between collective and individual efforts to forge a better futureOn the one hand some economists call for efforts to revive labor unions or for other policies that in an era of widening income inequality might lift the fortunes of workers a higher minimum wage paid sick leave Policy efforts could also focus on growing the economy through innovation and education tipping a higher share of jobs from lowskill to middle or highskill ones that boost average incomesOn the other hand globalization of markets and technological advances have shaken up the old model of timeclock jobs in ways that will be hard to reverse And many workers see benefits as well as challenges in the new eraI think were going back again to an earlier time where people my age and younger are feeling more responsible for their wellbeing and income and I dont think thats a bad thing says Renee Lemoncelli a mom near Columbus Ohio whose daughter is now pursuing a career in publishingMs Lemoncelli does work she loves designing and making jewelry that she sells online at the artisan marketplace Etsy The income can fluctuate based on seasonal demand But she has developed several solid product lines pays for her own health insurance and feels that she and others are getting back to what our country was founded on which was freedom and libertyIn fact some historians have found that as the Industrial Revolution took hold a commonly voiced concern was that factory jobs were eroding the flexibility and autonomy that people valued Now many gig workers covet those same attributes even as others voice contrasting laments about the decline of traditional pensions or job securityMy parents definitely were more secure Lemoncelli says They worked for local utility companies in an era when they were loyal to the company and the company was loyal to themNow as those bonds have frayed Lemoncelli sees a positive shift Her 20something daughter is part of a generation of young workers attuned to charting their own jobhopping career paths  gaining skills and fresh experiences as they goFor now though the young generation is navigating a job market thats more polarized than it used to be with more positions at the high or low ends of the pay spectrum The middle is still large but it has been squeezed both in numbers of jobs and by a dearth of wage growth according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkSome experts say America has a ripe opportunity to rebuild the middle class  and to thrust the economy forward in the process Whats needed says Joseph Fuller of Harvard Business School is for states and localities to forge closer ties between employers and institutions like technical schools that can train workers for growing careers Companies will get the skilled employees they need Workers will advance into better jobsIn Cincinnati Mr Raven found upward job mobility through a training partnership between Napier Truck Driver Training Inc and Hamilton County Job  Family Services He sees a middleincome lifestyle coming into viewIts coming into fruition he says I dont expect it to happen overnight
