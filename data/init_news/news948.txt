Gentlemen Donald J Trump is the new Presidentelect of the United States Though a a few results may still be unclear Trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of Ohio Florida Iowa and North Carolina plus Georgia And in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized Pennsylvania Michigan and WisconsinPennsylvania and Michigan have not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1988 and Wisconsin since way back in 1984 It appears also that states the Democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as Minnesota Maine and Virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins The 2nd Congressional district of Maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with Nebraska has been called for the Republicans for the first time in nearly 30 years The last time any Maine district voted for a GOP Presidential candidate was 1988 when George H W Bush seized all four electoral votes thereImportantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for Trump For example counts so far show that some 40 of voters in Connecticut and Rhode Island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic Republican candidate Their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support Trump This is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views publicThe clown candidate has beaten 16 more experienced Republican challengers and now Hillary Clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political historyAs tonights results have shown plenty of Trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet Media airtime for proTrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks Mainstream journalists such as Glenn Thrush  Wolf Blitzer  Jake Tapper  Jessica Valenti  and Brent Budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the DNC and Clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate This only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding Trump victory needs to be heldAnd lets not forget the Senate and House races After months of spineless GOP cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from Trump The Donald has still carried them to victory in both Houses of Congress  The White House Senate and House of Representatives are all in Republican hands until at least the 2018 House midterms Can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and SJWs yetEvery powerful vested interest not only supported Hillary but did everything they could to ruin Trump Yes its happeningDid you see the last major Hillary Clinton rallies Celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them Lady Gaga Beyonc Jay Z Bruce Springsteen Bon Jovi and Katy Perry all fell into Clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support Donald Trump Even longterm Republicans who betrayed Trump like Arnold Schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity SJWs such as Robert DeNiro after they joined the Never Trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs The celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months Hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for Hillary ClintonLikewise every major American company that has come out for a candidate has come out for Hillary Plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the Clinton campaign behind the scenes as well Prominent billionaires like George Soros and Warren Buffett have done all they could to drag Hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line Whilst Trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media They include the scapegoated but brave Peter Thiel and Carl IcahnAnd then theres the mainstream media Countless studies have indicated that about 8590 of all journalists are liberal This overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as The New York Times  Washington Post  and Huffington Post  plus Democratic TV surrogates like CNN and NBC The 2016 campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two George W Bush Administrations but raged even more ferociously against Donald Trump over the last 18 monthsAll of these media elites have lambasted Trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting Hillary Podesta and DNC emails Everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of Clinton Foundation donors in Hillarys Secretary of State diary book to more recent revelations about John Podestas involvement with Satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the Wolf Blitzers and Chuck Todds of the American mainstream media Yet Trump has triumphed nonethelessThe new administration must crush the criminal Democratic elites and Clinton Foundation with the rule of law Will Hillary now find herself stumbling into jailInasmuch as the Clinton campaign the SJWs and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine President Trump once he takes office Trumps first priority as CommanderinChief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the Clinton Foundation He also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by Wikileaks perpetrated from within the DNC and Hillary Clintons campaignThe Department of Justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when AttorneyGeneral Loretta Lynch had a private meeting with Bill Clinton during the most crucial time of the FBI investigation into Hillarys emails Additionally elements of the State Department illegally informed Hillary about new developments in that same case Enough is enough Its time to drain the swampElection night produced another curveball after weeks of calling Donald Trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result Hillary Clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the American people It would seem that she only telephoned Trump privately So whos the sore loser nowLast night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in Americanand perhaps globalhistory We cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next 24 hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all oddsHail to the Chief Donald J TrumpRead More 4 Reasons Donald Trump Will Win The Presidential
