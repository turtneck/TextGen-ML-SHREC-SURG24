Gun control homegrown extremism homophobic violence and the war against Islamic State have all been highlighted by the Orlando nightclub massacre but deadlock in Washington means major legislation will probably have to wait until after the November electionWhoever wins the US presidency will find an intray where the threat of terrorism at home and the commitment to wars abroad grinds on 15 years after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and Senate Democrats went on the front foot on Monday calling for laws that would make it harder for terrorists to get their hands on firearms in particular assault riflesIn a vivid illustration of ideological division however Republican flagbearer Donald Trump opposed gun control measures lambasted the immigration system as dysfunctional and claimed vindication in his call for a ban on foreignborn Muslims entering the USA landslide victory for Clinton or Trump with reflected gains in Congress could give one or the other a mandate for change lacking during the Obama years In the meantime there is realpolitik With Obama facing a Republicanled House and Senate the prospects for action are remote even after the killing of 49 people in the worst mass shooting in American historyEven so Senate Democrats lost little time on Monday in urging quick passage of legislation defeated last year to impose additional gun controls The bill would prevent people on terror watch lists and other suspected terrorists from buying firearms or explosivesThe killer in Orlando has been identified as Omar Mateen a 29yearold Americanborn Muslim whose weapons included an AR15 semiautomatic rifle FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against himObama himself weighed in on Monday The fact that we make it this challenging for law enforcement for example even to get alerted that somebody who they are watching has purchased a gun  and if they do get alerted sometimes its hard for them to stop them from getting a gun  is crazy Its a problem And we have to I think do some soulsearchingBut again the danger here is is that then it ends up being the usual political debate And the NRA and the gun control folks say that oh Obama doesnt want to talk about terrorism And if you talk about terrorism then people say why arent you looking at issues of gun controlAt the start of his second term Obama pushed legislation to expand background checks ban certain assaultstyle weapons and cap the size of ammunition clips That measure collapsed in the Senate and there has been little movement sinceBut if Trump provokes an electoral backlash handing sweeping victories to Democrats there could be new opportunities for Clinton who has been more outspoken on the issue than candidates in previous yearsOn Monday she told a rally in Cleveland Ohio If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links you should not be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked And you shouldnt be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show And yes if youre too dangerous to get on a plane you are too dangerous to buy a gun in AmericaYet the watchlist argument is less simple than meets the eye The nofly list for example has come under fire from left and right Drawn up by the FBI in the wake of the 911 attacks it contains 700000 names according to one estimate and has mistakenly included infants US military veterans and politicians including Edward Kennedy and John Lewis Analysts describe it as an unfocused and unwieldy blunt instrumentThis is one reason why a Congress that blocked gun control measures after the shooting of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown Connecticut seems unlikely to shift gear now Josh Earnest the White House press secretary admitted I dont know whether this profound tragedy will have more of an impact on the minds of members of Congress Hopefully it willBut Senator Ron Johnson a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the Senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs disagreed that stricter gun laws were the solution I think theres other root causes in play he told the Associated Press I think mental health is a huge issueThese are the tangibles more readily quantified What the White House and Congress should do to promote harmony with both the Muslim and LGBT communities is a more textured longterm challenge where tone is crucialWith characteristic bombast Trump charged straight in on Monday When I am elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States Europe or our allies until we understand how to end these threats he saidWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killerHe added The Muslim communitys so important They have to work with us  and turn in the people who are badAt Clintons rally the tone was very different We should avoid eroding trust in that community  inflammatory antiMuslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the family and friends of Muslim Americans and millions of Muslim business people hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terrorIt is no coincidence she added that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled since the Paris and San Bernardino attacksShe called on local leaders teachers and communities to develop education to recognize signs of radicalisation And in contrast to Trumps proposed ban on individuals she instead took aim at foreign governments implying she would take a tougher stand than Obama It is long past time for Saudis Qataris Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organisationsThe Orlando attack has also focused attention on hate crimes against gay men and lesbians in America The Obama administration has overseen great strides including the legalisation of gay marriage but activists note this can conceal ongoing hostility and prejudice in many communities The recent political debate over transgender bathroom use is seen as one example that contributes to a hostile climateIt was reported on Monday that members of Congress plan to ask the White House to end a decadesold policy that prohibits many gay men from donating blood Senators including Elizabeth Warren have long criticised the rule as discriminatoryUsing the alternative term Isil Obama acknowledged the targeting of LGBT people by Islamic State but gave little hint of new concrete measures Regardless of the particular motivations of this killer there are connections between this vicious bankrupt ideology and general attitudes towards gays and lesbians And unfortunately thats something that the LGBT community is subject to not just by Isil but by a lot of groups that purport to speak on behalf of God around the worldTrump meanwhile set himself up as an unlikely champion of the LGBT community Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LBGT sic community  Donald Trump with his actions or Hillary Clinton with her words Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country  they enslave women and murder gays I dont want them in our countryBut Trumps remarks met with scepticism from gay rights activists who argue that he has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who would roll back nationwide marriage equalityJay Brown communications director of the Human Rights Campaign said Lets be clear LGBTQ people are MuslimsAnd make no mistake Donald Trump is no friend of the LGBTQ community Donald Trump has vowed to roll back marriage equality pass Kim Davisstyle discrimination and allow governors from coast to coast to pass laws like North Carolinas HB2 Trumps rhetoric today isnt fooling anyone and what he is peddling isnt protection Its poison
