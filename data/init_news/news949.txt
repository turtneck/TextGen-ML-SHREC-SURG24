Dursts statements on the show are part of the case against himThat case has been several years in the making she said The investigation has been going on The making of the cases has been going on And I think these are pieces of evidence that are going to be used and theyre going to be very powerful pieces of evidenceBut that doesnt mean investigators only learned about evidence as the show aired

recordedIn our trial he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends making a lot of admissions and the state never used that she said But he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder we were trying Earlier in those interviews in a previous interview for that very program The Jinx there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony And so he realized he knew he had a mic on This is the third time hes made that mistakeWhile the comments may appear incriminating his attorney told Fox News Justice With Judge Jeanine
