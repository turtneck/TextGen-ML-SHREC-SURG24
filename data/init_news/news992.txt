Of late Bernie Sanders has beenunder assault from the technocratic wing of the Democratic Party The charge His campaign has circulated economic projections that show stunning  and rather implausible  benefits from Sanderss agendaSanderss promises runs against our partys best traditions of evidencebased policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmeticwrote four Democratic exchairs of the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers These are numbers we would describe as deep voodoo if they came from a taxcutting Republicanagreed Paul KrugmanAmidst this onslaught Steve Randy Waldman has penned what is I think the best defense of SandersHe admits that the campaigns policy proposals are sketchy and the economic projections its circulating are fantastical But he argues that none of that really mattersThe presidents role is to define priorities that must later be translated into wellcrafted policy details he says In a democratic polity wonks are the helpWaldman has a point If elected president Sanders could certainly get some top economists to tighten his policies He would have the vast machinery of the federal government available to sweat the details The best experts in academia would be honored to advise him Every think tank in town would produce reams of research on how to implement his ideasAnd hell lets just be honest All this policy talk is just a way to pass the time between now and the election It doesnt matter how strong Bernie Sanderss singlepayer health care plan is  its not going to pass just like Donald Trump isnt going to get Mexico to pay for a wall and Hillary Clinton isnt going to get universal preK past a Republican Congress and Ted Cruz isnt going to set up a valueadded taxIts obvious that debating the details of campaign proposals is on some level fantasy football for wonks Events will intercede bureaucracies will weigh in Congress will balk promises will be broken Remember when Barack Obama ran for president opposing an individual mandate and then flipflopped and supported one So whats the point of paying attention to any of this at allAs someone who pays quite a lot of attention to campaign policy processes heres my answer Watching a candidate run his campaigns policy processes is one of our best ways of predicting how he would run his White HouseThe key word there by the way is run Some of the most important decisions the president makes are about how to run the processes that translate vision into policy Those decisions include whom to hire which advisers to listen to which ideas make sense which strategies are likely to work The presidency is one damn decision like that after another Obama famously is so exhausted by the decision fatigue of the job that he wears the same color suit every day so he has one less thing to decide in the morningThis is one way in which campaigns give us insight into presidencies Presidential candidates also have to decide whom to hire which advisers to listen to which ideas are truly good ones which strategies are likely to work To make those decisions well they need a sound philosophy yes but they also need to want to hear good advice they need to want advisers who will tell them when theyre wrong they need to have good instincts for when something they want to believe is true simply isnt and they need to be realistic about the strategies that are likely to work and the ones that arentMy worry about Sanders watching him in this campaign is that he isnt very interested in learning the weak points in his ideas that he hasnt surrounded himself with people who police the limits between what they wish were true and what the best evidence says is true that he doesnt seek out counterarguments to his instincts that hes attracted to strategies that align with his hopes for American politics rather than what we know about American politics And these tendencies if they persist can turn good values into bad policies and an inspiring candidate into a bad presidentThe reason I care about the puppiesandrainbows promises of his singlepayer proposal is that I think Sanders believes them  I dont think hes a cynical politician simply eliding the weaknesses of his plan The reason I care about his campaigns circulation of fairly outlandish economic projections is that it makes me worry theres no one around Sanders with the sense to say that those results dont pass the smell test The reason Im frustrated by Sanderss promise that a political revolution will overcome all opposition to his plans is I think he believes it and so Im not sure he has a real plan B for when the political revolution doesnt happen The reason Sanderss persistently superficial answers on foreign policy matter to me is that theyre a test of his ability to learn on the fly about topics hes not terribly interested inIn a democratic polity wonks are the help But that only underscores the importance of electing someone good at hiring and managing them A President Sanders could hire excellent technocrats to help him make policy but would he want to A President Sanders could surround himself with experts who know the shortcomings of his ideas but would he listen to them A President Sanders could become deeply engaged on foreign policy but would he decide toManagement isnt the sexiest or most inspiring of topics But as Jimmy Carter can tell you it matters A good vision can be destroyed by a bad strategy high ideals can be muddied by weak staffing a pure heart can be led astray by bad adviceThere are plenty of criticisms to be made of Obamas presidency but I think the baseline competence of his administration has begun to dim memories of how important presidential management really isThe Bush administration was from this perspective a genuine disaster  a festival of tax cuts that didnt make sense and wars that were illplanned and all of it run by a man who clearly couldnt separate experts from hacks Heckuva job Brownie and good advice from ideological fantasies I have always thought this story reported by Megan McArdle showed the mundane ways in which Bushs deficiencies diminished his presidencyA senior economic adviser for George W Bush once told me a rather haunting story about the administrations decision to sign the 2002 farm bill  Like virtually all sound economists Bushs advisers disliked the bill a subsidyladen monstrosity that was considerably worse than the farm bill that had preceded it in 1996but they reluctantly allowed it to go forward because they thought passing the farm bill would buy legislative support for something they considered even more important the authority the president needed to advance the next round of treaty negotiations at the World Trade Organization As compromises go this one didnt seem too bad so Bushs advisers put on their game faces as the president signed it into law on May 13 2002 with a touching speech about providing a safety net for farmers All went well until later when someone cracked a joke about how we dont need another farm bill The president shocked demanded an explanation Whats wrong with the farm bill No one told me to veto the farm bill The adviser wasnt trying to hide the football but had just assumed that Bush knew So had everyone else It was so obvious to economists no one thought to tell the presidentOn the other hand George W Bushs father wasnt the most brilliant policy mind to ever occupy the Oval Office but he was an excellent manager who chose good staff made decisions he didnt like but knew were necessary and ran a competent and mostly scandalfree bureaucracy Theres a reason esteem for his presidency has grown greatly since he left officeVoters are hiring managers and the presidential campaign is a long strangely constructed job interview Among the qualities people are looking for are inspiration and decency and Sanders has shown he has both in spades But the presidency demands more than that and Sanderss success means he needs to show hes up to the more mundane rigors of the job too
