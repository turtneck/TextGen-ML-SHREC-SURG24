Im not sure when it started but at some point the Republican Party ceded the business of governance to the Democrats Maybe it began with the Tea Party movement or Fox News or the larger conservative mediaindustrial complex  I honestly dont know But its clear now that the GOP is no longer a legitimate governing party A party that allows rank neophytes like Herman Cain and Donald Trump and Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina to run for the highest office in the country has lost its wayIf you look at how the Republican Party operates today its hard to avoid the conclusion that governing just isnt a priority  or internal pressures within the party make it impossible Instead the GOP has become what I previously called a selfperpetuating hype machine for conservative political entrepreneurs Particularly at the national level Republican candidates and legislators many of them at least show no interest in compromise or serious policymaking which is what youd expect from a party of and for puristsWhile the new GOP has been bad for the country its been great for political celebrities people looking to promote their personal brands Ted Cruz is the most recent and obvious example of this approach to politics Cruz has been a remarkably ineffective Senator He has done nothing but bloviate and showboat on the Senate floor Hes accomplished zero legislatively His only practical contribution has been to obstruct and draw attention to his martyrdom read presidential campaignTed Cruz will never be elected president If he manages to win the Republican nomination hell lose in a landslide to a Democrat whoever that happens to be And because hes so eagerly made a spectacle of himself in the Senate hes alienated all but the tiniest segment of his own party Which means he has no political capital in Congress  hardly a concern for someone uninterested in legislating howeverCruzs latest squabble with Rand Paul helps to illustrate Cruzs intentions In an interview with Fox News Brian Kilmeade Paul basically wrote Cruzs political obituaryTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate and as a consequence he cant get anything done legislatively He is pretty much done for and stifled and its really because of personal relationships or lack of personal relationships and it is a problem I approach things a little different I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing  I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and its just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end resultPaul is right of course but he omits an essential point Cruz has been ineffective by design Managing relationships and respecting decorum only matter to people trying to accomplish things in the Senate  thats not what Cruz is up to Like the fanatical Tea Party wing of the House Cruz is there to obstruct and selfpromote In all likelihood Cruz will retire after a single term in the Senate Now that hes boosted his national profile and endeared himself to the insurgent elements of the base he can pivot to the private sector and make more money as a professional conservative activist  as for example Jim DeMint did in 2012 Cruz ought to be seen as the grifter that he is It was never about policy for him When he leaves the Senate hell be a hero to the fringe right Hell make a fortune on the conservative lecture circuit telling rapturous audiences about his willingness to challenge the Washington cartel It wont matter that he accomplished nothing changed nothing  itll be enough that he pretended to while he was there The same is true of Carson and Trump and Fiorina and even politicians like Huckabee and Jindal None of them will be president but their overthetop activism will ensure them a profitable career after politics And that I assume is the whole point The Democrats have their share of bad politicians but you dont see this kind of faux activism and exploitation in their party
