WASHINGTON  Rep Adam Schiff DCalif introduced legislation Wednesday to authorize military force against Islamic State militants  a step aimed at forcing Congress to take responsibility for a war its been funding for nearly six months with almost no debate on its duration costs or potential tollLawmakers have put no parameters on the US military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or ISIS since it began in August Since then the US has spent more than 1 billion participated in more than 1700 airstrikes and authorized sending roughly 3000 US troops to Iraq All of this has happened without new war authorizationSchiffs proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force would do three things limit military action against ISIS to three years prohibit the use of US ground troops and immediately terminate a stillactive 2002 AUMF tied to the Iraq War It also would end in three years a sweeping 2001 AUMF that President Barack Obama says gives him the authority to go after ISIS without new war authorization Some in Congress disagree that Obama has that authority and insist he needs new authorization which the president says he would welcomeThere is no doubt that our current offensive amounts to war said Schiff the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee Congress should take action both to authorize its prosecution and to set limits on that authorization so it may not be used by any future administration in a manner contrary to our intentSchiff is a lonely voice in the House Even progressives like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif have treated the need for new war authorization as an afterthought Its not much better in the Senate where Democrats hastily passed an AUMF out of a committee in late December knowing it was going nowhere They did so to show their frustration over the lack of attention to the issueIf the new Congress has revealed anything its that nobody in Washington wants to go first when it comes to authorizing a war The White House typically submits draft AUMF language to Congress as a first step to moving a bill but administration officials say they want feedback from Capitol Hill before moving Lawmakers meanwhile are grumbling about waiting for draft language from Obama when they could be moving forward with legislation on their ownThere is plenty of responsibility to go around Schiff told The Huffington Post I place more responsibility here than at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave They dont have to make the first step There is nothing holding us back except political timidityFor now Schiff is on the lookout for cosponsors for his bill He doesnt have any yet but he said he plans to reach out to lawmakers in both parties Nobody in the Senate has introduced AUMF legislation though Sen Tim Kaine DVa a vocal proponent for passing new war authorization has called for using last years committeepassed bill as the base for new legislation in this CongressSchiff acknowledged that his proposal is probably more narrow than the White House wants and that Obama will likely look to Republicans to give him broad authority Secretary of State John Kerry told senators in December that the administration would oppose an AUMF that explicitly prohibits US ground troops which some Democrats have insisted on Republicans appeared more amenable to Kerrys requestMany of us are skeptical of another broad AUMF considering whats happened with the last one Schiff said There will be some interesting bedfellows on this
