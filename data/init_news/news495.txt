If the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran that deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons  it will all but guarantee that Iran will get those nuclear weapons lots of them the Israeli leader said in a 39minute speech to the US Congress that offered a pointbypoint critique of Obamas Iran diplomacyIn an appearance that strained USIsraeli relations and was boycotted by dozens of Obamas fellow Democrats Netanyahu said Irans leadership was as radical as ever could not be trusted and the deal being worked out with world powers would not block Irans way to a bomb but paves its way to a bombThis deal wont be a farewell to arms it will be a farewell to arms control  a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare Netanyahu told lawmakers and visitors in the House of Representatives His speech drew 26 standing ovationsNetanyahus speech culminated a diplomatic storm triggered by his acceptance in January of a Republican invitation that bypassed the White House and Obamas fellow Democrats many of whom considered it an affront to the presidentObama refused to meet Netanyahu saying that doing so just ahead of Israels March 17 general election would be seen as interference Aides to Obama said he would not be watching the speech broadcast live on US televisionUnderscoring the partisan divide over Netanyahus address House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said afterwards that as a friend of Israel she was near tears during his speech calling it an insult to the intelligence of the United States She said she was saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by IranNetanyahu entered the chamber to a cacophony of cheers and applause shaking hands with dozens of lawmakers including House Speaker John Boehner before taking a podium and telling lawmakers he was deeply humbledAt the start of the speech he sought to defuse the intense politicization of his appearance which has hardened divisions between Republicans and Democrats over the White Houses approach to stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weaponsHe said he was grateful to Obama for his public and private support of Israel including US military assistance and contributions to Israels Iron Dome antimissile systemI regret that some see my appearance here as political he said I know that no matter which side of the aisle you sit on you stand with IsraelAlthough given the cold shoulder by the US administration Netanyahu on Monday offered an olive branch saying he meant no disrespect to Obama by accepting an invitation to speak to US lawmakers that was orchestrated by the presidents rival RepublicansOn Tuesday Netanyahu appeared to offer another possible avenue for an Iran deal but put very strict conditions on itHaving previously demanded a total elimination of Iranian nuclear projects with bombmaking potential he said the United States should not ease its restrictions until Iran improves its overall conduct a comment that could stiffen support among Republicans to maintain US sanctions on Iran or seek to escalate themBut the Israeli leader did not specifically call for new penalties something Obama has said would undermine ongoing talks and would prompt a veto if passed by CongressIf the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed they should at the very least be prepared to insist that Iran changes its behavior before the deal expires Netanyahu said The terms under consideration a suspension of restrictions on Irans sensitive nuclear activities in as little as 10 yearsHe added that while Israel and similarly minded Arab states might not like such a deal we could live with itHe added that the drop in oil prices put the United States and other countries in a stronger position to negotiate with IranIrans nuclear program can be rolled back well beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime especially given the recent collapse of the price of oilAs many as 60 of the 232 members of Congress from Obamas Democratic Party sat out the address to protest what they see as a politicization of Israeli security an issue on which Congress is usually unitedThe absence of so many lawmakers could raise political heat on Netanyahu at home Many Israelis are wary of estrangement from a US ally that provides their country with wideranging military and diplomatic supportOn Monday Obama appeared to wave off any prospect that the bedrock US alliance with Israel might be ruined by the rancorNetanyahu a rightwing politician who has played up his security credentials had denied his speech would have any design other than national survivalHe introduced Nobel peace laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel 86 to prolonged applause and said Elie your life and work inspires and gives meaning to the words Never Again I wish I could promise you Elie that the lessons of history have been learned I can only urge the leaders of the world not to repeat the mistakes of the past Wiesel sat in the gallery next to Netanyahus wife SaraNetanyahu wants the Iranians stripped of nuclear projects that might be used to get a bomb  something Tehran insists it does not want Washington deems the Israeli demand unrealisticNetanyahu who has hinted at the prospect of unilateral strikes as a last resort on Iranian nuclear sites told lawmakers Israel would stand alone if needed but he made no threat of military actionSpeaking just before Netanyahus address Irans Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Switzerland for talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry said the Israel leader was trying to create tension in the negotiations which face an endofMarch deadline to reach a framework accordUnder a 2013 interim deal the United States and five other powers agreed in principle to let Iran maintain limited uranium enrichment technologies US National Security Adviser Susan Rice argued on Monday that this commitment could not be undoneA deal with Iran is far from guaranteed given US assessments that more than a decade of carrotandstick diplomacy with Iran might again fail to clinch a final accordThe United States and some of its allies notably Israel suspect Iran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover to develop a nuclear weapons capability Iran denies this saying it is for peaceful purposes such as generating electricity
