With the Democratic presidential primary in its twilight frustration within the ranks over the partys handling of the primary process spilled out this week as Bernie Sanders supporters lashed out at party leaders arguing that their candidate has been treated unfairlyThe public outpouring of anger began last weekend at the Nevada Democratic Party convention where Sanders supporters who said Hillary Clintons backers had subverted party rules shouted down proClinton speakers and sent threatening messages to state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange after posting her phone number and address on social mediaThat led Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and other top party leaders to demand an apology and publicly ruminate on the possibility of violence at the Democratic National Convention in July as they prepare for a general election battle with Donald TrumpObama administration officials on Wednesday played down concerns about escalating tensions likening the race to the 2008 primary fight between Clinton and thenSen Barack ObamaBut Sanders isnt backing down A campaign spokesman said Wednesday that the campaign was looking into whether to ask for a recount in Kentucky where Sanders narrowly lost on Tuesday night and he fired up his crowd in Southern California Tuesday night by calling out the Democratic establishmentThe Sanders campaign on Tuesday did condemn unruly behavior from supporters and those who made threats to party leaders but made clear it is sticking with its stance that the party is subverting the process in a way that benefits ClintonThese claims that our campaign is sort of fomenting violence in some way are absolute nonsense Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNNs Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night adding that the campaign absolutely categorically condemns any threatening behaviorThe breakdown in civility comes after what has otherwise been a comparatively polite campaign season for Democrats but the frustration exposes a rift in the party and undercuts the notion that Clinton will be able to march into the Democratic convention this summer with a party unified behind herThe problem is that there are longsimmering concerns about unfair treatment out in the Nevada Democratic Party Weaver added We are not going to allow the millions of people who supported Bernie Sanders to be sort of rolled over in places like Nevada by the way they handled that conventionEarlier on Tuesday Sanders released a statement suggesting that his supporters were justified in feeling like the party has given them a raw dealIf the Democratic Party is to be successful in November it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned Sanders statement read Unfortunately that was not the case at the Nevada convention At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking placeIn an interview with CNN Wasserman Schultz said that statement wasnt enoughI was deeply disturbed she said The senators response was anything but acceptable It certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel the fireThe DNC chairwoman however said she has not spoken directly with Sanders but that her staff has been in touch with the Vermont senators campaign She also pushed back against Sanders accusation that the party had rigged the system against himWeve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014 she said They were followed and even if the Sanders supporters were frustrated there is never under any circumstances a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to in responseOn CNNs New Day Wednesday morning Weaver accused the DNC chairwoman of throwing shadeWe can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how shes been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign Weaver saidI gotta say its not the DNC he added By and large the DNC has been very good to us but not Debbie Wasserman SchultzWasserman Schultz brushed off Weavers comments later in the dayMy response to that is hashtag SMH shake my head Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer on Wolf We need to focus on one thing get through this primary and work to prepare for the general election and make sure that we can continue to draw the contrasts between either one of our really fine candidates who are focused on helping people reach the middle class and make sure that we get equal pay for equal work and create jobs and not let the Republicans take health care away from 20 million AmericansHe should get things under controlSpeaking to reporters in Columbus Ohio on Wednesday afternoon Vice President Joe Biden said if such disruption happens again Hes going to have to be more aggressive in speaking out about itBut here we are in May as was pointed out Biden continued Hillary was still in this in May in June Im confident that Bernie will be supportive if Hillary wins which the numbers indicate will happen So Im not worried Theres no fundamental split in the Democratic PartyLeading congressional Democrats also pushed Sanders to rein in his supporters Reid called Sanders response a test of leadership for Sanders and a source in his office told CNN that the Nevada senator is waiting to hear from the senator himself on the matterThe convention was Saturday Its now Wednesday afternoon And he hasnt spoken about it the source saidCalifornia Democratic Sen Barbara Boxer who spoke on behalf of Clinton at the Nevada convention condemned the behaviorHe should get things under control Boxer said Were in a race that is very critical We have to be unitedThis is a character moment for Bernie Sanders Hes got to figure out how hes true to his values and his ideals fully said CNN political commentator Van JonesI think Hillary and Bernie both misunderstand this movement I think Hillary just sees it as just a bunch of rowdy kids that at some point will just calm down and fall into line he said later adding I think Bernie actually only sees the good in his followers I think Bernie really misunderstands there is a nasty edge to his following that hes not taking seriously enoughSen Tim Kaine criticized Sanders responses in the wake of reports that Democrats felt threatened at and following the conventionWhat he did yesterday was sort of say its the partys fault Kaine told CNN That deflection of responsibility is not leadershipKaine added that the angry protests could be dirty tricksters in the crowd and not just Sanders supportersI dont think we should assume that all of the people raising hell are Bernie people Kaine saidSanders goes after the establishment in fiery speechSpeaking in Southern California Tuesday night Sanders fired up the crowd by calling out the Democratic leadershipThe Democratic Party is going to have to make a very very profound and important decision It can do the right thing and open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change That is the Democratic Party I want to see Sanders saidI say to the leadership of the Democratic Party Open the doors let the people in Or the other option for the Democratic Party which I see as a very sad and tragic option is to choose and maintain its status quo structure remain dependent on big money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy he saidThe crowd responded by chanting Bernie or Bust the equivalent of the Republican NeverTrump slogan for the Democratic raceHis speech barreled through his list of Clinton contrasts comparing his stances with her and criticizing those stances on minimum wage fracking breaking up the big banks and her use of super PACsIn response to the chaos in Nevada Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook simultaneously praised the passion and participation of Sanders supporters while adding that Clinton believes that no one should be intimidated harassed or threatened in this process He called on them to focus that energy on unifying the party a task that could be difficult given the raw feelings many Sanders supporters have for Clinton after the primarySupporters of both Clinton and Sanders deserve respect for the work they have put into their campaigns Mook said Ultimately we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose  to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trumps handsWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest on Wednesday downplayed any tensions between the two campaignsHe recalled a similar tenor to the 2008 contest between Clinton and Obama saying those tensions were no less intense and didnt lead to a negative result in the general electionI think one of the lessons of 2008 is not to confuse passion in primary for disinterest in the general election he said adding that highly motivated supporters were good for democracyWhile the spotlight this year was on the Republican primary and prospect for a contested convention and protests at the national convention in Cleveland some Democrats now worry about that happening at their convention in PhiladelphiaWasserman Schultz said the incidents in Nevada would result in the DNC reviewing its procedures for PhiladelphiaAs a result of this happening this weekend we will have conversations both at the staff level as well as my having conversations with the candidates so that we can make sure that both campaigns are focused on making sure that we can allow this process for the duration of the primary to play out in a civil and orderly way she saidBut the DNC chairwoman said she wasnt worried about violence happening at the conventionThis was absolutely a serious concern which is why I said what needed to be said yesterday and others have said that there was real concern Wasserman Schultz told Blitzer Wednesday afternoon But it is important and I am confident that the candidates take the messages to heart about making sure that we respond and conduct ourselves in a civil and orderly wayCalifornia Democratic Sen Dianne Feinstein however warned that Sanders intention to take his candidacy to the Democratic convention could spark unrest similar to the chaotic 1968 convention in Chicago and the riots surrounding itIt worries me a great deal Feinstein told CNNs Manu Raju You know I dont want to go back to the 68 convention because I worry about what it does to the electorate as a whole  and he should tooAnd Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said hes concerned about violence in PhiladelphiaWe saw what happened at the Trump rallies which broke into violence people punching one another I dont want to see that happen at the Democratic Party Durbin told CNN I call on Bernie to say to his supporters be fervent be committed but be sensible Dont engage in any violenceWeaver pledged Tuesday night that the convention will be peacefulTheres not going to be any violence in Philadelphia Wolf I guarantee you that he said on CNN We hope for a fair and orderly convention
