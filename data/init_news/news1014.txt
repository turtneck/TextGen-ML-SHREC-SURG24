persona and thawing hostilities with the skittish party eliteWe need unity as soon as possible said Ed Cox the New York party chairman and a Trump supporterYet while the charm offensive has made some progress interviews with dozens of GOP officials here showed that the celebrity billionaire still has to overcome a host of lingering concerns  both about his loyalty to the party as well as his discipline and electability as a candidateWere the ones that built this party said Jonathan Barnett a national committeeman from Arkansas You see so many states where they have never reached out or built an organization  Remember were good people Were the grass roots Weve been around a long time And Trump needs usTrumps top campaign aide Paul Manafort assured RNC members here that Trump views the party leadership as partners both in raising money and crafting a statebystate strategy and that his hot rhetoric has been a part that hes been playing and will soon give way to a more presidential demeanorTrump is playing a part and can transform for victory aide saysSome members were skeptical of Manaforts pitchTrump keeps saying that hes going to be so presidential that hell put you to sleep said Jos Cunningham chairman of the District of Columbia GOP He loves to say that His people say hell do that have that demeanor Id still like to see that because well we haventTrump himself is taking steps to repair relations RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called the billionaire mogul on Wednesday to congratulate him on his blowout victory in the New York primaryWe had a great talk no problem Priebus said in an interview Donald Trump is conciliatory You notice he hasnt been saying RNC lately He hasnt been saying that lately He certainly hasnt been talking about me latelyPriebus acknowledged that there probably are political benefits for Trump to rail against the process and use the RNC as a foilTheyve made a calculation somehow that it works ginning people up over accusations that the delegate selection process is rigged Priebus said I dont think they would be doing it on a larkPriebus said that the process is not skewed against Trump Nothings rigged just like nothing was rigged in New York when the top votegetter got 60percent of the vote but received 90percent of the delegatesTrumps rhetoric fits into his broader playbook to run against what he sees as corruption across the economic and political spectrums Manafort said in an interview that Trumps portrayal of the GOP nominating rules is no different than the rigged economy the rigged banking systemIt fits into the whole narrative of the system is broken and certain types of establishment situations dont meet the expectations of people he saidIts on Tensions between Trump and the GOP escalate in public fightFor much of the campaign the Trump operation seemed to alienate even shun party officials who are accustomed to courtship by candidatesMany officials took particular umbrage at Trumps onandoff public flirtation with ousting PriebusStop the attacks on Reince and the RNC leadership South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore said Reince is the best chairman I think in the partys history and there is no question that he is the guy to lead us into the general election Any discussion about a new chairman is completely stupidOn that point Manafort said This discussion over the last few weeks has not been an antiReince campaignTrump has been outfoxed by his chief Republican rival Sen Ted Cruz of Texas at state conventions and other gatherings where delegates to the national convention are selected Manafort said Trump is not seeking to upend the existing rules but believes the system lacks transparency and is trying to lay the groundwork for changes in future yearsCruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich addressed the RNC this week Also present were leaders of Our Principles PAC an antiTrump super PAC who huddled privately with some members Friday The groups chairwoman Katie Packer distributed a memorandum urging party leaders to do everything possible to stop Trump from locking up the nominationIt is not too late Packer wrote You are under no obligation to wrap your arms around a candidate who has not won a majority of GOP votes or a majority of delegates and perhaps wouldnt even be the frontrunner had the original field been much smallerYet in hallway chatter here there was a growing sense of resignation about Trump as the nomineeI sense that everybody has come around to the position that what we choose is what we choose and that to have an opponent to Hillary Clinton you take what you got and you run with it as fast as you can said David Norcross a former RNC general counselIs it too late for a Donald Trump makeoverThe conversations in Florida come amid a revamping of Trumps campaign Manafort said Trump is assembling teams of communications specialists schedulers policy advisers speechwriters researchers and liaisons to Capitol Hill think tanks and other GOP power centers  all traditional campaign elements that had been lacking in Trumps shoestring structureWe couldnt run a general election with eight people Manafort saidManafort suggested that the individuals who have been appearing on cable television shows as Trump representatives will begin playing smaller roles as he asserts control over what he called the narrativeNow were transitioning Manafort said Hes trying to be the nominee and people want to see the entire packageAmong the newest members of Trumps team is Rick Wiley who is well known to RNC members serving as the committees political director in 2012 When he addressed RNC members on Thursday Wiley sought to emphasize those connections and went out of his way to praise the work of the committees staff under PriebusWiley said the party and its nominee would be fully committed to waging a successful fall national campaign Arguing that the RNC had adapted the organizing model developed by the 2008 Obama campaign he added We are going to inherit a field program second to noneIn his presentation Wiley addressed worries among many Republicans that Trump as the nominee could lead the party to a catastrophic defeat in the fall one that could put its Senate majority at risk and cost Republicans House seatsYoure going to see this map expand he said contending that Trumps potential appeal to Reagan Democrats  workingclass white voters  could make states in the upper and industrial Midwest that long have been in the Democrats column competitive in the fallIf were playing in these states and were winning in some of these states and the Democrats are playing and having to spend money in those states he said its a good thing for us its a good thing for the party
