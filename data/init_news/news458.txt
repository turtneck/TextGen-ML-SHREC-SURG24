Protect Police Violence and Resistance in the United States  Joan Brunwasser Welcome back to OpEdNews Maya We last spoke back in January 2015 Now Id like to discuss your recent piece Death Penalty for Heroin Dealers More Proof the Drug War Is Not Over  Who thought the drug war was over in the first place and why  Advertisement  Maya Schenwar There has been a shift in mainstream politics toward condemning the drug war and for good reason It has done nothing to stem drug misuse and meanwhile it has resulted in the criminalization and incarceration of millions of people overwhelmingly Black and Brown people With countless studies demonstrating its failure I put this in quotes because I dont think the drug war was actually devised to help people in the first place politicians who defend it end up looking pretty bad So the current line is to say its in the past and that we have a new approach to drugs going forward The Obama administration many state governments and even conservative politicians including the Right on Crime crowd have said that we need to leave behind the old war on drugs In February Eric Holder said the drug war is over and Obama increasingly talks about treating drugrelated issues as public health problems instead of criminal problems JB How does that change anything the disproportionate numbers of minority members locked up for possession more single moms incarcerated for the same families split up and minors left with no parent at home Are they then opening the prison gates and saying We were wrong This was all a big mistake it didnt work and we diverted and wasted billions of dollars that could have been used to good purpose And we ruined your lives for nothing Oops Sorry MS No no one is opening the prison gates unfortunately There are some limited steps being taken toward scaling back drugwarrelated incarceration For example Obama has issued hundreds of commutations to people serving superlong drug sentences Some states have taken steps to reduce some very lowlevel drug offenses to misdemeanors instead of felonies which means people are a lot less likely to be incarcerated for them Californias Proposition 47 is an example of this although the emphasis on lowlevel offenses has actually entrenched the idea that people should be severely punished for higherlevel offenses  Advertisement  Obviously in a number of states marijuana is being decriminalized and some are legalizing it However that doesnt mean there are no longer marijuana arrests  in fact an ACLU study released recently showed there were more marijuana possession arrests last year than arrests for all violent crimes The study also showed that Black people are still disproportionately arrested in far greater numbers than white people despite using marijuana at about the same rate as white people JB How do we understand this Maya Beyond being convinced that the whole penal system is seriously screwed up whats the point of increased marijuana arrests Is this a last gasp effort or at least partly to fill up jail cells and local or private prison coffers MS There wasnt an increase in marijuana arrests overall last year there was a decrease But obviously it was a small decrease given that there was a larger number of possession arrests than all violent crime arrests I dont think its about filling private prison coffers Ultimately prisons are expensive for states and I dont actually see money as a primary motivator to incarcerate people Until we challenge criminality itself  and challenge the white supremacy that underlies the USs version of criminality  we wont be done with largescale incarceration We have to understand incarceration by looking at how people are being labeled as disposable and as dangerous and how those things are racialized Whether its marijuana possession or something else there will always be a convenient crime with which to charge Black and Brown people unless white supremacy itself is confronted We also have to think about ableism transmisogyny patriarchy economic injustice capitalism  really confronting the structures that make it possible for our society to lock millions of people in cages If we look at the drug war through this lens we understand thats its not some standalone entity its one tool deployed by a larger power structure that continually targets marginalized people in order to keep itself going JB Good point Does the fact that the penal dysfunction is part of a larger overarching dysfunction make it easier or harder to improve it And whats ableism I dont know that Im familiar with that term MS I think the fact that its part of an overarching structural problem means that it cant really been improved per se  it really has to be uprooted I wouldnt say that can happen extremely easily its more a goal to move toward while making incremental changes Ableism is the structural oppression against and devaluation of people with disabilities One of the ways it plays out in relation to prison is the extremely high level of incarceration of people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities Locked Down Locked Out Why Prison Doesnt Work and How We Can Do Better by Maya Schenwarimage by BerrettKoehler Publishers License DMCA JB Quite true I believe much of that shift occurred when President Reagan reallocated resources closing many state mental hospitals and dumping the patients onto the streets and the unprepared public And weve been paying the price one way or another ever since What havent we talked about yet MS Theres of course much more to talk about but we have to end things somewhere right One thing Id caution people against is assuming that the automatic alternative to incarceration for people convicted of drug offenses should be drug treatment First of all most people arrested for drug offenses arent dependent on drugs most people who use drugs are not dependent on them there are safe ways to use drugs and we have to challenge laws that stigmatize their use
