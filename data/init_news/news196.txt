New Jersey Gov Chris Christie is rapidly losing support among some of his most prominent homestate donors and power brokers who are either hesitant to back him or shifting allegiance to former Florida governor Jeb BushBushs aggressive moves to lock up the Republican Partys premier fundraisers threaten to undercut the Garden State governor before his expected campaign can get off the ground while raising questions about how robust of a network of support Christie will be able to musterBush has stopped short of directly confronting Christie by holding a fundraiser on his home turf But behind the scenes he has been quietly wooing via email a cadre of highprofile Christie backers including a group that attended a private dinner with Bush at New Yorks Union League Club in JanuaryIve known and admired Jeb for many years and Im obviously intrigued by his candidacy or I wouldnt have had dinner or communicated with him in recent weeks said New Jersey State Sen Joseph M Kyrillos Jr R who chaired Christies 2009 gubernatorial campaign and attended the New York dinner Time will tell how things evolveNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson a onetime Christie booster signaled his support for Bush on Wednesday when he showed up at a fundraiser in Chicago for Bushs political committeesFormer New Jersey governor Thomas H Kean Sr a longtime mentor of Christie who is no longer close to him said in an interview Thursday that he hasnt decided whom to back  while offering praise for BushWhen Bush said he has strong views on issues and wont change them to win an early primary it showed me he has real convictions Kean said The Republican Party in the past has had problems with people who changed their views in order to win a primary only to have to scramble back in a general election Voters dont find that kind of behavior credibleSeveral Bush donors in New Jersey are also in the initial stages of planning an event in the state in March or April according to several people with knowledge of the discussions Bush may not attend but his backers want to demonstrate his New Jersey supportSeveral top Christie backers said Thursday that he still has a strong organization of financial heavyweights both in New Jersey and across the country and they disputed the notion that he is being undercut by BushWere doing fine said Kenneth G Langone the billionaire cofounder of Home Depot who has pledged to devote substantial resources to advance Christies bid Everybody Ive called and asked has said yesChristie allies do not expect that he will be able to come close to matching Bushs current fundraising spree which is expected to bring in tens of millions His team has sought to project a sense of calm as it makes daily calls to donors arguing that much of the movement toward Bush is coming from loyalists who received appointments in the administrations of his father and brotherRay Washburne the Dallas real estate developer leading the national fundraising push for Christies political committee said there is plenty of room for both of themJeb has grabbed a good bit of the donor base no question he said But there is still a huge amount of the donor base available to getA Christie aide provided a list of two dozen New Jersey major contributors committed to Christies new political committee including investor Finn Wentworth trucking magnate Jerry Langer and Christies brother ToddNew Jersey real estate executive Jon Hanson who served as finance chairman for Christies gubernatorial campaigns said his instate donor network is stepping up and contributingI can see hes out there doing a good job Hanson said of Bush But I dont think thats going to hinder our ability to raise money for Governor Christies PACLast week Christie held a fundraiser at the Greenwich Conn home of former GOP gubernatorial candidate Thomas C Foley In the coming weeks he is planning to headline finance events in California and TexasSo far Christie has been raising money solely for his Leadership Matters for America PAC which can accept up to 5000 from individual donors An affiliated super PAC which can raise unlimited personal and corporate money is expected to be launched soonOnce it is Langone said he plans to put in significant amounts of money Absolutely he said Im waiting for it to startBut the investor also noted that he would be squarely behind Bush if Christies Florida rival emerges victorious out of the GOP primariesIf Jeb Bush is the Republican nominee I will do everything I can to help him get elected he said Jeb Bush is a good man My preference is Christie for one reason As I look at what this country desperately needs I think he comes closest to giving us everything we need and wantThe reticence Christie has encountered among prominent party financiers is a sharp contrast with the more than 100million that the Republican Governors Association brought in under his recent chairmanship While Christie aides have credited the fundraising haul to his efforts some RGA donors have privately said their giving was driven more by their interest in supporting various governors up for reelectionChristies difficulty in locking down homestate support comes after his remarks about child vaccinations on a recent trip to London drew a wave of scathing criticism and alarmed some of his supporters The governor had to make a series of calls to assure contributors that he supports vaccination for diseases such as measlesSpencer Zwick Mitt Romneys finance chairman in 2012 said the attitude of former Christie backers at home is tellingKyrillos is a very good bellwether for whats happening in New Jersey Zwick said of the state senator If Christie decides to run hes going to need the support from the people closest to him to sustain him until he can get national Republican supportZwick who has not committed to a 2016 candidate added Personally I have had my own reservations about what Governor Christie did at a key moment in the last presidential election and let it be known to him and others a reference to extensive public praise by Christie of President Obama for the federal response to Hurricane Sandy in the late stages of the campaign But I do not believe he had bad intentions and I have moved onAnother former Christie ally New Jersey attorney Lawrence E Bathgate II hosted the Jan 8 dinner in New York to introduce Bush to some of Christies top supportersBathgate had been in Christies camp for years but their relationship publicly soured after Christies administration pursued a plan to build protective dunes on the states coastline where Bathgate has an oceanfront homeIn an interview though Bathgate said his reservations about Christie began when he embraced Obama during his visit to the hurricanebattered state He also expressed concern about more recent events including the ongoing inquiry into the closing of traffic lanes leading to the George Washington BridgeI know he wanted to work with President Obama on Sandy but that doesnt mean you have to put your arm around him and hug him said Bathgate a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee That took the election and Mitt Romney off the front page Then you see him a couple years later flying around on Jerry Joness jet jumping up and down like he is a seventh grader Hes going to have to answer for all of that and for Bridgegate
