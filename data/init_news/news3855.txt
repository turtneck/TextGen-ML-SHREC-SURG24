One of the most vexing challenges of the Trump phenomenon is how the press should deal with it Theres never been anything quite like it and journalism is having to try to navigate this campaign as the rules are being rewritten on the fly Back in the beginning The Huffington Post had tried to keep the whole thing in perspective by relegating the campaign to their entertainment pages but eventually had to move it back to the politics section when it became clear that Republican voters were actually taking Trump seriously Today they cover him like a normal politician but append a standard disclaimer at the end of their articles about him pointing out that hes an extremist with noxious viewsTrump has brought the tabloids into the race already with his good friend David Pecker the publisher of the National Enquirer helpfully providing smears of his rival Ted Cruz during the primary Now Pecker has hired notorious Clinton hater Dick Morris as the Enquirers chief political correspondent so its likely Trump will be fed a steady diet of tabloid tidbits which he will undoubtedly share with his adoring fans So far the mainstream media has resisted the temptation to run with Clinton gossip stories mainly because theres so much coming over the transom about Trump But they are out thereand are likely to seep into the coverage as the Hillary smear industry gets up and running Theres nothing new in that but Trump is a master of tabloid media so we can probably expect this to play a different role than it has in the pastTV news organizations meanwhile have been notorious for allowing Trump to flout their rules They happily let him call in rather than appear on camera and give him hours of airtime in the hope that hell say something news worthy which to be honest he often does His lies and reversals are so constant and so blatant that reporters seem to be almost paralyzed as he slithers and slides out of their grasp He issui generisand nobody knows quite what to do about itMedia critics have been weighing in recently as the situation has become acuteNPRs On the Media correspondent Bob Garfieldhas been particularly vociferous lately imploring the media to recognize the threat that Donald Trump poses to America In this column he takes them to task for covering the Trump candidacy like a bemused recap of House of Cards He wroteThe rapacious CBS Chairman Les Moonves and the cablenewslike channels are delighted at the spectacle disaster is always great for ratings But this is not a show to be consumed and titillated by and parsed It is a conflagration of hatred and authoritarianism on its way to consuming us or at least that which makes us us Trumpism is raging out of control and the Fourth Estate responds how By going through the motions The usual false balance The usual staged cable bickering The usual dry contextual analysis The usual intermittent truthsquading to garnish our careless daily servings of uncontested hate speech incitement and manifest lies The usual reluctance to be part of the story  which in fact we are inextricably part of because we in large measure created it by giving oxygen to his every incendiary outrage and being our soundbitten compulsively enabling selvesthereflexive focus on the latest development the political ebb and flow and the architecture of the coming election simply buries the lede  that the man is monstrously unfit and unAmerican  and normalizes the grossly tragically abnormalAnd then he tells them what hereallythinks which is that they are falling into the trap of false equivalence between the parties fear of rightwing pressure and a reluctance to call a fascist a fascistMargaret Sullivan former NY Times ombudsman and current media columnist for The Washington Posthas similar concernsparticularly the notion that the media is pursuing a false equivalence rather than simple truthtellingThis perceived need to push for fairness for Trump  as if he has been mistreated or put at a disadvantage  baffles me Trump gets far more media attention than other candidates if only because he says such outrageous things commanding the daily news cycle over and over Wayne Barrett the investigative reporter who has been covering Trump for 40 years and whose reporting brought about Trumps first federal grand jury investigation told me in an interview The great failing is not in print media But the campaigns occur on the screen Many hardhitting stories from the New York Times The Washington Post the Daily Beast and elsewhere have received little followup on TV  not one minute of air time that Ive seen  but the slightest hint of a new angle on Hillary Clintons email practices can occupy most of a news cycle An exception was TVs attention last week to complaints about Trump University Jay Rosen the New York University professor and author of the PressThink blog is concerned about how this concept of fairness might play out Does it mean we cant take sides or does it mean lets treat unequal things equally The latter which he called distortion toward the middle ought to be prevented he saidThe NationsEric Alterman wrote about the print medias propensity for false equivalence as well focusing particularly on the New York Times From the earliest days of this campaign Times reporters have been transparently eager to blame both sides often regardless of circumstance Last November Times reporter Michael Barbaro devoted a lengthy article to the GOP candidates most brazen lies albeit one filled with euphemisms for the word lie Carly Fiorina refused to back down from a story about Planned Parenthood that was roundly disputed he wrote Ben Carson harshly turned the questions about inconsistencies in his life story back on the reporters who asked them Donald Trump utters plenty of refutable claims and set the tone for the embroidery by creating an entirely new category of overstatement in American politics But guess what The tendency to bend facts is bipartisan How do we know Well Gary Hart and Bill Clinton chose not to confess their infidelities to the nation during election cycles that took place a generation ago And apparently Hillary Clinton once mistakenly described herself as being the granddaughter of four immigrants when in fact her paternal grandmother was born shortly after her family arrived in the United Statesan error she quickly corrected Barbaro also found Clintons explanations about her personal and State Department email accounts to be unsatisfactory He wrote that she had used multiple devices like an iPad to read and send email even though shed said she preferred to read them all on a single device He failed to note that the iPad didnt even exist when Clinton set up her email account nor did he explain why expressing a preference counts as bending the truth Here is an example of false equivalence from just this week Nobody has done more to probe Donald Trumps noxious views than CNNs Jake Tapper His grilling of the candidate over his bigoted comments about the federal judge overseeing his Trump University lawsuit in California was as good as it gets and he received many kudos for his aggressive journalism He continued to report on Trump on his show Monday but also featuredthis harsh criticism of Hillary Clintonin which he lambasted the State Departments stated inability to release emails pertaining to her work on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal to reporter David Sirota until after the election He took on a very aggressive tone editorializing about the importance of releasing this important information when people are deciding whether to vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump However he notes that while Clinton was President Obamas Secretary of State she openly advocated for the deal in glowing terms even calling it the gold standard facts which have been known for years and have been well hashed out on the campaign trail and in the debates with Bernie Sanders Now she says she has changed her mind and is against the dealPolitifact called it a flipflop So what exactly do they think they will learn about her position that they dont already know Maybe she was more involved than she says she was which would be interesting but somewhat meaningless since we know she advocated strongly for it all over the world In the endyou either believe shes really changed her mind or you dont and these documents from years ago will not shed any new light on that And yet the implication was that Clinton was up to something nefarious with those damn emails again I dont mean to pick on Tapper Hes a great journalist one of the best on cable news The temptation to try to even things out with this sort of coverage has to be overwhelming when a personality like Trump dominates the coverage the way he does It must feel to a straight mainstream journalist as if theyre piling on him every day and it looks like theyre being partisan and unfair Certainly the right wing is accusing them of that nonstop  as they have been for more than 30 years But the result of this distortion toward the middle as Jay Rosen calls it has the perverse effect of normalizing Trump and pathologizing Clinton in a way that equalizes them to Trumps advantage There is no equivalence between them He is an unqualified unfit unhinged authoritarian demagogue and she is a mainstream Democratic party politician Lets hope the press listens to some of these critics and does a serious gut check whenever they are tempted to balance the coverage in this election by going easy on Trump and hard on Clinton Its dangerous
