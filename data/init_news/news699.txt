Bias bashers More Beer Less Vodka as Russians Mull Ongoing Crisis With the crisis continuing Russians are not only eating less they are also drinking less  particularly vodka and other hard drinks Against the background of an overall decline in alcohol consumption Russian preferences are shifting to beer and wine Originally appeared at Russia  India Report The volume of retail trade turnover in Russia continues to decrease In August it fell by 01 percent compared to the previous month compared to JanuaryAugust last year when it fell by 57 per cent said analysts from the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration RANEPA They were citing data from the state statistical agency Rosstat and a survey conducted by the Institute for Social Analysis and Forecasting The turnover is decreasing because Russians are not only eating less and cutting back on spending on services but they are also drinking fewer alcoholic beverages Sales of vodka dropped catastrophically From January to August 2016 vodka liqueurs and brandies accounted for 42 percent of sales volume Beer amounted to 4445 percent of total sales of alcohol Another 1213 percent was wine production Other beverages cider mead etc made up less than 1 percent of alcohol products bought by people according to RANEPAs monitoring data The range of sales is clearly seasonal Retailers usually sell more wine champagne and vodka in December while sales of beer increase by 1520 percent in midsummer compared to the beginning of the year Retail sales of alcohol have significantly decreased over the past two years 106 percent fewer alcoholic beverages were sold between January and August this year than during the same eight months of 2014 the survey report stated Retail sales of alcoholic beverages bottomed out in January and April 2016 Sales of vodka have dropped catastrophically Alexandra Burdyak a senior researcher at RANEPA and one of the authors of the study said The drop was 134 percent against the same period of last year The main decline occurred last year when sales of vodka decreased by 126 percent compared to 2014 However the wine production sector showed a different trend The traditional New Year increase in sales of wine and champagne dragged on with wine sales remaining at 2015 levels until May 2016 Burdyak said consumers first finished their earlier stored wine and then as stocks in cabinets dried out and lovers of wine and sparkling wines made sure that nothing was happening in the economy the ruble was not strengthening and the prices of imported alcohol were not decreasing they began to buy this type of alcohol again The new generation of consumers According to Burdyak the decrease in consumption of vodka and other alcoholic beverages has been steady since 2013 Strong alcohol consumption peaked in 2007 and it has been in decline since then The taste of Russians born in 1985 and later has been shaped by western primarily European influences they prefer wine beer and other light alcoholic beverages However Vadim Drobiz director of the Centre for Federal and Regional Alcohol Market Studies TSIFRRA believes it is a little too early to talk about a reduction in alcohol consumption in Russia Because of the crisis the main consumers of alcoholic drinks could have switched to cheaper options this is possible he said But few people are capable of seriously saving on alcohol Drinking away the crisis Vodka consumption fell from 53 percent of retail sales measured in terms of absolute alcohol content in 20072009 to 39 percent in 2015 During the same period the share of beer increased from 3132 percent to 43 percent of total sales of alcoholic beverages The total volume of retail sales is calculated in terms of absolute alcohol content as follows Half a litre of vodka 40 percent alcohol is equal to 200 grams of ethanol one litre of beer 4 percent is equivalent to 40 grams and one litre of wine 12 percent contains 120 grams of ethanol These trends appear likely to continue over the next few years though some analysts have reservations It should be borne in mind that consumers and the Russians certainly in my experience consider strong alcohol to be an antidepressant Drobiz said And that means that consumption of vodka and other spirits in the context of the ongoing economic crisis is not likely to fall
