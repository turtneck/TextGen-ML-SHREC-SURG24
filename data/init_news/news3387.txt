by Karl Denninger One final set of thoughts before you go out to vote today Theres one major issue that got very little play during the campaign as the media was hellbent on focusing on Trump and bad words If we all burn that is on them  and you But I assure you the press will fry up just like you will at 5000 degrees That issue is Syria Hillary Clinton has committed herself to imposing a no fly zone over Syria As I have pointed out on multiple occasions in this column there are two problems with that commitment First the Russians are in there at Syrias invitation Theyre protecting Syrias government at its request exactly as we protected Kuwait at its request  They are therefore acting with the permission of the sovereign government of Syria and we will not be We will effectively be invading Syria Second Russia has missile systems deployed in Syria that we cannot reliably kill and our aircraft and other flying equipment cannot reliably survive being fired upon by them either While we can certainly find some of their batteries through intelligence and similar and blow them up doing so would be a clear act of war If we do not do so then anything Russia does not want flying in the skies over Syria will not be flying It will instead be in many pieces and any airmen inside said aircraft will be dead Will Russia allow us to dictate that there will be a nofly zone and allow us to enforce it I doubt it If we attempt to implement one anyway then conflict is inevitable This is a conflict that has not happened thus far in the nuclear age between superpowers Oh sure theres been a plane forced down here and one shot down there along with plenty of harassment along with various proxy wars where this party or that was supplying arms to one side or the other eg Afghanistan but an actual faceoff and exchange between US and Russian forces has never occurred Once it happens if it does then someone will of course believe they won and someone will believe they lost The question will then be whether the side who believes it lost will admit to that and withdraw If that side does not do so then we are facing nuclear war  a war that inherently involves the destruction of both nations infrastructure and large percentages of their respective populations Hillary Clinton has said she intends to walk this path We do not know whether Trump will he hasnt committed himself one way or the other But his statements thus far tend to lead me and many others to believe he wont try to interfere in Syrias or anyone elses sovereign affairs In fact hes made clear that he believes that we have had far too many foreign entanglements and they have not served us well Theres no guarantee that a President Trump would not find some reason to intervene of course and thus no guarantee that we dont ultimately wind up in the same place Lets face it  Syria is a mess and one that Hillary Clinton had a large hand in creating But the choice here is between someone who might get pressed into a situation that leads to armed conflict possibly nuclear conflict and someone who has a vested interest in continuing what she started who has declared her intent to take an action that by definition will violate Syrias sovereignty and with nearcertainty will lead to an exchange of weapons between the Syrian protectors which are Russian and the United States That road has a high probability of being one way and at the end are events you will not like Dont vote to die  and kill your children If you vote for Hillary you are in fact voting for nuclear war
