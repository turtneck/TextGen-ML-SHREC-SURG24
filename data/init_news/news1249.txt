As a new poll shows 28 of early Republican Florida voters casting their vote for Clinton Donald Trump is getting desperate The Republican nominee begged Clinton voters to change their vote in 6 states where its not too late to do so Trump wrote Wednesday morning So now that you can see Hillary was a big mistake change your vote to MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN You can change your vote in six states So now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump November 2 2016 Tuesday evening Trump made the case that due to the FBIs announcement about Clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse  A lot of things have happened over the last few days This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake While its true that people in some states can change their votes its not true that this rule was changed because of Hillary Clintons emails and yes thats a new Right wing thing apparently Trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of Clinton but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about Clinton because of the nonsurprise October surprise the Republican FBI Director delivered  which was perceived to have benefited the Trump ticket Days ago Snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the FBIs bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to Clinton Claim After FBI Director Jim Comey announced that he was reviewing emails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes mixture WHATS TRUE Some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day WHATS FALSE No states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes And to make this even better that false information was based on a Fox News report that wasnt selling the false story about Clinton but still got some of the information wrong This is why the Right cant have nice things The Left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular because epistemic closure leads to losing Trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping exhaustive list of lawsuits bragging about sexual assault dissing minorities and a Gold Star family and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to Russia Only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a Clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet While this race is far from over if all Americans get off their butts and go vote Donald Trump faces an uphill battle to the White House
