The 2016 presidential election is shaping up as an unpopularity contest of unprecedented proportionsAssuming as now appears most likely that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination and that either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz becomes the Republican nominee the generalelection ballot is set to feature a choice between two candidates more negatively viewed than any majorparty nominee in the history of pollingTrump is by far the furthest underwater The latest Wall Street JournalNBC poll puts his net favorability rating at minus41 A breathtaking 65 percent of registered voters see him negatively versus 24 percent with a positive view making him the most unpopular major party presidential candidate ever recorded Cruz is at minus23 with 49percent viewing him negatively 26 percent in a positive lightTo underscore the challenge facing the GOP neither candidate has been viewed more positively than negatively by voters since the start of the campaignClinton by contrast has a healthier and more volatile history with voters Polls showed her favorables slightly ahead of her negatives when she formally launched her campaign last April But her trajectory is unnerving The new WSJNBC numbers have Clinton minus24 with 56 percent viewing her unfavorably and 32 percent favorably almost double the gap just one month earlierThis is unprecedented said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman It will be the first time in the history of polling that well have both major party candidates disliked by a majority of the American people going into the electionPause to let that sink in to compare this dyspeptic situation with previous elections  and consider the implications for governingSome historical perspective All three candidates are more unpopular than the losing presidential candidate at any point during the past five election cycles according to Gallup dataIf the nominees are Trump and Clinton said Republican pollster David Winston Youre probably looking somewhere in the neighborhood of three out of 10 Americans having a negative view of both You could have a very frustrated electorate by the time we get to Election DayIt sounds oxymoronic but voters could elect a president that a majority of them view unfavorably Assuming Clinton has the advantage over Trump said Democratic pollster Peter Hart she is going to be elected if she wins in minus territory which is something weve never had beforeVoters assessments of candidates between April and Election Day tend to stay stable the notable exceptions were Bill Clinton in 1992 who moved from minus11 to plus7 in the WSJNBC poll and Barack Obama in 2008 who rose from plus7 to plus21 Hillary Clinton given the rollercoaster nature of her ratings may have the capacity to rise againStill the unpopularity of the leading candidates reflects both their unique characteristics as polarizing personalities and the broader political sorting of the American electorate As voters assemble themselves into reliably and increasingly intense red and blue blocs their assessments of the opposing side hardenWhich raises questions about the potentially grim aftermathElecting either Clinton or Trump with these type of unfavorable numbers immediately means a weakened president without the power to persuade from the day she or he is sworn into office said Republican pollster Bill McInturffHistory teaches that a new presidents approval rating rises between Election Day and the inauguration Americans become more charitably disposed to their new leader once the campaign has concluded if only brieflyGiven these bargain basement favorability numbers will the 45th president enjoy that luxury Does presidential popularity even matter in an era of congressional gridlockSome political scientists think not citing a shift in the locus of presidential authority away from legislating Presidential power is no longer the power to persuade said Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg Popularity at one time was a major factor in a presidents ability to govern but we are in the era of the institutional president where presidents rely on their administrative powers and the powers of the office and less on public opinionIf Clinton is elected said Middlebury College political scientist Matthew Dickinson the fact that she may be one of the most unfavorably viewed presidents is not going to make a huge difference because shes likely going to be running into a House controlled by Republicans and the Senates going to be close either way Thats what really eats into your ability to govern rather than your favorability ratingsPerhaps But the unfolding unpopularity contest cannot be a healthy sign for our democracy nor a good omen for the presidency to comeRead more from Ruth Marcuss archive follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook
