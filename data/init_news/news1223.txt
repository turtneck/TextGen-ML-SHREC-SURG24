Weve looked at the arguments for the presidential candidacies of Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and Sen Marco Rubio RFla Turning to former Texas governorRick Perry one might conclude he is the most underestimated candidate Pundits who rank candidates tend to put him in the bottom tier of contenders Like generals however pundits tend to fight the last campaign and in the case of Perry that means affixing a dunce cap to his head and writing him off He certainly has a tiny margin for error but I tend to think voters care less about past mistakes and more about what they see before them So what does Perry have to show them1People do like a comeback story His rotten performance ushered in a new Perry more humble and studious2He is a grown up In a field of freshman senators a couple media figures Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee and a rising but less experienced star from the ranks of governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin Perry unarguably has the advantage of 14 years as governor a background including the border crisis and other situations demanding crisis management and the experience of having run for president once before In a New Hampshire round table he reiterated the argument Americans are going to want someone who has been tested someone whos got results in their background and were not going to choose another young untested United States senator I dont think that is where Americans are going to want to go Again he stressed Rhetoric is fine Nobody loves a barn burning speech any more than I do but if you dont have the record to back that upif youre not roadtestedthen I think there is always a concern3He is the only candidate with military experience Oddly he rarely mentioned this in the 2012 race He is not making that mistake this time around I think its important to understand that and having that very real life experience of knowing what these conflicts do in terms of treasure and bloodhe said in New Hampshire Somehow we thought we could stop the Islamic State with some simple bombing missions but that was just not the case and now were left with some really less than desirable opportunities to stop ISISIts going to require our personnel to be engaged on the ground and I would suggest having experience having a track record of dealing with issues and having experienced people who you trust who also have track records dealing with issues is an asset4He has battled the federal governmentTo the extent voters are angry with Washington politicians and federal meddling they have a champion in Perry He battled the feds on everything from Obamacare to Environmental Protection Agency regulations In his recent clash with the president he castigated the president for not securing the border and then took it upon himself to deploy the states national guard troops Hes remained an advocate of state control and stateled reform on education and health care5Hes an excellent retail politician with lots of free time That is a powerful combination in early primary states where voters expect to be engaged directly and repeatedly6Hes feisty but not obnoxious Republican voters are itching for a fight and Perry is pugnacious enough to give it to them Hes been in the trenches fighting the administration and will not be shy about taking on Hillary Clinton7There is an opening in the field Mitt Romney did not run New Jersey Gov Chris Christie is the victim of selfinflicted wounds So if you want an experienced conservative governor who is not a Bush Thats Perrys spot His biggest problem may be Walker whom Perry will need to show is less prepared on foreign policy and less accomplished than he is Its a tall order but with everyone gunning for Walker Perry may be the beneficiary8 He can handle the mediaHe is forceful enough and generally knowledgeable enough to push back on a tough interviewer and as we saw on alate night appearance relaxed enough and sufficientlyplugged intopopular culture to come across well in informal settings Hed be smart to use nonnews media to reset his image9Hes a law and order figure In defending the border and Second Amendment rights and championingprison reformhe has struck an appropriate balance between individual rights and public safety No one will accuse him of being antipolice or on the other hand ofdefending government excess10Hes led a rags to a notverymanyriches life No one will say he started out life withprivilege or wealth He does not have Ivy League degrees nor does he live an ostentatious life style hecurrently livesin a1400square foot 2 bedroom 2 bath condo full of boxes four dogs
