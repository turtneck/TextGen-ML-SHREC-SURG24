he called 911 but was put on hold and so hung up He said he toldone police officer about the beating but was told SJPD didnt have the manpower to interveneMorons he said How do you not staff 911 for an event of this sizeDiPaola wasnt the only journalist to condemn the cops handling of the protestMany of the protesters were peaceful Some waved Mexican flags in an apparent response to Trump calling Mexican immigrants rapistsAccording to the San Jose Mercury News many of the protesters were Latinos from East San Jose opposed to what they saw as racism from the GOP candidateWere here to support Latinos black people were not rapists Cindy Zurita a 23yearold student told the Mercury News as she held a sign readingMr Hate leave my stateABC reporter Tom Llamas however saidthat some of the protesters were throwing up gang signsThere were peoplewho came to demonstrate  some who just wanted to brawl hetweeted calling it the most violent demonstrations weve seenAt times protesters began to fight among themselves In one instance two female protesters pleaded for nonviolence while trying to protect a Trump supporter from an angry crowd Despite their efforts someone snatched the Trump supporters hatA handful ofthe bright red Make America Great Again hats were set on fire by protesters who then snapped photos of the scene or hung the charred hats from street signsSome protesters said they were disappointedto see violenceundermine their messageIts sad to see San Jose representing like this student Martha Garcia told the Guardian Trump is the one igniting the hate You cant fight fire with firePerhaps the most jarring scene was that of a young female Trump supporter being attacked by a crowd of protestersIn multiple videos of the incident the woman initially appeared to be happily posing in her Trump football jerseyin front of the mostly male protesters some of whom can be heard whistling and shouting at herThen an anonymous arm rises over the crowd and tosses anegg at the woman striking her in the headand eliciting howls and laughter from the crowdA second later a red water balloon bursts against the womans armAt first the woman triesto shrug off the attackssmiling while appearing to reach out toward the Mexican flags that some protesters are wavingObjects keep crashing into the convention center windows behind her however and protesters can be heard screaming expletives at herSuddenly another projectile strikes her hard in the face Eventually someone comes to help her and after she indicates that she is having trouble seeing she is ushered back inside the convention centerTheugly scenesof violence toward Trump supporters Thursday appeared to be the inverse of similar incidents earlier in the campaign in whichTrump protesters not supporters were targetedThe sucker punch captured byDiPaola for instance echoed an incident in March when a 78yearold Trump supporter suckerpunched a protester at a rally inFayetteville NCTrump protester suckerpunched by supporter in brutal video of Tucson rallyHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanderss campaigns both condemned the violence in San Jose John Podesta chairman of Hillary Clinton for America tweeted that violence against supporters of any candidate has no place in this electionMike Casca Sanderss rapid response director tweeted that we cannot stop Trumps violent rhetoric with violence  only peaceful protest in a voting booth can do thatBlame for the attackscirculated almost as rapidly as images of the violence with Trump supporters accusing Democrats and members of the media of having a double standardMany liberals meanwhile including the Democratic mayor of San Jose suggested that Trumps angry and divisive rhetoric made him at least partly responsible for the violence at his eventsAt some point Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign Mayor Sam Liccardo told the Associated Press praising the citys policewhile adding thatwere all still holding our breath to see the outcome of this dangerous and explosive situationThings inside the rally weremore subdued  if only slightlyPoliticoreported that one of its journalists was removed from the rally for reporting at the event without the campaigns permissionTrumpmeanwhile was interrupteda handful of times by protestersResponding to Clintons blistering attack

Bloomberg This is not a president Four more years of this stuff and were not going to have a country left
