On April 28 the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Obergefell v Hodges named for Ohio resident Jim Obergefell who wants to be listed as the surviving spouse on his husbands death certificate Obergefell married his partner of 20 years John Arthur aboard a medical jet in 2013 while Arthur was suffering from ALS Arthur passed away in October of that year three months after the couple filed their lawsuitThe decision to file suit  I know from Johns perspective  it was a way for him to say Thank you Jim Youve given me 20 years The past couple of years have been pretty awful with ALS and this is something I can do to thank you to protect you and to just let you know once again how much I love you And I can think of no better reason to be going to the Supreme Court than to remember that and honor that Obergefell said recently during a moving speech at the Human Rights Campaigns headquartersObergefell is joined by several dozen other gay plaintiffs from a number of states who are fighting both to be able to marry the person they love and to have their marriage recognized in every state in the countryFor Greg Bourke and Michael DeLeon it began at Fauver Law Office a small firm that operates out of a house in Louisville Kentucky In July 2013 the couple filed a lawsuit with the US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky to have their marriage recognized by the Commonwealth of Kentucky Bourke and DeLeon wed in Canada in 2004 but have not been able to receive the same benefits that heterosexual married couples get in their stateShannon Fauver and Dawn Elliott the two attorneys who originally handled Bourke and DeLeons case said it was tough to find plaintiffs who were ready to face all the publicity that comes with such a prominent role They said many were concerned about how the proceedings would affect their children and family membersI thought it would be a whole lot easier to find people who were willing to be involved in the litigation said Elliott But we had to sell it to the plaintiffs in order for them to be involved in thisAs the cases became increasingly highprofile more groups signed on to help win the right to marriage equality In Kentucky for example the plaintiffs are now being represented not only by Fauver but also by the Louisville firm of Clay Daniel Walton and Adams PLC the American Civil Liberties Union and the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation ClinicThe stories of these families and others all across America are the reason public opinion is changing so rapidly on marriage said James Esseks director of the ACLUs Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and HIV Project These are just regular parents who want the best for their kids Marriage will help both them and their childrenMichigans contribution to the Obergefell suit revolves around just one couple April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse Their 2012 lawsuit originally made no mention of gay marriage and was instead aimed at changing state law so they could both be recognized as legal parents to their four adopted children The couple only switched course after a federal judge invited them to expand their challenge to target the state constitutions ban on samesex marriageDana Nessel an attorney for the couple said the judges recommendation was just one of a series of surprises For a small legal team with little funding she said the last three years have been tough though ultimately rewardingThe Michigan case is unique both in the way it originated and because it was sent to a full trial according to Jay Kaplan staff attorney for the LGBT project at the Michigan chapter of the ACLU He said that holding a trial gave Rowse and DeBoers attorneys the opportunity to present expert testimony and crossexamine the defendants witnessesThis is the right time for marriage equality  politically socially legally said Laura Landenwich an attorney with Clay Daniel Walton and Adams PLC during a recent interview at the firms office Everything is in place for them to rule in our favor And I will make the prediction that if we lose that opinion will get reversed later on It will be viewed at some point as a mistake
