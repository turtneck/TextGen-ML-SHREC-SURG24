administer the death penalty by lethal injection But the court is also expected to weigh in on the drawing of lines for congressional elections the right to put the Confederate flag on license plates and the right of a municipality to regulate outdoor signageDecision days are scheduled for each Monday this month along with Thursday June 18  and there could be yet another day announced as well The court has not gone beyond June in more than 20 yearsIt is typical for the court to issue its most important and controversial rulings in the final days of its annual session Many expect the samesexmarriage and Obamacare decisions to come later in the month But many court observers are expecting the lethal injection decision sooner along with more than a dozen cases that carry considerable significance of their ownThe court meets at 10 am ET Monday and on the other decision days of the month NPR will be covering the proceedings and reporting on the decisions as soon as they become available on our regular radio programs on NPRorg NPR One and other platformsLethal Injection Glossip v GrossAs traditional methods such as hanging firing squad and electrocution have fallen from favor states with the death penalty have been injecting a protocol or series of drugs to execute death row prisoners But pharmaceutical companies now refuse to provide sodium thiopental the drug used at the beginning of the series to make the prisoner lose consciousnessStates have looked for substitutes including midazolam which is a sedative and not an anesthetic Inmates who have brought this case say that those who receive this drug may remain conscious after dosage when they receive subsequent drugs Some members of the court were clearly sympathetic to this viewpoint in the oral argument earlier this year But some of the courts conservatives seemed to regard it as a backdoor means to undermine the death penalty itselfIf the court sides with the inmates states will have to scramble to find alternative means of execution which may include a return to the more traditional methodsObamacare King v BurwellPlaintiffs have argued that only those states that have set up their own exchanges for the purchase of health care insurance are entitled to give subsidies to lowerincome people States that let the federal government set up their exchanges for them they contend may not accept the federal tax credits that subsidize those eligible in staterun exchanges The administration argues that the intent of the legislators was clear whatever the exact wording of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and that all exchanges are eligible for the subsidiesIf the court rules for the plaintiffs subsidies could go away for more than 6 million current recipients although the timetable for their losing insurance is somewhat uncertain Congress would be under pressure to actTaking this many people out of the system would also affect the private health insurance market and the amount that people pay in insurance premiums The degree of impact would depend on how sweeping the justices ruling is But it could affect individuals small business large business the insurance industry doctors and hospitalsSameSex Marriage Obergefell v Hodges and related casesA series of recent rulings by the high court has led to the legalization of samesex marriage in three dozen states which are home to more than 70 percent of the US population This has happened despite many states efforts to enact bans on such marriages either by legislation or by referendumThese laws and state constitutional amendments have been consistently struck down by federal courts at the district and appellate levels  except for the Federal Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit This one court sitting in Cincinnati upheld the ban enacted in that state and several others and said states did not have to recognize marriages performed legally in other states This circuit split between appeals judges brought the case before the US Supreme Court earlier this yearThe court now has the opportunity to clarify the legal situation by legalizing samesex marriage in all 50 states or to adopt any of several more complicated resolutions  leaving some states with legal samesex marriage but others  perhaps most  without The court is also deciding a related case regarding the right of a state to refuse to recognize a samesex marriage that took place legally in another stateArizona State Legislature v Arizona Independent Redistricting CommissionAre state laws that put redistricting in the
