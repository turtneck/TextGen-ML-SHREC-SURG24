Spin and overstatement have long been a part of political rhetoric But this year is pushing factcheckers into overdrive And thats not all badProfessional factcheckers might be excused for being a tad exhausted this campaign seasonTracking the public statements of 22 majorparty candidates during the primaries was one thing But a general election pitting Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton  two candidates with abysmal scores for honestyamong voters is another sending the factchecking world into overdriveIs Mr Trump really worth 10 billion as he claims Not according to Forbes magazineIs it true that Mrs Clinton slept during the Benghazi terror attack in 2012 as Trump says No according to Clinton testimony Was Clinton allowed to use a personal email server when she was secretary of State as she has asserted No according to a recent report by the State Departments Office of the inspector generalTrump alone is enough to keep the entire factchecking industry afloat When the flamboyant billionaire gave a big speech recently denouncing Clinton the Associated Press assigned 12 reporters just to check the veracity of his assertions  a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could have been doing other things moaned Washington Post media critic Erik WempleIts easy to get discouraged by all the charges of lying hurled around  Lyin Ted LyingCrookedHillary both a verbal Trump charge and the name of a Trump campaign site handouts from the Clinton campaign that lay out Trumps lies hypocrisy and catastrophic ideas And certainly to some voters the whole tone of the campaign is so depressing the answer is just to tune out and stay home on Election DayBut to veteran factcheckers its the time to shine Angie Drobnic Holan editor in chief of the Pulitzer Prizewinning site PolitiFactcom says shes really optimistic citing the growth of media factcheckingYou can have a cynical take on that but mine is more optimistic because factchecking is especially needed this year she says Donald Trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy and Im heartened that theres widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be factcheckedTrump supporters not surprisingly disagree Jeffrey Lord a regular on CNN defending Trump calls media factcheckers elitist and says the candidates themselves do a better job of countering each others assumptionsThis selfpolicing concept sounds a bit like having a basketball game with no referees And besides its just not going to happen Media factchecking is here to stay So are politicians who say things that arent true and accuse each other of lying But theres a spectrum of political speech There are outandout lies  deliberately false statements meant to deceive  then there are statements that are unintentionally false exaggerations and spin Sorting through the differences can be impossible as it requires knowing whats inside the speakers headAnd what about a candidate who makes big promises knowing they cant be fulfilled Thats another form of political speech that is lessthantruthful but which voters have come to expect  and often excuseIn a recent focus group veteran pollster Peter Hart asked 12 Republicans if they thought a President Trump would ever actually build a wall across the Mexican border Eight people voted no Same with his promise to deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the US And yet most of the 12 were fine that these promises would likely go unfulfilledThey dont hear a pledge they hear Im going to do something  says Kathleen Hall Jamieson director of the University of Pennsylvanias Annenberg Public Policy Center which sponsored the focus groupBut making pieinthesky promises is one thing Statements of fact that prove false are another and thats where factcheckers are having a field day PolitiFact has judged 174 statements by Trump so far and found only 16 to be either true or mostly trueSeventy have been judged false and another 34 rated Pants on Fire referring to claims that are not only inaccurate but also ridiculous according to Ms HolanWith Clinton PolitiFact has judged 218 statements and rated 112 true or mostly true 24 false and three Pants on FireThe next question is whether the assessments of PolitiFact and other factcheckers actually penetrate public consciousnessOur traffic is better than its ever been says Holan whose site is affiliated with the Tampa Bay Times Media organizations are doing factchecking in part because its very popular with readersProfessor Jamieson whose Annenberg center launched the first political factchecking website FactCheckorg in 2003 is less sanguineFactchecking has never been more important more complicated and less likely to reach its target audience with the desired corrected information Jamieson saysPart of the problem is the everaccelerating news cycle In order to get a correction through you have to get people to stand still long enough to hear it she saysAnother issue particularly for factchecking operations attached to news sites is low public opinion of the media Only 6 percent of Americans have a great deal of confidence in the press according to a survey released in April by the Media Insight ProjectHolan of PolitiFact says that when readers accuse her site of partisan bias against Trump she counters with data that show Republicans who do well on the PolitiFact TruthoMeter such as Jeb BushOf course former Governor Bush didnt do very well as a presidential candidate voters dont necessarily favor a candidate because he or she is more factual Moreover for a slice of the electorate this cycle reflects a break from politics as usual  and that includes an embrace of candidates who speak to voters without the filter of polls focus groups and scripted statements
