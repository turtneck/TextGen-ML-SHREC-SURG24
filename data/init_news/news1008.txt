We still do not know who or what is responsible for the crash of EgyptAir Flight 804 but we know this much for certain The terrorist danger is growing and it wont be contained to the MediterraneanResponding to criticism of President Obamas handling of terrorism White House press secretary Josh Earnest boasted Thursday of all the setbacks the Islamic State has experienced in recent months noting that in Iraq 45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them In Syria that figure is now 20 percentThats like a patient who ignored a cancer diagnosis bragging that he finally reduced the tumor in his lung  glossing over the fact that he let it spread and metastasize to his other organs If he had attacked the Islamic State cancer early Obama could have stopped it from spreading in the first place But instead he dismissed the terrorist group as the JV team that was engaged in various local power struggles and disputes and did not have the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and did not pose a direct threat to us He did nothing while the cancer grew in Syria and then spread in IraqNow the cancer has spread and metastasized across the worldAccording to a recent CNN analysis since declaring its caliphate in 2014 the Islamic State has carried out 90 attacks in 21 countries outside of Iraq and Syria that have killed 1390 people and injured more than 2000 others The Islamic State has a presence in more than a dozen countries and has declared provinces in Algeria Libya Egypt Nigeria Saudi Arabia Yemen Pakistan and Afghanistan The Post reported in 2015 that since the withdrawal of most US and international troops in December the Islamic State has steadily made inroads in Afghanistan where it has poured pepper into the wounds of their enemies  seared their hands in vats of boiling oil  blindfolded tortured and blown apart villagers with explosives buried underneath themAnd while the Islamic State spreads and grows alQaeda is making a comeback Obama is touting the killing of Taliban leader Akhtar Mohammad Mansour as an important milestone but the truth is that the Taliban has made major military gains in Afghanistan  and that has opened the door to alQaeda The Post reported in October that American airstrikes targeted what was probably the largest alQaeda training camp found in the 14year Afghan war Sounds good except for one small problem There were no major alQaeda camps in Afghanistan when Obama took office Now it is once again training terrorists in the land where it trained operatives for the attacks of Sept 11 2001AlQaeda has also regained lost ground in Yemen the country where it trained and deployed the underwear bomber who nearly blew up a plane bound for Detroit in 2009 And as a recent report from the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institutes Critical Threats Project notes the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra poses one of the most significant longterm threats of any Salafijihadi group and is much more dangerous to the US than the ISIS model in the long runOverall Gen Jack Keane recently testified that alQaeda has grown fourfold in the last five yearsWere lying to ourselves if we think that the violence we are witnessing is going to be confined to the Middle East  or South Asia  or North Africa  or Europe It is only a matter of time before the Islamic State and alQaeda bring this violence here to our shoresIndeed in many ways we face a situation far more dangerous and complex than we did before Sept 11 2001 Before 911 we largely faced a danger from one terrorist network alQaeda with safe haven in one nation Afghanistan Today we face danger from multiple terrorist networks with safe havens in a dozen or more countriesMoreover we face something we have never seen before two terrorist networks  the Islamic State and alQaeda  competing with each other for the hearts of the jihadi faithful and the backing of jihadi financiers The way to win that competition is to be the first to carry out a catastrophic attack here in the United StatesWhen it came to terrorist networks the George W Bush administration had a mantra Were going to fight them over there so that we do not have to face them here at home Obama abandoned that mantra And now the danger is getting closer to home with each passing dayRead more from Marc Thiessens archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
