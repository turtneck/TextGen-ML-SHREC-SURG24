Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy is bent on refusing to consider any nominee President Obama may submit to succeed late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia And if he doesnt give ground Obama may have only one option for an endrun a recess appointmentBut Republicans can rest easy GOP leaders have an ace up their sleeveThe truth is it doesnt take much to prevent a recess appointment as long as congressional leaders are watching the calendar CloselyIf youre trying to block the president from making one to the Supreme Court all the Senate has to do is commence a session every three days Because the Senate is only truly in recess after that threeday periodThe Constitution actually requires the House and Senate to meet every three days unless theres an agreement between the two bodies to skip and go on recess With the battle over a Supreme Court pick heating up dont expect that to happen in the near futureAll McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan RWis have to do is schedule what are called proforma sessions at threeday intervals for the rest of the year Proforma sessions are brief meetings of the House and Senate lasting but a minute or two  and sometimes a matter of seconds They help the House and Senate comport with the constitutional mandate of huddling every three days  even if they arent really doing anythingThe House and Senate dont conduct any business during these confabs In congressional parlance theyre sometimes referred to as just gavelin gavelout No votes No speeches Few words are uttered at allThe phrase proforma is derived from Latin meaning formalityCongress doesnt consider itself adjourned or on recess if its meeting every three days And thats all it takes to block a recess appointment for the rest of the presidents termIn 2011 and 2012 Democrats still controlled the Senate But Republicans ran the show in the House The GOPcontrolled House refused to agree to an adjournment resolution in an effort to block Obama from scuttling a Senate filibuster of his nominees to the National Labor Relations Board NLRB and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB Thus the House and Senate met every three daysIn early 2012 the president made four recess appointments in the window between the threeday proforma sessions But the Supreme Court later voided those appointments The court said that was thepointof the threeday sessions The Senate was indeedinsession The Supreme Court ruled 90 against the administrations brazen attempt to slip in appointments between the sessions every three daysIronically Scalia Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion to the NLRB case They argued that recess appointments will remain a powerful weapon in the Presidents arsenal They added it was unfortunate because the recess power is an anachronismWhen the roles were reversed Democrats used the same toolFor much of the final two years of President George W Bushs term the Democratcontrolled Senate met every few days to block him from making a recess appointmentIn 2003 Senate Republicans blasted minority Democrats for holding up a number of judicial nominations Democrats had particular trouble with the nomination of Judge Bill Pryor to the 11thCircuit Court of Appeals in Georgia Democrats didnt like Pryors views on womens issues and homosexuality So they filibustered PryorDuring a summertime adjournment not amid the threeday proforma theater discussed here Bush went around the Senate and appointed Pryor without its advice and consentDemocrats may try to force Republicans to take that vote this summer too But Republicans know that the best way to prevent a recess appointment later this year is to just meet every three daysCapitol Attitude is a weekly column written by members of the Fox News Capitol Hill team Their articles take you inside the halls of Congress and cover the spectrum of policy issues being introduced debated and voted on there
