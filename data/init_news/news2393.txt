Rand Paul is not like other potential presidential candidatesThe Kentucky senator who announced his candidacy for the White House on Tuesday morning doesnt fit neatly into the molds of either partySocially liberal on issues of crime and punishment  especially when it comes to drug sentencing  against a federal ban on samesex marriage and no foreign policy hawk hes not your prototypical RepublicanAs a fiscal conservative and an opponent of abortion rights though hes certainly no Democrat eitherIts time for a new way a new set of ideas and a new leader Paul says in a Web video with a heavy metal soundtrack previewing his presidential campaignPaul fits more with libertarians And though he is the scion of the last carrier of the torch of liberty hes also not quite his fathers libertarianPauls father the former Rep Ron ran for president three times before retiring The elder Paul 79 was always regarded as something of a gadfly an outspoken fresh voice in the Republican primary with a passionate following of young libertariansThough Paul did not win a single state in 2008 or 2012 when measured by Election Day voting percentage he routinely finished in the top three In fact he finished a solid second behind Romney in the critical early state of New HampshireBut his band of young engaged and determined Paulites proved one thing  they could organize Ron Paul not only won straw poll after straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference and elsewhere he also won the most delegates in several states including Iowa Though Paul finished third in vote total in the Hawkeye State his campaign engineered what amounted to a takeover of the state Republican Party apparatusHe has a number of assets said Stu Rothenberg founder of the Rothenberg Political Report He has terrific fundraising potential He has an army of supporters who will run into a burning building to vote for himRand Paul has tried to use those supporters to help build on his fathers foundation reaching out to minority voters with an emphasis on criminal justice reform and to young audiences  like one in New Hampshire last year  with an appeal based on privacy and civil libertiesHow many people here have a cellphone Paul asked How many people think its none of the governments damn business what you do on your cell phoneIf I had to fill a large lecture room at my campus I would bet a lot that Rand Paul could fill that room with young libertarianminded conservatives said Dante Scala a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire Of that I have little doubtThough Rand Paul can fill a room with young libertarians in similar ways that his father could he isnt a carbon copy of his dad Paul has adjusted some of his policies to fit the mainstream of the GOP a bit betterPaul has emphasized where he agrees with evangelical Christians on gay marriage telling a group of pastors last month that the First Amendment says to keep government out of religion not religion out of government And in moves that show he understands the GOP has returned to its hawkish roots since the rise of the selfdeclared Islamic State militant group he has changed his tune on defense spending proposing 190 billion more for the Pentagon And the second day of his presidential rollout finds him in South Carolina  in front of the aircraft carrier the USS YorktownThose moves toward the mainstream of the party may lose Paul some diehard libertarians but says David Boaz of the Cato Institute most libertarians are thrilledI think Rand Paul is the most libertarian major presidential candidate that I can remember seeing said Boaz whos new book is called The Libertarian Mind so it tells you that there is a constituency that wants this more libertarian approachBoaz sees Pauls adjustments as necessary and practicalRand Paul is trying to find a balance that reflects his own views and appeals to a plurality and eventually the majority of the party Boaz said To the extent that there is that constituency  skeptical of foreign intervention skeptical of the surveillance state  he has that market in the Republican Party all to himself Is it a big enough market Well thats what hes about to find outPauls antiestablishmentarian campaign slogan for 2016 will be Defeat the Washington Machine Unleash the American DreamThat little slant rhyme invokes the memory of Paul crusading against the security state on the floor of the US Senate in an oldfashioned 13hour filibuster two years ago But if the goal for Rand Paul in 2016 is to emerge as the antiestablishment alternative to say Jeb Bush Paul has to become more than just the libertarian candidate Scala saidHe has to find a way to be more appealing to the mainstream of New Hampshire Republicans while keeping his appeal to his core vote which I would describe right now as people who voted for his dad three years ago Scala said Thats the trick for Rand PaulPaul just as his father did with online money bombs will likely be able to raise enough money to stick around for quite some time in the GOP primary Analysts like Rothenberg are skeptical he will be able to pull off the improbable and become the Republican nominee but Rothenberg wonders if Paul is laying the groundwork for a sea change within the partyHe may be starting a process that down the road will change the Republican Party will start to bring in some new kind of faces into the Republican Party Rothenberg said And I wouldnt be surprised if in six or 10 years this is a more libertarian party
