On the one hand I find it weird that George Stephanopoulosdonated 75000 to the Clinton Foundation He should have known how it would lookOn the other hand look is really the operative word there Its not as if Stephanopouloss ties to the Clintons were some kind of closely guarded secretStephanopoulos worked on Bill Clintons 1992 campaign for president He was communications director in Clintons White House The sudden realization that Stephanopoulos might be in his heart of hearts sympathetic toward the Clintons is a bit oddIts easier to see whats going on here when you realize Stephanopoulos wasnt the only media figure to donate to the Clinton Foundation Dylan Byers reports that the hyperconservative Newsmax gave more than a million dollars So did James Murdoch  yes hes one of those Murdochs  and the News Corporation Foundation the Murdoch familys philanthropy threw in at least another 500000But no one much cares about those donations because no one really thinks Newsmax or Fox News are going to end up biased toward the Clintons They care about Stephanopouloss donation because they think Stephanopoulos isalready biased toward the Clintons and this just proves itBut the attacks on Stephanopoulos are getting the possible scandal almost exactly backward Stephanopoulos Murdoch Newsmax and all the other Clinton donors werent donating to the Clinton Foundation because theyre biased toward the Clintons they were donating to the Clinton Foundation because they want the Clintons to be biased toward themAfter all if youre a powerful media figure trying to help out the Clintons on the sly the last thing you want to do is publicly donate 75000 to them so everyone thinks youre in their pocket But if youre a powerful media figure  or a giant corporation  who wants to keep good relations with the Clintons maybe you do want to make that donation Bill Clinton after all was watching those donations carefully and he was grateful to the people and institutions that stepped up to support a project he cared aboutIts hard to remember now but Clinton managed for a moment to depoliticize his foundation pretty effectively At the time Stephanopoulos made his contribution supporting Clintons charity was almost as bipartisan as supportingSimpsonBowles This was a moment whenMitt Romney andDonald Trump were also supporting the Clinton Foundation after all But that speaks to the deeper corruption of the Clinton Foundation which became to all appearances a way for pretty much anyone to buy some goodwill with the ClintonsLook at the other names on Byerss list of media or mediarelated companies that donated to the Clinton Foundation Carlos Slim Thomson Reuters Bloomberg LP Time Warner AOL HBO Twitter Google These titans and institutions werent donating to Clinton Foundation just because they liked the Clintons  they were donating to the Clinton Foundation because they wanted the Clintons to like themWhich is all to say that while it was a mistake for Stephanopoulos to donate to the Clinton Foundation it didnt change much hes either biased toward the Clintons in a way that affects his coverage or he isnt and that would have been true with or without his contribution The more worrying question is whether the Clintons are biased toward the people and companies who give millions of dollars to their foundation
