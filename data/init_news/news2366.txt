Wednesday 1020 pm ET Tuesday is unknownSome residents in the area told CNN they saw Abaaoud recently in the neighborhood and at a local mosqueInvestigators zeroed in on the building after picking up phone conversations indicating that a relative of Abaaoud might be there They met fierce resistance from the start including an armored door a woman who blew herself up and bullets flying back and forth for about an hour The French officers even used powerful munitions which led to one floor of the building collapsingThat violence produced rubble that included body parts on which investigators are conducting DNA testsFrench President Francois Hollande held up the vicious backandforth as further proof that we are at war with ISISWhat the terrorists were targeting was what France represents This is what was attacked on the night of November 13 he said These barbarians targeted Frances diversity It was the youth of France who were targeted simply because they represent lifeFrance had already been part of the USled coalition fighting ISIS with airstrikes But the country has stepped up its efforts since the series of shootings and explosions in Paris last week which killed 129 peopleNow Hollande has proposed extending Frances state of emergency for three more months  a measure that among other things gives authorities greater powers in conducting searches holding people and dissolving certain groups To go after the Islamist extremist group the French President also said he would appeal to world leaders  including meeting next week with US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin who have been at odds on what to do in SyriaThere is no more  divide There are only men and women of duty he said We must destroy this army that menaces the entire
