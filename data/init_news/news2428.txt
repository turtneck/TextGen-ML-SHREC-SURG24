Theres a sense of growing optimism among Democrats that if Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket they might have a chance at what otherwise seems impossible curtailing the GOPs stranglehold on the US House of RepresentativesThe fundamental landscape is deeply unfavorable to House Democrats Theyre down 30 seats and behind in fundraising with district boundaries drawn in such a way that winning a national majority of votes wont deliver them a majority of seats They need fundamentally something gamechanging and weird to happen And then like magic along comes Donald Trump who happens to be weak in exactly the sort of Republicanleaning suburban districts they are hoping to peel away from the GOPTrump makes districts that would have been hardcore tossup districts into ones that lean Democratic and gives Democrats a little bit of a push in Republicanleaning districts across the country according to Kelly Ward the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign CommitteeIn a practical sense the DCCCs preTrump vision was heavily focused on the longterm planning of what they call The Majority Project a multicycle effort to simultaneously improve the DCCCs field and data infrastructure while understanding which districts are being made newly competitive by ongoing demographic changeData shows us that Democrats are moving into Republican districts and making them more Democratic over time as we look between now and 2020 DCCC chair Rep Ben Ray Lujn DNM told me just before Trumps Super Tuesday sweep Postsweep Ward says the Trump takeover accelerates this for usFor a sense of exactly how lost and forlorn House Democrats were before Trump breathed new life into their hopes its useful to look beyond the DCCC to the behavior of Maryland Rep Chris Van Hollen Himself a former DCCC chair he was widely regarded as a likely successor to Nancy Pelosi as the Democrats leader in the House since the top two Dems behind her in the party hierarchy Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn are both quite old themselvesBut rather than hold on to a safe House seat and hope to sweep into the speakership he chose to resign his seat in order to fight a tough contested primary for the Democratic nomination for an open Senate seat in Maryland  a clear indication that he saw no shortterm path to significant gains in the HouseAnd hes not alone House Democrats face two serious headwinds in their quest for a majority that they are essentially powerless to cureThe first is that the map is simply very unfavorable to them Back in 2012 Barack Obama won considerably more votes than Mitt Romney but Romney actually carried more House districts This is because Democrats through a mix of partisan gerrymandering and natural geography are more likely to be packed into lopsided districts To win the House they need a landslide not just a winThe second is that House landslides when they happen almost always hurt the incumbent presidents partyThe basic dilemma for a House minority whose party controls the presidency is that either people are generally happy with the status quo in which case the president is likely to be popular but voters are unlikely to vote out tons of House incumbents or else people are unhappy with the status quo in which case the voters are likely to punish both the president and his copartisans in the HouseDemocrats only real hope for 2016 is for something offthecharts weird to happen in presidential politics Something like say a vulgar real estate developer turned reality television host with scant record of involvement in the conservative movement erupting onto the scene with an underdeveloped policy agenda and a trackrecord of offensive statements and inflammatory rhetoricIt is of course possible that if Trump secured the Republican nomination he will prove himself to be an exceptionally skilled candidate who mops the floor with Hillary Clinton in ways we can barely imagine today It is also possible that unpredictable events  terrorist attacks foreign wars financial crises  will impinge on the election in ways that badly damage Clintons hope In either of those cases House Democrats will be dragged down tooBut based on what we know of Trump so far he seems likely to be a weak general election nominee who is weak specifically in areas that House Democrats see as growth possibilitiesDemocrats top targets are a series of suburban districts where Republican incumbents have retired somewhat fatigued with the incessant intercaucus warfare among House Republicans These kind of districts  places like PA8 MN2 NV3 NY19  are places whose Republican voters are disproportionately welleducated and supporting nonTrump candidates Those are the voters most likely to be persuaded to swing to Clinton or just stay home as a reaction to GOP disunity in the face of TrumpismMeanwhile one crucial element of Democrats larger focus has been on identifying areas where the Latino population is growing rapidly in ways that are likely to make them more competitive over the medium termBut a big challenge Democrats traditionally face is that Hispanics punch below their weight in terms of actual voter turnout Ward believes that turnout momentum that we could see among Hispanic voters because of Donald Trump could accelerate that competition In general she notes that Democrats win when turnout is high and the medias fascination with Trump is creating heightened electoral awareness in a way that should boost DemocratsSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has according to press reports already privately told colleagues that his caucus will drop Trump like a hot rock if his presence at the top of the ticket seems to be hurting Senate candidates in New Hampshire Florida Wisconsin and elsewhereDropping your partys presidential candidate is a tough trick to pull off for a Senate candidate and its not clear that its at all possible in a House raceMost people after all simply dont pay that much attention to their local member of Congress Meanwhile national media is overwhelmingly focused on the presidential race Ward argues plausibly that the celebrity presence of Trump in the race should only exacerbate that tendency for presidential politics to crowd out everything elseDonald Trump will define this election as we have seen from day one Ward says he will dominate the attention and he will create the narrative of the election
