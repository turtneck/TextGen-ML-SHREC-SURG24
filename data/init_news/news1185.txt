Imagine this Donald Trump wooing delegates with rides on his goldaccoutered private jet A wealthy Ted Cruz supporter wining and dining them at the Cleveland convention Welcome bags stocked with expensive swag awaiting party activists in their hotel rooms courtesy of a wellfunded super PACThe already freewheeling Republican presidential contest is fast turning into a personal persuasion game as the candidates pursue noholdsbarred efforts to lock up delegates  and there are relatively few limits on how far they can goThe jockeying has already led to accusations of unfair play Trump has accused Cruz of luring delegates with unspecified goodies and crooked shenanigans charges that the Cruz campaign dismissed as falsehoodsUnder regulations established in the 1980s delegates cannot take money from corporations labor unions federal contractors or foreign nationals But an individual donor is permitted to give a delegate unlimited sums to support his or her efforts to get selected to go to the convention including money to defray the costs of travel and lodgingA candidates campaign committee can also pay for delegate expenses Some legal experts believe a campaign could even cover an allexpensespaid weekend prior to the convention to meet with senior staff at say a Trumpowned luxury golf resort in FloridaGiven that the last contested Republican convention was 40 years ago  Gerald Ford vs Ronald Reagan in 1976  many ofWashingtons top campaign finance experts are furiously paging through old Federal Election Commission opinions trying to discern what delegates can acceptWere in uncharted territory said Kenneth Gross a former associate general counsel at the FEC And when you get into the heat of battle and the stakes are as high as they possibly can be in terms of who will be the nominee people are going to push the envelopeTrump and Cruz who have shown their relentlessness in this seasons roughandtumble campaign are expected to look for every legal edge possible if neither is able to secure 1237 delegates before the July convention Also in the mix is Ohio Gov John Kasich who forged an alliance with Trump on Saturday in a delegate fight in MichiganThe candidates will be in a bidding war for delegates said Brett Kappel a veteran campaign finance lawyer who has represented Democrats and Republicans Theyll live like kings at the conventionTrump team vows to win delegate majority as rivals prepare for open conventionThe FEC delegate rules were established long before super PACs came on the scene and offer little guidance about how such groups can lobby delegates One possibility floated by strategists in recent days a superPACfinanced war room that collects reams of personal data  political background hobbies family details  that can be used to target the nearly 200 activists and elected officials who are not bound to a specific candidateThe lack of clear guardrails has left party activists feeling unsettledIts almost like we need a campaign finance system for delegates said Gregory Carlson 27 who ran unsuccessfully to be a delegate in Colorado over the weekend This is why we need to put serious thought into this and who are immune to being paid off with belowboard messagesSince most delegates are expected to cover their own travel and stay in Cleveland they could be offered thousands of dollars in assistance Just how far those payments can go has not been testedIf they decide to go to Cleveland via Cabo that might be a problem said Anthony Herman a former FEC general counselBut its unclear that such a perk would be made public if it were provided by a single donor Under FEC rules a contribution from an individual to a delegate does not have to be disclosed as long as it was not made in coordination with a campaign or as an independent effort to boost a candidate That means gifts could flow to delegates unseenBeyond subsistence expenses in the weeks ahead are there cash and items of value given to these delegates asked Michael Toner a Republican electionlaw attorney Is someone going to show up in the Cayman Islands in January with a threeweek paid trip Thats not going to be readily apparent before the electionStill Toner added I think the vast majority of the deals are going to be political deals People want attention a seat at the tableTrump still leads but Cruz keeps winning the trickier delegate contestsThat was the case in 1976 when Ford leveraged the prestige and trappings of the presidency to try to bring uncommitted delegates over to his side He invited entire state delegations to lunch and dinner at the White House and even hosted a group on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal to watch the July 4 bicentennial celebration in New York Harbor according to Jules Witcovers 1977 book MarathonReagan tried to match him with his Hollywood connections recruiting entertainers such as John Wayne Jimmy Stewart and Pat Boone to call wavering delegatesIt was handtohand combat said Reagan biographer Craig Shirley who detailed the fight in his book Reagans Revolution The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All When it comes to getting delegates it is the wild wild West Anything goesWell not absolutely anything State and federal antibribery laws would probably forbid delegates to sell their votes outright although it is unclear how those statutes apply to those who are private citizens rather than elected officials Electionlaw attorneys noted that the Justice Department has recently stepped up its focus on campaign finance violations and could scrutinize suspicious transactionsAnd most experts doubt there will be systematic efforts to try to win over delegates with cashI think its a pretty dangerous game to play Herman said The optics are just so bad Putting aside FEC exposure or even criminal exposure I think the political exposure if it were disclosed and the public knew about it  it would just seem so unseemlyThe campaigns declined to offer specifics on how they plan to woo delegatesWell theres the law and then theres ethics and then theres getting votes Trump convention manager Paul Manafort said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press Im not going to get into what tactics are used I happen to think the best way were going to get delegates is to have Donald Trump be exposed to delegates let the delegates hear what he saysCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the senator from Texas has been building an organization that will allow us to secure the delegates we need to win should this race be determined at conventionSomebody used the Colorado GOP Twitter account to tweet NeverTrumpSeveral delegates interviewed this week said they would not be swayed by inducements They were exasperated by the suggestion that their support could be bought with money or giftsWendy Day  a 43yearold mother of four in Michigan who was elected to be a delegate for Cruz  said her delegation is looking for ways to keep their convention expenses down perhaps by renting homes outside the city so they will not have to depend on a benefactor to cover their expensesWe wouldnt want to feel like we were being bought off she said adding I dont think Cruz supporters would be swayed by gifts and money We are in this to save our countryJoy Hoffman chairwoman of the Republican Party in Arapahoe County Colo said she would view any kind of monetary gift or offer to pay for expenses as a bribeThe candidates can call me and talk to me said Hoffman who will be an unpledged alternate delegate to the convention But she warned that she will not be easily dazzledI already know these people Hoffman said Theyve been bugging me for months I had breakfast with Kasich not long ago and Ive had conversations with the Trumps At the end of the day thats nice They put their pants on the same way they eat the same kind of food we eatOKeefe reported from Colorado Springs David Weigel in Rochester NY and Katie Zezima in Irvine Calif
