at 252 pm 2 Comments For a long time now Ive felt that no matter who wins this election the US is in for extremely difficult times over at least the next 4 years The reason is twofold First when you combine Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters the latter didnt just disappear a majority of the population is in full on revolt against the status quo This mood isnt going anywhere Combine this backdrop with the very high likelihood of an economic downturn and you have a recipe for mayhem This isnt even taking into account the possible end to a multidecade secular bull market in sovereign bonds the ramifications of which represent a financial extinctionlevel event for much of the Western world When I look at the financial markets and note that they appear totally unwilling to even flirt with the very real possibility of a Trump victory I conclude that the current status quo assumption is not only that Hillary will win but that after she wins the social mood will get better I on the other hand think it will get far far worse as disgusted Trump and Sanders supporters push back relentlessly from day one As I noted earlier today on Twitter Sorry but if Clinton wins country becomes completely ungovernable I dont mean gridlock I mean total madness  Michael Krieger LibertyBlitz November 1 2016 Of course Im not the only one Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote an excellent piece earlier today published at The Week titled The Clinton Presidency is Going to be a Miserable Slog  which is my must read of the day Here it is Being on the cusp of electing the first woman president and defeating a snarling newly crass and nationalist Republican Party should feel energizing for the American left But its been tiring The Democrats arent just electing a woman Theyre stuck electing this woman Hillary Clinton Its been a slog  Clinton could not easily put away her socialist challenger Bernie Sanders She would not release the transcripts of the paid speeches she gave to Wall Street banks She could not name her accomplishments as secretary of state She could not quite escape her own role in managing the political fallout from her husbands affairs or the appearance of corruption in the Clinton Foundations pioneering work in the field of dogooder graft When FBI Director James Comey gave us a healthy reminder of Clintons email scandal last week liberals must have realized Its not just the campaign The Clinton presidency is going to be a slog  too The Clinton standard of political behavior has always had a lawyerly slipperiness to it When the scandals come it depends on your definition of is When the headlines erupt suddenly we discover that all of Clintons friends signed an affidavit contradicting the latest accuser or whistleblower And really what difference at this point does it make Partisans will note that Clintons ethical lapses and faults are minor compared to Donald Trumps Those comparisons are not going to matter in a few days Some may object Theyll reply that the only problem is the aggressive prosecutorial zeal of the Republicans And it is true that Republicans have an ongoing grudge against Clinton But lets posit the existence of a vast right wing conspiracy that hates President Obama just as much as it hates the Clintons Why is it only able to turn up newsdriving scandals on the latter Could it be that Obama however detested by conservatives conducts himself with higher ethical standards than Bill and Hillary Clintons scandals and misdeeds often have little to do with the Democrats battle with Republicans Clinton played fast and loose even with the Obama administrations own rules Obama had forbidden Clinton from giving a government job to the Clintons ondemand schemer Sidney Blumenthal  yet Clinton kept him on the payroll of her charity and kept up correspondence with him about Libya even as he had business interests in a postGadhafi state Despite explicit rules set by the Obama administration the Clinton Foundation continued to operate as a bank in which foreign leaders and governments could deposit their quids while Clinton was at the head of the State Department able to distribute pro quos in return Beyond the propensity to generate scandal there is a larger reason that Clintons administration will be a slog The 2016 election has been characterized by a demand for great change And Hillary Clinton has run as the defender of the way things are the way theyre going and who theyre going for Hillary Clinton received a vigorous challenge from a left wing that isnt afraid to label themselves socialists Americas centerright party ditched its commitments to establishment doctrine on free trade and liberalized immigration and challenged the wisdom and justice of Americas postCold War political order But Hillary Clinton will enter the White House as the caretaker for the status quo in American political life Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders were not the men to carry forward this message of discontent to real political triumph Both candidates represented their cause poorly Trump was at once too crude and unethical himself And Sanders had none of the political instincts and savvy to really go after Clinton in the primaries Clinton is the face of a prosperous grasping establishment that wont bear challenge from the left or right Her ability to survive scandal after scandal will not be received as some testament to her political canniness or some deep integrity It will be received as just the system defending its own from attack Her survival and her ability to win is a a tribute to the power and selfregard of our political class And this class has no plausible solution for the nations foreign policy for its immigration system or for an economic system that abets the elites secession from their own nation Clintons presidency will be a slog because she is exactly like the system she defends She can point to the great wealth this system produces for its top clients But neither she nor her cheerleaders can really claim that it looks like wisdom or justice to anyone else Well done Mr Dougherty
