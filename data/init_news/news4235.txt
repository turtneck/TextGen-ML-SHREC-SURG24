In his 2015State of the Union address President Obama spoke about important labor issues like unequal wages for women and a lack of paid sick and maternity leave He called on Congress to pass legislation raising the minimum wage and requiring employers to guarantee at least seven days of sick time a year to their employees He had to do this because remarkably nearly40 percentof the American workers have no sick time at all nor is there any requirement for their employers to provide any  a regressive distinction the United States shares with only two other countriesPapua New Guinea and OmanHopefully these important issues will be brought to light as the 2016 presidential race heats up especially with Bernie Sanders running The antifamily nature of US labor law should make it a logical target for any valuesoriented crusader but predictablyRepublican politicians oppose reform While hiding behind a defense of small businesses the Republican agenda is really a handout to mega corporationsWalmart for instance has been exposed for its discrimination against pregnant women forcing them onto unpaid leave or firing them outright if they become unable to perform certain duties In April 2014 activists and employees forcedthe company to modify its policy allowingfor a reasonable accommodation to be made for women with a temporary disability caused by pregnancy This weak and ambiguous concession leaveswomen with healthy pregnancies in the lurch even though they still may require modified job dutiesCongress could intervene and establish better protections for pregnant women but it doesnt The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Actthe last such act passed on the federal level is so feeble thataWalmart spokesperson in 2014could truthfully say Were proud of our new policy It is best in class and goes well beyond federal and most state laws That reveals at least as much about federal and state laws as it does Walmart The Waltons areamong the wealthiest peopleon the globe yet their business wont guarantee American workers the fundamental dignity of having a child without fear of repercussion And so it goes with workers rights across sectors of the economyIn any moral society this would be considered a crime And in more advanced societies Walmart is forced to grant their workers more rightslike unionization Here were dominated by politicians who argue the only crime would be if the state got involved at allRepublicans scoff at emulation of the European model which affordsgenerous holiday sick andpaternal leave to workers  by pointing toEuropes own unemployment epidemicand the fact thatthe Americaneconomy is recovering with almost all of its capitalist dogmas intact Of course whats often left unsaid is thatour rebound is being enjoyed overwhelmingly by only the wealthiest few What value is a roaring economy to ordinary Americans who are overworked overstressed unable to spend time with their families and not even reaping the financial benefits for their hardshipEven office and whitecollar workers while generally receiving far greater benefits than lowwage retail and fast food workers are woefully deprived when it comes to making room for their personal lives Their hours are less rigidly documented and they are usually salaried meaning theyare more likely to becalled on forunpaid overtime They spend virtually their entire day in plywood boxes a mentally stultifying way to invest ones time As more and more Americans live the sedentary professional lifestyle thedisastrous health consequencesof sitting around all day are becoming apparentTheres also a compelling argument articulated brilliantly ina 2013 essayby author and activist David Graeber that many whitecollar and service sectorjobs have no justifiable reason to exist Says Graeber Its as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all workingProfessionals spend their days bounding from meeting to meeting and forwarding spreadsheets from one department to another Customer service does little more thanobfuscate informationandbear the brunt ofconsumer rage All this goes on with virtually no time off or flexibility despite the economic and personally refreshing benefits ofpeople controlling their own schedules Working Americans passively accept that this is just life but total conformity to the demands of a meaningless day job exacts a toll on their psyche and wastes the time and energy of skilled people who could otherwise be doing important work These are not minor quibbles to be brushed aside with folksy idioms likeNobody likes their job and Thats whythey call itwork this is a crippling cultural sickness America is often heralded as a great experiment but policy planners are at best unimaginative and at worst fiercely hostile when it comes to social experimentation Nowhere is this more finely exemplified than in our work culture You can make close to 100000 in your first yearworking on Wall Street but cap out around that much after a lifetime insocial work Say what you will about capitalism  its not a system that rewards work based on its social value Our fixation on profit drives Americans into the bullshit jobs sector of the economy leaving important work like fixing ourcrumbling infrastructureundone A society that was truly full of big bold ideas would not allow a fear of resembling socialism to prevent it from more meaningful planning Lots of Americans cant find work at all Many of those who can work put in too many hours for too little reward While our jobserode our home livesand personal health politicians defend abstract ideals of capitalism over the needs of real human beings Pointless evendestructivework pays a great deal more than work that benefits society To praise this as thegreatest modelin the world is about as delusional as anything the North Koreans believe But there is a way to beat it The super wealthy have engineered a system that works wonders for them andthey arent going to let it go without a fight If we ever want to have a system that works for the people the people are going to have to build it American workers and consumers muststrike protest stand up for their rights as human beings and strengthen their local communitiesWe need toradicalize our economy decide as a society the kind of work we really value and reward it accordingly And we could all spend a lot more time creating loving sharing and relaxing
