NEW YORK  Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee a likely contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination and a leading voice for Christian conservatives said Thursday that governors and state legislatures should consider ways to resist a Supreme Court decision that recognized samesex marriage as a constitutional rightOn USA TODAYs Capital Download Huckabee likened such a possible decision on an issue now being weighed by the high court to the notorious Dred Scott case before the Civil War that ruled African Americans couldnt be citizens Pushing back against such an opinion is not without historical and judicial precedence he said in an interview promoting his new book God Guns Grits and Gravy published Wednesday by St Martins PressIf he were still governor he said I think I would put it before the legislature I mean we would ask We have a constitutional amendment in our constitution Do we want to hold to that Do we want to put it before a referendum of the people I mean there are a lot of different angles to pursue it Or you could just surrender and say OK we just agree that the court is right Whatever the legal basis for Huckabees stance  and constitutional scholars question whether there is one  as a political matter his fervent opposition all but guarantees that the issue of gay marriage will be prominent in the GOP presidential debate While other leading contenders also oppose gay marriage some of them including New Jersey Gov Chris Christie have said court decisions recognizing the right make it a settled questionRather than just immediately capitulate to nine people in robes and what it will probably be is five people in robes against four people who disagree  then you have a very very divided court he told the weekly newsmaker series Do we really surrender the entire American system of government to five people unelected appointed for life with no consequences for the decisions they make The founders never intended for there to be such incredible almost unlimited power put in the hands of so few peopleHowever Erwin Chemerinsky dean of the University of California Law School Irvine said states would have no options if the Supreme Court decided that laws prohibiting samesex marriage violated the ConstitutionThere have been efforts by states to circumvent or ignore Supreme Court decisions most notably the intense Southern resistance to Brown v Board of Education and desegregation Chemerinsky said The Supreme Court made it clear that its ruling was the law of the land This will be no differentThe issue has been joined he noted Already marriage equality exists in 36 states mostly because of court decisions and there has not been the type of resistance Huckabee suggestsStill it is a sign of Huckabees appeal to the evangelical Christians who are among the GOPs most loyal voters that his new book immediately shot to No 1 in sales among political books on Amazon and into the top 100 among books of all sorts In his folksy conversational style he unfavorably contrasts New York Los Angeles and Washington DC  places he dubs Bubbleville  with those from the heartland which he dubs BubbavilleAt one point in the book he discussed how goooood it is to eat game Im sorry if that sounds cruel to any vegan readers he added And are there any Raise your hands if you have the strengthIn the interview Huckabee also Acknowledged he was likely to make his second bid for the White House He also ran in 2008 If everything continues to work well and I sense that there is say the proper financial and political support then I think its a given that thats where the destination is Predicted former president Bill Clinton would be an asset to his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton if she runs for the Democratic nomination I mean he had a good presidency Im a Republican but I admire good governing Dismissed as overblown a furor over comments in his new book criticizing Beyonce and JayZ for using sexually explicit lyrics and the president and first lady for allowing their daughters to listen to them I do think theyre good parents he said of the Obamas adding he has some of Beyonces songs on his iPhone Shes an incredibly gifted singer and dancer She doesnt need to get into the vulgar in order to be successful and influentialHe also denied charges of hypocrisy leveled this week by Jon Stewart in a combative interview on The Daily Show because he had played bass backing up rocker Ted Nugent as he sang Cat Scratch Fever a song with sexually suggestive lyrics of its own Discussed reports that the FBI had decided not to pursue civilrights charges in the police shooting in Ferguson Mo saying the Justice Department would have proceeded if it could have found any standing to do so It was obvious that Attorney General Eric Holder wanted to be able to bring charges he said It was almost evident from the beginning that he was hoping that they would be able to find some way to indict or bring some charges against officer Darren WilsonNow he said I hope that civil rights activist and MSNBC anchor Al Sharpton will have a rally and apologize for having incited so many people to actions that were hurtful to the people of Ferguson hurtful to many minority business owners whose businesses were burned and looted because passions were inflamed
