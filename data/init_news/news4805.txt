House Republicans unveiling their first budget blueprint since the party took control of Congress issued a sweeping spending plan Tuesday that calls for complete repeal of ObamaCare major changes to Medicare and controversial moves to boost defense spending despite tight budget limitsGOP leaders say their budget would balance in less than 10 years and in that time cut spending by 55 trillion compared with current projectionsThe spending plan stands little chance of ever being signed by President Obama but makes clear that the party is not dialing back its ambitions despite a rocky start to the latest congressional sessionAfter some internal debate over the Republican strategy for taking on the Affordable Care Act the budget plan renews GOP calls to repeal and replace the lawThe document would repeal ObamaCare in its entirety and calls for starting over with a patientcentered approach to health care reform The document does not get into deep specifics on what this might entail  one factor is a pending Supreme Court case over the laws subsidies that could force Congress and the Obama administration to reconsider the policy if the administration losesHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Prices 38 trillion plan borrows heavily from prior GOP budgets including a plan that would transform Medicare into a voucherlike premium support program for seniors joining Medicare in 2024 or later They would receive a subsidy to purchase health insurance on the private marketMeanwhile Republicans are proposing using tens of billions of dollars in additional war funding to get around tight budget limits on the PentagonThe use of overseas military funds to skirt spending caps is a new feature War spending is exempt from budget limits and the move would allow Republicans to effectively match Obamas proposal to boost defense spending by 38 billion above current limits That was a key demand of the partys defense hawksBut Senate Republicans GOP aides say are likely to reject the move to radically reshape Medicare and are more reluctant to use war funds to help out the PentagonPrice has also signaled hell replicate Rep Paul Ryans approach to cutting Medicaid and food stamps by transforming them from federal programs into wholly staterun programs that receive lump sum funding from the government That approach makes it easier to cut these programs without saying how many people would be dropped or how their benefits would be cutThe nonbinding budget measure while setting broad goals for spending and taxes still requires followup legislation to implement Republicans have never tried to implement its most controversial cuts and are unlikely to do so as long as Obama is presidentTo meet their promise to balance the budget within a decade Republicans would have to cut at least 5 trillion from a federal budget thats on track to total 50 trillion over that period Senate Republicans will unveil their plan nextThe twin GOP budget plans will arrive as top lawmakers such as Speaker John Boehner ROhio are negotiating a 200 billion or so agreement that would permanently fix a flawed funding formula for Medicare physician payments  adding perhaps 140 billion to the deficit over 10 years  while at the same time the budget resolution will claim that the higher reimbursement rates for doctors will be paid for with cuts elsewhere in MedicareThe Medicare docs fix illustrates a truism in Washington Its easy to vote for spending cuts when theyre only hypothetical but excruciatingly hard when theyre binding and spark opposition from powerful interest groups like health care providersThe Associated Press contributed to this report
