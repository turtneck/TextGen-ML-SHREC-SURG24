Hillary Clinton moved to capitalize Tuesday on a sharpedged debate performance that exposed vulnerabilities for Donald Trump excoriating his values and character in an effort to expand her coalition of women minorities and young votersTrump meanwhile scrambled to move his campaign forward While the Republican nominee insisted that he was not unnerved he and his advisers grasped at excuses to explain why he did not perform better at the first presidential debate Monday nightTrump on Tuesday was unrepentant and eager to defend his past denigrating a former beauty pageant winner whom he targeted as his latest foil and vowing to attack Clinton over her husbands marital infidelities in their next showdownIn a country divided over two historically unpopular candidates Trumps turn is unlikely to shake his core support But Democrats said they felt assured that Trumps hot temperament scattered demeanor and series of statements that left him exposed to further scrutiny would make it increasingly difficult for him to win over the undecided voters he has been courting especially moderate white womenI look back as a former practitioner and say Is there anything Donald Trump did to convince somebody who wasnt in his column to be for him said David Plouffe President Obamas former campaign manager I have a hard time thinking theres many of those people I dont think he lost anybody But thats not his challenge now Hes got to addClinton was ebullient as she returned to the campaign trail Tuesday in Raleigh NC and strove to keep alive the controversies that marred Trumps debate performanceThe real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important hardest job in the world and I think people saw last night some very clear differences between us Clinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane en route to North CarolinaTrump did little to change the subject In a Tuesday morning interview on Fox News Channel he said debate moderator Lester Holt the anchor of NBC Nightly News was biased and the Republican complained about the quality of his microphone Clinton jabbed him for that telling reporters Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good nightTrumps attacks on her weight are a bad dream for former Miss UniverseTrump also disparaged a former Miss Universe pageant winner Alicia Machado for her physique In the debate Clinton raised Trumps past comments about the Venezuelaborn woman who was crowned Miss Universe at age 19 in 1996He called this woman Miss Piggy and then he called her Miss Housekeeping because she is Latina Clinton said in one of the debates more electric exchangesThe next morning Trump offered an indignant defense of how he dealt with Machado when he was a partner in the company that owned the Miss Universe contestShe was the worst we ever had he said on Fox adding She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problemThe Clinton campaign sought to advance the story across media platforms releasing a Web video featuring the beauty queenturnedactor now a US citizen who lives in California and arranging a conference call for reporters with Machado who described the election as like a bad dreamLike Trumps feud this summer with the Muslim parents of a dead US soldier the Machado episode rapidly emerged as a microcosm of the campaign  and a test of whether Trump can expand his support beyond his base of aggrieved white voters most of them menMike Murphy a veteran Republican strategist who has been critical of the partys nominee said Trumps comments about Machado were hugely tone deaf The debate overall he said was for many Republicans an Oh crap moment If you thought he had a spring in his step for the last few weeks and was getting back in the hunt thats pretty much goneFew of Trumps supporters went so far as to crown him the victor House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis who has been a weather vane for the Republican leadership during this election season was supportive though muted at a Tuesday news conference He told reporters that Trump gave a unique Donald Trump response to the status quoI think he gave a spirited argument Ryan said and I think he passed a number of thresholdsTrumps backers insisted that the debate would not damage his standing in the close race with Clinton Rep Peter T King RNY said As far as the temperament thats how hes been for the last 15 months It got him to the top  He does have the feistiness that I think 51 percent of the American people will likeWilliam J Bennett who served in President Ronald Reagans Cabinet said of Trump When he loses his temper a little bit many people see that as passion and as someone whos engaged in the fight and in what he believes People forgive that  and a leopard cant change his spotsWhy even Republicans think Clinton won the first debateIt will take several days before the political impact of Mondays debate becomes clear but many Republicans said they were bracing for Clinton to get a bump in the polls An estimated 84 million people watched the clash at Hofstra University in Hempstead NY making it the mostwatched presidential debate in historyThe event reverberated around the globe Former Mexican president Vicente Fox said Trumps behavior should alarm world leaders because he revealed himself to be ignorant and dangerousWhen he speaks about the geoeconomic situation and the geopolitical situation and terrorism hes absolutely ignorant and hes only provoking us democratic leaders from around the world to reject everything hes proposing Fox who watched the debate on Mexican television said in a telephone interview He is an imperialistic gringoIn the United States the risk for Trump is that a negative impression sets in on shows such as NBCs Saturday Night Live on social media and in workplace conversationsDemocrats sought to taunt Trump on his uneven performance particularly given his regular attacks on Clintons stamina and appearanceHe seemed unable to handle that big stage and I really did feel that by the end with the kind of snorting the water gulping and the leaning on the lectern that he just seemed really out of gas said Clinton campaign chairman John PodestaTrump previewed an even more combative second debate Oct 9 in St Louis by saying he might hit her harder perhaps over former president Bill Clintons affairsI really eased up because I didnt want to hurt anyones feelings Trump said on Fox saying he would have brought up the many affairs that Bill Clinton had but held back because the Clintons daughter Chelsea was in the audienceI didnt think it was worth the shot he said I didnt think it was niceHillary Clinton shrugged off the threat telling reporters He can run his campaign however he chooses I will continue to talk about what I want to do for the American peopleClinton campaigned at a community college gymnasium in Raleigh to whoops and loud applause One down two to go she said of the debatesDuring a campaign rally in Melbourne Fla Tuesday evening Trump said that Clinton is a woman that I think is virtually incompetent certainly as secretary of state He called her incompetent repeatedly throughout the rallyWere going to get rid of that crooked woman Shes a crooked woman Shes a very very dishonest woman Trump saidFor Democrats Trump provided what Plouffe called an embarrassment of riches at the debate  a series of controversial statements and unresolved damaging questions He seemed to affirm that he paid no income taxes he made side remarks and pained expressions while Clinton praised the vibrancy of African Americans he said it was a smart business strategy to profit from the housing crashVice President Biden seized on that last point at a rally for Clinton in Philadelphia where he charged that Trump has no moral centerThis is a guy who said it was good business for him to see the housing market fail Biden said What in the hell is he talking aboutClinton and a brigade of highprofile surrogates plan to continue using Trumps debate comments against him She will campaign in New Hampshire on Wednesday with Sen Bernie Sanders IVt hoping to energize young voters there with a discussion of college affordability while first lady Michelle Obama will stump across Pennsylvania on ThursdayHe put a lot on the table  a lot of things that are not true and a lot of views that we think are counter to where most voters are said Jennifer Palmieri Clintons communications director It wont end tomorrow Theres a lot that will live on from this debateAnne Gearan in Raleigh NC Jenna Johnson in Melbourne Fla and Jose DelReal in Washington contributed to this report
