A UN meeting aims to coordinate financial efforts against the Islamic State It cant deliver a knockout blow but it can make an impactHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueSmoke rises as Iraqi security forces and allied Popular Mobilization Forces shell Islamic State group positions at an oil field outside Beiji Iraq 155 miles north of Baghdad last month The United States and Russia are going after the Islamic State groups oil industry destroying refineries and hundreds of tanker trucks transporting oil from eastern Syria in a heavy bombardment in recent days aiming to break the extremists biggest source of incomeThe finance ministers set to meet at the United Nations cant put the Islamic State in a financial vise But they can deliver some critical blows to an organization already showing signs of financial strainAnd for a UN Security Council often at odds the meeting of its finance ministers next week comes at an opportune moment when terrorists attacks worldwide have created a sense of shared purpose  even it seems between the United States and RussiaThe core of the Islamic States wealth is in many respects beyond the reach of next weeks meetings hosted by the US Only Turkey can shut its borders to the smugglers who carry Islamic State oil and other contraband and only military force can deprive the group of the territory it uses for extortion and taxationBut a more coordinated effort at targeting the Islamic States finances can pay dividends The US and others for example have used bank reports of suspicious financial transactions to more effectively target locations where the Islamic State is producing and loading oil productsRamping up this coordination is akin to squeezing the balloon of Islamic State finances  thoughnot yet hard enough to pop itsays Matthew Levitt director of the counterterrorism and intelligence program at the Washington Institute for Near East PolicyAnd it is vital to defeating the Islamic State he says Any opportunity to get this level of attention and cooperation on an issue that will be central to destroying ISIS should be seized and built uponTerrorist attacks linked to the Islamic State in Beirut Paris and San Bernadino Calif appear to have galvanized the international communityWhat is reassuring is how much the nations of the world are taking this threat more and more seriously and working together with greater unity said Farhan Haq a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon to journalists earlier this weekParticularly promising are indications the US and Russia agree that the effort to dry up ISIS funding can and must be toughened up says Mr Levitt using another acronym for the Islamic StateBoth the US and Russia are pushing for a new council resolution on terror financing and could agree on one text by the Dec 17 summitAlready there are indications that the Islamic State is feeling a financial pinchHolding the finance ministers summit at the Security Council underscores the importance world leaders are placing on both terror financing and the coordination of financial intelligence and military efforts The summit will mark the first time that a council session will be chaired by a financial official  US Treasury Secretary Jack LewThe finance ministers can work to apply greater scrutiny across the board  from financial transactions that offer crucial clues about the Islamic State economy to money brought into the Islamic State by foreign fighters and donors around the regionBut the summit can only do so muchHalf or more of the Islamic States financial resources are generated from taxation or extortion within the territories the group controls in Syria and Iraq That means that successfully cutting Islamic State funding is directly linked to the international military campaigns aimed at shrinking its territoryThere are a number of actions that can be taken to reduce the financial streams but one thing is clear If you want to deprive ISIS of cash you deprive it of territory says Jonathan Schanzer vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in WashingtonMoreover the Islamic State trafficks much of its oil and antiquities across Turkeys border with Syria experts say The US has been pressing Turkey for months  mostly behind closed doors  to do more while Russia has been much more public with its accusationsNext weeks meetings are an opportunity for the international community to get on the same page to tackle some of these bigger funding streamsWere not going to get anywhere on a critical issue like terror financing if it all sinks into a lot of fingerpointing and recriminations says Levitt If you can get beyond the bickering then a lot more good can be done if you focus on helping Turkey shut down that border
