Last Christmas Christian apologist Eric Metaxas published an article in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal about a miracle or perhaps I should say the miracle  the origin of the universe That article Science Increasingly Makes the Case for God went on to become if not quite a miracle at least a sort of wonder It was shared via email and social media more than any other opinion article in the history of the Wall Street Journal Thats really saying something since the Journal is known to have one of the most popular oped pages in the world Former editor Robert Bartley quipped that his was the only opinion page in journalism that actually sold papersMetaxas certainly tapped into something As of this writing this morning that article has over 470000 Facebook shares and well over 9000 comments The wonder is not the article itself but the phenomenon that in an age of angry pop atheism and sloppy Godisdead scientific journalism intelligent welleducated people the kind of people who read the Wall Street Journal still have minds which are open to the idea that the universe is not closed that there is something or Someone beyond it who can intervene into it Who started it whirling into existence in the first placeI sat down across a Skype line with Metaxas recently to discuss the paperback release of his book Miracles What They Are Why They Happen and How They Can Change Your Life The first third of the book deals with philosophical issues Are miracles possible What are they exactly And why are philosophical objections to them not quite as final or decisive as they purport to beThe rest of the book is actual miracle stories stories from history and stories from Metaxas circle of acquaintances The latter are more persuasive than one might expect Weve all seen the toupeed theurgist circuses of Christian television hawking Jordan river water and magic oils to the gullible But the people Metaxas describes in this book are a little harder to write off Educated wellread accomplished leaders The charming little story of Gregory Alan Thornbury and his wife and the miracle of the car keys packs a little extra power when you realize that Dr Thornbury is a highly accomplished philosopher Im not saying that its right that secular elites in this country should writeoff the testimony of people from trailer parks I hate that contempt But I am saying that if class and IQ are your excuses to not listen to peoples miracle stories then Miracles takes away at least that excuseOne of the most important features in the book is that miracles are not just intervention they are information I found myself wanting more along this line than the book offered The koine Greek word for miracle is teras and the word for sign is semeion which is etymologically related to sign Miracles are a form of communication Modern materialists and those believers who live in reaction to materialism seem to think that the message of miracles is that God exists or gods exist and that this world is not the only world The problem with that is that the miracles of the New Testament appeared in a world in which materialism was very rare almost unknown outside upper class Romans Jesus disputes with the religious leaders were not about whether God existed they were about who God approved of and who He did not In information science terms miracles have entropy departures from the expected deterministic route conferring signal or as my friend George Gilder would say it surpriseBelow you can find a partial transcript of the interview which has been edited for clarity and if you want the whole thing you can listen hereJERRY BOWYER Eric Metaxas is our guest Hes the author of Miracles What They Are Why They Happen and How They Can Change Your Life which has just been published in the paperback editionEric thanks for joining us todayERIC METAXAS Well it is my pleasure Thanks for having meMETAXAS Well thats not so easy to answer I would say that there are two answers theyre equally true because it depends on what your definition is And I kind of go with both in the book One definition is anything that is an injection into the material world into the universe of time and space from outside of that world So anytime anything happens in this world and you say this isnt possible to explain naturalistically that can be a miracleThe parting of the Red Sea was not a coincidence Jesus walking on water was not a hallucination If those things actually happened you can say those are miraclesBut also  well let me put it this way I say that those kinds of miracles are Gods way of speaking to us trying to get our attention And so thats a particular kind of miracle So most of us when we say something is a miracle thats what were talking about Were not just talking about something amazing were talking about something amazing that actually involves GodBut alternatively when were talking about lets say the creation of the universe the Big Bang when you look at the details of it  and the first part of my book deals with faith and science  the scientific details of it the more we know from science the scientific details of it are so staggering that you cant help but think this had to have been something that God didSo on one level everything all of creation partakes in the miraculous if you believe that God is involved on any level every electron spinning around every nucleus of every atom is somehow miraculousBut basically when were talking about miracles were not talking about that Were typically talking about you know I prayed for Uncle Jimmy and suddenly he could walk again You know thats the kind of a miracle typically were talking about And most of the miracles in the book are those kinds of miracles And the thirty miracle stories at the end of the book are definitely those kinds of miraclesBOWYER So your definition of miracle does not include say the act of creation That might be a wonder because its not an intervention into an existing set of physical laws its the origin of that existing set of physical lawsMETAXAS That is extremely heavy I wasnt prepared for that I would have gotten the coffee before the interview That is a brilliant wonderful observation and clarification And Im not used to this Jerry so thank you for doing thatI would actually say that the act of creation is a miracle but it is  as I meant to clarify earlier its a different kind of miracle because there was no one there to observe it happening Although in retrospect through science we can see what happened and we can be staggered retroactively or retrospectively we can be staggered The more you look at the origins of the universe the more you look at what was necessary for the universe to come into being the more you say this simply could not have happened that makes no logical sense Occams razor says its much easier to say God did it than to say you know a thousand things had to line up perfectly and oh by the way coincidentally they did That makes infinitely less sense its infinitely less plausibleBOWYER All right So just a quick aside for nonphilosophical listeners and readers Occams razor refers to the principle that all other things being equal the simpler the explanation which explains all the observations the more likely that explanation is to be trueMETAXAS Yeah When youre talking about science sometimes people are so put off by the idea that God created the universe that they come up with these baroque really hilarious alternative explanations Like they say oh theres an infinity of universes by the way we cant see them and we have no evidence for them but there has to be And of all of those infinite universes one of them got everything perfectly right And guess what we just happen to be living here right now Its just swell Now to me when people say that I think thats actually less scientific than saying a creator created the universeBOWYER Because by definition there is no possible observation of multiverses They were completely hermetically sealed off from usMETAXAS Right And this is what people  people who advocate for socalled multiverse theory themselves say that theres no evidence for them So its a really tremendous speculation that makes believing in the God of the Bible look infinitely scientific in comparison
