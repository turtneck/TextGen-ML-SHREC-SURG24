During a House Appropriations Committee hearing lawmakers added language to the 2016 defense spending bill stating that Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether or not to authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria also known as ISIL or ISISThe amendment offered by Rep Barbara Lee DCalif has no binding effect It does nothing to force a congressional debate on the duration costs or endgame of the war It simply states that it is Congress responsibility to have that debate and then vote to authorize or not to authorize warWe must recognize that Congress has an important role to play in matters of war and peace Its way past time to reassert Congress role in warmaking said Lee We cant allow this policy of endless war to continue This amendment just says Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether to use military force against ISIL A debate Doing our job Thats all this amendment requiresPresident Barack Obama has been directing airstrikes against ISIS since August and hes been doing so without new congressional authorization The Constitution requires Congress to declare wars but in this case Obama said he doesnt need lawmakers signoff because a sweeping 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force covers his actions Lawmakers have disputed that point for months so the president sent them a new Islamic Statespecific AUMF proposal in February saying he welcomed a vote on it even though he doesnt think he needs itDemocrats say Obamas proposal is too broad Republicans say its too restrictive and their differences have given way to complacency That leaves the US engaged in a military campaign with no end in sight The US has already spent more than 21 billion participated in more than 4000 airstrikes and sent 3000 military personnel to Iraq in the effortThe reality is that many lawmakers dont want anything to do with a war authorization vote for fear that if something goes wrong their fingerprints will be on it A handful of Democrats have been pushing for a debate and a vote but neither GOP nor Democratic Party leaders are doing anything to make the issue a priorityTuesdays committee vote at least showed there is bipartisan support in the House for debating and voting on war authorization  something House Speaker John Boehner ROhio has signaled isnt going to happen on his watchWe are not only evading this responsibility on both sides of the aisle quite frankly  but we are handing over warmaking authority to the executive branch to all future presidents with both hands It is a gigantic mistake not to do our job said ColeRep Rodney Frelinghuysen RNJ was among those who opposed Lees amendment He called it totally inappropriate to tie a war authorization measure  even one that just states the role of Congress  to the defense spending billLee offered two other amendments that were rejected One would have repealed the 2001 AUMF with a cushion of eight months for Congress to pass a new ISISspecific AUMF in its place The other would have repealed the 2002 AUMF that authorized the Iraq War Neither of those AUMFs have an expiration date and Obama has leaned on both as his legal justification for taking military action against ISIS on his own
