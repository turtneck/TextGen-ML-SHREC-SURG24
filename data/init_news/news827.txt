At 3 am on a cold desert night earlier this month four Islamic State militants carrying guns grenades and cash slipped into Saudi Arabia here through a hole in the new heavy fencing that separates this country from IraqThey were immediately spotted by Saudi border guards in a stateoftheart control room 35miles away appearing first as blips on radar then as ghostly white figures on nightvision cameras scanning the desolate desert landscapeHeavily armed troops were dispatched to confront them When the battle ended the four intruders  all Saudi citizens  and three Saudi soldiers were dead including the local base commander who was killed when a militant pretending to surrender detonated a suicide vestThanks to God and our new systems we are ready for whatever they try said the new commander Ali Mohammed Assiri whose troops have now been issued orders to shoot on sight anyone breaching the border If you are not willing to defend the country you dont deserve to live in itExcept for Syria and Iraq where the Islamic State controls territory no country is more directly threatened by Islamist militants than Saudi Arabia which the extremists regard as a traitor to Islam for Riyadhs close associations with the United States and the WestNo king of Saudi Arabia has ascended the throne amid more regional turmoil than King Salman who was crowned Friday upon the death of his brother King AbdullahWith war raging in Syria and tensions with Iran increasing Saudi Arabia is threatened by a disintegration of the national government in Yemen across its southern border and by the Islamic State militants who are dominating the Iraqi desert just over its northern borderSalman indirectly mentioned the threat of rising violence and regional instability on Friday in his first speech to the Saudi people saying that the Arab and Islamic nation is in dire need today to be united and maintain solidarityMilitants have staged four attacks inside the kingdom in the past six months resulting in the deaths of eight civilians 11 police or border guards and 13 militants according to Saudi officialsAs in the recent attacks in Paris on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper and a kosher supermarket most of the Saudi attacks have been carried out by homegrown radicals influenced or trained by the Islamic State alQaeda or other extremist groups Saudi authorities said that they have arrested 293 people in connection with the incidents and that 260 of them are Saudi nationalsSaudi officials are anticipating more attacks either by some of the 2200 or so Saudi citizens they say have gone to fight with the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq or by others who infiltrate Saudi Arabias borders especially the nearly 600mile frontier with Iraq which runs mainly through empty desertThey are targeting Saudi Arabia and they want to have a very big terrorist act in this country said Gen Mansour alTurki spokesman for the Interior MinistryThe Saudi government has responded by sharply beefing up border security and by creating new laws that give the government broad power to arrest anyone who joins or even praises the radical groups  which has led to complaints from human rights groups that the laws are being unfairly used against activists who merely criticize the governmentOfficials have also made it illegal for imams in the countrys 85000 mosques to give sermons sympathizing with religious extremists The Ministry of Islamic Affairs has launched the alSakinah Campaign for Dialogue an antiradicalization program that includes a Web site offering anonymous counselingWe are also educating the imams to tell people that what ISIS is saying is against Islam said Tawfeeq alSediry Saudi Arabias deputy minister of Islamic affairs They represent violence We represent the real IslamSaudi officials said they have also tightened controls on charities suspected of channeling money to radicals Wealthy Saudi individuals are widely believed to be a significant source of funding for the Islamic State and alQaedaCritics point to that funding as evidence that many Saudis quietly support the Islamic State seeing it as a Sunni Muslim force fighting to protect other Sunnis especially in Syria and Iraq where Shiite Muslims control the government with the support of Saudi Arabias chief rival IranIn the Middle East its nothing new You create your own terrorists then pretend you are fighting them said Ali alAhmed a Saudi activist who runs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington The Saudis didnt even invent it but theyre good at itAhmed said the Saudi government is playing both sides to give the appearance that they are the good guysThey get a lot of political traction out of it Ahmed said To the Americans they are the guardians of safety and no matter how horrible they are on human rights the way they treat women and all that they are the ones who are keeping things under control Really they are very cleverAwadh alBadi a researcher and scholar at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh rejects those assertions He says the Islamic State is offering arguments that attract some idealistic young MuslimsIslamic State leaders say they want to establish a vast Islamic caliphate or khalifa including taking control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina which are in Saudi ArabiaFor many young people the idea of khalifa is the idea of the great Islam Badi said The idea itself is attractive to many people who aspire to see a return of Islamic dignity and influenceOne Western diplomat based in Riyadh said Saudi cooperation in the fight against Islamist militants has been unwavering He noted that Saudi Arabia has joined the USled military coalition against the Islamic State and sent fighter jets to bomb militant targets  including one F16 piloted by King Salmans son Prince KhaledWe have had to fight the perception that the Saudis are not doing enough the diplomat said speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject From here we think they are doing plenty They tell us Weve been fighting these guys and their ilk for 12 years so dont tell us how to fight these peopleThe kingdom faced a wave of alQaeda attacks in the mid2000s but officials were able to stop them with a fierce crackdown that resulted in the jailing of thousands of suspected militantsThe decree issued last spring making it illegal to belong to or publicly support the Islamic State and other radical groups has slowed the flow of Saudis joining the militants said Turki the Interior Ministry spokesman because it allows police to arrest anyone trying to go as well as those returningThe most visible sign of Saudi Arabias response to the rising militant threat is the extensive new system of fences ditches razor wire and berms along the border with Iraq which stretches from the border with Kuwait in the east to Jordan in the westKing Abdullah inaugurated the barrier system in September after six years of construction on the project which was initially conceived as a defense against the sectarian chaos in Iraq but is now primarily a defense against the Islamic StateSaudi officials have also embarked on a multiyear project to similarly fortify all the thousands of miles of land borders with Jordan Qatar the United Arab Emirates Oman and especially Yemen  where the government was recently toppled by rebels aligned with Iran Saudi Arabias main rival for power in the regionSometimes jokingly referred to as the Great Wall the Iraq border defense system involves two high fences topped with concertina wire backed by deep ditches and tall sand berms designed to make it impossible for any vehicle to crossThe physical barriers are reinforced by technological ones with 40 radar towers each 125 feet high that constantly sweep a radius of nearly 25 miles looking for any movement Each tower is fitted with two cameras  one for daytime one for night  that can zoom in on objects up to 12 miles awayAt the borders main control room at the border guard base in Arar a town of about 100000 people in the empty desert nearly 600 miles northwest of Riyadh operators sit at computer monitors watching 24 hours a dayWhen radar spots something moving in a suspicious place the operators use a mouse to swivel the camera in its direction Most of the time its nothing dangerous  a camel or a shepherds dog  but in the predawn hours of Jan5 it was four heavily armed militantsNot far from a remote and desolate border crossing which is only open during the hajj pilgrimage season the four militants slipped through a hole left by a construction crew working on the fenceTurki said the men were trying to get to Arar where police arrested three Saudis and four Syrians suspected of plotting with the infiltrators The four militants were carrying nearly 20000 in cash four suicide vests six grenades five assault rifles and pistols and two silencersEven if they got to Arar were they waiting for the people to rise with them I doubt it said Badi the King Faisal Center scholar They send messages We are capable of coming to you We will target you Terrorism will come to youIts the same idea as the attacks in France he said They are not planning to take over France but they send a message that they can do this
