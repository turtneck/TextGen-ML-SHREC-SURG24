On the right Evangelical voters see the need to make political compromises On the left morality is increasingly seen through secular eyesThough religion still creates clear fault lines among American voters the importance of a candidates own religiousness is declining rapidlyTwothirds of Evangelicals are planning to vote for Donald Trump and twothirds of religiously unaffiliated nones are saying they will support Hillary Clinton according to a Pew Research Center study released WednesdayBut the share of Americans who want a president with strong religious beliefs is down 10 percentage points  to 62 percent  from 2008 And the trend is apparent on both sides the percentage of Republicans who say it is important for a president to be religious is down eight points since 2008 For Democrats its down 13 pointsYet for each side the reasons for the decline differ On the Republican side Evangelicals are willing to embrace lessreligious candidates in order to maintain political clout while the growing nones of the Democratic Party have shifted to emphasize secular morality over traditional religionFor two election cycles now weve seen a steady decline in the number of Americans who care if the president has strong beliefs says Greg Smith coauthor of the study Maybe the attitudes of some religious groups are changing but more so the religious composition of the entire country is changingEvangelicals have long faced the conundrum of choosing a purist candidate versus choosing a candidate who has broader appeal Mr Trump is an example of that  though for some Evangelicals he represents a particularly big compromise given his lack of religiosity and playboy lifestyleEvangelicals know that Trump is not the Ted Cruz candidate says Chad Seales a professor of religion at the University of Texas Austin and an expert on Southern Evangelicals He is not the religious right candidate of the 1990s but they are making all kinds of concessions to agree with him and reframe him in their world Trump is the cultural option There is no doctrine option leftLast month evangelical leader James Dobson called Trump a baby Christian and fellow religious leader Ralph Reed said we accept him for who he is now because he has showed a commitment to Christian waysHe may not be against abortion for evangelical purposes but well take the end result even it its not by the same means says Laurie MafflyKipp of Washington Universitys John C Danforth Center on Religion and Politics When push comes to shove there has never been a Republican frontrunner who has been a pure Evangelical I think they have compromised beforeMitt Romney a devout Mormon and 2012 Republican presidential nominee is the latest example of how Evangelicals compromised embracing a Mormon and a former bluestate governor note numerous expertsMore recently the senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas Robert Jeffress focused on secular  not theological  similarities in his endorsement of Donald TrumpIt was never seamless but the reason it was so successful was that it was able to push the numbers of the Republican Party over the majority  its voting bloc was powerful and cohesive enough adds Professor SealesBut now he adds Evangelicals are willing merely to back the political positions even if there is concern about a lack of religious conviction behind them  as in Trumps caseOn the other side the rise of the nones appears to be beginning to have an effect In 2012 25 percent of Americans claimed no religious preference In the late 1980s the number was 7 percentThat could be at least partly a reaction to the intense fusing of theological doctrine and politics among religious conservatives suggests Michael Hout a sociologist at New York UniversityMany new nones were people raised Baptist or Catholic but not active he says As those churches became more overtly political over issues like abortion inactive liberals who used to identify quit doing soBut experts say Democrats are also increasingly viewing morality outside of religiousnessNones were among Bernie Sanderss strongest supporters in the primary notes Mr Smith of Pew They were drawn to his vision of a society that takes better care of all  from free college to healthcare to a higher minimum wageMoreover they saw him as a plain speaker whom they could trust For that reason they are slow to warm to Clintons campaign with the allegations of email misuse and her connections to Wall StreetThis is a sign of nervousness about her moral character  which is important because there is a kind of linkage between moral values and leadership says Mark Valeri a professor of religion and politics at the Danforth Center at Washington UniversityThe result is a curious situation in which Democrats appear to be more worried about the morality of their candidate than Republicans areOn the right Republican proTrump side there is less attention to the personal morality of the leader says Professor Valeri But because on the progressive side they do reach for high moral reform there is a desire that Clinton be able to present herself well motivated morally Thats why the emails the testimony the charges are sticking so hard
