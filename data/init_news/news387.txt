President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin laid out sharply competing visions Monday about how to tackle the ongoing conflicts in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East with each blaming the other for the regions turmoil even as they signaled a willingness to address it togetherIn speeches to the UN General Assembly less than two hours apart each leader said he embraced a foreign policy approach that respects international norms that are essential to global stability Later in the day the two met privately to hash out their differences and to see whether there was room for cooperation The closeddoor session lasted more than an hour and a half ending just before Obama was scheduled to host a reception for delegatesAfter the session Putin left for Moscow In brief remarks to Russian reporters he described relations between the two countries as regretfully at a rather low level due to US resistance but said that we now have an understanding that our work needs to be strengthened at least on the bilateral basis We are now thinking together on the creation of appropriate mechanismsA White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting said that while it gave Obama clarity on their objectives the two sides continued to disagree on Syrian President Bashar alAssads role in the conflict and his futureRussias objectives are to go after ISIL and to support the government the official said using an acronym for the Islamic State Administration officials have expressed concern that new Russian deployments in Syria would bolster Assads fight against his opponents rather than degrade the militantsIn his speech Obama took direct aim at Russias military buildup in Syria as well as its support for Ukrainian separatists saying We are told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder that its the only way to stamp out terrorism or prevent foreign meddlingBut I stand before you today believing in my core that we the nations of the world cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion We cannot look backward  And if we cannot work together more effectively we will all suffer the consequencesFor Obama a week that showed the world as he wants it and how it really isPutin for his part charged that attempts by Western nations to impose democracy  including in Iraq and Libya  were responsible for upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa While people in those regions clearly wanted and deserved change the export of revolutions this time socalled democratic ones he said had resulted in violence and social disaster instead of a triumph for democracyThen Putin had a question I cannot help asking those who have forced this situation do you realize now what you have done he said in remarks that never mentioned but were clearly directed at the United States Policies based on selfconceit and belief in ones exceptionality and impunity have never been abandonedBeyond the barbs the two raised the prospect of cooperating more closely on fighting Islamist terrorists and brokering a political solution in Syria where war has raged for 4 years Obama and Putin  who opened their first extended formal meeting in two years with a stiff handshake before the cameras  remain divided over Assad whom Obama wants ousted and Putin continues to backThe United States is prepared to work with any nation including Russia and Iran to resolve the conflict Obama said in his 42minute speech But we must recognize that there cannot be after so much bloodshed so much carnage a return to the prewar status quo  And so Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population who have been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombingPutin by contrast insisted that no one but Assads forces and militias are truly fighting the Islamic State He said it would be an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government and its armed forcesRussia has directly challenged US military and diplomatic dominance in the region and the USled coalition air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria Over the past month Putin has expanded Russias longrunning provision of weapons to Assad with deployments of tanks and aircraft Over the weekend Russia and Iraq announced that they would establish a rival antimilitant coalition in Baghdad to include Iran and SyriaIn his speech before UN delegates Iranian President Hassan Rouhani echoed Putins comments saying that while the United States was responsible for the current tumult in the Middle East his government was willing to help bring democracy to SyriaRussia maintains that Western intervention in Syria is a violation of international lawPutin proposed creating a broad international coalition that he compared to the antiHilter coalition during World War IIRussia the current chair of the UN Security Council has called for a meeting next month to discuss how to better combat extremism Moscow has also proposed a meeting among itself the United States and the governments of Iran Syria Saudi Arabia Turkey and Egypt on coordination over SyriaThe Obama administration has not yet responded to the latter proposal and it remains unclear whether Saudi Arabia the most powerful Sunni Arab state opposed to Assad and Iran the Syrian leaders other main backer would agree to cooperate on any Syrian initiativeLeading European members of the USled coalition which has been conducting air attacks against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria over the past year have indicated that they believe the idea  and some cooperation with Russia  is worth exploringFrench President Franois Hollande who last week authorized his countrys first air attacks in Syria said Monday that today the moderate opposition is weak Bashar alAssad is weak and ISIL is strongWe cant stick to our original enemies he said in a morning session with reporters We have to gather everybody togetherIf Saudi Arabia and Iran can find agreement on the future of Syria then there can be an answer Hollande saidIn comments last week British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to be softening their position toward Assad at least temporarily We have to speak with many actors this includes Assad but others as well Merkel said Not only with the United States of America Russia but with important regional partners Iran and Sunni countries such as Saudi ArabiaEuropean views have been influenced not only by the stagnation in the Syrian conflict and the Islamic States expansion in Iraq but also by the hundreds of thousands of refugees  many of them from Syria  who have been pouring into their countriesUN Secretary General Ban Kimoon praised those European countries that have provided asylum but urged them to do more After the Second World War it was Europeans seeking the worlds assistance Ban saidBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff who was the first world leader to address the General Assembly on Monday drew applause when she noted that her country has already provided shelter to many Syrian refugees Brazil loosened restrictions two years ago and has issued more than 7000 visas to Syrian refugees at this point  more than any other country in Latin AmericaWe have our arms open to welcome refugees she said We are a multiethnic nationObama and Putin also offered differing accounts of what had transpired in Ukraine where Russia has annexed Crimea and backed separatists in the countrys southeastAlthough Putin devoted the bulk of his speech to Syria and terrorism he repeated Russias charge that the overthrow of Ukraines government early last year was orchestrated from outside He said Russia would adhere to the Minsk agreements once they gave adequate representation to the legitimate demands of eastern Ukraine separatists that Moscow has backedObama however said the West would continue to impose economic sanctions on Russia unless it reversed course We cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violatedWhile relations with Russia rank highest on Obamas priority list during this visit his agenda includes other major bilateral meetings and working sessions The president met privately Monday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressing him to adopt a more stringent target for cutting Indias carbon emissions in

December dispatching a senior adviser Brian Deese to New Delhi this month to discuss the matter After their meeting Monday the president said And what I indicated to the prime minister is that I
