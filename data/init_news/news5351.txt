Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her allies have begun preparing a playbook to defeat Donald Trump in a generalelection matchup that will attempt to do what his Republican opponents couldnt show that his business dealings and impolitic statements make him unfit to be commander in chiefBoth the Clinton campaign and outside supporters are confident that she and Trump will almost certainly face each other in the general election and that the focus is shifting past her hardfought primary campaign against Sen Bernie Sanders of VermontThey are now focused intently on researching the billionaire real estate moguls business record dissecting his economic policies and compiling a long history of controversial pronouncements that have captivated and repelled the nation in this tumultuous election seasonNeither the Clinton campaign nor several independent super PACs working on her behalf plan to respond with the same brassknuckles style that Trump has taken with his Republican opponents aides and outside supporters said But in their view Trump isnt Teflon Republicans waited too long to go after him and they went about it the wrong wayWhat the Republicans did was too little too late said David Brock who runs two proClinton super PACs now engaged in researching and responding to Trump It was petty insults It was not strategicJustin Barasky spokesman for the large proClinton super PAC Priorities USA said Republican candidates committed malpractice by failing to raise liabilities from Trumps past or aggressively challenge him on offensive or incorrect statementsImplicit in the effort is real worry about Trumps outsider appeal in a year dominated by workingclass anger and economic anxiety The prospect that Trump could compete for some of the bluecollar voters who have flocked to Sanders for instance  or to reorder the map of competitive states to include tradeaffected Michigan or Pennsylvania  has prompted Clintons allies to leave nothing to chanceHow Trump vs Clinton could reshape the electoral mapYet they also believe that although Trump has motivated a loyal plurality of supporters in primary contests he has limited ability to expand that support once the Republican field clears Because of the litany of controversial pronouncements he has made they expect a Trump nomination to make it easier to rally women Latino and African American voters to turn out for Clinton In fact her aides are planning for a historic gender gap between Clinton and TrumpGiven Trumps willingness to attack his opponents  and his pivot to going after Clinton in recent days  one clear presumption has emerged about the fall contest It will be uglyThats one reason the former secretary of state plans to counter Trump with highroad substance policy and issues according to one senior campaign aide The idea is to showcase what Clintons backers see as her readiness for the job without lowering her to what they describe as Trumps gutterThe aide said the campaigns daytoday decisionmaking remains focused on Sanders But Clinton swept all five states that voted Tuesday and Trump did well meaning both are far closer than any competitor to securing their respective partys nomination Clinton is also far ahead in polling in Arizona a large contest this week while Sanders is expected to pick up victories in other Western states that the Clinton campaign maintains will have little effect on her leadA central lesson of Trumps primary battle the campaign aide said is that he cannot be ignored  but also that he cannot be beaten at his own game The key will be to maintain stature by focusing on her message of political unity and economic growth and by showing knowledge and strength on foreign issues The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about internal strategyTrump praises campaign manager after incident with protesterIts kind of mutually assured destruction Both sides line up their nukes Its going to be just ugly and nasty and icky said another Democrat with longtime ties to the Clinton family The winner will not be the least bad of the two The winner will be the one in the contest of that mutually assured destruction who also has a vision and a message about the future that is both inspiring and credible for the rest of the countryAt the same time her infrastructure of outside supporters will be poised to respond to what they expect will be Trumps allout war against Clinton on everything both personal and political Clintons backers acknowledged that she is also a divisive figure and that controversies such as her use of a private email server while secretary of state will not evaporate during the general electionWe will not make the same mistake the Republicans made by letting attacks go unchallenged Brock saidTrump has repeatedly brushed off polling indicating that he would lose in a headtohead contest with Clinton But after his victories in Florida and elsewhere last week he sounded like a generalelection candidate who recognizes the challenge aheadWe have to bring our party together he said We have something that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story in the worldTrump has benefited in the primary season from the failure of Republicans to unite behind a single foil to his candidacy  and from his own strategy of picking off successive targets whom he viewed as weak Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson both made the mistake Clinton supporters said of trying to ignore Trumps insults or wait out a Trump decline that never came Sen Marco Rubio RFla made the other mistake of trying to use Trumps own tacticsYou cant beat him by being him Barasky saidIn a oneonone race against Clinton Trump would have less room to parry or pivot the same way the senior Clinton campaign aide said because Trump would have one target and one target onlyBarasky and others also predicted that Trump will emerge more damaged by his primary fight than Clinton because of the deep divisions he has caused and exploited Sanders supporters may not like Clinton but their distaste for her doesnt approach the antipathy or angst that many Republican voters harbor about Trump they saidTrump satisfied his loyal supporters by playing a character  the bully the iconoclast  but he turned off many in his own party in the process said several Clinton supporters who are studying the Republican raceIn fact they believe Trumps own words will make one of their central objectives easy tearing him down in the eyes of women notably Republicans and independentsSeveral outside groups  including Emilys List which supports Democratic women who favor abortion rights  are compiling dossiers of statements denigrating women that were taken from the candidates own mouth not just in this campaign but far into his pastYoure a mom and youve got your kids sitting on the couch and you watch the nightly news and youve got this guy saying things as a presidential candidate that you tell your kids not to say said Stephanie Schriock president of Emilys List You dont call women bimbos you dont say that theyre fatWomen including independents who sometimes vote Republican are going to be repulsed Schriock saidTrump will also be a rallying point for Clintons message to black voters particularly older ones who view Trumps rhetoric and his raucous rallies as reminiscent of the worst of Americas pastAt an MSNBC forum Monday Clinton said that Trumps rallies and his exhortations to violence resemble the lynch mobs of the South during the Jim Crow era The remark came after videos from a Trump rally in Fayetteville NC were widely disseminated and showed a white Trump supporter punching a black protester in the faceThe secretary has hit on a really important chord that is running through the African American community This community is 50 years or less from the civil rights images of dogs and hoses and frightening images said Rep Sheila Jackson Lee DTex who has endorsed Clinton That visual of the sucker punch is going to be ingrained in us forever You cant take it backSeveral proClinton super PACs are compiling research on Trump from his long career in business and much shorter career in politics The strategy is still a work in progress and ongoing research through polling focus groups and forensic accounting among other tools will continue through the springMuch of the work is to search for vulnerabilities that in other years with other candidates would have already been exploited by other Republican candidates during the primaryPlans are well underway to present Trumps bankruptcies and management history to voters  particularly to women and the working classIn addition Trump opposes an increase in the minimum wage and has proposed tax breaks for the wealthy positions that his Republican opponents could not go after but which Clinton supporters believe will play poorly in the general electionPeople who suffered from Trumps business decisions will be featured in testimonial advertisements and media campaigns Brock said The media strategy is not unlike several successful efforts in 2012 to tie Republican Mitt Romney to the layoffs and business closures that his company Bain Capital was responsible forYoure definitely going to hear from a number of people who are former customers clients employees who got the short end of the stick in various ways dealing with Trump Brock said Thats fertile groundSchriock also noted Its about character It all ties to what kind of character does this man haveAnd it is about money As the general election approaches Clintons allies are preparing to draw from the discontent in Republican ranks to fill her campaign coffersIve gotten phone calls and emails from a few major Republican donors who have said in effect I will let you know when Im ready to have you make an introduction for me said Andy Spahn president of a Los Angeles consulting firm and a longtime Clinton adviser and top Democratic fundraiser There is certainly an element of the Republican Party be it voters or highnetworth donors who are uncomfortable with what is happeningOther Democrats also assessed that in addition to GOP donors Republican congressional candidates will run away from Trump in the general election underscoring what they see as his thin qualifications  and the danger he poses to their own political fortunes
