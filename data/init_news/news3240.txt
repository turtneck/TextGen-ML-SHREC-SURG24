Two of the biggest news stories of 2015 have been the fall in global oil prices and theapparent breakthrough in negotiations between Iran the United States and others around Irans nuclear weapons research And because Iran relies so heavily on oil exports to earn income the two stories are deeply interlinkedOn the one hand the decline in the world oil price has made life harder for Iran On the other hand relaxing the sanctions against Iran could drive down global oil prices even further  a boon to most of the worlds economies including those of most of the countries pressuring Iran to disarmIn terms of oil sitting in the ground Iran is a whale with almost 10 percent of the worlds proven reserves But in terms of actual oil production the country has become more of a minnow That reflects the multifaceted impact of international sanctions on the Iranian industry Most of all the financial sanctions have made it extremely difficult for Iran to attract the foreign investment needed to actually pump the oil out of the groundMore recently other sanctions on Iranian shipping and direct bans on the importation of Iranian crude oil have further squeezed the industry In January Irans oil minister told a local newspaper that exports had fallen 60 percent since their peak in 2011 to about 1 million barrels per dayIf sanctions were lifted this trend would turn around as new investment poured into the Iranian industry Of course it would take some time for investment to lead to production and most likely any deal would only provide partial sanctions relief But the reality that this shadow production could come back online is hanging over global oil marketsBeyond oil sitting untapped in Iranian soils there is a surprisingly large quantity of oil that has been pumped and is simply sitting around in storage containers As Anjli Raval of the Financial Times reported earlier this month the main cause is a quiet diplomatic triumph of the Obama administration Ahead of Barack Obamas visit to New Delhi in January the Indian government asked domestic refiners to slash purchases of Iranian oil and keep imports in line with the previous fiscal years levels This means oil the Iranians have been pumping for the Indian market has been cooling its heels in storage insteadBack in late 2014 India was importing 348000 barrels of Iranian oil per day which it is allowed to do under the current international sanctions regime That has fallen to around 50000 barrels per day as a favor to the antiIranian coalition  a favor that is likely tolerable for India because the global trend toward cheap oil makes Iranian imports less desirableThis and other export curbs mean that for a while now Iranian exports have actually dropped even more rapidly than Iranian production The country has responded by investing massively in oil storage Raval citing data from the British tanker company Gibsons says Iran has about 37 million barrels in storage Unlike oil thats sitting in the ground oil stored in tankers really could explode onto world markets very quickly in the wake of any kind of diplomatic sentiment Even if formal sanctions were released only gradually for example it is very unlikely that India and other countries would keep up informal deals to swear off Iranian crudeNegotiations with Iran are being undertaken with an overwhelming emphasis on foreign policy and national security issues But it is worth mentioning that getting Iranian oil back onto world markets and driving down prices would be excellent news for the American economyAnd it would be even better news for the economies of other key participants in the negotiations  especially Germany and China  that lack Americas domestic oil industryConversely Russia which has traditionally been one of the countries that is friendliest to Iranwould suffer further economic harm from an influx of Iranian oil And the Persian Gulf states  led by Saudi Arabia  have generally taken a strong antiIranian line in geopolitics and have a strong economic interest in keeping Iranian oil off the market
