Its hard not to like Joe Biden Ive seen him speak in person several times and his love for people and politics is downright infectious Im sad he announced Wednesday he is not running for president because hes fun and he would have lit up the campaignBut I think he made the right decisionThe path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasnt clear let alone easy and its better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail And while Biden seems genuinely to relish campaigning campaigns are getting less and less fun by the day The truth is that a Biden candidacy would have been enjoyable for voters and the media But it probably wouldnt have been very enjoyable for BidenMore substantively a Biden candidacy might simply have muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between Hillary Clinton and Bernie SandersTake the first Democratic debate where Clinton tried to argue that her plan for how to deal with the ills and excesses of Wall Street was more comprehensive and tougher than Sanders Sanders response Well thats not trueOn this issue Sanders is right He is a lifelong economic populist to the point where hes not afraid to criticize the structural failings of capitalism and change the underlying rules of the game to make sure the economy helps poor people and working families Clinton on the other hand has certainly embraced some of the rhetoric of populism in her latest campaign But the extent to which it courses through her bones  let alone her policies  is questionable In the middle of this debate would have been Biden The vice president has more populist street cred from the getgo especially rhetorically I dont think Ive ever heard Biden speak without mentioning his hometown of Scranton Pennsylvania More importantly despite a lofty career since then hes always managed to maintain a straight shooter Regular Joe style But on policies hes more closely aligned with Clinton than Sanders Biden voted in favor of the GrammLeachBliley Act  which repealed part of the GlassSteagall Act opening the door to banks to engage in the wild risktaking that crashed the economy Biden sided with big banks in making it harder for Americans to reduce their amount of student debt And Biden supports the TransPacific Partnership trade deal as Clinton did for a while before recently changing her view  With a little more than a year until the presidential election its essential for Democratic voters  and Americans in general  to see a debate in the primaries in which conventional centrist economic policy is exposed and evaluated in light of a viable populist alternative Clinton and Sanders are having that very real and important debate Regular Joe who repeatedly promotes centrist policies that most help the countrys elite would have unhelpfully complicated things I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America Biden once told a reporter But it doesnt mean I wont run Now apparently he wont run And while we should be grateful for his public service up until now his decision is also a public service  because the Democratic primary will run better without him
