Important aspects of Trumps foreign policy play on Americas weariness as global cop Its his extreme prescriptions that worry votersAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealIn recent weeks Donald Trump has offered one provocative foreignpolicy pronouncement after another reflecting his view that America can no longer afford to pay for the worlds security and prosperityThe United States he says should leave a NATO alliance where wealthy Europeans are mooching off a poor US for their national defense needs Asian partners also need to prepare for an era of American retrenchment  to the extent that allies Japan and South Korea might want to acquire their own nuclear weapons he suggestsAnd then of course theres the matter of his envisioned southern border wall  which he says Mexico must either pay for or face a cutoff of the billions of dollars that Mexicans working in the US send back home each yearSuch proposals may leave most of Washingtons foreignpolicy elite gasping for breath but they resonate with a significant slice of the American public for a couple of key reasons national security and opinion experts sayFor one thing many in the US have tired of Americas role of superpower and sympathize with the idea that playing the worlds policeman has gotten too expensive and offers diminishing returns Then theres the fact that much of Mr Trumps more extreme thinking on US relations with the world has been around in milder forms for years  and has even picked up steam under President ObamaFor instance former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates caused a stir when he used his farewell tour of Europe in 2011 to castigate European allies for not paying their fair share of the alliance defense bill And Mr Obama elected as a kind of antidote to the interventionist George W Bush has as president espoused a more domestically focused America He recently lamented to The Atlantic magazines Jeffrey Goldberg about the free riders who can afford to pay more than they do now but rely on the US for their securityFrom there its not much of a leap to nod and cheer at Trumps take on an overburdened America experts sayTrump is effectively speaking to a widespread feeling in the American public of frustration with aspects of being the global hegemon the big man on the world stage says Steven Kull director of the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Marylands Center for International and Security Studies He speaks to a deepseated feeling and he gets a responseAmericans have a gut reaction when they hear Trump say as he told The New York Times that for too long the US has been the worlds big stupid bully being systematically ripped off by everybody says Lawrence Korb a senior fellow specializing in defense spending at the Center for American Progress in WashingtonPeople off the top of their head say Yeah thats right when they hear someone saying were too much of the worlds policeman or that others arent paying their fair share Mr Korb saysOne reason Americans can relate to Trumps worldview is that they have already been exposed to the broader thinking that lies beneath his more extreme specifics  through Obama Korb addsIn a lot of what Trump says theres a ring thats familiar to people he says andpart of that familiarity comes from the Obama presidencyObama has delivered a kind of retrenchment that was a reaction to Bush who was viewed as overly interventionist he says So when Trump talks about America paying for the world when it needs to pull back and fix things up at home people think theyve heard it before and it has a grain of truth for themKorb notes that all of Obamas past Defense secretaries have upbraided European allies for not paying their fair share into NATOIf you go back and take a look at what Robert Gates and Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel said they all carried the message that You guys have to do more  he says People may be fuzzy on the specifics he adds but they remember the general idea that our allies in Europe and Asia arent stepping up to the plate the way even the president thinks they shouldAs long as Trump is talking in terms of greater burdensharing among allies the public is broadly with him Most Americans feel the US is less respected on the world stage but at the same time favor a greater degree of shared leadership in global affairs recent surveys from the Pew Research Center in Washington suggestAnd according to a Pew survey taken a year ago only about half of Americans have a favorable view of NATO  with the alliances detractors higher among RepublicansBut Americans appear to part ways with the Trump foreign policy vision when general feelings confront specificsAny misgivings over NATO do no translate into support for abandoning the alliance says Dr Kull of the University of Maryland citing his own research Similarlyviews that Asian allies should take on more of their own defense do not translate to support for Japan and South Korea acquiring nuclear weaponsYes there is pretty strong thinking that our allies for too long have been relying on our generosity but does that mean the public thinks we should pull out of NATO No Kull says about twothirds dont think soThat number was among the findings of a study his group recently did for the Chicago Council on Global AffairsWhile Americans may approve when Trump the businessman talks about the US needing a better deal with the world that does not mean they are looking for a revolution in world affairs Kull addsThere was support for NATO in the Chicago Council survey and there is support for the basic international order of security alliances and trade relations he says  and thats where Trump departs from the general publicOf course for dealmakerinchief Trump threats to abandon NATO or Asian allies could simply be startingpoints for negotiation But Kull points to surveys showing Trumps unusually high negatives for a presidential candidate and he suggests that misgivings about how a President Trump would conduct relations with the world are part of thatPeople may be unhappy about things but they arent looking for a president to turn global affairs upside down or put the world order at risk he says Theyre not ready to say thats how presidents act or that thats how America acts in the world
