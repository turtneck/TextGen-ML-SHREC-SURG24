This past weekend the Donald finally pushed a button that was too much for Jeb to bear He made the factual observation that Jebs brother had been president on 911 Well all hell broke loose asevery GOP establishment figure roseup in untamed fury that Trumpwould be rude enough to bring such a thing up Why thatssacrilegeBush followed up with a bizarre tweet which encapsulates the central vulnerability of his campaign and calls into question his entire rationale for runningThisis a strangeargument if only becauseTrump isobviouslycorrectThe attack happened on George W Bushs watch Thus its undeniable that he did not keep us safe But up until now ithasbeen considered something of a faux pasto even say asmuchSure there were some malcontents on the left who tepidly pointed out theobvious truth  that if Al Gore had been president at the time the Republicans would have impeached him if not tried and hanged him for treason  hadthe shoe beenon the other foot Thats fairly obvious But people mostly decided to eschew the blame game after 911Gore for his partcame forward to declarethatGeorge W Bush is my commander in chief and exhort his fellow Democrats to unite behind our president  behind the effort to seek justice not revenge to make sure this will never ever happen again Soon after the entire Congress except for Rep Barbara Lee backed the presidents decision to invade Afghanistan There was very little political dissension Indeed the only serious partisan sniping came from people on the right like Andrew Sullivanclaiming without evidence that the left was in league with the terrorists But for the most part anyblamefor the attacks wasmuted and relegated to the extremesThe government investigated of course and quite thoroughly It created a blue ribbon bipartisan commission which interviewed everyone involved held public hearings andpublished a report in book form for the entire country to see The hearings were particularly riveting as the nation got to hear from various insiders about what had been going on before during and after the attacks Most memorable wasformer terrorism czar Richard Clarkewho testifiedthat he and others had been running around with their hair on fire trying to get the administration to focus on the high probability of an imminent terrorist attack on US soilAnd everyone remembers National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice under questioning by the commissionadmittingthat the president had been given a very specific memo warning of the attacks on August 6th 2001 almost a month before the attacks When asked what the title of the memo was Rice replied to gasps from the audience there and undoubtedly in every living room in America I believe it said Bin Laden determined to strike inside the United StatesIt was a while before America got to see that memo but when we did we saw that they explicitly warned that they would follow the example of World Trade Center bomberIt said that in the first paragraphThere was also a lot of information about the presidents response to the attacks including the rather bizarre fact that Vice President Dick Cheney seemed to havetaken over controlin the early going and that the commission wasnot allowed to interview the president outside the VPs presenceBut with all that there was no Select Committee on 911 formed after the Democrats took over the Congress in 2006 to go over the same ground They did not belabor the issue by calling more witnesses and subpoenaing more documents and keeping the issue alive as a scab that would never heal on the backs of the families who lost loved ones on that awful day They did not in other words turn 911 into a partisan witch huntDonald Trump of course doesnt care about any of that Hes just a street fighter who says whatever comes into his head And hes perfectly happy to yank Jeb Bushs chain and forcehim to answer for the fact that his brother was treated far better than he and his brother and all the rest of them would have treated any Democratin that situation Hes willing to go where no one else was Hes blaming Bush for 911Jeb for his part appeared on CNNs State of the Unionon Sundayto respond to Trumps needling and clumsily said that its what you doafter the attackthat matters Unfortunately this not only stipulates that his brother did fail to keep us safe but then invites the public to look at what he did after which is not a record on which anyone should want to run The obvious question Was attacking a country that didnt attack us leading to thousands more lives lost evidence of his keeping us safeNo Jeb Bush would be wise to simply roll his eyes at Donald Trump and let him rant on without responding because whenever he opens his mouth he creates a whole new set of questions This point was drivenhome when Jake Tapper brought up Benghazi in this context TAPPER Obviously Al Qaeda was responsible for the terrorist attack of 911 but how do you respond to critics who ask if your brother and his administration bear no responsibility at all how do you then make the jump that President Obama and Secretary Clinton are responsible for what happened at Benghazi JEB BUSH Well I  the question on Benghazi which is hopefully well now finally get the truth to is was the place secure They had a responsibility the Department of State to have proper security There were calls for security it looks like they didnt get it And how was the response in the aftermath of the attack was there a chance that these four American lives could have been saved Thats what the investigation is about its not a political issue Its not about the broad policy issue is were we doing the job of protecting our embassies and our consulates and during the period those hours after the attack started could they have been saved TAPPER Well thats thats kind of proving the point of the critics I was just asking about because you dont want to have your brother bear responsibility for 911 and I understand that argument and Al Qaedas responsible but why are the terrorists not the ones who are responsible for these attacks in Libya BUSH They are of course they are but  of course they are but if the ambassador was asking for additional security and didnt get it thats a rproper point and if its proven that the security was adequate compared to other embassies fine well move on Jeb doesnt seem to realize that every time a Republican bellows Four Americans died on Clintons watch and in the next breath insist How dare you say George Bush didnt keep us safe on his watch something doesnt quite track Even Americans who are otherwise too busy to pay attention to the granular details can tell that this is a very strange construction If you watch the video Jeb himself misses more than a couple of beats when Tapper brings it up  he obviously felt the dissonance All congressional majorities play politics and there is always a political element to any investigation by one party into the presidency of the other party But the Republicans have turned this into a blood sport in ways that are unconscionable Its one thing to hold hearings about Hillary Clintonscattle futures trades back in the 70sor theWhite House Christmas card list These are stupid wastes of time and money but they are not about life and death issues for which the Republicans should have a little bit more respect After 911 it would have been very easy for the Democratic Congress to turn what the Bush administration did into a three ring circus of recriminations and insinuations for political gain There were plenty of people who thought President Bush could have been impeached for what Jeb insists was his brothers finest hour  his actions after 911 and the Iraq invasion in particular Unlike these relentless Benghazi Inspector Javerts for better or worse the Democrats thought it would be more legitimate to win the presidency and the Congress through the electoral process in which the epic failure of the Iraq invasion was the focus rather than trying to blame George W Bush for failing to keep the country safe on 911 And that was noble of them Donald Trump is not noble Jeb Bush is going to be questioned on this and hes going to need a better answer than saying his brother kept the country safe He didnt And he didnt do any better in the aftermath He made some good speeches and to his credit he cautioned Americans not to blame Muslims in general for the attacks which may be the best thing he did Other than that its not a good record no matter how you look at it In fact its astonishing that Jeb ever thought he could run without having to answer for it Trump is going to make sure he does Meanwhile the upside to this little squabble is weve finally been able to put the partisan responses to 911 and Benghazi up for comparison Lets just say it doesnt look all that good for Team Red Jeb and The Donalds spat is only going to make that clearer as time goes on
