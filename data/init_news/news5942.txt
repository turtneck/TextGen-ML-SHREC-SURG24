Federal taxpayers dumped more than 205 million into Hawaiis ObamaCare insurance exchange but after a steady downward spiral the oncehighly praised Hawaii Health Connector is on life supportThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has already restricted grant funds to the Hawaii Health Connector after telling officials in March it was out of compliance with the Affordable Care Act because of fiscal instability and ongoing IT issuesWith state lawmakers also blocking additional funds the system is struggling to stay afloat The governors office said it is doing what it can to salvage the situation including approving 30 million to temporarily transition the local portal to the federal exchange HealthCaregov  where residents could continue to enroll over the next year while problems with the local site are addressedLaurel Johnston deputy chief of staff for Gov David Ige claimed the state will negotiate the release of federal grant funds and ensure compliance with the lawWhether they will succeed remains to be seen CMS still has to accept the governors proposal  and the exchange reportedly is making contingency plans in case the system has to shut down entirelyThe drama has only hardened critics concerns that millions of taxpayer dollars are going to wasteThe 200 million was a complete waste of tax dollars that could have been used for much more productive efforts said Reg Baker a wellknown CPA in Hawaii who for many years was the chief financial officer for the health insurance plan HMAAThe news about the Hawaii Health Connectors troubles went national this week when Hawaiis largest daily the Star Advertiser broke a story based on a leaked draft of the states report to CMS which reportedly said the exchange prepared a contingency plan to shut down local operations and transition to federal government control by Sept 30 The plan purportedly directed that no new enrollees would be accepted by the local exchange after the end of this week outreach services would conclude May 31 and a 73member workforce including staff and consultants would be laid off by Feb 28The governors office maintained that was just a draft report and said recent news reports based on confidential working draft documents have misrepresented ongoing discussions between the federal government the state administration and Hawaii Health ConnectorThe Connectors executive director Jeff Kissel said the first priority is to ensure the continuity of coverage for the 37000 to 40000 Hawaii residents who are receiving health insurance coverage through Hawaii Health Connector If CMS does not accept the governors plan Hawaii also risks losing 1 billion in matching federal Medicaid funds according to Iges officeBaker told FoxNewscom the state should just abandon plans to keep the local Connector open and merge with the federal government website Piggybacking on the federal system is the financially smart thing to do he saidWhile many of the states Democrats praised the ObamaCare exchange when it launched in October 2013 it was riddled with trouble from the start The web portal never worked properly despite the state spending 74 million on a contract with CGI to build and maintain it The exchange experienced tremendous staff turnover with three executive directors appointed in two years Enrollment reached just over 8500 in the first year and as a result Hawaii was ranked the most costly exchange in the nation at more than 23899 per personEnrollment never reached the 300000 number thenGov Neil Abercrombie a Democrat enthusiastically predicted at the opening press conference launching the Connector The enrollment number also never hit 70000 the minimum needed to stay financially solvent At its peak enrollment reached 37000 a fraction of the states 14 million people Hawaiis uninsured population at 8 percent when the exchange opened dropped just 2 percentSome folks might suggest that the Connector was successful because of the 30000 people who signed up but those numbers are questionable since many already had insurance to begin with were transferred to the Medicare system or are no longer enrolled and signups are not as important as the number currently enrolled in the insurance plans offered on the Connector Baker said noting each enrollee cost the federal government about 666666Millions of dollars went to the failed web portal developed by controversial Montrealbased company CGI Federal the same company that developed the botched federal web portal for HealthCaregov under a 937 million contract but was replaced in January 2014 after numerous enrollees had problems registeringBesides the fact that Hawaiis web portal did not function properly since the site launched because it didnt sync with the state Department of Human Services website offering Medicaid the site had another major technical problem the Connectors Small Business Health Options Program targeted at small business owners sent garbled data to insurers preventing them from signing up small businesses and their employeesHawaii is just the latest state that has struggled to sustain its ObamaCare exchange at great cost to taxpayers watchdog group Americans for Tax Reform notesDespite the government investing 45 billion into staterun exchanges Oregon Massachusetts Maryland Vermont New Mexico and Nevada shut down their operationsOne wonders where these tens of millions of dollars actually go ATR President Grover Norquist saidBaker said the system is failing for the same reason most businesses fail  the customers did not see the value of the product they were trying to sell
