The Supreme Court it would seem did not want you to see what it was up to on WednesdayThe robed nine were hearing oral arguments in King v Burwell  a legal effort by conservatives to dismantle Obamacare and probably the most politically charged case to appear before the high court since Bush v Gore But as always there was no video of the proceedings and curiously the court chose not to release sameday audio of the argument as it did in Bush v Gore and has done in other highprofile cases since thenI went to the argument as I have for the last decade to attempt to paint for readers a verbal picture of the atmospherics in the room such as Samuel Alitos eye rolls Sonia Sotomayors hectoring and Clarence Thomass states of repose But this time court staff placed me in the back corner three feet from the door blocking my view of the justices were two redvelvet curtains a marble pillar another marble pillar and a closed brass gate carved with images of acorns oak leaves dolphins helmets and plumes animal heads and the Ten CommandmentsUltimately though there will be no hiding what happened in that chamber Wednesday morning Ninety minutes of lopsided argument in favor of the Obama administrations defense cast significant doubt on what had been a plausible challenge to Obamacares legality The conservative majority could still knock down the law of course but given the ambiguity exposed Wednesday it would now be a breathtaking surprise for the justices to cause such massive upheaval  taking healthcare immediately from 8million and causing a death spiral for the rest of Obamacare  based on such a slender legal reedThe four liberal justices furiously picked apart the arguments of Michael Carvin who had also argued unsuccessfully in a 2012 challenge to the healthcare law Alito and Antonin Scalia were not as aggressive as usual in their questioning of the Obama administrations lawyer and Chief Justice John Roberts was almost as silent as Thomas Anthony Kennedy perpetual swing vote had some serious doubts about the argument against ObamacareKennedy said that while perhaps you will prevail in the plain words of the statute theres a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument along with a violation of federalism because states would be coerced to embrace Obamacare exchanges or enter an insurance death spiral he saidSometimes we think of things the government doesnt Kennedy informed himAt issue whether the language in the Affordable Care Act calling for each state to establish a healthcare exchange means that people are not eligible for subsidies in states where the federal government created the exchanges because the state refused to do so Take away those subsidies and Obamacare collapsesOne part of the law favors the critics interpretation but other parts of the law and the broader context of the law contradict such an interpretation Given this Talmudic dispute over the text its almost inconceivable that the justices supposed practitioners of judicial modesty would consider that justification sufficient to tear apart the nations social fabricOpponents of the law went through great contortions to bring this case Theyre arguing against tax credits  and thus in favor of tax increases They had trouble finding people who had sufficient injury to have standing in the case  and in Wednesdays arguments it became apparent that only one of the four plaintiffs clearly qualified More difficulty came when Carvin argued that states would still get the benefit of exchanges even without subsidies Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that he argued the opposite in his last appearanceWhichever legal argument the laws opponents were relying on at the moment it was secondary to the political argument against Obamacare Scalia in his attempt to justify the social upheaval that would come if the court jettisoned the law asked the governments top lawyer Donald Verrilli You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue  Congress adjusts enacts a statute that takes care of the problem It happens all the timeThere was laughter in the courtroomAfter the argument hundreds of activists whipped up by some members of that very Congress waved signs and traded taunts as if they were rival fans at a basketball gameStand up Fight back Health care under attack chanted one sideLiberty Follow the law the other side shouted backIn the unlikely event the Roberts court uses an ambiguous textual dispute to overturn the most significant social legislation of the era there will be no place to hide from the national conflagration that followsRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
