themNPRs politics team has annotated Trumps speech below Portions we commented on are highlighted followed by analysis context and fact check in italicsThank you thank you Thank you very muchFriends delegates and fellow Americans I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United StatesWho would have believed that when we started this journey  because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago Who would have believed this Who would have believed thisThe Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago Not so good Not so goodTogether we will lead our party back to the White House and we will lead our country back to safety prosperity and peaceWe will be a country of generosity and warmthBut we will also be a country of law and orderOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation The attacks on our police and the terrorism of our cities threaten our very way of life Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our countryAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities Many have witnessed this violence personally some have even been its victims I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon and I mean very soon come to an endBeginning on January 20th of 2017 safety will be restoredThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nationI will present the facts plainly and honestlyWe cannot afford to be so politically correct anymoreSo if you want to hear the corporate spin the carefullycrafted lies and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week Go thereBut here at our convention there will be no lies We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing elseThese are the facts Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administrations rollback of criminal enforcement Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in Americas fifty largest cities Thats the largest increase in 25 yearsIn our nations capital killings have risen by 50 percent They are up nearly 60 in nearby BaltimoreIn the Presidents hometown of Chicago more than 2000 people have been the victims of shootings this year aloneAnd more than 4000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took officeThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 compared to this point last yearNearly 180000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizensThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resourcesOne such bordercrosser was released and made his way to Nebraska There he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root She was 21 yearsold and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 40 Grade Point Average Number one in her class Her killer was then released a second time and he is now a fugitive from the law Ive met Sarahs beautiful family But to this Administration their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasnt worth protecting No moreOne more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open bordersWhat about our economy Again I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper Nearly 4 in 10 AfricanAmerican children are living in poverty while 58 of AfricanAmerican youth are now not employed2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years agoAnother 14 million people have left the workforce entirelyHousehold incomes are down more than 4000 since the year 2000 Thats sixteen years agoOur trade deficit has reached an alltime high think of this think of this our trade deficit is nearly 800 billion think of that 800 billion dollars last year alone Were going to fix thatThe budget is no better President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than 19 trillion and growing And yet what do we have to show for it Our roads and bridges are falling apart our airports are Third World condition and fortythree million Americans are on food stampsNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster but theyve lived through one international humiliation after anotherOne after another We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal which gave back to Iran 150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing  it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiatedAnother humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria  and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing In Libya our consulate  the symbol of American prestige around the globe  was brought down in flamesAmerica is far less safe  and the world is far less stable  than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of Americas foreign policyLets defeat her in November okayI am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regretsHer bad instincts and her bad judgment  something pointed out by Bernie Sanders  are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today Lets review the recordIn 2009 preHillary ISIS was not even on the map Libya was stable Egypt was peaceful Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence Iran was being choked by sanctions Syria was somewhat under control After four years of Hillary Clinton what do we have ISIS has spread across the region and the entire world Libya is in ruins and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood forcing the military to retake control Iraq is in chaos Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton death destruction terrorism and weakness But Hillary Clintons legacy does not have to be Americas legacyThe problems we face now  poverty and violence at home war and destruction abroad  will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first placeA change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomesTonight I will share with you my plan for action for America The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents is that our plan will put America FirstAmericanism not globalism will be our credo As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect The respect that we deserveThe American People will come first once againMy plan will begin with safety at home  which means safe neighborhoods secure borders and protection from terrorism There can be no prosperity without law and orderOn the economy I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild AmericaA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nations most powerful special interests Thats because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit Believe me Its for their benefitBig business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in placeThey are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does She is their puppet and they pull the stringsThat is why Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change Never everMy message is that things have to change  and they have to change right nowEvery day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected ignored and abandoned I have visited the laidoff factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals These are the forgotten men and women of our country And they are forgotten But theyre not going to be forgotten longThese are people who work hard but no longer have a voice I am your voiceI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good I have no patience for injustice How great are our police And how great is ClevelandI have no patience for injustice No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens When innocent people suffer because our political system lacks the will or the courage or the basic decency to enforce our laws  or still worse has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  I am not able to look the other way And I wont look the other wayAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server deletes 33000 of them so the authorities cant see her crime puts our country at risk lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence  I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our countryWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless and negligent in handling our classified secrets I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually didThey were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimesIn fact her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it  especially when others who have done far less have paid so dearly When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has comeI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselvesNobody knows the system better than meWhich is why I alone can fix itI have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders  he never had a chance Never had a chance But his supporters will join our movement because we will fix his biggest single issue trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a countryMillions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all AmericansIn this cause I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States Governor Mike Pence of Indiana And a great guyWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana Which is amazingHes a man of character and accomplishment Hes the man for the jobThe first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed Immediately after Dallas we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia Missouri Wisconsin Kansas Michigan and TennesseeOn Sunday more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge Louisiana Three were killed and three were very very badly injured An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all AmericansI have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police when I take the oath of office next year I will restore law and order to our country Believe me Believe meI will work with and appoint the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly doneIn this race for the White House I am the Law And Order candidateThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seenThis Administration has failed Americas inner cities Remember it has failed Americas inner cities Its failed them on education Its failed them on jobs Its failed them on crime Its failed them in every way and at every single level When I am President I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equallyEvery action I take I will ask myself does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore in Chicago in Detroit in Ferguson who have really in every way folks the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America Any other childTo make life safe for all of our citizens we must also address the growing threats from outside the country We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and were going to defeat them fastOnce again France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism Men women and children viciously mowed down Lives ruined Families ripped apart A nation in mourning The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over  at the World Trade Center at an office party in San Bernardino at the Boston Marathon at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga Tennessee And many many other locationsOnly weeks ago in Orlando Florida 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist This time the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community No good and were going to stop itAs your President I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology Believe meAnd I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said Thank youTo protect us from terrorism we need to focus on three things We must have the best absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world The best We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq in Libya in Egypt and in Syria Instead we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now doing it quickly Were going to win Were going to win fastThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region the State of IsraelRecently I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share As usual the United States has been picking up the costs Shortly thereafter it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism A true step in the right directionLastly and very importantly we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place We dont want them in our countryMy opponent has called for a radical 550 increase in Syrian think of this Think of this this is not believable but this is whats happening A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President ObamaShe proposes this despite the fact that theres no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come fromI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our peopleAnyone who endorses violence hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will beDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens especially for AfricanAmerican and Latino workers We are going to have an immigration system that works but one that works for the American peopleOn Monday we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza Sabine Durden and my friend Jamiel Shaw They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly Of all my travels in this country nothing has affected me more nothing even close I have to tell you than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve We have to solve itThese families have no special interests to represent them There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf My opponent will never meet with them or share in their pain Believe me Instead my opponent wants Sanctuary CitiesBut where was the sanctuary for Kate SteinleWhere was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann and Sabine and Jamiel Where was sanctuary for all the other its so sad to even be talking about it because we can solve this problem so quickly Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so horribly These wounded American families have been alone But they are not alone any longerTonight this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them to send them our love and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fateWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration to stop the gangs and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communitiesI have been honored to receive the endorsement of Americas Border Patrol AgentsAnd will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful lawful lawful immigration system LawfulBy ending catchandrelease on the border we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence Illegal border crossings will go down We will stop it it wont be happening very much anymore Believe mePeace will be restored By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserveTonight I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied  and every politician who has denied them  to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say On January 20th of 2017 the day I take the oath of office Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforcedWe are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizensEditors note Trump chanted along with the crowd hereMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration Which is what we have now Communities want relief Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty mass immigration and mass lawlessnessHer plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals further reduce your jobs and wages and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that theyre going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle classI have a different vision for our workers It begins with a new fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat Of which there are manyIts been a signature message of my campaign from day one and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of officeI have made billions of dollars in business making deals  now Im going to make our country rich againUsing the greatest business people in the world which our country has I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreementsAmerica has lost nearlyone third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton Remember it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country Or frankly any other country Never ever againI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America  and I am not going to let companies move to other countries firing their employees along the way without consequence Not going to happen anymoreMy opponent on the other hand has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class She supported NAFTA and she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization  another one of her husbands colossal mistakes and disastersShe supported the jobkilling trade deal with South Korea She supported the TransPacific Partnership Which will not only destroy our manufacturers but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments And its not going to happenI pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence We will never sign bad trade deals America First again America FirstInstead I will make individual deals with individual countries No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long  and which no one from our country even reads or understandsWe are going to enforce all trade violations against any country that cheatsThis includes stopping Chinas outrageous theft of intellectual property along with their illegal product dumping and their devastating currency manipulation They are the greatest that ever came about They are the greatest currency manipulators everOur horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America  and well walk away if we dont get that kind of a dealOur country is going to start building and making things againNext comes the reform of our tax laws regulations and energy rules While Hillary Clinton plans a massive and I mean massive tax increase I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year  Democrat or RepublicanMiddleincome Americans and businesses will experience profound relief and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone I mean everyoneAmerica is one of the highesttaxed nations in the worldReducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country Believe me itll happen and itll happen fastThen we are going to deal with the issue of regulation one of the greatest jobkillers of them all Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as 2 trillion a year and we will end it very very quicklyWe are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energyThis will produce more than 20 trillion in jobcreating economic activity over the next four decades My opponent on the other hand wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business  that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work againWith these new economic policies trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans  We will build the roads highways bridges tunnels airports and the railways of tomorrow This in turn will create millions of more jobs We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choiceMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children And thats what shes doing And thats whats shes done We will repeal and replace disastrous ObamacareYou will be able to choose your own doctor againAnd we will fix TSA at the airports Which is a total disasterWere going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives Tremendous problemWe will completely rebuild our depleted military and the countries that we protect at a massive cost to us will be asked to pay their fair shareWe will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of beforeMy just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dyingMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal One more sign of how out of touch she really is We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 daysThe politicians have talked about this for years but Im going to do itEditors note Crowd chants Yes You WillWe are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our ConstitutionThe replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies Very important This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendmentI on the other hand received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safeAt this moment I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because Ill tell you what Because the support theyve given me and Im not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight True So trueThey have so much to contribute to our politics yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits An amendment pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago threatens religious institutions with a loss of their taxexempt status if they openly advocate their political views Their voice has been taken awayI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all AmericansWe can accomplish these great things and so much more  all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again Start believing It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back  bigger and better and stronger than ever beforeIn this journey Im so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don Ivanka Eric Tiffany and Barron you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy And by the way Melania and Ivanka did they do a jobMy Dad Fred Trump was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew I wonder sometimes what hed say if he were here to see this and to see me tonightIts because of him that I learned from my youngest age to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working peopleHe was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers and carpenters and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also I love those peopleThen theres my mother Mary She was strong but also warm and fairminded She was a truly great mother She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known and a great great judge of character She could pick em out from anywhereTo my

exclusive mission is to go to work for our country  to go to work for you Its time to deliver a victory for the American people We dont win anymore but we are going to start winning againBut to do that we must break free from the petty politics of the past America is a nation of believers dreamers and strivers that is being led by a group of censors critics and cynicsRemember all of the people telling you you cant have the country you want are the same people telling you that wouldnt stand I mean they said Trump doesnt have a chance of being here tonight Not a chance The same people Oh we love defeating those people Dont we Dont we Love it Love it Love itNo longer can we rely on those same people in the media media and politics who will say anything to keep a rigged system in

whole world that America is still free and independent and strongI am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House And I will be your championMy opponent asks her
