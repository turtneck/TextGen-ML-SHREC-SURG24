this monthThose named were the firstterm Iowa senator Joni Ernst the firstterm Arkansas senator Tom Cotton  like Ernst a military veteran  and the governor of Indiana Mike Pence Trump spent time with Pence and his family on Sunday and was due to meet Ernst in New Jersey on MondayErnst was endorsed by the Tea Party and won her Senate seat in 2014 running an infamous ad featuring a boast of growing up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm and the promise that once in Washington she would know how to cut pork thus making big spenders  squeal In 2015 she delivered the Republican response to Barack Obamas State of the Union addressCotton 39 and thought by some a likely postTrump presidential candidate in 2020 has not been as often named among potential Trump VPs as Pence and Ernst In his tweet Trump said Cotton had been great on Meet the Press yesterday Despite a totally onesided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solidCotton gave little away in his NBC interview saying Trump could make the case for himself as to why he should be president He was more forthright in attacking Hillary Clinton who he said had been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administrationTrumps note of complaint about Todds questioning echoed another tweet sent on Monday in which he blamed the dishonest media for a furor over a tweet he sent and then deleted on Saturday which showed Clinton next to a sixpointed star against a background of dollar bills prompting accusations of antisemitism The image was later found by reporters on a white supremacist message board in a post predating Trumps tweetThe former House speaker Newt Gingrich who has repeatedly said he is open to being Trumps VP may yet be considered too forthright Last week in words that echoed strongly on Monday in the controversy over Trumps Clinton tweet he told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival Trumps job is frankly to quit screwing up and get the election down to three or four big issuesThe New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama have also been reported to be under consideration Trump has said the pick will likely be announced at the convention in Cleveland which starts on 18 July but some sources suggest he may announce sooner to help drum up excitementAs evidence of his management of a process which generates relatively positive publicity Trump also tweeted on Monday The only people who are not interested in being the VP pick are the people who have not been askedMany of the Republican partys biggest names are not willing to appear at the convention The former presidents George HW Bush and George W Bush the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney and the Ohio governor John Kasich all plan to avoid the fourday eventPossible speakers include the former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and the boxing promoter Don KingIm going to be involved definitely King who lives in Cleveland told the Associated Press Hes my man I love him Hes going to be the next presidentSome celebrities backing Trump have however passed on the convention The Super Bowlwinning Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka told the Chicago Tribune last week I spoke with Mr Trump this afternoon and he invited me But I dont think Im going to goTrumps campaign has also been in touch with aides to the man who challenged him most strongly in the primary the Texas senator Ted Cruz who has reportedly been trying to win a speaking slot Others under consideration include the former United Nations ambassador and sometime presidential hopeful John Bolton the West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito and the Washington representative Cathy McMorris RodgersGingrich a likely convention speaker who also spoke to the AP said Trump understands that if he can appeal to consumer America he drowns political America He also recalled a recent conversation with a Trump family member who confidently told him We know how to do conventionsTrumps daughter Ivanka predicted in a recent radio interview the convention would be a great combination of our great politicians but also great American businessmen and women and leaders across industry and leaders across really all sectors from athletes to coaches and everything in betweenI think it will be a convention unlike any weve ever seen she said It will be substantive It will be interesting It will be different Its not going to be a hohum lineup of you know the typical politiciansA Trump spokesman Jason Miller told the AP This is not going to be your typical party convention like years past Donald Trump is better suited than just about any candidate in memory to put together a program thats outside of Washington and can appeal directly to the American peopleMatt Borges the Ohio Republican party chairman said Trump is going to have to bring all his skills to bear to make this work not just in Cleveland but for the next four monthsIt wont be easy but thats what hes got to do
