Washington CNN Donald Trumps criticism about the Muslim parents of a slain American soldier has generated  once again  a backlash within his own partyJust 100 days from the election Trump has responded in his standard fashion  dig in claim hes being treated unfairly and attack backBut the swift condemnation of Trumps response raises questions about whether this controversy is different from the ones that came before itIt certainly isnt going away  Khizr and Ghazala Khan appeared for a lengthy joint interview on CNNs New Day on Monday where Khizr accused Trump of ignorance and arroganceKhan also said hes received an outpouring of support for speaking out against the GOP presidential candidate including from many Republicans And he warned that Trumps attacks on Muslims are boosting terror recruitment Khan said it is good Muslims who are the ones who can help stop terror and make American saferWe are the solution to terrorism Khan said on CNN MondayTrump tweeted during the interview that the issue was not the Khans it was stopping the spread of radical Islamic terrorismThe White House also weighed in with an implicit rebuke of Trump saying that Gold Star families deserve only honor and gratitude for their loved ones serviceSpeaking aboard Air Force One spokesman Eric Schultz wouldnt provide a specific response to Trumps comments about the Khan family But he said honoring Gold Star families should rise above politicsFamilies who make the ultimate sacrifice for this countrys freedom and this countrys safety deserve nothing but our countrys honor and gratitude and deepest respect Schultz saidAlso on Monday Hillary Clintons runningmate Tim Kaine said Is it OK to speak in a disrespectful way about the military about a Gold Star mom and dad for Gods sake about people with disabilities or saying offensive things about women or trash people who are Latinos or immigrants more generallyWere either going to build a community that is a more perfect union that is a community of respect or were going to decide to do what has been done throughout American history but never to our advantage Kaine said during a campaign stop in Richmond VirginiaThis time attacks from the Republican presidential nominee on the parents of a soldier who died defending America have put new pressure on GOP leaders to decide whether they will continue to stand by him Already the partys leaders in the House and the Senate have distanced themselves from Trumps remarks and other Republican figures are attacking their nominee forcefullySen John McCain issue a very personal statement Monday blasting Trumps comments about the Khans and paying homage to their son Humayuns sacrifice McCain noted that his son also served in the Iraq War and the McCains have been serving in the US military for hundreds of yearsIt is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party McCain said While our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among usLastly Id like to say to Mr and Mrs Khan thank you for immigrating to America Were a better country because of you And you are certainly right your son was the best of America and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation  and he will never be forgottenSen Lindsey Graham RSouth Carolina said in a statement This is going to a place where weve never gone before to push back against the families of the fallen There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics  that you dont do  like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize youIf youre going to be leader of the free world you have to be able to accept criticism Mr Trump cant Graham said The problem is unacceptable doesnt even begin to describe itThe controversy is over Trumps response to the Khans whose son was killed in Iraq by a suicide bomber in 2004 The Khans took the stage Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention where Khizr Khan rejected Trumps proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States as unconstitutional pulling a copy of the Constitution from his breast pocket and saying that Trump has sacrificed nothing and no one Trump has since responded by criticizing Ghazala Khans silence and suggesting she wasnt allowed to speakThe incident recalls Trumps attack last year on McCain Trump said at the time that McCain is not a war hero because he was captured and imprisoned in Vietnam Many had speculated the criticism would spark Trumps decline in the GOP primary race  it did notBut there are two key differences Trump was not yet the GOP nominee and McCain  himself the 2008 GOP standardbearer  is a longtime public figure with experience parrying on the presidential level The Khans are notThis is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country Jeb Bush a Trump rival in the 2016 GOP primary said on Twitter Sunday eveningTheres only one way to talk about Gold Star parents with honor and respect tweeted Ohio Gov John Kasich who skipped the GOP convention in his state and has declined to endorse Trump Capt Khan is a hero Together we should pray for his familyKasichs top strategist in his failed 2016 presidential campaign John Weaver tweeted a scathing attack on Trumps handling of the Khan controversy saying Trumps slur against Captain Khans mother is even for him beyond the pale He has NO redeeming qualitiesAnd both Republican congressional leaders took issue with Trump issuing statements Sunday that praised the Khan family and reaffirmed their opposition Trumps proposed Muslim travel banAmericas greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it House Speaker Ryan RWisconsin said As I have said on numerous occasions a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values I reject it Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military and made the ultimate sacrifice Captain Khan was one such brave example His sacrifice  and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  should always be honored PeriodCaptain Khan was an American hero and like all Americans Im grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like Captain Khan and their families have made in the war on terror McConnell said in a statement SundayAll Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services McConnell said And as I have long made clear I agree with the Khans and families across the country that a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American valuesBut both men noticeably did not mention Trump by name in their brief statements that came hours after Khizr Khan called on them to repudiate TrumpHe told CNNs Jim Acosta those GOP leaders have a moral ethical obligation to not worry about the votes but repudiate him withdraw the support If they do not I will continue to speakDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton also criticized Trump on Sunday speaking to reporters alongside Kaine a Virginia senatorAsked if Trumps attack on the Khan family is a pivotal moment in the election Clinton said Well he called Mexicans rapists and criminals He said a federal judge was unqualified because of his Mexican heritage He has called women pigs He has mocked a reporter with a disabilityThats right Clinton said And any one of those things is so offensive and then to launch an attack as he did on Capt Khans mother a Gold Star mother who stood there on that stage with her husband honoring the sacrifice of their son and who has in the days since spoken out about the overwhelming emotion that any mother would feel as her son was being honored and then to have Trump do what he did I dont know where the bounds are I dont know where the bottom isLike the dustup over Trumps criticism of Indianaborn federal judge Gonzalo Curiels Mexican heritage Trumps reaction has been tinged with the stereotyping of Khans Muslim familyId like to hear his wife say something Trump told DowdThen he told Stephanopoulos If you look at his wife she was standing there She had nothing to say She probably  maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say You tell me But plenty of people have written that She was extremely quiet And it looked like she had nothing to say A lot of people have said thatDonald Trump has children whom he loves Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak she wroteResponding to the backlash Trump issued a statement Saturday praising Capt Khan as a hero and saying the real problem is radical Islamic terrorists who killed himBut in that statement he again criticized the soldiers fatherWhile I feel deeply for the loss of his son Mr Khan who has never met me has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution which is false and say many other inaccurate things Trump said in the statementAnd Sunday morning he again weighed in over TwitterCaptain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it Trump wrote in the first of two tweetsHe followed up later by attempting to shift the focus from Khizr Khans criticism of his proposed Muslim ban to the Iraq war in which Khans son was killedI was viciously attacked by Mr Khan at the Democratic Convention Am I not allowed to respond Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me Trump tweetedAs Trump pushed back first asking whether Ghazala Khans silence on stage was related to her faith Khizr Khan again attacked Trump Sunday on CNNs State of the UnionHe is a black soul and this is totally unfit for the leadership of this country Khan said The love and affection that we have received affirms that our grief  that our experience in this country has been correct and positive The world is receiving us like we have never seen They have seen the blackness of his character of his soulOn Sunday night Trumps running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence issued a statement offering praise for Humayan Khan as an American hero Pence also touted the Trump campaigns immigration plan which would prevent newcomers from entering the US if they hail from countries that have been compromised by terrorismCaptain Khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror Due to the disastrous decisions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton a once stable Middle East has now been overrun by ISIS This must not stand Pence saidBy suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism rebuilding our military defeating ISIS at its source and projecting strength on the global stage we will reduce the likelihood that other American families will face the enduring heartbreak of the Khan familyTrumps advisers attempted to move past the controversy downplaying the direct conflict between Trump and the Khan familyWhat hes saying is that Mr Trump has a right to defend himself to make clear what hes saying is this is about Islamic terrorism for him to be criticized like that he didnt think was fair Trump aide Jason Miller told CNNs Brian Stelter on Reliable Sources Sunday
