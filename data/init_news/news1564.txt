A couple of weeks ago I wrote a mostly facetious article about six events that could occur to flip the polls in favor of Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton and then I assessed how much each would matter No single occurrence apart from the preposterously unlikely event of Barack Obama endorsing Trump seemed to have a ton of power on its own Nonsilly scenarios included the release of new and questionable Clinton emails a month of passable behavior from Trump and a serious health setback for Clinton What the column failed to consider however was the power of a few of these incidents occurring at the same time Weve now seen new unfavorable email stories this was inevitable two weeks of moderately controlled behavior from Trump the previous record had been about two days and a genuine health issue for Clinton a nearcollapse during a 911 ceremony We also saw a small but foolish gaffe from the Democratic nominee on Friday night when she dismissed fully half of Trumps supporters as part of a basket of deplorables which she defined as the racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic you name it At a time when Trump should have been further on the defensive contending with almost comically devastating revelations about his approach to charity more on that in a bit he is instead pulling even with his rival Rumors of Clintons failing healthwhich had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestratedhave become legitimate concerns Theres no use in discussing Clintons emails here at least for now Its not just that there are plenty of other outlets that will further beat that horseso much so that the Washington Post editorial page has hollered nuff Its that nothing weve learned is likely to move anyones opinion The general narrative out there whether thats fair or not is that Clinton is untrustworthy The bottom line in horserace terms is this the drumbeat persists Theres only slightly more use in dwelling on Trumps streak of good behavior Yes he has kept his impulses under control for a couple of weeks a nearmiracle especially given the rise to power of campaign chief Steve Bannon widely viewed as the high priest of fullfreak Trumping While Trump has said plenty of recent things to appall the soberminded like resurrecting a promise to steal the oil of any place we bother to invade he has said them calmly rather than in a way that makes news So this is an important development especially if Trump starts to notice how big a friend he has in silence But one ludicrous outburst changes that and those used to come at about one per cockcrow so well have to see if he can keep the lull going Unfortunately the nearcollapse of Clinton on Sunday from feeling overheatednow diagnosed as pneumoniadoes call for some sentences Clintons line about the basket of deplorables might have caused a blip but it has now been overshadowed The video of her seeming to buckle is terrible and heartrending and it feels almost indecent to witness But now the rumors of Clintons failing healthwhich had been easy to write off because they were so obviously orchestrated with help from Rudy Giuliani no lesshave become legitimate concerns Its easy to dismiss symptoms like extended coughing especially with a candidate who must endure countless hours and speeches on the campaign trail Its impossible to dismiss being overcome at a commemoration for 911 the sort of event during which every political bone in your body is telling you Do not make news Do not make news Do not make newsThe setting for Clintons overheating was especially unfortunate You could argue and I have that Clintons health doesnt matter that much politically because not many of those who favor her over Trumpa split viewed by many of Clintons supporters as akin in severity to God versus Satanwill suddenly prefer him instead But voters do think a lot about national security and if you believe Scott Adams When a wouldbe commanderinchief withersliterallyin front of our most emotional reminder of an attack on the homeland we feel unsafe Is Adams right He might beor at least right enough that two out of a hundred voters could change their minds which is all that it takes Clintons health problems are just the latest example of how fortune so often works in favor of Trump They hit just after the publication of a remarkable piece of reporting by The Washington Posts David A Fahrenthold who revealed that the candidates record of philanthropy seems to be close to nonexistent Apparently Trump is so pathologically stingy that even organizations to which he claimed to donate had received no money Worse his own family foundation took in nothing from Trump himself after 2008 relying instead on funds from outside donors Even worse Trump illegally redirected 25000 of the money toward the fundraising committee of Florida attorney general Pam Bondi who was deciding on whether to pursue a lawsuit against Trump University Even worse than that Donald Trump spent 20000 of his charitys money to purchase a sixfoottall painting ofmaybe you guessed itDonald Trump That would all be poor optics as they say except that news of Clintons health came in and dwarfed everything But lets suppose that investigations of Trumps charity come back to the fore as they probably will They will still have close to zero effect on most Trump supporters Those who still believe Trump is a benevolent fellow have already had to process several container ships full of cognitive dissonance and dont mind a few tons more Those who believe Trump is a nonbenevolent fellowand this includes many probably most of his supporters to judge by what they write and sayalready know hes a rascal They accept that The thing is hes their rascal For those who find such loyalty hard to understand or accept recall that Trump in the eyes of many voters is the only candidate who has bucked the bipartisan globalist consensus and seemed to mean it Just imagine if you were on the left but among both Democrats and Republicans running for office nearly everyone in political life had long expressed indifference to climate change and had views on abortion that ranged from strongly prolife to weakly prolife Then along came one candidate who loudly insisted on combatting global warming and fighting for a womans right to chose On the minus side he also said nasty things about coal miners and fetuses repelling everyone Would you be tempted to forgive himThis brings us finally to a muchdiscussed recent essay in the Claremont Review of Books called The Flight 93 Election written by one Publius Decius Mus Deciuswho writes as if he were born in 1850 meaning he was probably born well after 1980is one of those intellectuals who because of Trumps positions on immigration trade and war forgive Trump for his many sins The use of Flight 93 is an allusion of dubious taste to the hijacked plane in which passengers heroically charged the cockpit on 911the point being that Trump versus Clinton is possible death versus guaranteed death Yes Trump is worse than imperfect Decius writes So what We can lament until we choke the lack of a great statesman to address the fundamental issues of our time Decius has not been alone in his mindset Trump supporters know hes a uniquely risky candidate but they make the case for gambling on him all the sameno matter the poor track record of huge political rolls of the dice our recent wars come to mind They feel things are very bad and many Americans agree This is why Trump is again pulling even with Hillary Clinton Unfortunately we understand one another less and less across this divide One side says I know how bad you think things are out there but you have no idea how bad Trump is The other side says I know how bad you think Trump is but you have no idea how bad things are out there Its a conversation designed to fail leaving only hardened factions All that remains at this point is to wait and count up The polls while technically within the margin of error still favor Clinton Yet the energy on balance seems to favor Trump Even when John McCain briefly led Obama in 2008 he never attracted swooning and feverish supporters at least not when he wasnt addressing a hospital Obama did and Trump does Many Americans seem to want an excuse to vote for him and the rise of Bannon seems ironically to be leading to a more controlled candidate If he keeps cool and collected during the debates even if he calls for plundering the globes energy supplies he probably comes out ahead So no one can relax anymore On the plus side well enjoy the extra oil Full ScreenPhotos The Art of the Donald Alison Jackson Pictures Trumps Me Time The torch will be passed and a new leader must be capable of gripping it securely Will he prove equal to the challenge As commander in chief would the candidate use military force responsiblyand tastefully Above all success in the Oval Office requires an ability to sit still for long hours of exacting prep work America needs a leader who wont flinch under fire whether literal metaphoric or tonsorial There is not a black America or a white America or a Creamsiclehued America waterproof and evenly applied There is only a United States of America When the candidate looks in the mirror a president should stare back With newfound confidence he is now ready to fill Lincolns mittens
