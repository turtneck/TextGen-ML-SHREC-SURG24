It was the fall of 2001 and John Cornyn was getting ready to run for the US Senate when terrorists sent a jolt through the world and changed the politics of national security foreverI remember when my wife pointed  to the TV when the second plane hit the tower the Texas Republican now the Senates majority whip recalled Tuesday afternoonCongress swept into action approving a war resolution against terrorists and six weeks after the Sept 11 attacks the USA Patriot Act was introduced It passed the House by an overwhelming margin the next day It cleared the Senate the day after that with just one dissenting voteAlmost 14 years later the national security debate is completely different in both parties This week a leading Republican presidential candidate Sen Rand Paul Ky briefly shortcircuited the nations surveillance laws and then an overwhelming majority of senators including Cornyn voted Tuesday for a measure that would rein in portions of the once overwhelmingly popular Patriot ActI think its pretty stark Cornyn said before the final roll call comparing 2001 to 2015Congress turns away from post911 law retooling US surveillance powersA large bloc of Republicans whose ranks include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ky and Sen John McCain Ariz cling to the post911 ethos that surrendering a little bit of personal privacy is worth it if it gives authorities a chance to catch terrorists and avert another 911type disasterThirty of the 53 GOP senators who voted opposed the new less sweeping surveillance legislation  all but Paul on grounds that it was too weak But that group now realizes that it no longer controls the debate as it used toThat sense of urgency has clearly died off in the intervening years McCain said after the voteYet majority sentiment still remains far from Pauls civil libertarian vision of completely turning off the intricate system of pulling together metadata of phone texting and email and sifting through to find any terrorist connectionsInstead a bipartisan majority in Congress is now clearly on record supporting an aggressive spying culture just one that is a little more restrictive than the intelligence agencies would like and one with more judicial oversightAfter all McConnell and Paul both lost on Tuesday They voted against the USA Freedom Act one because he thought it was too weak and the other because he thought it preserved a culture of intrusive Big Brother governmentSen Patrick J Leahy DVt a lead sponsor of the new measure said the smartest thing he ever did was to find a likeminded conservative partner 14 years ago Richard K Armey RTex who was the House majority leader at the time willing to ensure that the Patriot Act included a timelimit mechanism that would force a review of the policiesWe wouldnt have the debate if Armey and I hadnt been able to form the coalition and put the sunsets in Leahy said TuesdayThat set up the first big review of the Patriot Act for the summer of 2005 but even then many of the actions being taken were still classified and reports about warrantless wiretapping by security agencies would not begin to emerge until late 2005 and early 2006 As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee Sen Richard J Durbin DIll remembered that he was barely allowed to speak about the amendments that he was offering in order to modify the very classified portions of the lawI couldnt even explain publicly what it was all about I had to say in the most general terms of principles what we were doing Durbin said TuesdayBy the spring of 2008 many details about the wiretapping program had broken into public view and Congress held a full debate about how to update the 1978 law that governed those actions the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA which established a special federal court to consider warrants for monitoring individuals overseasIntended as a curb against domestic spying  its original cosponsor was Edward M Kennedy DMass in 1977  critics considered it outdated more than 30 years laterThe drumbeat against the military and covert intelligence services complex seemed to hit a crescendo among Democrats that spring of 2008 ThenSen Barack Obama DIll used his opposition to the Iraq war as a wedge against thenSen Hillary Rodham Clinton DNY to secure the Democratic presidential nomination and Rep Nancy Pelosi DCalif had become the most liberal House speaker in historyStill even then after much debate with the Bush White House Obama and Pelosi threw their support behind only slight modifications to FISA which protected the telecommunications companies from the threat of lawsuits for turning over data to spy agenciesThat bill passed by very similar margins to this years legislation 293 votes in the House in 2008 and 338 last month 69 votes in the Senate in 2008 and 67 on TuesdayJust as McConnell found himself the odd man out this week Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid DNev the majority leader in 2008 was on the sidelines then protesting from the left against the rewrite of the FISA bill Reid voted against the bill which the other leading Democrats of the day endorsedThat 2008 debate may have been the beginning of the bipartisan coalition that triumphed on Tuesday but first it had to withstand the early wave of antigovernment tea party activismThe biggest threat to enhanced powers for the intelligence community came in a series of wave elections huge Democratic victories in 2006 and 2008 based on deep antiwar sentiments and sizable Republican gains in 2010 fueled by belief that the federal government needed to be reined inThat sequence of events created a large bloc of libertarianminded Democrats and Republicans in Congress and in early 2011 just weeks into his tenure running the House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio and his leadership team got its first lesson that todays Republicans arent reflexively hawksSome Patriot Act provisions were expiring but Boehners team considered them so noncontroversial that their renewal was put on the fasttrack calender no debate no amendments and more than twothirds majority required for approval in much the same way post offices are namedInstead the bill did not win the needed supermajority and the embarrassed Boehner leadership team had to pass it under normal rules days laterIn the past two years however the emergence of two crucial players have collided to alter the debate Edward Snowden and the Islamic State Snowden a former National Security Agency contractor revealed to The Washington Post and Britains the Guardian newspaper in 2013 just how vast the NSAs collection of bulk data was sweeping up millions of connections among Americans with no ties to terroristsThe revelations drew deep outrage from the public but then in late 2014 Islamic State forces began their advance in Syria and Iraq punctuated by a series of beheadings of hostages that included US citizens The public was much more focused on national security issues again and the unease was only heightened by terrorist attacks in Europe by radical extremists That push and pull set the dynamic for the debate the past monthSnowdens argument is that government has gone too far the ISIS argument is how far does government need to go to protect us Durbin said That is the tensionFor now that tension has created what many consider a bipartisan middle ground but plenty of lawmakers worry that the ground could shift againSecurity really is on peoples minds these days Sen Rob Portman ROhio who faces reelection in 2016 and opposed Tuesdays vote and it will be for a long time because I dont think the threats going to go away
