Far fewer veterans than expected are taking advantage of a new law aimed at making it easier for them to get private health care and avoid the long waits that have plagued Department of Veterans Affairs facilities nationwideOnly 27000 veterans have made appointments for private medical care since the VA started mailing out Choice Cards in November the VA said in a report to Congress this month The number is so small compared to the 86 million cards that have been mailed out that VA Secretary Robert McDonald wants authority to redirect some of the 10 billion Congress allocated for the program to boost care for veterans at the VAs 970 hospitals and clinicsRepublicans and Democrats insist the problem is the department and that it needs to do a better job promoting the choice program They also want to change a quirk in the law that makes it hard for some veterans in rural areas to prove they live at least 40 miles from a VA health siteThe government measures the distance as the crow flies rather than by driving miles leaving thousands of veterans ineligibleVeterans put their lives on the line to defend this country The very least we can do is ensure they dont have to jump through hoops to receive the care they need and have earned said Sen Jon Tester DMont whose vast state has just one VA hospitalThe choice program was a key component of last years sweeping law approved in response to reports that dozens of veterans died while waiting for appointments at a VA hospital in Phoenix and that appointment records were manipulated to hide the delays A series of government reports said workers throughout the country falsified wait lists while supervisors looked the other way resulting in chronic delays for veterans seeking care and bonuses for managers who falsely appeared to meet ontime goalsThe law signed by President Barack Obama in August allows veterans who have waited more than 30 days for an appointment to get VApaid care from a local doctor It also allows veterans who live at least 40 miles from a VA hospital or clinic to get private care and makes it easier to fire VA employees accused of wrongdoingThe choice program expands an existing program that allows veterans to get outside care for emergencies or procedures not available at the VA Veterans have long complained about waiting months or even years to be reimbursed for private care and many are skeptical the choice card will alleviate those problems despite promises by the VAI dont believe any of us thought that there would be a wholesale rush to leave the VA system at all but we are still early in the program Rep Jeff Miller RFla chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee told reporters during a recent tour of the VAMcDonalds bid to shift the money has met a bipartisan wall of opposition in Congress where leaders said the landmark law they adopted last summer to overhaul VA has not been fully implemented Taking money away from the choice program just three months after it was launched is premature even irresponsible lawmakers and veterans advocates saidMiller called the plan a complete nonstarter His Senate counterpart Johnny Isakson RGa called it unacceptable And Sen John McCain RAriz one of the laws chief authors said Congress not only would reject the idea but refuse to even consider itConnecticut Sen Richard Blumenthal the senior Democrat on the Senate veterans panel said in an interview he would oppose any reallocation of funds so long as there are delays and issues with quality of care at VAMcDonald counters that the proposal which has not been formally submitted to Congress would help ensure that every veteran receives the care they have earned and deserve regardless of where they choose to get it fromMcDonald who took over as VA secretary in July said he never intended to gut the choice program or somehow eliminate it Instead he said he simply seeks the kind of budget flexibility he enjoyed as Procter  Gamble CEOImagine your household You are hungry but you cant move the money from the gasoline account to the food account Well that is the situation I face he said at a Feb 11 budget hearing before the House Veterans Affairs CommitteeLouis Celli director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation at The American Legion the largest veterans service organization called McDonalds explanation disingenuousDraining funds from the bill shortcircuits the program and ultimately hurts vets Celli said noting that VA officials had pushed for the choice program as a shortterm way to expand patient access to careRep Tim Huelskamp RKan said a veteran in his rural district drives 340 miles oneway for cardiology treatment at a VA hospital in Kansas CityIf the VA choice program cant provide something closer for him then we need to relook at how we are implementing that Huelskamp told McDonald at the Feb 11 hearingMcDonald said VA officials are willing to look at the 40mile rule to see if it needs to be changed The VA is committed to doing all it can to make sure the program is robust he said
