With Donald Trump closing in on the Republican nomination in Indiana today there is a new wave of fingerpointing to assess blame for this allegedly horrible outcomeAnd those who fault the media are having one last hurrahNowhere is this more evident than on the cover of Politico Magazine which features Trump facing a media mob with the headline What Have We DoneIts a study in selfflagellation this argument that Trump would not be where he is today without being propped up by the press Many of his detractors refuse to acknowledge that a nonpolitician is winning this thing by getting a record number of GOP primary votes so the thing must be rigged by reportersPoliticos special media issue is so packed with antiTrump essays that there is little attempt at balance One exception is media writer Jack Shafter who says the blame game gives too much credit to the media and too little credit to Donald TrumpBut then theres reporter Ben Schreckinger who became the fulltime Trump correspondent despite the fact that working for Politico is his first job out of college Perhaps thats why he is so angry at criticism from Trump and his deputies and a lack of access both of which are standard fare in the political big leaguesFormer New York Post gossip writer Susan Mulcahy argues that Trump used to lie to her and once gave a scoop to the New York Times rather than confirm it to herBut the most important article is by Campbell Brown the former CNN and NBC anchor who I like and respect Why I Blame TV for TrumpNow you have to factor in that Brown cannot abide Trump She calls him a chronic liar a misogynist shockingly ignorant and a man who condones violence So this is the writing of an outspoken criticBrown says TV news is rolling over for The Donald Trump doesnt force the networks to show his rallies live rather than do real reporting Nor does he force anyone to accept his phone calls rather than demand that he do a facetoface interview that would be a greater risk for him TV news has largely given Trump editorial control It is driven by a hunger for ratingsand the people who run the networks and the news channels are only too happy to make that Faustian bargainThis aside from the business about real reporting is a fair point Trumps rallies got so much more live coverage than any of his competitors that it gave him an unfair advantageBrown misses the old 800pound gorillas of TV news like Tom Brokaw who could push back against commercial decisions But of course the broadcast networks dont cover politics in a major way and have ceded that turf to cableSo yes I believe Trumps candidacy is largely a creation of a TV media that wants him or needs him to be the central character in this years political drama she writes And its not just the network and cable executives driving it The TV anchors and senior executives who dont deliver are mercilessly ousted The ones who do deliver are lavishly rewarded I know from personal experience that it is common practice for TV anchors to have substantial bonuses written into their contracts if they hit ratings marks With this 2016 presidential soap opera they are almost surely hitting those marks So we get all Trump all the timeHeres what Brown who candidly admitted she left CNN because she couldnt match the ratings of Fox and MSNBC is missingTrump has seized much of the free air time by doing many many more interviews than his rivals and by driving the campaign dialoguewhich all candidates try to do but are usually too cautious or dull to pull offMany reporters have dug hard into Trumps businesses his rhetoric his promises his contradictionsbut these stories and segments have done little to dent his lead He is seemingly impervious to most media criticism in part because his supporters dont trust the press but its not for lack of tryingA huge portion of the media attention lavished on Trump is harshly negative often from conservative and liberal commentators who oppose him on ideological grounds Trump punches back hard especially on Twitter though hes toned it down of late The billionaire actually benefits from denunciations by those his supporters view as members of a failed mediapolitical establishmentAnd dont forget how the Huffington Post and New Yorks Daily News have demonized Trump from the beginning or all the mainstream media pundits who spent months insisting he was a sideshow that he would fade that this or that controversial remark would produce his imminent demiseThere is much to criticize in the medias coverage of Donald Trump But to say the media were the engine that powered his candidacy is to miss the way he overpowered his rivals and forged a connection with millions of Republican votersHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
