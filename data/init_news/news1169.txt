Why Obama Has His Work Cut Out For Him On Getting Trade VotesThe Obama administration finds itself in the rare position of fighting alongside House Republicans this week as it tries to overcome Fridays stinging defeat to its massive trade package the TransPacific PartnershipThe defeat came when Speaker John Boehner split the presidents agenda that passed the Senate in May into two parts one was Trade Promotion Authority also known as fasttrack  a law that allows Obama to negotiate the deal then have Congress pass it with an upordown vote with no debate The other was Trade Adjustment Assistance a safety net aimed at retraining any US workers who might lose their jobs as a result of the new trade packageThe simplified version of what happened is this Democrats really like TAA Republicans like TPA Boehner split them into separate votes hoping Dems and Republicans would vote for the respective parts they liked The Obama administration really needs TPA to negotiate the trade deal and so to torpedo the whole deal Democrats voted down the worker assistance package in huge numbersSo now theres nothing to do but wait The House voted today to give themselves until July 30 to get the votes they need to get the package passed And by the numbers its clear that Obama and the House GOP have their work cut out for them in procuring those votesIn an extremely polarized Congress thats an unusually haphazardlooking mix of votes To understand exactly who voted how and why weve broken the vote down into four groupsNo on both 143 Democrats 49 RepublicansWho they are Liberal democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and conservative RepublicansWhat it means The Democrats that have tended to be against TPP have also tended to be more liberal Dems  like Marylands Donna Edwards and Minnesotas Keith Ellison  who have no problem breaking with President Obama This group of House Dems are so against TPP that they were willing to sink TAA a policy Dems tend to like The other thing that makes this group notable Its huge  143 Democrats voted no on both parts of a deal the administration badly wants to pass The question is how many if any Obama can peel away from this group given that Rep Pelosi herself House minority leader was willing to break with himThe Republicans on this side meanwhile include many members of the House Freedom Caucus the group of lawmakers trying to swing their leaderships agenda even further to the right like Idahos Raul Labrador and Michigans Justin Amash These Republicans who voted against the trade agenda have given a mix of reasons  theyre concerned about jobs they think the deal is too secretive and they simply dont want to give Obama more power for exampleYes on both 27 Democrats 81 RepublicansWho they are ProTPP Republicans Obama allies and members in centrist contested districtsWhat it means This group includes Republican Rep Paul Ryan one of the loudest supporters of TPP over the last few months Among the few Democrats was Debbie Wasserman Schultz chair of the Democratic National Committee falling in line behind Obama and more centrist Dems like Texas Henry Cuellar and Californias Jim Costa It also notably contains a few lawmakers facing tough reelection challenges from the other party next year  Nebraska Democrat Brad Ashford and Republicans Carlos Curbelo of Florida Iowas Rod Blum and Illinois Bob Dold Voting for both TPA and TAA may be a way for these lawmakers to show theyre capable of reaching out across the aisleThis group also notably includes some Democrats  Kathleen Rice of New York and Ami Bera of California  who took heat from labor for their support Labor ran ads in those states slamming those lawmakers even saying they didnt mind if a Republican won in Beras district as Politico reportedNo on worker assistance yes on fasttrack 1 Democrat 109 RepublicansWho they are John Boehner and the largest chunk of RepublicansWhat it means Theres a reason virtually no Democrats save Texas Ruben Hinojosa voted this way  this is the vote for what Republicans wanted and against the Democratfriendly portion of the bill Republicans have in the past viewed TAA as an expensive ineffective necessary evil for getting trade deals passed as AEIs Alex Brill wrote after the vote These are the lawmakers who took the opportunity to make it clear they see TAA as unnecessaryYes on worker assistance no on fasttrack 13 Democrats 5 RepublicansWho they are Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and a dozen other Dems plus a few moderate RepublicansWhat it means This tiny Democratdominated group did what Boehner had expected many Dems would do  they took the opportunity to vote for worker assistance and against Trade Promotion Authority thinking that even if a trade deal they didnt like passed they would at least be supporting the policy they do likeNow theres potentially a month and a half for Obama and proTPP Republicans to try to get the votes they need on TAA But not everyone is optimistic As Maryland Democratic Rep and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday Theres more time now Now whether theres  six weeks thats what were talking about six seven weeks approximately  whether theres sufficient time to bridge the gaps is probably questionable
