Why isnt the Democratic Party landsliding the worst and cruelest Republican Party in the past 162 yearsJust take a glance at their record votes and youll wonder why the Republican representatives dont just incorporate themselves and be done with any pretense that they are real peopleA brief look at a compilation of Republican votes during the years 20112012 when the Republicans controlled the House demonstrates that they regularly choose Wall Street over Main Street drug and oil banking and insurance companies over consumers And that Republicans want tiny enforcement budgets against corporate crime to assure that hundreds of billions of your health and other consumer dollars are not recovered from the corporate criminals 60 billion a year alone in business frauds on MedicareRepeatedly these Republicans often a unanimous 100 of them in a bizarre kind of corporateconditioned response vote in favor of corporations shipping American jobs overseas rather than voting to protect American workers This Republicancontrolled congress was intent on defending and increasing massive tax breaks for the wealthiest at the expense of the lower income families attacking Medicare social security and other programs assisting elderly Americans even assaulting womens health and safety opposing stronger food safety enforcement and preventing toxic pollution controls while at the same time protecting rapacious student loan companies and keeping victims of mortgage companies and banks defenseless against onslaughts of insurmountable debt accumulationThey also passed a bill to pay members of Congress during a GOPled government shutdown however while refusing to guarantee that soldiers would get paid during the same shutdown Moreover the Republicans have this strange antagonism toward encouraging more people to vote and assuring that every vote countsGo past the faade of the Republican rhetoric praising heroic veterans are their grim votes against protecting veterans from ripoffs as borrowers for their consumer education and housing needsFast forward to the last two years and youll find the same corporatist grip on the House Fifteen times House Republicans have voted for measures attacking womens health blocked all votes on comprehensive immigration reform gave the back of their hand against childrens wellbeing twice voted unanimously against affirming that climate change is real and passed tax cuts of which 996 percent go to the richest 1 percent of Americans Furthermore they have voted unanimously against even considering a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courts 54 Citizens United decision that opened the floodgates of big corporate money in elections They continue to protect secret money in elections and twice voted against even allowing a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act giving women new tools for equal pay for equal workOne hundred percent of all House Republicans voted against allowing a vote to let American workers earn just seven jobprotected paid sick days each year  less than has been given for years in westernEuropean countriesSo in hock are they to the student loan industry the Republicans have repeatedly voted against bringing up for a vote the student loan refinancing bill One hundred percent of House Republicans voted against even bringing up a bill to stop big companies from dumping their US charter and fleeing abroad to avoid paying their fair share of taxes Leadpoisoned children in Flint Michigan got the straightarm by 236 House Republicans Republicans held zero hearings in 2016 on the presidents 2017 budget  an unheard of breach of legislative dutyHouse Republicans in recent years have stupidly cut the IRS budget facilitating 400 billion of uncollected taxes each year thereby swelling the federal deficit that the GOP is supposed to care about The Republicans are knowingly complicit in protecting tax evasionWorse these Republicans are complicit in shielding over 330 billion each year in computerized billing fraud This corporate crime wave estimate comes from the leading expert on billing fraud Harvard Professor Malcolm Sparrow author of License to Steal  backed by an earlier report from the Government Accountability Office of the Congress There simply is too little budget for adequate investigators and prosecutors even when every dollar in enforcement brings about ten dollars in recoveries and finesWhy doesnt all of this antihuman record make news First these bills are almost always blocked by the Democrats in the Senate Second many of these votes by the House Republicans are blocking votes to require ontherecord roll call votes that show each members position on a bill Third lets be clear the media which has reporters swarming all over Capitol Hill is not doing its jobFourth there arent a tiny fraction of the civically active people back home organized to publicize the votes by their member of Congress Fifth the lack of dynamic leadership by Congressional Democrats included being rolled by a Republican strategy to up the GOPs advantage in the number of gerrymandered districts in 2010 brilliantly reported in David Daleys new book Ratfked The True Story Behind The Secret Plan to Steal Americas Democracy In the final analysis the blame is on the Democratic Party that does not give us a competitive election process over substantive matters uppermost in the minds of the American people It took strenuous demands by some civic leaders in Washington DC just to get the House Democrats to compile these aforementioned Republican votes and passively release them in a concise form to the public and then only a month before the November elections With few exceptions Democrats astonishingly do not campaign on such a base Republican misery indexUnfortunately many Democratic candidates are dialing for the same campaign dollars as their Republican opponents and many Democratic incumbent candidates are ensconced in safe noncompetitive electoral districts often because of their gerrymandering Consequently they dont make an effort to show the callousness and cruelty of the Republican PartyFor any further explanation of this Democratic Partys dysfunctional indifference to winning back the House of Representatives based on the abysmal record of the Republican Party call in some social psychologists specializing in group machoismTo see the
