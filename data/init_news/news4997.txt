Hillary Spent 25 Million from Clinton Foundation on Private Jets   by Martin Armstrong Bob Woodard  the journalist who broke the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon to resign has come out to say that Hillarys Clinton Foundation is corrupt and a scandal Hillary said she will continue the Clinton Foundation if president meaning she would continue taking money from foreign governments no doubt While the IRS documents show Hillary took in 500 million taxfree she only paid out 75 million in charity and 25 million was spent traveling chartered jets As long as she claims she went somewhere to talk to someone all of her expenses are taxfree I travel the world and have not spent even a halfmillion on travel Of course I am not hiring private jets
