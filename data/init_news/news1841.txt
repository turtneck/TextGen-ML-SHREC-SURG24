Washington CNN President Barack Obama will try to reassure a nervous nation on Sunday that he has a plan to defeat the fastevolving threat of terrorism as fears multiply of ISIS attacks on the homeland and public trust in his handling of the threat has dipped to record lowsObamas rare 8 pm ET Oval Office address reflects growing anxiety that the global showdown with the extremist group has now spread to US soil following a mass shooting in San Bernardino California  that authorities are treating as terrorismHis appearance comes at a time of public disquiet over terrorism and a political debate over the threat now consuming the 2016 campaign  raging at levels not seen since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001  Obama has also struggled to convince critics he has a viable strategy for destroying ISIS in the Middle East and has been accused of downplaying the threat from the group for political reasonsObama will use Sunday nights address to pledge to use of every available tool to keep American people safe and destroy ISIS senior administration official saysThe gravity of the occasion is underscored by Obamas decision to use the symbolic power of the Oval Office for only the third time in his presidency following addresses on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the end of the Iraq war in 2010In a new CNNORC poll released on Sunday 60 of Americans disapproved of Obamas handling of terrorism  up nine points since May Two thirds of those polled meanwhile said they disapproved of the presidents handling of ISISThe poll was conducted before the attacks in San Bernardino and also showed a shift in public opinion on how to tackle the group  with a majority  53  for the first time saying the US should send ground troops to fight ISIS And 68 said the American response to the groups rise had not been sufficiently aggressiveThose figures reflect Obamas struggle so far to convince critics he has a viable strategy for destroying ISIS in its selfdeclared caliphate in Iraq and Syria and after he has been accused of downplaying the threat from the group for political reasonsThe figures tracked with a a Washington PostABC News poll last month after an ISIS rampage in Paris but also before the California attack that found that a record low of 40 of Americans approved of Obamas handling of terrorism and only 35He will reiterate his firm conviction that ISIL will be destroyed and that the United States will draw upon our values  our unwavering commitment to justice equality and freedom  to prevail over terrorist groups that use violence to advance a destructive ideology said White House spokesman Josh EarnestSundays address also seems to be an implicit acknowledgment that Obama has failed to convince Americans that he is prepared to take on the ISIS threat amid widespread criticism of his strategy and rhetoric on the issue that keeps being overtaken by eventsRepublicans have redoubled attacks following the California killings to fire up a hawkish party base ahead of early nominating contests and to suggest that Obamas policy isnt working and that the president does not understand the threatWhy on earth did the Obama administration not know this ahead of time and stop them before they carried out this terror attack Cruz said of the California shootingMoving forward this is not going to be the last attempt to attack the homeland Rubio saidPeople are dead A lot of people are dead right now Trump said on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday So everybody wants to be politically correct and thats part of the problem that we have with our countryThe real estate mogul also said he would live tweet the Presidents addressOther candidates have warned the United States is in a war of civilizations with radical Islam and that a new world war has reached US soilSuch political fury complicates Obamas effort to ease public fears of terrorism and to build support to confront two critical problems  the expanding battle against ISIS and its evolving tactics and his own political vulnerabilities on the issueHis speech comes at an alarming momentTerrorism experts are warning that the San Bernardino attack could be the harbinger of a much more acute threat to US soilMore of what we can expectUnfortunately I think it is more of what we can expect in the future  whether it is copy cats or whether you have again either ISISaligned or inspired or ISISdirected individuals said Dean Alexander director of the Homeland Security Research Program at Western Illinois University It might instigate ISIS to take a more proactive approach to send individuals here to the US or to try to recruitSuch a self radicalization scenario by Muslims on US soil has long been feared by antiterrorism experts who say such attacks are nearly impossible for the administration to detect and stopBut critics say he has consistently underplayed the threat from ISIS because its rise conflicts with his assurances that he has severely degraded the threat from global terror  a key legacy issue as he nears the end of his second termInstead of being contained theyre conducting or inspiring spectacular terrorist operations on multiple continents  including now in the United States ISIS affiliates are spreading across the Middle East and south AsiaUnder increasing pressure to toughen his rhetoric Obama is also likely to use his address to counter claims the United States is somehow at war with Islam itselfThey cant beat us on the battlefield so they try to terrorize us into being afraid and changing our patterns of behavior and panicking and abandoning our allies and partners and retreating from the world Obama said at a press conference in Malaysia last monthNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie rejected the idea that Muslims would be offended by the use of specific terminology to describe the threatNow when you say radical Islamic jihadist they understand the rest of the Muslim community understands Christie said on Face the NationBut Clinton said on ABC News This Week that throwing around such terms actually helped the extremistsIt helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying We are in a war against the West  you must join us she saidWe must never accept the premise that they put forward because it is a lie Obama said in FebruaryNor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek They are not religious leaders They are terrorists
