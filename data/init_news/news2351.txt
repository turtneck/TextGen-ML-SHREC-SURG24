WASHINGTON  In a move that could alter the minimum wage debate and improve the image of the worlds largest retailer Walmart announced it will raise the baseline wage of its current store employees to 10 per hour bringing pay hikes to an estimated 500000 workersThe company said in an announcement on Thursday that it would raise its wage floor to 9 in April followed by a second boost to 10 by next FebruaryThe decision follows similar moves by other major retailers such as Gap and IKEA but the sheer size of Walmart sets the company apart The Arkansasbased retailer is the largest privatesector employer in the US with an estimated 14 million employees and it is largely seen as a trendsetter in the retail industryOverall these are strategic investments in our people to reignite the sense of ownership they have in our stores McMillon said As a result we firmly believe that our customers will benefit from a better store experience which can drive higher sales and returns for our shareholders over timeRight now we want to make sure everybody is crystal clear on how vital our store experience is for our future McMillon added in a later CNBC interview Customers need to be served and associates need to be happy and love their jobAccording to a Walmart spokesman the new wage floors will apply to current employees New hires next year will be earning at least 9 but will be bumped up to at least 10 per hour after roughly six months of trainingIn the CNBC interview McMillon suggested that the improving US economy  with unemployment falling recently to 57 percent from a peak of 10 percent after the recession  was also pressuring Walmart to raise wagesIts great to see the job market getting better and the market works so were adjusting to that market he saidWalmart has long been saddled with a reputation as a lowwage employer and its battles with labor unions  in particular the United Food and Commercial Workers union  stretch back decades In recent years labor groups have organized highprofile worker strikes to coincide with the companys Black Friday shopping events pillorying the retailer over its pay practicesThe acrosstheboard pay hikes should help rehabilitate that image They will probably also help Walmart improve customer service in its stores Over the past two years bare shelves in Walmart supercenters have become a common sight A report from a research firm last year traced the troubles in part to a lack of investment in the companys laborWe know that this wouldnt have happened without our work to stand together with hundreds of thousands of supporters to change the countrys largest employer Emily Wells an OUR Walmart member said in a statement Thursday from the group Wells said shes currently earning 950 per hour and will now see a raise though she added that workers still face erratic schedulingA 10 wage would still leave many workers and their families below the poverty line but its well above the 725 federal minimum wage that still prevails in states without a higher oneThe fact that Walmart is raising its base wage could help lawmakers in Congress in their push to raise the federal wage floor which hasnt been raised since 2009 Democrats have proposed hiking it to 1010 per hour and tying it to an inflation index but Republicans in both chambers have blocked the measure from moving forwardIt is encouraging that the nations largest employer Walmart has recognized what Republicans in Congress fail to acknowledge that 725 is significantly too low an hourly wage for any American worker said Drew Hammill spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif We hope that this move will help convince Republicans to stop blocking efforts to raise the wageWith Congress gridlocked many states have moved ahead with raises to their own minimum wages with a slate of ballot measures passing in the November elections For the first time ever a majority of states now have a higher minimum wage than the federal level
