The leading Republican presidential candidates clashed sharply over immigration policy military spending and other intractable and emotional issues in a debate here Tuesday night bringing into sharp relief the partys fault line between rigid conservatism and mainstream practicalityThe twohour debate spotlighted the rift between the outsider candidates and establishment governors over how strictly to enforce immigration laws and whether to provide a pathway to legal status for the countrys more than 11 million undocumented immigrants or deport themIt also revived a longsimmering dispute over the size and role of the US military with Sen Rand Paul Ky warning of the potential adverse fiscal effects of increased defense spending and Sens Marco Rubio Fla and Ted Cruz Tex advocating a more muscular American military presence in the worldOverall however it was a relatively cerebral affair In a marked departure from the three previous debates Tuesdays questions prodded the candidates to explain their positions on such substantive issues as tax policy the minimum wage and trade treaties rather than draw contrasts with one anotherLittle attention was paid to the personal attacks that have shaped the race in recent weeks On the campaign trail billionaire Donald Trump has harshly assailed Ben Carson as the retired neurosurgeon rose in the polls but Trump refrained from hitting his fellow frontrunner on the debate stageSimilarly former Florida governor Jeb Bush whose attack on Rubio backfired at the Oct 28 debate did not strike his onetime protege on Tuesday night Instead he focused his rhetoric on President Obama and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton delivering a few punchy answers in a performance that was not dominant but was more energetic than his earlier lackluster showingsA lengthy discussion of immigration stood out as a proxy for a debate over how Republicans can win back the White House after eight years in the wilderness under the banner of pure and principled conservatism or with a moderated platform designed to broaden the GOPs appeal to Latinos and other minoritiesTrump forcefully defended thecontroversial proposal that has fueled his candidacy since summer in which he would deport all undocumented immigrants and construct a wall along the border with Mexico to keep them outWe are a country of laws we need borders we will have a wall the wall will be built the wall will be successful and if you think walls dont work all you have to do is ask Israel said the former realitytelevision star The wall will work properly done Believe meThat drew a quick retort from Ohio Gov John Kasich who had been spoiling for a fight and repeatedly interrupted the questioning of other candidates to give his opinionsFor the 11 million people come on folks we all know we cant pick them up and ship them across the border Kasich said Its a silly argument Its not an adult argumentTrump then interjected with a taunt at Bush You should let Jeb speakIn early debate two governors clash over conservative recordsAnd the former Florida governor did just that arguing that deporting illegal immigrants is in conflict with American values and would tear families and communities apart Bush warned ofthe electoral consequences should the GOP nominee campaign with Trumps positionTheyre doing highfives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this Bush said Thats the problem with this We have to win the presidency and the way you win the presidency is to have practical plansSoon after Brian Fallon a Clinton campaign spokesman tweeted We actually are doing highfives right nowCruz however sided with Trump If Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty we will lose the senator from Texas saidCruz said that for many voters illegal immigration is a very personal economic issue and he added Were tired of being told its antiimmigrant Its offensive I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba to seek the American Dream and we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of lawTuesdays debate the fourth so far in the Republican race was hosted by Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal before a live audience at a historic theater in downtown MilwaukeeThere were eight candidates in the main debate  the smallest group to share the big stage so far  as national polling averages winnowed the top tier New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee were relegated for the first time to an earlier undercard debate where both faced sharp attacks from Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal over their records on fiscal policy and other issuesThe Take Candidates set aside personal attacks to address economicsFor the moderators the event brought added scrutiny in the wake of the Oct 28 debate in Boulder Colo which was a chaotic affair CNBCs moderators were sharply criticized for the tone and personal nature of their questioning and the candidates felt they were being baited to attack one another rather than asked about substanceFrom the outset of Tuesday nights debate the moderators sought to set a different tone Comoderator Neil Cavuto said the focus of the debate would be the economy and what each of you would do to improve it No more no lessThe first questions were about Democratic proposals to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour There are varying views within the Republican Party about the minimum wage with 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney among those supporting an increase which polls show is widely popularBut Trump and Carson said they would not raise it arguing an increase would inhibit job growthTaxes too high wages too high Trump said Were not going to be able to compete against the world I hate to say it but we have to leave it the way it is People have to go out they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratumCarson said Every time we raise the minimum wage the number of jobless people increases especially among black people He said the better question is How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependentKasich who has raised the minimum wage in Ohio took a more moderate approach Economic theory is fine he said but you know what People need helpLater in the evening an extended series of questions about the candidates tax plans sparked a fight between Rubio and Paul over the size of the military and defense budgetI know Rand is a committed isolationist Im not Rubio said earning loud cheers from the crowd I know that the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the worldPaul persisted warning that the country could ill afford to spend more money on the military I want a strong national defense But I dont want us to be bankruptCruz interjected siding with Rubio You think defending this nation is expensive Try not defending it Thats a lot more expensiveFormer business executive Carly Fiorina also delivered tough lines about the military and the United States role in Syria but she also accused Trump of bluster when he talked about his past associations with Russian President Vladimir PutinAt one point Trump snapped Why does she keep interrupting everybodyThe crowd booed loudly but unlike in previous debates Fiorina did not respond to TrumpMeanwhile Carson  who has built a powerful following among grassroots conservatives with his softspoken approach  faced virtually no scrutiny from the moderators or fellow candidates over the veracity of his personal narrative which has been the subject of recent media investigationsWhen Cavuto asked Carson whether the scrutiny was engulfing his campaign Carson seemed pleased to have the chance to clear the airThank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade Carson said We should vet all candidates I have no problem with being vetted What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truthHe added People who know me know that Im an honest person
