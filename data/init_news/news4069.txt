Some of the biggest donors and fundraisers in the Republican Party still uncertain who should get their support in 2016 are sprinkling their money around a presidential field that grows by the dayThe largesse born of their indecision has a notable exception Rand PaulThe Kentucky senator has aggressively tried to raise money around his effort to curtail the surveillance powers of the National Security Agency emailing supporters and posting messages on social media imploring people to celebrate this victory with their cashIn doing so hes exacerbated the perception among some of the GOPs most generous donors that his positions on foreign policy make him an unacceptable choice for the White House This is especially so to those who consider an aggressive posture abroad and support for Israel paramountI do not know of a single person in Mitt Romneys donor network who will be with Rand Paul said Phil Rosen a Manhattan attorney and top fundraiser for the 2012 Republican nominee Rosen said he met with Paul and politely told him he wouldnt be supporting him because of his isolationist and libertarian policiesRosen hasnt settled on his choice in next years primary contest but expects to decide soon from a short list Other prominent donors are doing the same with some willing to give money to multiple candidates in the early stages of the campaign but not to PaulAmong them Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson New York hedge fund pioneer Michael Steinhardt and Ken Abramowitz founder of a venture capital firm in New York All three have given money to South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham who announced his presidential campaign on Monday by saying he wants to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill usThose donors like many of the Republican Partys biggest spenders are looking for the strongest candidate on foreign policy especially on the protection of Israel Thats become the centerpiece of not only Grahams campaign but also is a featured aspect of the bids of Florida Sen Marco Rubio and Texas Sen Ted CruzGraham in particular has a terrific record in Congress and is experienced and articulate said Steinhardt who is also giving to former New York Gov George Pataki and former Arkansas Gov Mike HuckabeeThe weight of donor opposition to Paul hit his campaign soon after he launched it in April when a politically active nonprofit the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America began a 1 million television advertising campaign against him in the four early primary states The nonprofit can raise unlimited money and is not legally required to disclose its donorsSeveral other groups are prepared to pounce on Paul if they sense he is gaining traction in the race Among them is a group led by John Bolton a former ambassador to the United Nations who recently decided against running himself but plans to push for strong national security policies from the sidelinesIve spoken to well over 1000 major Republican donors and can remember only one who agreed with Rand Paul on foreign policy Bolton said The views he represents are a tiny tiny minority within the Republican PartyUnlike several of the other Republican candidates for president Paul doesnt have an obvious billionaire  or group of billionaires  backing his campaign as New Jersey Gov Chris Christie does with Home Depot founder Ken Langone and Rubio does in car dealer Norman BramanCampaigning in South Carolina last week when he spoke about his fight against renewing the NSAs authority to collect Americans phone records in bulk Paul said he isnt concerned about the big donors lining up against him But he said he wouldnt turn down their moneyIf you know some billionaires and you want to send them our way were happy to talk to them Paul said Its more about votes than it is about dollars and I think were going to have plenty of money to competePaul said hes counting on smalldollar donations raised primarily online the kind hes tried to drum up during the debate that has resulted in at least the temporary suspension of the NSAs authority to collect Americans calling recordsHes attracted enthusiasm outside the usual Republican circles particularly from collegeaged voters with a distaste for military engagement and others who put civil liberties at the forefront of their concernsRepublican pollster Frank Luntz who isnt aligned with any 2016 candidate said what Paul lacks in traditional deeppocketed donor enthusiasm he could make up for in smaller contributorsHes not going to have a traditional campaign because hes not going to be a traditional candidate Luntz said That comes with advantages and disadvantagesPauls campaign said it raised more than 1 million online in his first 24 hours as a candidate but wouldnt say how much it has raised around the NSA issue It will report on its finances next month
