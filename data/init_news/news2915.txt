Ask him and hell tell you himself Im very optimistic he says SeeAnd why shouldnt Bill Gates be an optimist Hes one of the richest men in the world He basically invented the form of personal computing that dominated for decades He runs a foundation immersed in the worlds worst problems  child mortality malaria polio  but he can see them getting better Hell he can measure them getting better Child mortality hasfallen by half since 1990 To him optimism is simply realismBut lately Gates has been obsessing over a dark question whats likeliest to kill more than 10 million human beings in the next 20 years He ticks off the disaster movie stuff  big volcanic explosion gigantic earthquake asteroid  but says the more he learns about them the more he realizes the probability is very lowThen theres war of course But Gates isnt that worried about war because the entire human race worries about war pretty much all the time and the most dangerous kind of war nuclear war seems pretty contained at least for nowBut theres something out there thats as bad as war something that kills as many people as war and Gates doesnt think were ready for itLook at the death chart of the 20th century he says because hes the kind of guy that looks at death charts I think everybody would say there must be a spike for World War I Sure enough there it is like 25 million And there must be a big spike for World War II and there it is its like 65 million But then youll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I and most people would say What was thatWell that was the Spanish fluNo one can say we werent warned And warned And warned A pandemic disease is the most predictable catastrophe in the history of the human race if only because it has happened to the human race so many many times beforeIn a 1990 paper on The Anthropology of Infectious Disease Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown estimated that infectious diseases have likely claimed more lives than all wars noninfectious diseases and natural disasters put together Infectious diseases are our oldest deadliest foeAnd they remain so today In a good year flu kills over 10000 Americans says Dr Thomas Frieden director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention In a bad year it kills over five times that If we have a pandemic it will be much worse People think the H1N1 flu wasnt so bad But more than 1000 American kids died from H1N1Each new year seems to bring its own sensational candidate for the next pandemic In 2014 of course it was the Ebola outbreak  which killed more than 10000 people and sent much of America into hysterics This year a particularly infectious form of bird flu has ripped through 14 states killing or forcing the slaughter of 39 million birds Public health authorities are forcing the grisly massacre because the more birds around for the flu to infect the more chances the flu has to mutate and reassemble itself into a form that can infect humansIt isnt just the news that carries warnings The culture is thick with our fear of infectious disease Zombies for instance are everywhere  World War Z was a bestselling book and a blockbuster movieThe Walking Dead has become one of televisions most popular shows And zombies are a metaphor for infectious diseaseWhen I was a kid I watched AIDS go from an obscure arcane curiosity to a global pandemic Max Brooks author of World War Z told the CDC What drove me crazy was that unlike the Black Death or the Spanish Influenza AIDS could have simply been stopped by a pamphlet A couple dos and donts a little education and clearheaded leadership and it might have ended up as a footnote in a virologists medical text If thats not zombies I dont know what isThe CDC has even released a document titledPreparedness 101 Zombie Apocalypse The point obviously isnt that the CDC expects a zombie apocalypse around the corner its that since a zombie apocalypse is simply an infectious disease apocalypse talking about how to avoid becoming a zombie is a safe way for people to talk about how to protect themselves from pandemic diseaseWhen confronted with real anxiety a lot of people shut down Brooks said For them planning for an actual crisis is just too scary too paralyzing to think about Make it a zombie attack though then theres some psychological paddingPandemic disease is something our culture thinks about knows about fears Its so topmost on our minds and in our nightmares that weve created an elaborate metaphorical architecture so we can talk about it even with people who are too scared to talk about it We think about it so much it seems almost ridiculous that we arent ready But were not Not even closeJust look what happened with EbolaRon Klain was an odd choice for Ebola czarKlain entered the Obama administration as Vice President Joe Bidens chief of staff This was itself notable Klain was chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore too making him the only person to serve in that position for two different vice presidentsHe quickly proved himself an exceptional fixer for the Obama administration with a mix of policy political and bureaucratic chops that everyone agreed was rare And so when President Obama needed someone to coordinate the US governments response he turned to Klain And Klain did his job After a few early botched cases the Ebola outbreak ended on American soil Ebola became what Americans were used to it being someone elses problemBut talk to Klain today and he doesnt sound like a guy exulting in victory He sounds scared He doesnt think Ebola showed that Americas response can work He thinks it showed how easily it could failYou cant use the word lucky or fortunate about something like Ebola that killed 10000 people Klain says But it was the most favorable scenario for the world to face one of these things Ebola is very difficult to transmit Everyone who is contagious has a visible symptom It broke out in three relatively small countries that dont send many travelers to the US And those three countries have good relationships with America and were welcoming of Western aidWith a pandemic flu the disease would be much more contagious than Ebola Klain continues The people who are contagious may not have visible symptoms It could break out in a highly populous country that sends thousands of travelers a day to the US It could be a country with megacities with tens of millions of people And it could be a country where sending in the 101st Airborne isnt possibleEbola Klain thinks shows how unprepared the world was for a disease that its known about for decades and that comparatively speaking spreads pretty slowly A person infected with Ebolacan be expected to pass the disease on to two people barring effective countermeasures epidemiologists call this the reproduction number Two is not that high as these things go The SARS virus had a reproduction number of four Measles has a reproduction number of 18What happens when the world faces a lethal disease were not used to with a reproduction number of five or eight or 10 What if it starts in a megacity What if unlike Ebola its contagious before the patient is showing obvious symptomsPast experience isnt comforting If you look at the H1N1 flu in 2009 Klain says it had spread around the world before we even knew it existedBehind Gatess fear of pandemic disease is an algorithmic model of how disease moves through the modern world He funded that model to help with his foundations work eradicating polio But then he used it to look into how a disease that acted like the Spanish flu of 1918 would work in todays worldThe results were shocking even to Gates Within 60 days its basically in all urban centers around the entire globe he says That didnt happen with the Spanish fluThe basic reason the disease could spread so fast is that human beings now move around so fast Gatess modelers found that about 50 times more people cross borders today than did so in 1918 And any new disease will cross those borders with them  and will do it before we necessarily even know there is a new disease Remember what Ron Klain said If you look at the H1N1 flu in 2009 it had spread around the world before we even knew it existedGatess model showed that a Spanish flulike disease unleashed on the modern world would kill more than 33 million people in 250 daysWeve created in terms of spread the most dangerous environment that weve ever had in the history of mankind Gates saysThe science fiction writer William Gibson has a good line the future is already here its just not evenly distributed And nowhere is that truer than in health careAccording to the World Health Organization the United States spends more than 8000 per person per year on health care Eritrea spends less than 20 Traditionally Americans thinks of that as Eritreas problem But if a highly infectious highly lethal new disease presents in Eritrea and the world is slow to learn about it then it will quickly become Americas problemThis is of course what happened with Ebola If it had made its first appearance in the United States it likely would have been caught and contained quickly But as my colleague Julia Belluz wrote the countries where the 2014 outbreak began happen to be three of the poorest in the world and it took them at least three months to even realize they were harboring an Ebola outbreak By the time Ebola was recognized it was already out of control  and so for the first time it made its way to American shoresWhen I ask the CDCs Frieden whats needed to catch these diseases early he doesnt hesitate The most effective way to protect people is basic public health infrastructure he says That means laboratories for finding specimens getting them tested and discovering whats spreading It means field epidemiologists It means emergency operation centers And you need to have that available day in and day out If weve learned anything its that you want an everyday public health system you can scale up for an emergency not a system you only use in case of emergenciesThe good news is this kind of system isnt all that expensive Basic public health infrastructure is fairly cheap  around a dollar per person per year Theres no magic here says Frieden In Uganda you have motorcycle couriers picking up specimens from hundreds and hundreds of healthcare centers all over the country They then send them to centralized centers The expense isnt hugeThe difficulty often isnt money its priorities These arent sexy investments It doesnt cost nearly as much as building a fancy hospital in your capital says Frieden with evident frustrationBut if you can find the disease and test it then modern technology really does come into play We can rapidly decode the basic structure and pathways of new diseases in ways that were unimaginable even a few decades ago  and that means we can come up with a response much more rapidlyThe bad news You need a government that works sighs FriedenPandemic infections present three basic problems of governance The first is countries that dont want to admit they need international help because they dont want to admit they have a problem in the first placeGuinea did not want to declare an Ebola epidemic Gates says because in terms of investors and travel its a death sentenceAnd it wasnt just Guinea or even just Ebola As Michael Specter wrote in the New YorkerThe second is countries that cant admit international help either because the state is too weak and fragmented to effectively coordinate with international actors or because the state is hostile to the organizations that would need to come in and offer relief Imagine an outbreak that begins in Syria right now and you get the ideaThe third problem is that no one really trusts the efficacy of the international institutions that would most naturally coordinate the responseThere is no other way to say this the World Health Organizations Ebola performance was a disaster The WHOs slow response to Ebola has been universally condemned reported the Guardian The director generals committee  which can declare a public health emergency  was not convened until August eight months after the first cases and five months after public warnings from Mdecins Sans Frontires whose doctors were on the front lineGermanys Chancellor Angela Merkel is now leading an effort to reform the organization But similar mistakes during the SARS crisis and H1N1 have led to similar calls for WHO reform and little has happenedThis isnt just an issue of bureaucratic incompetence The WHO is underpowered for the problems its meant to solve About 75 percent of its funding comes from voluntary donations and theres no mechanism by which it can quickly scale its efforts during an emergency The WHOs member countries could fix this by giving the WHO more reliable permanent funding  or even more reliable emergency funding mechanisms But so far no suggestions along those lines have gained much tractionThe result is that the WHO that will face the next major disease outbreak is likely to be quite similar to the WHO that faced Ebola and H1N1 and SARS As a senior US delegate to the World Health Assembly told Vox Are we sure the WHO can do better next time NoWhether through the WHO or some other mechanism most experts agree that the world needs some kind of emergencyresponse team for dangerous diseases But no one knows quite how to set up that team Thats what were lacking in the global system  a battalion of people in white helmets says Klain But who will own it Control it Pay for it Deploy it Those are the tricky thingsThis is in stark contrast to war which is not necessarily more deadly to the human race but is much better planned for When you talk about war Gates says there are all these rules about how the government can seize various ships But when an epidemic comes along who is supposed to survey the private capacity and go out there and grab all these thingsLook at what happened during Ebola Gates continues Where was the equivalent of the military reserve where you get on the phone and you said to people Now come And they had been trained and they understood how to work together People who want to volunteer do we pay them What do we do with them after they come back when people might have this fear that theyve been exposed Are employers going to take them back What are the quarantine rules It was completely ad hocThis is whats so maddening about the modern fight with epidemic disease Unlike in past eras humanity has the tools it needs to protect itself But global travel has far outpaced global governance  or even global disease response Diseases move much faster than governments This is the hole in the global system Klain says and no one really knows how to fix it
