Many Republicans claim that President Obama is among the most polarizing presidents in modern history If the results of a new Gallup survey measuring his approval rating are any indication they might be rightThe presidents overall approval rating for his just finished sixth year in office stood at 426 percent according to Gallup Thats well below Bill Clintons or Ronald Reagans sixthyear average 638 percent and 599 percent respectively Even so Obamas average for the year is still ahead of Richard Nixon 254 percent who was by this point in his presidency mired in Watergate George W Bush 373 percent or Harry S Truman 386 percentBut another measure that looks at how Republicans and Democrats view presidential performance shows that Obama is on track to be the most polarizing president ever nudging out his predecessor with an average 70point gap between the political partiesBoth Bush and Obama were elected with hopes of unifying the country However the opposite has happened at least in the way Americans view the job the president is doing with presidential evaluations more divided along party lines than ever before Gallup notesThese increasingly partisan views of presidents may have as much to do with the environment in which these presidents have governed as with their policies given 24hour news coverage of what they do and increasingly partisan news and opinion sources on television in print and online the polling organization saysIn his sixth year in office 79 percent of Democrats approve of Obamas performance while just 9 percent of Republicans do George W Bushs numbers were exactly reversed in year six of his presidency 79 percent of Republicans approval vs 9 percent for DemocratsObama and Bush had their most polarized approval ratings in their fourth years in office both with a 76 percentage point gap between Republicans and Democrats for the final year of their first term although Bush had slightly higher approval from both parties the gap was still the same As Gallup points out the fourth year is typically the most polarized in a presidents due to it being an election yearAccording to Gallup Each of Obamas six years in office rank among the 10 most polarized in the last 60 years with George W Bush holding the other four spots Bushs most polarized years were his fourth through seventh years in office after the rally in support for him following the 911 terror attacks had faded Clearly political polarization has reached new heights in recent years under a Republican and a Democratic president
