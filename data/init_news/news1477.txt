Every preliminary electoralmap forecast this spring paints a bleak picture for Donald Trump in his effort to win the presidency against Hillary Clinton The consensus is that there is only a very narrow path to victory and that will probably shape the opening phase of the generalelection campaignAmong the earlier forecasts the University of Virginias Larry Sabato sees a Clinton romp in the making A year ago his forecast showed Democrats with an advantage in states adding up to 247 electoral votes Republicans with an edge in states adding up to 206 and six states totaling 85 votes rated as tossups Today Sabato sees no states as tossups Instead he shows Clinton with 347 electoral votes and Trump with just 191The Cook Political Report shows a similarly dire map for Trump 304 electoral votes leaning or solid for Clinton 190 leaning or solid for Trump and 44 up for grabs The four states Cook rated as tossups include three carried by Obama in 2012 Iowa New Hampshire and Ohio and one carried by Mitt Romney North CarolinaThe Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report offers a more conservative estimate but one no less daunting for Trump and Republicans 263 leaning or solid for the Democrats 206 for the Republicans and the remaining as tossups The tossups in this analysis are Colorado Florida Ohio and VirginiaThese forecasts are the reason so many elected Republicans are worried about Trump at the top of their ticket If he crashes so too might their current majorities particularly in the Senate No wonder House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis remains a holdout in his willingness to fully embrace Trump and why Senate leaders expressed their concerns to the presumptive nominee when they met ThursdayTo hold the Senate Republicans must fend off a series of Democratic challenges in states that are traditional presidential battlegrounds or worse states that have been in the Democrats presidential column repeatedlyCooks Senate list shows six Republicanheld seats as tossup races Three are in presidentially blue states Mark Kirk in Illinois Patrick J Toomey in Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson in Wisconsin Three others are in traditional battlegrounds Rob Portman in Ohio Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and the seat being vacated by Marco Rubio in Florida Only one Democratic seat is currently a tossup that of retiring Democratic leader Harry Reid of NevadaIf it becomes necessary these embattled Republican incumbents will distance themselves from Trump in an instant to run their own campaigns  but will need to defy recent history to be successful For some years now voters increasingly have cast their votes for Senate in line with their presidential preference This election could become a major test of whether that trend toward straightticket voting in recent years can be reversedA counter to the electoralmap projections showing Trump a potentially sizable drag on other Republican candidates came last week when Quinnipiac University released polls from Ohio Florida and Pennsylvania Clinton and Trump were neck and neck in Florida and Pennsylvania and Trump led narrowly in OhioCritics of the surveys asserted that the samples understated the likely size of the nonwhite vote and overstated the percentage of Republicans Its also worth noting that all of the surveys had a relatively high percentage of undecided votersMore evidence is needed and subsequent surveys will either ratify or contradict those numbers But the three states in question are one path to the presidency for Trump If he could hold all of the states that Romney won  by no means a certainty  and flip Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania he would become presidentMany Democrats express the belief that there are traditional GOP states that may be in play in November starting with Arizona Clinton strategists are not assuming major changes in the geography of the battlegrounds To that end the key will be to prevent Trump from bringing out disaffected white workingclass voters while energizing the Obama coalitionThe Washington Posts Abby Phillip described one step that the Clinton campaign is planning to protect states that are mustwins this fall which is by starting to organize as early and as robustly as possible in Midwestern states with white workingclass constituencies including Michigan Wisconsin and PennsylvaniaAll three states have voted for the Democratic nominee six times in a row although Obama won Pennsylvania where there was no real campaign by just more than five points in 2012 That fivepoint margin was almost identical to the margins by which he won the contested states of Colorado and New Hampshire and is a source of potential concern for Clintons teamNine House committee chairs endorse Trump but not yet Speaker RyanThe Clinton camp has been eager to get moving on its generalelection operations for weeks knowing that it takes time and resources to build the kind of organization they need to get all of their voters to the polls in November The persistence of the challenge from Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont notwithstanding the leadership of Clintons campaign in Brooklyn is now moving ahead on that frontClintons other strategy will be to disqualify Trump to any possible persuadable voters among them independent women and to generate the biggest possible turnout among Latinos and African AmericansClintons liabilities as a candidate make it more difficult for her simply to run a positive campaign to win over these voters although she will need to do that In addition she and her outside allies will probably emulate the strategy followed by Obama against Romney four years ago by unloading soonThe barrage will come in the form of TV ads and other means of communication  through social media surrogates and talking heads all recounting the many controversial things Trump has said about women about Mexicans about Muslims and anything else that might be in the opposition research filesTrump should expect an allout assault from the Democrats starting in early June The goal will be to make it as difficult as possible for him to gain a foothold in the places where he will need it most Whether Trump and the Republicans who are all scrambling to try to unify as best as they can will be ready to answer is a major questionTrump has proved to be largely impervious to attack in the primaries but hes now facing a much different electorate If he isnt ready for what is coming at him the opening phase of the general election could prove decisive
