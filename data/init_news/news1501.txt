Clintons campaign did just that this week condemning Sanders for trying to convince the next generation of progressives that the Democratic Party is corruptThe notion that Sanders had to try to convince progressives of this in the first place is ludicrous The warmongering corporatefunded proprivatization Democratic Party leadership has long made it loud and clear that it is thoroughly corrupt and reactionaryYet Clinton and her supporters happen to be correct about one thing they are just right for the wrong reasonsBernie Sanders is not a Democrat And this is a good thingWhat the Clinton camp appears to be incapable of understanding is that the Democratic Party is less and less popular among progressive AmericansSince the rise of the Clintonian New Democrat almost three decades ago the party has moved so far to the right it has little in common with the base it purports to representPresident Obama campaigned on the promise of change but in many ways his presidency  particularly in the first term  was George W Bush liteThe Obama administration barely even slapped the banks and financial elites responsible for the Great Recession on the wrist Not a single Wall Street executive went to jail while today the very banks responsible pose just as much of a systemic risk as they did in 2008The Obama administration killed thousands of people including an unknown number of civilians with its secretive drone war It expanded the war in Afghanistan  twice  dragged its feet on Guantnamobacked a rightwing military coup that overthrew Honduras democratically elected leftwing government and dropped 23400 bombs on six Muslimmajority countries in 2015The Obama administration waged a McCarthyite crackdown on whistleblowers using the World War Iera Espionage Act to clampdown on more than all previous presidential administrations combined while drastically expanding the surveillance stateThis is the Democratic Party Americans have grown up with in the past nearly 30 years since the rise of the Clintonism And in these same decades wages have stagnated poverty has increased and people have become more and more dissatisfied with the way things areIt is true that Sanders social democratic politics are similar to those of New Deal Democrats He often jokes that many of his policies were supported by President Dwight Eisenhower  a Republican in the 1950sYet the Democratic Party of the mid20th century is long goneSince the fall of the Soviet Union the US has drifted more and more to the right  and taken much of the international community with it During the Cold War Western capitalist countries had to at least pretend to be concerned with fighting inequality and systemic discrimination Today they no longer have to compete with an alternativeAs the Republican Party has shifted to the extreme farright the Democratic Party moved along to the right with it Instead of holding ground shifting to the left was not even on the table the Democratic Party embraced neoliberalismThe socalled Third Way paved by the Clintons is just another word for this processHillary Clinton a figure greatly admired by neoconservatives who are overwhelmingly backing her over Trump represents a continuation of this status quo  a status quo millions upon millions of Americans have said they refuse to tolerate anymoreAmericans are desperate for actual change and Sanders has offered a new path Clinton has flatly insisted that Americans cannot have basic things that much of the world takes for granted  singlepayer health care free public higher education environmental policies that dont rely on fossil fuel corporations that destroy the planet Sanders says otherwiseThe Democratic Party is a party of corporate influence and military power It is chockfull of 1 percenters with leaders like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel  who shuts down public schools en masse and covers up police killings of unarmed black residents  or Debbie Wasserman Schultz  who is working to help loan sharksMany of the things that have been called for by Donald Trump a fascistic demagogue have already been implemented by the Democratic PartyThe Obama administration has deported more than 25 million people  more than any other president It is sending Central American refugees fleeing violence back to where they are killed The Obama administration is more and more heavily militarizing the border a process that began with the Clinton administrations passing of NAFTA The Obama administration is discriminating against Muslims throughout society with widespread police surveillance and entrapment along with shadowy policies like the nofly list When Clintons campaign and her supporters implore Americans to oppose Sanders because he is not a Democrat it is nothing more than a disingenuous appeal to authority What they are really saying is loyalty to the Democratic Party is more important than loyalty to the leftwing ideals that it supposedly espouses This is the textbook definition of rank opportunism For them being a loyal Democrat is more important than having leftwing politics Under eight years of a Democratic presidential administration life for the average workingclass American and particularly for the average workingclass American of color has not gotten better it has gotten worse The Clintons the most powerful force in the Democratic Party happen to embody everything that is wrong with it It was under their leadership that the party took its most reactionary and despicable turn Bill and Hillary gutted welfare and passed the antiLGBTQ Defense of Marriage Act Bill and Hillary advocated for neoliberal trade deals like NAFTA and the TransPacific Partnership Bill and Hillary have made millions of dollars speaking for corporations and banks Moreover the Clintons are one of the most corrupt families in US politics The Clinton Foundation has been described by investigative journalist Ken Silverstein as a socalled charitable enterprise that has served as a vehicle to launder money and to enrich family friends Unlike that of the Clintons Sanders record is not just consistent it is squeaky clean And it is consistent and squeaky clean precisely because Sanders is not an opportunist Sanders a longtime independent is not a party hack He is a principled leftist who is only running on the Democratic ticket because he knows this at the present political moment is the only way he could have a chance of winning When it comes to third parties the US is an incredibly undemocratic country Most of the worlds democracies have some kind of space for nonhegemonic parties And in much of Europe in particular where governments are based on parliamentary systems third parties can play at least a small role in the political system This is not so in the US where there are countless obstacles to democracy in US elections  with limited debates closed primaries unelected superdelegates and of course the electoral college Sanders popularity proves that Americans are hungry for real leftwing politics for the kind of leftwing politics the Democratic Party has long abandoned The fact that a 74yearold bald and frankly unattractive man a Vermont senator with a Brooklyn accent whom most Americans had never heard of until this year has been doing so incredibly well is a testament to just how popular  and one might even say correct  his socialist ideas are An enormous grassroots movement has been built around Sanders This movement has exploded in very little time It is led by the youth particularly by young women and people of color What we are witnessing right now is the resurgence of a new left throughout the US  and throughout the world Sanders is part of this much larger international trend with figures like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK or Podemos in Spain And Sanders is aware of this When he says Not me us he is acknowledging that the social movements around him are much more important than he is as a mere individual The fact that he has responded to pressure from Black Lives Matter and the Palestinian solidarity movement demonstrates this Those like Hillary Clinton who are desperate to cling on to the old vestiges of establishment power are not part of this new leftwing resurgence they are in fact impediments to it Even if Sanders does not win the primary one of his many important accomplishments will be helping to expose to millions upon millions of Americans just how reactionary and corrupt the Democratic Party is He should be thanked for this not condemned
