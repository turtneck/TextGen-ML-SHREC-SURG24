Editors note The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHillcomAnd the winner of the 2015 award for top member of Congress is Well in keeping with the polarized politics on Capitol Hill I have one winner for Republicans and a very different winner for DemocratsSpeaker Paul Ryan RWis and Sen Bernie Sanders IVt perfectly embody the polarization that prevents Congress from getting anything done on the nations most pressing issues from immigration to stopping gun massacres to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ISISThis dysfunctional Congress deserves its dismal 13 percent approval rating from the American people The Republican majorities in the House and Senate reached a new nadir in broken politics by inviting a foreign leader Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to use the Congress as a setting to disrespect the American president back in March They acted without first consulting with the White HouseAnd then there was the refusal to hold confirmation hearings on the presidents nominees for judicial posts or to the Foreign ServiceCongressional Republicans have made it their everyday practice to obstruct initiatives from the twiceelected leader of the nation That includes their recent undercutting of any efforts to deal with global warming which are being negotiated by the president and more than a hundred other world leadersThe GOP antipathy toward President Obama is not new however The bigger change is the outofcontrol elbowing inside the Republican tent that came to define the year on Capitol HillRepublicans in the House successfully launched a coup earlier this year against thenSpeaker John Boehner ROhio forcing out a man who is by any measure a strong conservative but still not conservative enough for the partys far right The same right wing then derailed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif because they saw him as too close to BoehnerThe eventual winner after several weeks of embarrassing party infighting was the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and former Ways and Means committee chair Ryan But Ryan won without winning the official endorsement of the rebellious Freedom Caucus who dictated Boehners departureAll this led the new Speaker in his very first speech as the top Republican in the House to stare failure in the faceLets be frank The House is broken said Speaker Ryan We are not solving problems We are adding to themAnd that is from a loyal conservativeThe real story on Ryans elevation is that he is by far the most conservative Speaker in recent times His voting record is far to the right of Boehner and other GOP Speakers of the current era from Newt Gingrich Ga to Denny Hastert IllDont forget Ryan rose to prominence as the defiant rightwinger who proposed as top Republican on the budget committee to change Medicare from a guaranteed health care program for the elderly to a limited untested voucher plan He also backed massive tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporationsIn almost 17 years in Congress Ryan has been a reliable opponent of abortion rights and gay rights and he supported President George W Bushs push to privatize Social SecurityDespite that very conservative record the new Speaker had to deflect charges from the Freedom Caucus conservative talk radio websites and bloggers that he is just one more establishment Republican That outrageousindictment fits with a Pew Research poll from Maythat found 75 percent of Republican voters want Congressional Republicans to obstruct defy and challenge President Obama more frequentlyThe GOPs deference to the far right has resulted in a backlash from liberal Democrats  around the nation and on Capitol Hill  that finds expression in the presidential bid of SandersLast year my top member of Congress leapt to prominence on the power of the same backlash Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass She surfed a tide of populist anger among liberals over income inequality and the bailout of big banks and Wall StreetThis year the 74yearold Sanders succeeded in channeling the same energy outside the halls of Congress Democratic voters still strongly back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the partys 2016 nomination But the unleashed defiant roar of the party in 2015 can be heard at Sanderss political ralliesHe has been a political sensation all year long in every corner of the nation He attracts energized loud crowds by identifying the Republican majority in Congress as the tool of big business and extremely wealthy Americans including Charles and David Koch and other plutocrats Sanderss anger at the power of big money is resonating among leftwingers looking to identify those responsible for rigging the economic and political system against workers unions students immigrants and minoritiesSanders succeeded in forcing Clinton to do a flipflop and become an opponent of Obamas Asian trade deal He lashed her for being slow to oppose the XL Pipeline He critiqued her 2002 vote to authorize the war in IraqHe Sanders is where the heart  the economic heart and soul of the party is right now And hes got the outsider thing which is so big this year New York Times columnist David Brooks said recentlySanders and Ryan are the years political leaders in Congress because they captured that outsider thing for the left and the rightAs the year ends both parties  and their leading men  are in a critical struggle over whether the outsiders are now in chargeJuan Williams is a cohost of FNCs The Five where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities
