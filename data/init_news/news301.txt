The presidents comments cap a geopolitical backlash sparked by Netanyahus statement on Monday that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch The Israeli prime minister has since insisted that he remains open to a twostate solution under very specific restrictive conditions But the damage appears to have been done with the White House offering only the most perfunctory of diplospeak to obscure its frustrationsWe indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israels traditions That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly said Obama And I think that that is whats best about Israeli democracy If that is lost then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who dont believe in a Jewish state but it also I think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the countryIn his first public comments on Tuesdays elections in Israel Obamas deepest discomfort was saved for Netanyahus Election Day warning about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls in drovesThough he pledged to keep working with the Israeli government on military and intelligence operations Obama declined to say whether the United States would continue to block Palestinian efforts to secure statehood through the United Nations In a phone conversation the two had on Thursday he said he indicated to Netanyahu that it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possibleWe take him at his word when he said that it wouldnt happen during his prime ministership and so thats why weve got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we dont see a chaotic situation in the region the president said in an interview with The Huffington Post on FridayWASHINGTON  President Barack Obama is operating under the assumption that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not support the creation of a Palestinian state despite the Israeli leaders postelection efforts to recast himself as amenable to a twostate solutionBesides the pressing international matters Obama also discussed challenges on the domestic front In forceful terms he chastised Senate Republicans for holding up his attorney general nominee  Loretta Lynch and encouraged Democrats to buck demands that they first pass a human trafficking bill with a controversial antiabortion provisionOur goal he added is to get this done in a matter of weeks not monthsNegotiators took a hiatus for the observation of Nowruz the Iranian New Year The president on Friday encouraged everybody involved to use that time to grow more comfortable with the current positions that are being takenStanding in the way of that final deal according to recent reports are lingering disputes over limits on new types of centrifuges that Iran wants to develop and the pace of international sanctions relief to be given to the country after a deal is struckFrankly he said they have not yet made the kind of concessions that are I think going to be needed for a final deal to get done But they have moved and so theres the possibilityWhile he expressed worry about the strain that Netanyahu had placed on Israels democratic fabric Obama did not see the Israeli prime ministers electoral victory as having a tangible impact on current negotiations over Irans nuclear program With just days to go before those talks between Iran the US and five other countries are scheduled to wrap Obama offered a markedly sober assessment about the prospects for a dealAn even bigger fight between the parties could be on the political horizon The president flatly said that he would not sign an appropriations bill to fund the government if it did not alleviate the spending cuts brought about by sequestration With spending cuts set to return in October 2015 his declaration ups the ante for lawmakers and portends another government shutdown showdownIve been very clear We are not going to have a situation where for example our education spending goes back to its lowest level since the year 2000 said Obama We cant do that to our kids and Im not going to sign itEven without Congress input there are initiatives that Obama can pursue during his closing yearandahalf in office During the roughly 25minute interview in the White House Cabinet Room he said that two major ones will be comingRelatively soon Obama said he will be raising the annual salary threshold at which companies are required to pay overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week The president didnt tip his hand as to how much he would lift the current level of 23600In addition Obama said he would be exercising his pardon and clemency powers more aggressively for people who meet the criteria There has been ongoing criticism that he has utilized those powers less than many of his predecessorsOne place where Obama will not go in the closing months of his second term is back to the negotiating table over a grand bargain on longterm deficit or debt reduction Despite Republican criticism that a crisis still looms he insisted that the times allow for a different approachThe truth is is that circumstances changed said Obama when asked why he no longer highlights issues like entitlement reform At that time we were seeing significantly higher deficits and the economy was just beginning to grow We now know that weve got strong growthHis unwillingness to reopen those talks he had in 2010 and 2011 isnt indicative of some ideological drift he added Asked if hed become a more progressive president over time  as recent comments from his former top adviser Dan Pfeiffer indicated  the president answered emphatically NoWhat we have done Obama said is consistently looked for additional opportunities to get stuff done  By hook or by crook were going to make sure that when I leave this office that the country is more prosperous more people have opportunity kids have a better education were more competitive climate change is being taken more seriously than it was and we are actually trying to do something about it Those are going to be the measures by which I look back and say whether Ive been successful as president
