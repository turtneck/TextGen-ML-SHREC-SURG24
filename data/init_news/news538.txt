As some presumably small portion of Americans sat through a dull debate between the Republican and Democratic vicepresidential nominees on Tuesday night a far more interesting drama was unfolding within the Libertarian ticket VP candidate Bill Weld told the Boston Globe that he plans to focus on attacking Donald Trump for the remainder of the campaign  essentially admitting that running mate Gary Johnson can not become presidentTrump has Welds full attention he explained because his agenda is so terrible its in a class by itself I think Mr Trumps proposals in the foreign policy area including nuclear proliferation tariffs and free trade would be so hurtful domestically and in the world that he has my full attention Weld saidApparently he avoided acknowledging that his new mission amounts to working to make Hillary Clinton president He pointed out that he disagrees with Clinton on fiscal and military issues though last week on MSNBC he said hes not sure anybody is more qualified than Hillary Clinton to be president of the United StatesIts unusual for a candidate to admit defeat five weeks before the election even though Johnson is at just 74 percent nationally in the Real Clear Politics polling average However Welds move doesnt exactly constitute going rogue since earlier in the day Johnson admitted in a CNN interview I guess I wasnt meant to be president The Libertarian nominee was trying to argue that his lack of foreignpolicy knowledge is an asset five days after he was unable to name a world leader he admires Johnson described that as another Aleppo moment referring to a previous gaffe in which he failed to recognize the name of the besieged Syrian cityThe gaffes led many to say Weld should be at the top of the ticket and Weld strategists reportedly looked into the possibility of doing that only to be shot down by JohnsonWeld insists that hes not abandoning Johnson and that his running mate is fully in support of his strategy shift I have had in mind all along trying to get the Donald into third place and with some tugging and hauling we might get there he saidHowever Welds claim that theres no discord on the Libertarian ticket wasnt very convincing He also suggested to the Globe that he may abandon the Libertarian party in the future Im certainly not going to drop them this year he saidWeld a former twoterm Republican governor of Massachusetts said that after blocking a Trump presidency hed like to work with Republicans like Mitt Romney and Haley Barbour to rebuild the GOPMaybe somebody is going to come up with a new playbook and I dont know who its going to be but it would be fun to participate he saidMaybe Mike Pence Both vicepresidential candidates seem pretty eager to move past the humiliations of the 2016 campaign Update In an interview with Reason on Wednesday Weld tried to clarify  or walk back  his remarks to the GlobeHe also posted a statement to Facebook
