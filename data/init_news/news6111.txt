When Donald Trump told ABCs George Stephanopoulos in an interview on Sunday that he didnt think the Republican Party needed to be unified behind his candidacy it wasnt really clear what he meantDoes the party have to be unified Im very different than everybody else perhaps thats ever run for office I actually dont think so Trump said I think it would be better if it were unified I think it would be  there would be something good about it But I dont think it actually has to be unified in the traditional senseSo how will he win I think Im going to go out and Im going to get millions of people from the Democrats Trump said Im going to get Bernie Sanders people to vote because they like me on tradeA charitable interpretation is that Trump doesnt think members of the Republican establishment need to align behind him in order for him to be successful That was certainly true in the primaries but its less clear that its true in the general Why For the same reason that the uncharitable interpretation of Trumps comments is so baffling Trump very much needs Republicans to vote for him in NovemberThat sounds obvious of course but its worth delvinginto Consider for example the relative unfavorability of Trump and Hillary Clinton within their own parties Clintons got the Democratic nomination essentially locked up but is still battling Bernie Sanders and still maintaining only a small lead over him in national polling But she is much more positively viewed by members of her own party than is Trump  and consistently so Trumps numbers have improved but theyre still pretty abysmalThis is a large part of the reason that Trumps overall favorability ratings are lower than Clintons Republicans look at him a lot more skeptically than Democrats do Clinton For him to be successful in November he needs those skeptical Republicans to come out and vote for him anywayAfter all this happens at a time when partisans have been more willing than ever to vote for the candidate their own party nominated Even independents  a group that largely still tends to vote on a partisan basis  were largely loyal to the party with which they identified in 2008If Republicans waver on their choice but Democrats stay true to their party Trumps in a lot of trouble Yes a chunk of Bernie Sanders supporters say that they wont back Clinton in November but when Clinton lost the nomination in 2008 the number of defections was much smaller than polling at the end of the primary suggestedDonald Trump will end the primary season withmore votes from Republicans than any Republican in history But hes also had the most people vote against him as the splintered party struggled to reach consensus The fact that prominent Republicans are reluctant to back Trump is a both a cause and side effect of that split House Speaker Paul Ryan declining to endorse Trump wont hurt Trump among Trumps existing base of support they dont like Ryan anyway But if Ryan argued for Trumps candidacy  if more moderateestablishment Republicans were to embrace and make the case for his nomination  its likely that wavering Republicans might be influenced Trump needs them to beHe waves this away by suggesting hell find some space in the political middle He returns to this baffling idea that he can lure Bernie Sanderss supporters to his cause  an effort that will almost certainly fail based on the politics at play and an effort about which Sanders himself has been increasingly vocalThere has been a repeated suggestion that Trump can lure Democrats to his cause in the way that Ronald Reagan did in 1980 You can see the dip Reagan caused in Democratic Party loyalty on the first graph above But that idea is flawed for several reasonsFirst of all those Reagan Democrats  mostly workingclass white males  have already migrated to the Republican Party You can see the trend in data from the General Social Survey the Reagan Democrats of 1980 are the regularold Republicans of today In that sense Trump is right His campaign hinges on those voters supporting himOn top of that though white voters are a much smaller part of the electorate than they were in 1980 That year 88 percent of the electorate was white In 2012 the figure was 72 percent In 1988 workingclass whites made up half of the electorate as the Atlantics Peter Beinart noted in March This year theyll be only onethird Yes its possible that Trump will inspire more whites to come to the polls but theres also some evidence that hes inspiring nonwhites to turn out too  to vote against himTrump cant count on wooing a large group of Democrats to vote for him in part because most of the Democratic Party is made up of groups that view him very negatively women blacks Hispanics If he cant convince Democrats and if Democrats and Democraticleaning independents maintain their party loyalty he needs every Republican vote he can get To do that he needs help  the sort of help he didnt get in the primaries leading to his earning less than 50 percent of the total votesIt sounds macho to say he doesnt need loyalty that hell go it alone with the party or without it But a nonunified Republican Party is a Republican Party that endures four more years of a Democratic White House
