US Keen to Keep South China Sea Nations Buying From Them Not China by Jason Ditz October 28 2016 Share This United States determination to keep its South China Sea territorial disputes with China going rests heavily on having nations with active claims in the sea as US client states particularly those with claims that conflict with Chinas That used to be with several nations having such claims But the US is struggling to keep those nations exclusively buying US arms Todays big loss was from Malaysia  which has announced they intend to buy littoral mission ships from China instead of the United States Details on the decisionmaking process are unclear but the US problems with their own littoral combat ships breaking down so that mightve hurt their chances Its a comparatively small deal but part of a growing trend Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has been making headlines for weeks with his interest in ending longstanding reliance on the US While this has grown into complaints about general USPhilippines relations one of the early grievances was his not liking the US dictating arms sales and expressing interest in buying from China and Russia instead If these countries start buying their arms from China theyll have a strong incentive to resolve maritime disputes with China diplomatically which could severely limit their interest in having warships patrolling through the area to confront China Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
