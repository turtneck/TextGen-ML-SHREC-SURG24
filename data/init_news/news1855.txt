posted by Eddie Ever wonder how cellphones went from being a point of wealth to household commodity Well theres reason to believe that the accessibility of cellphones isnt purely coincidental The thought originated with metadata and the possibilities made possible through the documentation of information that cellphones provide through both backdoor access and the location data each phone provides FISA the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is an incredibly secret court that answers to no one and has autonomy in not only their proceeding and rulings but is also highlyclassified Through this system Presidents George Bush and Barrack Obama have enabled their own domestic surveillance practices Although The NSA is heavily involved as well In doing so the government has created programs and jobs that are specific to collecting and translating metadata The government would have you believe that metadata is not as invasive as specific data but lets consider it this way Imagine your coordinates being reported by the second from the time you wake in the morning during your commute to work and whichever plans you have afterwards This data system gives insight into each particular location phone call and the duration of said phone calls to these data collectors Imagine being able to see each and every step your better half or child has throughout the day and you notice they stops at location that seem unusual or speakcommunicate with numberspeople unfamiliar to you while having access to the duration of those calls Although this leaves an opportunity for misconception but it also brings us to an objective truth how revealing metadata can be Edward Snowden a former NSA employer who specialized in technology in the cyber division released classified documents involving both government programs that enacted policies and FISA court rulings on said programs These revelations brought his need to flee for asylum in China and then and currently Russia Snowdens attempt of transparency let Americans learn just how much census data has changed and the contracts deployed between the government and the major communications companies such as ATT These companies have made millions by granting backdoor access and data to the government Yet this isnt all bad Local officials have occasionally solicited access through communication companies to find criminals and perpetrators of crime For example in 2013 California officials used the data and cellphone accessibility to find the murderer that slaughtered a man his wife and their two children Until the solicitation the local officials werent close to right suspect After collaboration the local officials were able to find through metadata collection analysis and cellphone GPS the exact location of the murderer So you tell me do you think your phone is as private as you think Written by Anthony A Fabrikant From Around the Web Founder of WorldTruthTv and WomansVibecom Eddie  8889 Posts  Eddie L is the founder and owner of WorldTruthTV and Womansvibecom Both website are dedicated to educating and informing people with articles on powerful and concealed information from around the world I have spent the last 36 years researching Bible History Alternative Health Secret Societies Symbolism and many other topics that are not reported by mainstream media
