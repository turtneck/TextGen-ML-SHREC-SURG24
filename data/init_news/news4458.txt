The water outlook in droughtracked California just got a lot worse Snowpack levels across the entire Sierra Nevada are now the lowest in recorded history  just 6 percent of the longterm average That shatters the previous low record on this date of 25 percent set in 1977 and again last yearAnd it has huge implications for tens of millions of people who depend on water flowing downstream from melting snow  including the nations most productive farming region the California Central ValleyLast year was already a tough year at La Jolla Farming in Delano Calif Or as farm manager Jerry Schlitz puts it Last year was damn near a disasterLa Jolla is a vineyard a thousandorso acres of neat lines of grapevines in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley It depends on water from two sources the federal Central Valley Project and wellsUntil last year Schlitz says wells were used to supplement the federal waterNow we have nothing but wells Nothing Theres no water other than whats coming out of the ground he saysLast year one of those wells at La Jolla dried up The farm lost 160 acres  about a million dollars worth of produce plus the wasted labor and other resourcesThis year the outlook is no better The Central Valley Project which decides where and when to release what water is left in Californias reservoirs has already warned that most farmers downstream wont get any water for the second straight yearAs KQED reports More than 400000 acres of farmland were fallowed last year because of scarce water Credible sources have estimated that figure could double this yearLa Jolla is plowing miles of trench in the dry earth to bury water pipes connecting wells to fields and fields to wells The farm owners want to make sure that they can move water from working wells to the places that need itWere getting prepared in case we lose one we lost two We lose three Watch out man Im going to unemployment says Juvenal Montemayor the owner and founder of La Jolla He says this is the best they can doNow drilling a new well isnt a shortterm option You try to get a well done right now No way Its like a twoyear waiting time for wells he saysThen theres the cost a halfmillion dollars for a single well he says Now ask me if I want to make a well No I dont want to make a well I dont have a choice he says I dont have a choiceThats the tough situation La Jolla and many other farmers in the Central Valley face They wont be getting any federal waterGroundwater reserves are getting lower and lower as farmers and towns drill deeper and deeper sucking out more water than there is coming inIts gotten so bad in the San Joaquin Valley that the ground is actually sinking Last summer it sank a halfinch each monthBack among the grapevines at La Jolla Schlitz points to the mountains on the horizon their tops barely sprinkled with snowThe snow supplies roughly a third of all of Californias water on average The Sierra Nevada snowpack is supposed to be a storage bank It holds the snow late into the spring that then melts gradually The runoff feeds reservoirs that supply water for millions of people  and the Central Valley This year Californias chief snow surveyor says there may not even be runoffThats our lifeblood up there Schlitz says Whatever comes out of there you know thats our lifeblood
