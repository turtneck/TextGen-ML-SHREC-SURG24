According to critics of the Iran deal Obama got played If he had just waited they argue painful economic sanctions would have forced the Iranians to cave completely And when that happened the United States could have taken down Irans nuclear program entirely instead of just limiting itThis narrative sounds compelling Its also a total fantasy The way sanctions actually worked means that the longer the US waited to make a deal the worse it would have beenMiles Kahler a distinguished professor at American University put this point really well in a piece forBrookingsKahlers basic point is that the deal isnt just an agreement between America and Iran  its a deal between America Iran and Americas international partners People who say there was a better deal dont really understand what countries like Russia and China wanted out of the negotiationsEach of Americas negotiating partnersthree European allies Russia and Chinapaid a higher economic price for these economic sanctions in trade and investment foregone than the United States whose companies have had and will continue to have limited economic exchange with Iran since the revolution prevented by layers of unilateral sanctions imposed by successive US administrations Without the support of its negotiating partners for extending or deepening sanctions their effectiveness would be immediately undermined Given the greater opportunity cost of sanctions for themparticularly for Russia and Chinait is difficult to imagine that they would follow any US pursuit of a tougher bargain Thus the deal that is on the table represents not only a bargain between the P51 and Iran but also a bargain among the P51 partners themselvesIn other words the sanctions that led to this deal depended on the participation of those other countries But because they previously traded a lot with Iran they werealso suffering a lot from the sanctions America didnt have strong trade ties with Iran in the first place so it felt much less economic pain But Germany and China didnt want to give up the money they could make from Iran forever If Obama walked away from this deal these countries would likely have given up on sanctions altogether  and the prospect of a better deal would have vanishedThis is a very basic fundamental point but no deal critic has been able to answer it in a remotely plausible fashion Thats probably because the supposed better deal is 100 percent fictional It was never a real option  just a myth made up to obscure the truth that this deal was the best one available
