on November 13 2016 309 pm  As predicted Donald Trumps victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities And its even happening in the deep blue state of California where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California My sister texted this to me 10 minutes agoOur democracy is being tested even in California pictwittercomgDLKw54Lox  James Thompson JETBallin November 13 2016 The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent AfricanAmericans from getting equal rights You can hang a nr from a tree  Equal rights he will never see it says The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it In the wake of Trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country In fact there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia and students designating water fountains white or colored at a Florida high school Frankly there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here  This is what Trumps America looks like and its scary And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying What exactly does she mean by that Is she going to call out all bullying including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband Because right now she isnt even First Lady yet and her effort has failed miserably And she only has her husband to blame
