CLEVELANDYou could be forgiven for wanting to pop a valium at the end of Donald Trumps acceptance speech last night The Republican nominee painted a stark picture of a Hobbesian America that is nasty brutish and shortTrump essentially used the most important speech of his campaign  and perhaps political career  to yell fire in a crowded theatre He warned that we are in a moment of crisis and made the case that these desperate times call for desperate measuresWhile the message seem tailored tothe same disaffected and angry workingclass voters who fueled his primary victories he clearly wanted to convince a national audience that things are so bad right now that they should swallow whatever doubts they have to take a chance on himBeginning on January 20th of 2017 safety will be restored he declaredTrump is the crisis candidate If voters feel safe confident and hopeful in November his team knows he will lose To win he does not just need to convince Americans that the country is on the wrong track  they already believe this  but that we are in the midst of an existential crisisThe attacks on our police and the terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life he said repeatedly touting himself as the law and order candidateHe spoke of a violent crime wave murderous illegal immigrants roaming free innocent children sacrificed on the altar of open borders and an America shocked to its core He described the current environment as more dangerous  than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seenThen he suggested that elites are covering up how bad things have gotten I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper he declaredTrump also spoke of growing threats from outside the country After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before he said This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton death destruction terrorism and weaknessThe newlyminted nominee grasped for the mantle of change agent without offering many specifics A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes he said Clocking in at 76 minutes it was the longest acceptance speech at any major party convention since 1972  drawing comparisons to Fidel Castro Yet Trump never tried to be uplifting or inspiringWhen hes not reading from a teleprompter he can be charming and magnetic He can also be somewhat selfdeprecating which supporters find ingratiating But he did not try to be in this settingIn a remarkable departure from past GOP conventions Trump made no mention of God religion or his faith Philip Rucker and David Fahrenthold note Making America Afraid Again is how David Maraniss sums up the week The Posts Editorial Board calls Trump the candidate of the apocalypse No doubt for many of his listeners his words expressed a deeply felt emotional reality There is real fear in the land real pain But it will take real leadership not the wishful demagogic brand Mr Trump embodied Thursday night to address this Many of the claims dont hold up under scrutiny Our inhouse Fact Checkers challenge the accuracy of 25 different assertions Trump made last night The dark portrait of America  is a compendium of doomsday stats that fall apart upon close scrutiny Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee write Numbers are taken out of context data is manipulated and sometimes the facts are wrong When facts are inconveniently positive  such as rising incomes and an unemployment rate under 5 percent  Trump simply declines to mention them He describes an exceedingly violent nation flooded with murders when in reality the violentcrime rate has been cut in half since the crack cocaine epidemic hit its peak in 1991Max Ehrenfreund has more on why Trumps crime stats were cherry picked and misleading read an annotated version of the full transcript hereIf reality does not conform to what Trump needs reality to be to support his case he will invent a new reality EJ Dionne writes An array of key Republican thought leaders expressed angst and alarm about the tenor of Trumps speech Heres a sampling of the reactionA conservative blogger in the Never Trump campThe editorinchief of the conservative RichochetcomA GOP pollster who specializes in outreach to young peopleThe conservative columnist at the NYTThe mainstream media was also taken aback by the gloomThe Financial Timess US columnistA culture reporter for the New York Times Trump really does want to be the New NixonAs promised earlier this week his speech heavily drew on and echoed Richard Nixons acceptance speech at the 1968 conventionI am your voice Trump said saying that he will fight tirelessly for millions who have been forgottenLike Nixon Trump is clearly motivated by profound grievance and a yearning to be shown respect by elites who have never taken him seriously He bragged at both the beginning and the end of his speech about how many votes he received in the primaries and how he proved the pundits wrong Oh we love defeating those people dont we he asked the crowd I am with you I will fight for you And I will win for youI wonder what my dad would think of my tremendous success Trump said late in the speech But he did not sketch out autobiographical details that could have made him more relatable In Nixons 1968 RNC speech for instance he spoke poignantly about being a poor boy in California listening to the train go by at night and dreaming of a better future We got nothing like that from Trump perhaps because the billionaire does not have those kinds of stories to tell A textbook cult of personality Trump did however present himself as a white knight who is singularly capable of restoring orderNobody knows the system better than me which is why I alone can fix it he insistedI have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police he said at another point When I take the oath of office next year I will restore law and order to our country Believe me Believe meWonkblogs Jim Tankersley compares the text of Trumps speech last night to Reagans speech at the GOP convention in Detroit in 1980 Most strikingly Reagan warned voters to place their faith in free people not powerful leaders Trust me government asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man that we trust him to do whats best for us he said My view of government places trust not in one person or one party but in those values that transcend persons and parties The trust is where it belongs  in the peopleIn this vein Post opinion blogger Alexandra Petri describes the final night of Trumps convention as a creepy fascist infomercial Donald Trump is selling America a miracle juicer The juicer is Donald Trump It is orange and it will never let you down If you order now Donald Trump will send you another one free More broadly Trump clearly believes in his heart that government is the solution to our problemsThis is of course should be anathema to intellectually honest movement conservatives and is totally at odds with 36 years of orthodoxyThe political editor at BuzzFeed who previously wrote for the conservative Free Beacon Trump rejected other core tents of modern conservatism as well Americanism not globalism will be our credo he said But Trump now owns the Republican Party  at least until November The audience cheered and applauded for a lot of lines that conservatives in the not distant past would have booed a Democrat for saying He sounded protectionist and isolationist themes Sure not everyone was applauding And perhaps some in the audience didnt understand what exactly he was referring to But the crowd was with him Trumps alarmism makes it imperative for Democrats to offer a counternarrative next weekMost Democrats are still far too dismissive of Trumps chances They discount him at their own peril Just ask Jeb wherever hes hiding out this weekRemember Bill Clintons speech at the Charlotte convention in 2012 He effectively laid out the case that the economy had improved dramatically compared to what Obama had inherited when he took office in Jan 2009Obama himself speaks next week in Philadelphia and you can bet hell try to rebut the picture that Trump painted of the economy and the country Its all over but the SHOUTING My ears are still ringing a little bit after Trump basically yelled his entire speech A lot of male pundits have taken heat for saying Clinton shouts when she talks these guys ought to call out Trump for doing so last nightA ton of online buzz was about the yelling To his credit Trump again showed he can be selfdisciplined when he wants to be  for a night Normally he adlibs in response to a chanting crowd but he mostly kept chugging along and sticking to the script As the crowd chanted lock her up  a mantra of this convention  Trump didnt take the bait Lets defeat her in November he repliedA few minute later a protestor to his left disrupted his speech and held up a sign that said Build bridges not walls Trump stood patiently if a little perturbed looking as the crowd drowned her out with chants of USA At a normal rally hed rile up the audience into a frenzy by yelling Get em out of here But last night he took a dramatic pause before bellowing How great are our police The crowd loved it Looking to the next 100 days many Republican experts believe Trump did little to expand his appeal beyond the base It may be that this speech was so unusualrelentlessly negative and high decibelthat it will punch through more the analysts realize National Review Editor Rich Lowry writes But its hard to believe its going to widen his appeal He didnt even seem interested in trying to show voters that he has more range than he is shown over the last year This was a Trump rally dressed up with fancy trappings and a ballon drop afterwards Surely Trumps attitude is that this approach got him this far so why change And that is the gamble of his entire campaignThe former communications director for the NRSC A coming out party for the GOPAnother notable moments from last night that will be remembered was when billionaire PayPal founder Peter Thiel told the convention I am proud to be gay I am proud to be a Republican But most of all I am proud to be an American It was the first declaration of its kind and most of the delegates stood and cheeredThen in his speech Trump referred to the massacre of 49 wonderful Americans at a gay nightclub in Orlando and promised to protect our LGBTQ citizens The crowd cheeredTrump paused As a Republican I have to say it is so nice to hear you cheering he saidWhat a sea change The official party platform ratified earlier this week continues to oppose gay marriage But the times they are a changinEven the runningmate Trump picked to appeal to social conservatives got in on itWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPINGWE MAYFIND OUT HILLARYS VP CHOICE THIS AFTERNOON even though she is not expected to formallyannounce her choice until tomorrow The headline in The New York Times is Tim Kaine Seems Likely for Hillary The Wall Street Journal says Kaine Seen as Clintons VP Pick The APs Ken Thomas and Matthew Barakat write that Kaine 58 has been a favorite  since the start The timing Kaine has a series of fundraisers scheduled in Massachusetts on Friday and Saturday If the Virginia senator cancels thats a strong indication hes been picked the Boston Globes Annie Linskey reports Kaines first fundraiser is set for noon Friday at the University of Massachusetts Club in Boston On Saturday Kaine is scheduled to be on Nantucket at the Chanticleer Garden for a 530 pm receptionText messages could go out from the campaign announcing the pick as soon as Friday after an event shes holding here in Orlando Linskey adds Clinton is appearing at the site of the Pulse nightclub shooting this morning making it unlikely that a selection would be announced before then Elizabeth Warren does not think its her I think if it was me Id know it by now the Massachusetts senator told Stephen Colbert last night Some Democrats caution against discounting Tom Vilsack per John Wagner and Anne Gearan Theres a push among some lefties to prevent HRC from picking Kaine or Vilsack They grumble that the Virginian is too close to the financial services industry and the Ag secretary is too close to corporate agribusiness Kaine signed a bipartisan letter just this Monday urging the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to carefully tailor its rulemaking regarding community banks and credit unions so as not to unduly burden these institutions with regulations aimed at commercial banks Anne Gearan reports At issue are compliance rules under DoddFrank Kaine also signed a second letter on behalf of regional banks seeking relief from liquidity reporting requirements Critics say both requests help banks of many sizes avoid oversight Kaine brushed thecriticisms aside People are going to say whatever they want but Im strongly for the regulation of the financial industry he told reporters in Northern Virginia If you spend a lot of time over regulating credit unions and community banks you are basically letting a lot of the big guys off easily Kaine also said hes undecided on TPP and still open to voting for it I see much in it to like he told The Intercept calling the deal an upgrade of labor standards environmental standards and intellectual property protections But he also voiced concerns about the dispute

Cruz in his NYT columnThe future is unknown  but you can make sure that when the history of the present year is written your place wont be with those timid and temporizing souls who surrendered both their party and their dignity to Trump Thats what Cruz earned himself last night not a better chance at the presidency but a profile in political courage that will be remembered no matter what happens to his political ambitions henceforth And its yet another irony of this most ironic year that it would be the most overtly Machiavellian of Republican politicians who would keep his honor and pass a test that so many politicians of more conspicuous highmindedness have failed Though MikePences Cleveland introduction speech was overshadowed by Cruzmany conservatives were nonetheless impressed  and
