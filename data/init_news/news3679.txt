Back in February analyzing Donald Trumps appeal David Gelernter wrotePolitical correctnessTrump hasnt made it a campaign theme exactly but he mentions it often with angry disgust Reporters pundits and the other candidates treat it as a sideshow a handy way for Trump King Kong Jr to smack down the pitiful airplanes that attack him as he bestrides his mighty tower roaring But the analysts have it exactly backward Political correctness is the biggest issue facing America today Even Trump has just barely faced up to it The ironic name disguises the real nature of this force which ought to be called invasive leftism or thoughtpolice liberalism or metastasized progressivism The oldtime American mainstream working and middleclass white males and their families is mad as hell about political correctness and the havoc it has wreaked for 40 years  havoc made worse by the flat refusal of most serious Republicans to confront itI thought Gelernter was onto something at the time and I thought about this passage again when reading the thoughts of a 22yearold Trump supporter quotedby Conor Friedersdorf in The AtlanticFridersdorfs correspondent whose name is redacted is a prosperous postcollegian in the San Francisco Bay area  someone who should be backing Bernie or Hillary or maybe Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson But instead hes backing Trump and so is his Asian fianceAnd the reason he gives is political correctness For me personally its resistance against what San Francisco has been and what I see the country becoming in the form of ultraPC culture Thats where its almost impossible to have polite or constructive political discussionDisagreement gets you labeled fascist racist bigoted etc It can provoke a reaction so intense that youre suddenly an unperson to an acquaintance or friend  This is a war over how dialogue in America will be shaped If Hillary wins were going to see a further tightening of PC culture But if Trump wins If Trump wins we will have a president that overwhelmingly rejects PC rhetoric Even better we will show that more than half the country rejects this insane PC regimeIts not a coincidence that when leftist protesters showed up at a conservative event at Rutgers University students responded to the leftists chants with Trump Trump TrumpPolitical correctness is not as some might claim just an effort to encourage niceness As Gelernter notes its an effort to control people Like the Newspeak in George Orwells 1984the goal is to make it impossible for people to speak or even think unapproved thoughtsOf course by limiting what people can think and say political correctness has hollowed out Americas universities cheapened and distorted its politics and served and this last is entirely intentional to make those who favor traditional American values like free speech feel marginalized and at riskI saw someone on Twitter talking about Americashaming last week and that term fits pretty well But as leftists like to say you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggsAlmost as irritating to a lot of people though is the extent to which selfdescribed conservative politicians punditsand media organs have gone along Part of this is because PC is often misleadingly sold as politeness and elite American conservatives are suckers for etiquette Part of it is because those conservative leaders move in an uppermiddleclass environment where academic norms govern everyone including themSo nobody respectable was willing to launch a fullscale counterattack on PC on or offcampus Crack the occasional joke maybe But actually do something Not so muchBut when respectable people wont talk about things that a lot of voters care about the lessrespectable will eventually rise to meet the need Thats what Trumps doing And a lot of people are cheering him on not so much because theyre fans of Trump personally as because theyre happy to see someone finally stand up to the PC bulliesWill electing Trump solve all the nations problemsNopeBut as mentioned above it will show that more than half the country rejects the culture of political correctness and the political class that let it take over And for many people thats reason enoughGlenn Harlan Reynolds aUniversity of Tennesseelaw professor andthe author ofThe New SchoolHow the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself isa member of USA TODAYsBoard of ContributorsIn addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourBoard of Contributors To read more columns go to theOpinion front pageand follow us on TwitterUSATOpinion
