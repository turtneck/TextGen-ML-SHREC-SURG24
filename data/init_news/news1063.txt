NEW YORK  Donald Trump fired his hardcharging campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday in a dramatic shakeup designed to calm panicked Republican leaders and reverse one of the most tumultuous stretches of Trumps unconventional White House bidLewandowski in some ways as brash and unconventional as the candidate himself had been by Trumps side since the beginning of his unlikely rise to presumptiveGOP nominee But he clashed with longtime operatives brought in to make the seatofthepants campaign more professionalThe former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations fundraising and Trumps search for a running mate but Lewandowskis aggressive approach also fueled nearconstant campaign infighting that complicated Trumps shift toward the general electionReached by the AP on Monday Lewandowski deflected criticism of his approach pointing instead to campaign chairman Paul ManafortPaul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7 Thats a fact Lewandowski said declining to elaborate on his dismissal Asked by CNN why he was fired he said I dont know the answer to thatLewandowski also says his relationships with Trumps top adviser Paul Manafort and the candidates daughter Ivanka are goodLewandowski was fired Monday after a tumultuous period for the campaign marked by infighting and rumors Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement earlier in the day that she wishes Lewandowski the bestHe is the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Partys delegation to the GOP national conventionTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks described Lewandowskis departure as a parting of ways A person close to Trump said Lewandowski was forced out largely because of his poor relationship with the Republican National Committee and GOP officials That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss internal deliberationsThe move came as Trump faced continued deep resistance from many quarters of his party concerned by his contentious statements and his reluctance to engage in traditional fundraising Trump was upset that so many Republicans  House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell among them  were reluctant to support him the person said and at least partially blamed LewandowskiPeople close to Trump including adult children Ivanka Eric and Donald Jr also had longsimmering concerns about Lewandowski who had limited national experience before becoming Trumps campaign chief Some of Trumps children were among those urging the billionaire businessman to change tactics for the general electionFiring your campaign manager in June is never a good thing said veteran Republican operative Kevin Madden The campaign will have to show dramatic changes immediately on everything from fundraising and organizing to candidate performance and discipline in order to demonstrate theres been a course correction Otherwise its just cosmeticsLewandowski has long been a controversial figure in Trumps campaign but benefited from his proximity to the presumptive Republican nominee Often mistaken for a member of the candidates security team he traveled with Trump on his private plane to nearly every campaign stop giving him more direct access to the businessman than nearly any other campaign stafferHe was a chief promoter of the idea that the best campaign strategy was to Let Trump be Trump Lewandowski frequently dismissed the notion that Trump needed to hire more experienced political hands spend on polling and sophisticated data operations and moderate his rhetoric as he moved toward the general election That approach clashed with seasoned operatives hired in recent monthsMinutes after news of Lewandowskis departure was announced Trump aide Michael Caputo tweeted Ding dong the witch is dead and included a link to the song from the film The Wizard of OzLewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery in the spring for an altercation involving a female reporter during a rally The charges were later dropped Trump defended Lewandowski throughout the episode and repeatedly framed his own actions as a sign of loyalty and a demonstration that he would not give in to outside pressureFolks look Im a loyal person Trump told voters at the timeIts so important he said of loyalty in a subsequent interview And its one of the traits that I most respect in people You dont see it enoughLewandowskis consulting firm Green Monster was paid more than 360000 by the Trump campaign through the end of April and reimbursed an additional 15000 for travel expenses according to fundraising reportsYet his approach within the campaign sparked intense criticism from experienced Republican operatives inside and outside of the campaignThe move comes a day before Trump is to attend a major New York City fundraiser organized by longtime GOP financier Woody Johnson the NFL Jets owner Trump will spend part of Tuesday and Wednesday at finance events in his home cityMany of the top Republican fundraisers had encountered turbulence between worried donors and a campaign manager who did not seem fully onboard with the idea that Trump and the party needed to buckle down and raise the money needed to build a robust general election operationRepublican strategist Ryan Williams a frequent Trump critic said Lewandowskis dismissal is the first major public admission from Donald Trump that his campaign is not going wellThis shows donors activists and party officials that he is willing to make significant changes even if it means parting ways with a trusted political aide Williams said Now Trump needs to demonstrate that he is willing to change his own approach by toning down his rhetoric and becoming a more disciplined general election candidate
