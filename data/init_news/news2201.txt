The climate change plan announced by the Obama administration Monday is not as aggressive as plans by some other countries But it suggests the US is serious about the issue and gives the country new credibility in climate talksAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealPresident Obama speaks about his Clean Power Plan in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Monday The president is mandating even steeper greenhouse gas cuts from US power plants than previously expected while granting states more time and broader options to complyThe Obama administrations new rules to reduce carbondioxide emissions from existing power plants have helped propel the United States to a leadership role in international efforts to curb global warming some analysts suggestMondays announcement of President Obamas Clean Power Plan is being seen as a significant step forward for the US and for the international processThis is a case of leading by example says Elliot Diringer executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions a climate and energypolicy think tank in Arlington Va The rest of the world has been waiting a long time for the US to demonstrate the kind of leadership were seeing nowThe plan adds to the USs diplomatic credibility on climate adds Andrew Deutz director of international government relations for The Nature Conservancy And that is as significant as the emissions goals he suggestsBut how strict are the emissions goals themselves Is the US on the verge of becoming a world leader in cutting carbon emissionsTheres no easy way to compare the climate efforts of different nations specialists say because negotiators working on a Paris treaty are taking a pledge and review approach Each country chooses its own targets based on a range of factorsThe Clean Power Plan aims to cut CO2 emissions from existing power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 It is part of a broader Obama administration plan to cut carbon emissions economywide The goal for that broader plan is to reduce all CO2 emissions to between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025The European Union by contrast aims to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels  a moreaggressive target  by 2030 Some European countries not in the EU such as Norway and Iceland aim to at least match the EU targets Switzerland aims for 50 percent cutsMeanwhile China Canada New Zealand Japan and Singapore are using 2005 as the base year for their targets like the US Canada New Zealand and Japan have proposed emissions cuts of 25 to 30 percent by 2030 China and Singapore have pledged to significantly reduce their carbon intensity  the amount of carbon produced per unit of gross domestic product Their goal is to see that their emissions peak by 2030Still others such as Mexico South Korea Ethiopia and Morocco have set another even softer baseline offering to cut emissions between 32 and 64 percent compared with what their emissions might have been in 2030 if emissions followed a business as usual pathOf particular interest are India Indonesia Brazil and South Africa which have yet to submit plans notes David Waskow who heads the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute in Washington Along with China these countries fall into a category of newly industrialized nations whose economic aspirations could lead to troubling emissions pathsPeople have tried to devise all sorts of formulas to suggest what an equitable distribution of effort would be says Mr Diringer So far none has stuckStill Mondays announcement gives the US fresh credibility in dealing with climate change This new credibility first emerged last November says Mr Deutz when Mr Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping jointly announced their national offerings toward a new global climate pact during a summit in Beijing For its part China committed to capping emissions by 2030 with renewable energy sources accounting for 20 percent of the countrys generating capacity The country also would reduce its carbon intensity by 60 to 65 percent by 2030That did a couple of things Deutz says It put the US out there with a significant credible target It demonstrated that China was prepared to commit to an international target as well And the fact that the US and China were moving together helped to unlock the negotiating spaceThat played out in interesting ways a month later at global climate talks in Lima PeruSuddenly the US became a credible positive force in the negotiations getting a lot more respect than it had previously he says It also meant that some countries that were hiding behind the US couldnt do that and they were exposedNow with the Clean Power Plan which covers a sector of the economy responsible for 31 percent of the countrys carbon emissions the White House has added meat to the bones of its broader international offering Mr Diringer saysHow all this plays out in Paris remains to be seen Counting EU countries as a single entity so far 22 countries have proposed their individual contributions to a new treaty Taken together these represent 56 percent of global emissions But the commitments fall far short of what it would take to put the world on track to meet its current globalwarming objective  holding global warming to 36 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100Many developing countries view as inadequate the emissions plans industrial countries have offered so far Other difficult issues that dont involve emissions targets also remain to be solvedAnd even with a fully operational Clean Power Plan a new administration faces a lot of work to achieve the overall emissions reductions Obama has put forward to the Paris meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change notes Alden Meyer director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists in WashingtonStill the Clean Power Plan represents a very important step in fulfilling the USs commitment Mr Meyer says Given the history at the state level with things like renewableelectricity standards and energy efficiency programs we think its quite likely that the US could overachieve the standard in the Clean Power Plan
