Deep in the Haitian countryside peanut farmer Wismith Moricette epitomizes the success of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clintons charitable work Through an innovative program backed by the Clintons the 23yearold has doubled the yield from his oneacre plot Along with all those peanuts Moricette said have come visions of a brighter future for his wife and young sonFifty miles away on Haitis north coast Anelle Germinal exemplifies another reality of the Clintons work here disappointment The 33yearold mother of four has been standing in the baking sun every day for months waiting for work in the struggling Caracol Industrial Park which the Clintons have touted as a model that would change the economy of this impoverished countryThey said we would have work Germinal said but I have nothingMoricette and Germinal are two faces of the Clintons increasingly complicated relationship with Haiti where their highprofile development efforts after a devastating earthquake in 2010 have produced both success and disillusionmentAs Hillary Clinton moves toward a second run for the White House her familys global charitable work mostly through the Clinton Foundation has come under intense scrutiny The foundation has accepted large donations from corporations and foreign countries raising concerns that the Clintons are creating conflicts of interest by blurring the lines between their political business and charitable interestsThe Washington Post reported last month that the foundations donors include seven foreign governments that contributed millions during Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of state Among those donations was a 500000 contribution from the Algerian government for earthquake relief in Haiti that the foundation has acknowledged violated the terms of an ethics agreement with the Obama administrationThe Clintons defenders have dismissed concerns about the donations as political sniping saying the test of the foundation is not where it gets its money but how it spends it They said their work has created economic opportunity improved lives for women and girls raised health standards and fought the effects of climate change across the developing worldThe work has been especially visible in Haiti where the Clintons first traveled as young newlyweds in 1975 and where many people credit them with drawing the worlds attention immediately after the earthquake which killed more than 200000 peopleWith former president Clinton assigned by the United Nations to head up the emergency recovery effort and Hillary Clinton guiding official US assistance as secretary of state the couple helped a relief effort that has included some of the worlds richest people biggest celebrities and most successful businesses The Clintons also helped mobilize an effort in which international donors pledged 104billion including 39billion from the United StatesGreg Milne director of the Clinton Foundations Haiti Program said projects include efforts that have helped more than 2000 small farmers an artisangoods company that employs more than 300 people a fishfarming operation a cholera treatment center and improvements to schools in some of Haitis poorest slumsClinton supporters also point out that their successes have come amid Haitis chaotic political situation  parliament is not functioning and President Michel Martelly dogged by scandal is ruling with virtually no checks on his power  which is marked by endemic corruption weak institutions poverty poor public education terrible roads and other factors that have historically made it extremely difficult for development efforts to succeedThe country has long had a fraught relationship with foreigners who come to invest and provide aid Haitians often regard them with gratitude for desperately needed resources and at the same time with suspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help itNevertheless the Clintons are facing a growing backlash that too little has been accomplished in the past five years and that some of the most highprofile projects they have backed  including a justopened Marriott another luxury hotel and the industrial park  have helped foreign investors and Haitis wealthy elites more than its poorBill Clinton is a good guy and wellintentioned but the people here dont think so  they think hes here making money said Leslie Voltaire a former government official who worked with Clinton on postearthquake reconstruction There is a lot of resentment about Clinton here People have not seen results  They say that Clinton used HaitiIn January Haitian expatriates picketed the Clinton Foundations New York headquarters demanding to know why more progress has not been made with the billions in international aid pledged after the quakeSaid Raymond Joseph a former Haitian ambassador to the United States People are asking What has Bill Clinton done for usThe Clintons long influence in Haiti is hard to overstateAs president in 1994 Bill Clinton deployed about 20000 US troops to Haiti to restore President JeanBertrand Aristide who had been ousted in a coup in 1991 Clintons trade policies as president which he later called a mistake were devastating to Haitis rice production and made it harder for the country to feed itselfIn 2009 Clinton was named UN special envoy for Haiti and he has visited the country 37 times since thenAfter the earthquake Clinton united with former president George W Bush to create the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund which distributed 544million in the two years after the earthquake Separately the Clinton Foundation has spent more than 30million in Haiti and led efforts through the Clinton Global Initiative to persuade private companies to spend vastly moreWhat I think most people dont know even if theyve been on the ground there is these people are immensely talented Bill Clinton said in a 2010 interview with NPR They have suffered from 200 years of outside and inside abuses and neglect and misgovernment And a lot of the people whove gone there even to help them in the best of faith have done so in a way that would never have allowed them to support themselves and to lift themselves up And now there is a true consensus for and determination for a sustainable comprehensive longterm modern society in Haiti And they can do itBut as the initial emergency response has evolved into efforts to ensure Haitis longterm development Haitians increasingly complain that the Clintons most ambitious plans are disconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western HemisphereFor instance the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than 2million in the Royal Oasis hotel where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than 200 a night and the shops sell 150 designer purses and 120 mens dress shirtsOne recent afternoon the hotel appeared largely empty and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake locals fear it may be failing A spokeswoman for Occidental Hotels the chain that runs the hotel said that occupancy is up this year and that the project will mature in the long runBill Clinton also introduced Marriott officials to Denis OBrien an Irish telecom billionaire who has contributed millions to the Clinton Foundation The result is a 45million Marriott hotel that opened this month in central PortauPrince OBrien said no Clinton money was invested in the projectThe ultramodern hotel is adjacent to the headquarters of Digicel a communications giant owned by OBrien When The Post visited recently many if not most guests seemed to be foreign businessmen connected to DigicelClinton defenders argue that hotels that cater to wellheeled foreign guests can still buy local products and provide local jobs and those guests are often involved in business investments or aid projects that benefit the neediest HaitiansOBrien said his hotel employs 200 Haitians is filled with locally purchased art and serves food from Haiti OBrien leads the Haiti Action Network a collection of private businesses that have committed through the Clinton Global Initiative to spend 500million on projects in Haiti He and his company just built 150 schools and rebuilt PortauPrinces historic Iron MarketI dont know any modern leader that has spent more time helping a country and being so effective OBrien said of Bill Clinton He works like a demon in the developing world Nobody is doing that Is Tony Blair doing thatOther Clintonbacked projects have not delivered on lofty promises A 2011 housing expo that cost more than 2million including 500000 from the Clinton Foundation was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squattersControversy surrounding the Clintons only deepened with the recent revelation contained in an upcoming book by Peter Schweizer that Tony Rodham  Hillary Clintons younger brother  serves on the advisory board of a USbased company that in 2012 won one of Haitis first two goldmining permits in 50 years After objection from the Haitian Senate the permits have been placed on holdNeither Bill Clinton nor the brother of Hillary Clinton are individuals who share the interests of the Haitian people said Samuel Nesner an antimining activist who thinks mining poses great environmental risks and will mainly benefit foreign investors They are part of the elite class who are operating to exploit the Haitian peopleClinton Foundation officials said Bill Clinton had been unaware of Rodhams involvement in the mine project A spokesman for Hillary Clinton said she does not know the chief executive of the mineI strongly believe the Clintons came to Haiti in good faith and they wanted to have an impact said JeanMax Bellerive who was Haitis prime minister at the time of the earthquake and served as cochairman with Bill Clinton on the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission Bellerive is also on the mining companys advisory boardBut Bellerive said the former president was hampered by a weak staff of American aides who were more interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti Echoing a common sentiment in Haiti Bellerive also said Clinton should have listened more carefully to the opinions and needs of ordinary Haitians How do you want a guy coming from Davos or Dubai to get the real feeling for whats happening downstairsMilne of the Clinton Foundation said the criticism is wrong and unsurprisingPresident Clinton is one of the most dedicated and highestprofile advocates for Haiti and he is still engaged while others have moved on he said So its not surprising that for some he is an easy target for natural frustration that the change we all want isnt happening fasterMilne said the country has experienced strong economic growth in recent years with more Haitians employed and more children in schoolIs Haiti building back better Milne said using a phrase that the Clintons frequently quote In many ways yes though challenges remainPaul Farmer a doctor whose Partners in Health has helped provide medical care in rural Haiti since the 1980s and whose health network has received more than 18million from the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund for a medical residency program also praised the Clintons work He said he forged partnerships at CGI meetings with private businesses and other charities for a variety of projects he said would not have taken place without the Clinton connectionHe said that by any objective measure Haiti has been improving in part because of the Clintons effortsIs the whole country built back better I doubt it Farmer said Water insecurity and food insecurity are very pressing problems But if you look at the health statistics for Haiti  infant mortality child mortality  theyre all improvingStill even some who have benefited from Clintonbacked programs have grown disillusionedI read that Bill Clinton is the most popular politician in America but he couldnt get elected mayor in Haiti today said Jacky Lumarque rector of Quisqueya University a private school that was damaged in the earthquake and received 914000 from the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund to create an entrepreneurship centerLumarque said the program has helped hundreds of Haitians turn their informal street businesses into formal entities that keep records pay taxes and have potential for growthHe said it has been a huge success  but stands apart from the usual strategy of foreign groups including the Clintons who tend to favor projects imposed by wellmeaning foreigners that are more about Haiti than for HaitiThe entrepreneurship center Lumarque said is an example of what Clinton can do in spite of himselfWhen Bill Clinton came here late last month to help inaugurate the new Marriott he made a side trip by helicopter to Haitis central plateau to have a look at a Clintonbacked program that is revolutionizing the peanutfarming industryThe Acceso Peanut Enterprise Corp was started with a 125million grant from the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership which is headed by Bill Clinton and Canadian mining executive and philanthropist Frank Giustra as well as the charitable foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos SlimAcceso buys feed fertilizer and fungicide at bulk rates then sells them to farmers for far less than normal prices Acceso also hires tractors for farmers who otherwise would be using an ox and plowRobert Johnson an American who runs the program said the improvements are vastly increasing yields quality and farmers profitsHe said Acceso worked with about 1000 farmers last year and bought about 120 metric tons of peanuts This year it expects to triple the number of farmers and buy almost five times as much peanut tonnageAt least half of Accesos sales have gone to two large Haitian factories that produce a peanutbased paste that is given to malnourished children Most of the rest goes to local peanutbutter producers he said The programs success Johnson said comes from its marketdriven approach Its not a charity its a business with a charitable purposeWere building something that is going to be sustainable he said We talk to the farmers Were not going to just bring in something that someone thought up in DavosThe program is branching out into limegrowing and Clinton visited a site last month where thousands of seedlings are being cultivated by dozens of workersBenel Auguste 32 is one of the small landowners who rented his plot about a third of an acre to Acceso to plant limes Its a good idea its going to work he said We know limes and we need them We can do thisThe Clintons also were enthusiastic backers of the Caracol Industrial Park which was built on 600 acres of farmland just east of the port city CapHaitienThey agreed with economists particularly Oxford University development specialist Paul Collier who concluded that Haiti is an ideal place to create mass jobs in garment factories because of its proximity to the United States favorable trade agreements and cheap laborThe Clintons helped Haitian officials identify SaeA Trading Co which operates factories across the developing world and sews garments for giants such as Target Gap and WalMart as a potential major investorAs secretary of state Hillary Clinton along with top aide Cheryl Mills lobbied for the project with South Korean officials and hosted SaeA executives in Washington to press the planBill Clinton attended the SaeA contractsigning ceremony in PortauPrince on Jan 11 2011  a day before the first anniversary of the earthquake He later laid the first stone of the parks construction And then in October 2012 the Clintons Martelly and other officials attended the ribboncuttingSpeaking to a group of investors at the ceremony officials and celebrities that included actors Sean Penn and Ben Stiller as well as business moguls Donna Karan and Richard Branson Hillary Clinton said it represented a new day for Haiti and a new model for how the international community practices developmentHaiti is truly open for business and we want your help she said We see this partnership between governments like our own and the private sector as absolutely essential in promoting and supporting longterm prosperity in Haiti We know very well that longterm prosperity cannot come from just the provision of aid There must be trade and investment like we have seen here todayToday SaeA employs about 4500 people Company spokesman Lon Garwood said the operation has been steadily growing and will open a new facility next month HenriClaude MllerPoitevien a Haitian government official who works in the apparel industry said the Caracol project is on schedule and continues to expandA power plant was built but plans for a new port at the industrial park to carry finished goods to the United States have been shelved Residents of the plants housing project say their land floods when it rains and few said they think the plant will ever create the number of jobs originally promisedI believe that the momentum to attract people there in a massive way is past said Bellerive the former prime minister You can do interesting things with Caracol but you have to reinvent the concept Today it has failedEach morning crowds line up outside the parks big front gate which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinderblock wall many holding rsums in envelopes Most said they have been coming every day for months waiting for jobs that pay about 5 a dayFrom his envelope Jean Mito Palvetus 27 pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the US Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machineI have three kids and a wife and I cant support them he said sweating in the hot morning sun I have a diploma but I still cant get a job here I still have nothingTom Hamburger in Washington contributed to this
