At Shadowproof we believe part of what made the 2016 Presidential Election so agonizing was the endless stream of punditry we were inundated with on a daily basis Sometimes it masqueraded as valuable analysis and critical journalism Most often these pieces were clearly as author Aldous Huxley might say excruciating orgasms of selfassertionShadowproofs staff collaborated on this collection of the worst punditry written during the campaign Many of these individuals deserve the label of hack They should be forever remembered for compounding the trauma of this electionAdditionally we know we probably missed some gems that deserve recognition We would like our readers to submit what they consider to be the worst of the worst and on Thursday November 10 we will publish a collection nominated by our readers Share your picks in the comment section below or send us an email DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY Jonathan Chait Reminder Liberalism Is Working And Marxism Has Always Failed We wont see a red tide sweep the United States any time soon but that hasnt kept liberal writers from trying and failing to malign leftists The most energized pundit was Jonathan Chait writer for New York Magazine In this piece championing liberalism  Chait took part in whats become a formulaic liberal undertaking warning of the specter of Marxism or any leftist ideology imbued with even the faintest hint of redArguing liberalism works not only means ignoring its past and present failures but it also speaks to a deepseated fear among the liberal commentariat They are afraid a genuine leftist ideology is enticing to the young and disillusioned Even Bernie Sanders as benign and unthreatening as he was faced a torrent of diatribes for advocating some of the most genial socialist policies including the right to a living wage Someday there will be an independent socialist movement and it will be truly vindicating Roqayah ChamseddineFurther Reading  Oh Good Its 2016 And Were Arguing Whether Marxism Works  Courtney Enlow An AllCaps Explosion of Feelings Regarding the Liberal Backlash Against Hillary Clinton Bourgeois feminists invested in the Clinton brand inundated readers with banal fanfiction dressed up as politics One of the most superficial justifications for a Hillary Clinton presidency came from one Courtney Enlow who penned an allcaps explosion of feelings for the former Secretary of State Enlow spends the entire body of her article yelling because Hillary cannot yell so on her behalf she etches out a stream of incoherent complaints in all capsFuck everything Im with her Enlow concluded It might as well be the mantra of every liberal supporter of Clinton Her article not only neglects to address a single policy issue but it alsointentionally or otherwisepaints all detractors as misogynists unwilling to pass the torch to a woman and white thereby erasing countless people of color who condemned Clinton for actions shes taken and the policies shes supported throughout her political career This shallow examination of Clinton as a beer buddy instead of a politician with a direct hand in the material consequences which impacted innumerable communities is now normal This is the way so many dissect political candidates and a preview of what is in store for Americans after Clintons inauguration Roqayah ChamseddineFurther Reading  Hillary Clinton vs Herself  by Rebecca Traister Max Fisher  Is Hillary Clinton really the foreign policy superhawk she is portrayed to be Clinton has a reputation as a hawk It won her praise during the 2016 election from neoconservatives who ardently supported President George W Bushs foreign policy She supports a nofly zone in Syria She was a fierce advocate for regime change against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya after meeting with Westernized Libyan exiles and played a key role in pushing the US government to war She is a big believer in targeted assassinations with drones She voted for the Iraq War when she was a senator Nevertheless Fisher wrote a piece during the primary intended to undermine all the scrutiny of her foreign policy recordIt was a response to the New York Times profile by Mark Landler on how she became a hawk Fisher made several distinctions without a difference suggesting she is hawkish on failed states civil wars and humanitarian crises dovish toward adversarial or hostile states He penned this marvelous sentence after summarizing her record supporting interventions in Yugoslavia Iraq Afghanistan Libya and Syria That is just a large number of wars or military interventions and its easy to see why Clinton has been judged as hawkish as a result as if the wars just happened to Clinton like bad bouts of the flu and theres nothing much she could do about it Then Fisher reasoned it is hard to know what a president will do in terms of foreign policy because it is beyond American control Except what Fisher does not get is that America is a massive empire and the US most certainly has the ability to determine whether pouring gasoline on the fire is the right thing to do Kevin GosztolaPaul Krugman  Plutocrats and Prejudice Casting Sanders as myopic and moneyobsessed was a convenient way for pundits to water down his actual platform which included demands for universal healthcare and an end to mass incarceration However Krugmans argument went beyond that It joined the trend of weaponizing identity politics and cast Clinton as the candidate who understood minority communities better even though she once called black people super predatorsKrugman claimed Sanders believes money is the root of all evil while Clinton believes money is the root of some evil maybe a lot of evil but it isnt the whole story Instead racism sexism and other forms of prejudice are powerful forces in their own right It helped to deflect conversation about Clintons relationships with Wall Street elites or her support for welfare reform that ravaged communities of color It also enabled Clinton to respond to critiques of President Barack Obama with suggestions that an angry old white man was trying to hijack the Democratic Party Brian SonensteinFurther Reading  The Pastrami Principle  Amanda Marcotte  Lets storm the Sanders heman womenhaters club Hillary plays the gender card while Bernie fans rage It is possible no one put in as much effort to simplify the Democratic Primary contest as a battle of the sexes as Salons Marcotte  In the early months of the primary she painted Sanders supporters as an all white and male obstacle to history and Sanders himself as their belligerent leader intent on denying American women their dream of a potent symbol in the White HouseClinton Super PAC Correct the Record relished the kind of work Marcotte did because it effectively erased the thousands of young women who had legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton In this particular piece she put forth evidence of the gender dynamic by publishing two photos she took of a rally in Iowa One showed a crowd full of hopeful women of all ages she said were united by their love of Katy Perry and adorned with Glitter unicorns and Disney princess memorabilia Another showed the scraggly crowd of cantankerous young men Sanders attracted Again identity politics cleverly distracted from a necessary conversation on the issues and records of the two presidential candidates Brian SonensteinFurther Reading  Why Im supporting Clinton over Sanders Liberals dont need a savior but someone who can actually get things done in Washington  Joy Reid  Come on Bernie Time to Level With Your Dreamers Like many careerist grifters Reid supported Hillary Clinton in the primary and tried to undermine any populist progressive movement in the Democratic Party This particular column was so trollish it needed to be read by gaslightClaiming Sanders supporters were part of an angry movement and out of their senses Reid told Sanders in May before many primaries occurred he needed to concede the race and tell his supporters to stop living in an alternate reality And she further distinguished herself by trying to manipulate Sanders voters into believing their concerns were products of racism and sexism even though Sanders typically won all younger voters regardless of race ethnicity and gender Dan WrightMichael Tomasky  Get Of My Lawn Bernie Kids Why Im Voting for Hillary Clinton In the film Gran Torino Clint Eastwood shouts at kids to get off his lawn because he struggles with diversity and America as a more inclusive society For Tomasky the threat to his lawn was different It is millennials who possess an ambitious vision for a better and just world that goes beyond the confines of establishment politics you know young people who seek to unravel the messes created and amplified by the failures of Tomaskys generationFor this column Tomasky a 56 yearold white man with a very nice home in suburban Washington DC that could be found on Zillow haplessly wielded the politics of privilege It was written in first person and teemed with the kind of selfabsorbed narcissism which was a hallmark of the vote scolding genre of writing so many of us were subjected to during the election After he was challenged by Sanders supporters Tomasky copped out and declared I havent the slightest idea But none of you Sanders supporters has the slightest idea of what the future holds either He went on to mock supporters for being assertive even though it was his performance that provoked thousands of supporters into understandable outrage Kevin GosztolaFurther Reading  An Ode To My Berniebro Trolls  GENERAL ELECTION Jonathan Chait  Jill Stein Explains Her Plan To Stop Trump By Electing Him President A small percentage of US citizens who voted for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein had their votes counted as can you guess Votes for Jill Stein However there is a genre of liberal punditry that goes back more than a decade It lectures and berates every citizen who would dare to vote for a thirdparty candidate It says they help Republicans and seeks to blame them for wars poverty famine armageddonjust about anything bad that occurred after voters dared to support another choice than one of the two candidates the capitalist system foisted upon themChait is magnificent at writing these types of asinine columns Through spectacular misdirection he maintained Stein believed Clinton will lead to fascism He ignored the kernel of Steins remarks that sparked this spittle in particular how failure to improve the material conditions of lower and working class Americans fuels rightwing extremism If anyone needs to demonstrate why our choices get progressively worse each election they can point to columnists like Chait who foster this kind of halfbaked discourse Kevin GosztolaFurther Reading  Ralph Nader Still Refuses To Admit He Elected Bush  Jamie Kirchick  Beware the Hillary ClintonLoathing Donald TrumpLoving Useful Idiots of the Left Few screeds backfired on their authors as marvelously as this piece None of the individuals smeared in the piece actually ever expressed support for Trump In fact each of them had records where they denounced him before Kirchick accused them of being Trump Lovers Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent reacted  Area man willfully confuses refusal to unthinkingly parrot all criticism of Trump with admiration of him On top of that it brought further controversy to The Daily Beast after it published a story by a straight writer who was outing Olympians as gay That egregious piece was removedKirchicks piece was one of the earlier articulations of the argument that the Kremlin wants Trump to be US president which now saturates media He reasoned leftists critical of Clinton validated Trump and so therefore they were feeding into the agenda of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin It seems rather boring and uninspired at this point He and other neoconservatives had it rough during the election because they were no longer relevant and in order to be relevant they had to openly identify with the Clinton campaign Maybe theres a role for Kirchick in the pundit class under a Clinton presidency He regularly contributed to the Los Angeles Times over the past months Or maybe this cretinous drool monger now carries too much of a risk of damaging a media organizations reputation that editors will steer clear of him Kevin GosztolaFurther Reading  If Trump wins a coup isnt impossible here in the US  Eli Lake  Now Clinton Knows How Scooter Libby Felt The failed presidency of George W Bush left many neoconservatives scrambling to hold onto power and relevance but neocons like Lake believe they have found the sunnyside up around the Clinton campaign With Clinton and friends celebrating the support of Iraq war cheerleaders Robert Kagan Max Boot and David Frum it was only a matter of time before someone tried to beat the yoke of the old regime off former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney and convicted felon I Lewis Scooter LibbyIn his piece Lake celebrated Libbys reinstatement to the DC Bar and feebly tries to compare Clintons alleged mistreatment by the FBI with Libbys noting a tangential connection to FBI Director James Comey Lake claimed Libby was tried and convicted in the press before the trial and also convicted after the trial It amounted to a preview of how we can expect neocon pundits to behave under a Clinton presidency Dan WrightMatt Yglesias  Against Transparency There are hundreds of journalists against transparency some who are in the closet and some who are very public about their views Concerned about how the Clinton campaign struggled with coverage of the former secretary of states emails Yglesias fully outed himself and advocated for increased restriction on the types of government records that can be released to journalists and the public He argued emails and other electronic records produced with conversational communication tools should not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act FOIAYglesias displayed a severe misunderstanding of FOIA and neglected to mention the existence of key privacy exemptions and deliberative process privilege These are supposed to protect officials so they can have frank conversations that will most likely remain secret Beyond that Yglesiass column represented the growing disdain against information that exists among liberal pundits who seem to believe if these things are secret the rightwing echo chamber will not be able to make Clintons life miserable Yet of course organizations in this echo chamber will always find something to spin against Clinton Yglesias knows this and that made his call to restrict a major tool for government accountability even more dumb
