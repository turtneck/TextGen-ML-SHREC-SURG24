Print Last week the UNs premier cultural agency UNESCO approved a resolution viciously condemning Israel referred to as the Occupying Power for various alleged trespasses and violations of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem Except that the resolution never uses that term for Judaisms holiest shrine It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection  let alone its centrality  to the Jewish people and Jewish history This Orwellian absurdity is an insult not just to Judaism but to Christianity It makes a mockery of the Gospels which chronicle the story of a Galilean Jew whose life and ministry unfolded throughout the Holy Land most especially in Jerusalem and the Temple If this is nothing but a Muslim site what happens to the very foundation of Christianity which occurred 600 years before Islam even came into being This UNESCO resolution is merely the surreal extreme of the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel It features the BDS movement Boycott Divestment and Sanctions now growing on Western university campuses and some mainline Protestant churches And it extends even into some precincts of the Democratic Party
