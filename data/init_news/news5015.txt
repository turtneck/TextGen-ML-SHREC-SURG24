Hillary Rodham Clinton easily parried barbed Republican questioning Thursday about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya emerging unscathed from a highstakes congressional hearing with a smooth and sometimes poignant account of her role in the event that has loomed as among her largest political liabilitiesJust over a year before the 2016 general election the longanticipated showdown was suffused with presidential politics  though neither Clinton nor members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi mentioned her position at the top of the Democratic fieldBoth she and her Republican questioners claimed the high ground insisting that they were focused on learning what went wrong when militants overran two US compounds in the restive Libyan city in September 2012 just months before Clinton left office as secretary of stateDemocrats defended Clintons leadership and repeatedly accused Republicans of using the special investigative panel to hunt for damaging information about herI would imagine Ive thought more about what happened than all of you put together Ive lost more sleep than all of you put together Clinton said I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been doneRepublicans sought to establish a link between Clintons decisionmaking  before and during the attacks  and the four deaths but they clearly struggled to build a theory of the case that she was directly responsible or negligentThey also hurt their own cause at times Several spent their 10minute periods on peculiar lines of questioning One pressed Clinton repeatedly about an email exchange between two State Department staffers whom Clinton said she did not know Much of the hearing was also consumed by bickering between Republicans and Democrats on the panel leaving Clinton to sit by sometimes shuffling papers or resting her chin on her handUS Ambassador J Christopher Stevens and three others were killed in a chaotic hourslong assault that revealed serious gaps in security and communications but not Clinton claimed a failure of leadership or policyThis was the fog of war Clinton said following an emotional recounting of harrowing events that included the failed attempt to rescue Stevens and the gutwrenching hours that followed when the State Department could not account for his whereaboutsThe hearing comes at a moment when Clinton is reestablishing herself as the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination following several months in which her poll numbers had nosedived Her stumble came in part because of her handling of a controversy over her use of a private email account while she was secretary of state  an unorthodox practice that was unearthed by the panel she appeared before on ThursdayIn recent days Clinton has recovered much of her advantageShe has built upon her strong performance at the first Democratic debate on Oct13 She also got a stroke of good fortune when Vice President Biden ended months of speculation with an announcement Wednesday that he would not seek the Democratic nominationAs was the case with the debate the hearing setting was one that played to Clintons natural strengths She kept her composure through the 11hour session and appeared well prepared for the lines of attack by the Republican members of the committee As the day wore on with her command of the proceeding becoming more apparent she even appeared bored at timesHow many questions were asked of Sidney BlumenthalThere was no replay of the famous and politically damaging moment from a January 2013 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Then in her final days as secretary of state Clinton shouted and waved her arms at a Republican senator and demanded What difference at this point does it make whether the attacks were premeditatedThis time Clinton also had the benefits of missteps by Republicans  most notably remarks by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif that the committee investigation had succeeded in damaging Clinton politically Democrats seized upon that statement as proof that the investigation was motivated by partisanship rather than getting to the bottom of what had happened in BenghaziClinton has called the panel basically an arm of the Republican National Committee but she did not confront her Republican questioners on that point Thursday She mostly smiled in mute agreement when Democrats called the exercise a partisan fishing expedition or a waste of taxpayer moneyAt one point Rep Jim Jordan ROhio suggested the Obama administration tried to whitewash the terrorist origins of the attacks because it undercut the political success that Clinton and others claimed in Libya Im sorry that it doesnt fit your narrative Congressman Clinton responded I can only tell what the facts wereTwo of Clintons personal attorneys sat behind her during the hearing underscoring the peril the Benghazi episode and the questions surrounding her emails pose for her The FBI is investigating whether classified information was compromised through Clintons email system which operated outside the usual State Department procedures and controlsIn her testimony Clinton said she did not have a computer in her State Department office and did little of her daily work via emailI conducted it in meetings she said I read massive amounts of memos a great deal of classified information I made a lot of secure phone calls I was in and out of the White House all the time There were a lot of things that happened that I was aware of and that I was reacting toRepublicans had wanted to interview Clinton in private leading to months of negotiations over the terms of her appearance Her attorneys refused saying Republicans could selectively leak damaging material from a closeddoor sessionClintons disciplined performance command of facts and pure stamina may bear out her calculation that a public performance would work to her benefit as well as remind her opponents why she is an imposing candidateConservative columnist Byron York wrote in the Washington Examiner that a hearing billed as an epic High Noonstyle confrontation  instead turned out to be a somewhat interesting look at a few limited aspects of the Benghazi affair In other words no big deal And that is very very good news for Hillary ClintonThe day began with the panels chairman Rep Trey Gowdy RSC defending the committees mission and motives Much of his opening statement was spent rebutting claims of partisan biasThe House of Representatives including some Democrats I hasten to add asked this committee to write the final accounting of what happened in Benghazi Gowdy said He said that despite seven previous inquiries his panel was the first to interview many witnesses and the first to discover Clintons exclusive use of a private email server for her government workWhy Was Hillary Clinton Speaking So SlowlyNot a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email he assured Clinton We signed up to investigate and therefore honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us and to do everything we can to prevent it from happening to others Our committee has interviewed half a hundred witnesses Not a single one of them has been named Clinton until todayRepublicans on the committee have repeatedly pressed Clinton about the special access she gave longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal who sent reports about Libya to the private email address that Clinton used for government business while she was secretary of stateWhy the panel members asked could a Clinton loyalist get messages to her inbox while the American ambassador in Libya had to send his concerns about security through official channelsHelp us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you Madam Secretary but the ambassador did not Gowdy saidClinton said that was exactly the way the system should work She said security issues were discussed and resolved by professionals whose work she would not secondguess She used the question of adequate security to make an impassioned case that the legacy of Benghazi should not be a retrenchment of American engagement in dangerous placesRepeatedly the Republicans were baited by Democrats into fights over whether the committee was a partisan tool and whether any of them should be there at all Just before the lunch break Gowdy and several Democrats got into a loud argument about whether to release Blumenthals interview transcripts while cameras showed Clinton shuffling papersI dont know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of the deaths of four Americans Clinton said to Gowdy before the intracommittee bickering beganDemocrats repeatedly charged that the majority Republicans were rehashing questions that had been answered in the many inquiries into the only death of a sitting ambassador since 1979The committees top Democrat Rep Elijah E Cummings Md claimed Republicans had focused on Clinton to the exclusion of other relevant Cabinet members including the thenheads of the Defense Department and the CIAIt was under sympathetic Democratic questioning that Clinton grew pensive and emotional particularly when recalling Stevens and how he died She called Stevens a rising star whose deep knowledge of Libya made him her choice to be ambassador She swore him in for that postClinton gave a detailed account of efforts to bring Stevens and State Department officer Sean Smith to a safe room inside the lightly defended diplomatic compound Stevens was visiting from his headquarters in the capital TripoliI wanted to point out that even when we try to get it right which we do try sometimes there are unintended consequences and there is an example out of this tragedy Clinton said The attackers used diesel fuel to set the compound on fire And the safe room was anything but safeThe security situation in Benghazi was deteriorating rapidly over the summer of 2012 and Stevens requested additional security measuresMany of the security requests she said were fulfilled Others
