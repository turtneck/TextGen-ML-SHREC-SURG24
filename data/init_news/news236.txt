Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme CourtThe unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the looming faceoff between the White House and the Senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of US Supreme Court justicesLegal scholars from both political parties renewed a call Tuesday to reconsider how much time justices spend on the high court Many of them cited with disapproval a bruising and protracted clash building between President Obama and the GOPcontrolled Senate over when and how to fill Scalias vacancyThe point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr That didnt quite pan outFor years now lawyers have been floating proposals that future highcourt justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the Supreme Court bench The plan would space out appointments so presidents would make appointments every two years supporters said That would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court  and align with the longer life spans of Americans since the nations founding they argueIt just sounds undemocratic said Gabe Roth executive director of an advocacy group called Fix the Court about the lifetime court appointments Theres definitely concern about the justices being out of touch There have been a number of cases with modern technology whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting TV over the airwaves or over the InternetThomas Merrill a law professor at Columbia University and a former deputy US solicitor general 19871990 said hes been a little bit skeptical of the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices But Merrill said his thinking has evolvedMy current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the Supreme Court has become incredibly contentious partisan political almost to the point where the political system freezes up as were witnessing right now with the Scalia death Merrill said It would be a good thing not to have the type of Armageddon it looks like were about to haveTermlimit supporters point to a 2015 poll by ReutersIpsos after highprofile rulings on Obamas health care legislation and samesex marriage that suggested twothirds of respondents would support a 10year limit on tenure on the Supreme CourtBut actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system thats already near paralysis Some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers but others have concluded it would require amending the Constitution To do that the House and Senate would need to vote their support and then threequarters of the states would have to approve Another path would be for twothirds of the states to call for a Constitutional ConventionNot likely but possible Kerr of George Washington University said Well see how this year goes It may become unbearable with the president and the Senate duking it out every day
