0 Add Comment YOU just have to show that youre willing to go that extra mile said Keith Gernon angling the webcam on his laptop to give a perfect shot of his bed where his girlfriend Cathy Wilson is already waiting We havent left the house without a cash deposit with us for the past four months just so we can grab any property that comes available to rent But were always beaten to it so weve decided to try something new Gernon and Wilson both 27 are speaking exclusively to WWN about their difficulties in securing a one bedroom flat in Dublin city centre and have decided to offer potential landlords a daily sex video broadcast live over a webcam in a bid to give them the edge over other renters The minute a flat goes up on Daft we mail the landlord and put on a bit of a show for them letting them know theres more where that came from said Wilson undressing quickly in a bid to secure a bedsit above a butchers shop which just got listed at 1800 a month If you think youre going to just show up and get the place forget it Its like trying to get bread in Russia in the 80s We dont even bother going to viewings now we just send over a sexy clip and take it from there While landlords are open to webcam shows as part of their letting packages people looking to buy a house rather than rent in Dublin must agree to sign up for a 24hour Truman Show style existence with cameras in every room of the house
