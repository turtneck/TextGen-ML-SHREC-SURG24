In obscure data tables buried deep in its 2016 budget proposal the Obama administration revealed this week that its student loan program had a 218 billion shortfall last year apparently the largest ever recorded for any government credit programThe main cause of the shortfall was President Barack Obamas recent efforts to provide relief for borrowers drowning in student debt reforms that have already begun to reduce loan payments to the government For more than two decades budget analysts have recalculated the projected costs of about 120 credit programs every year but they have never lowered their expectations of repayments this dramatically The 218 billion revisionlarger than the annual budget for NASA or the Interior Department and EPA combinedwill be tacked onto the federal deficitWow marveled Steve Ellis vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense Whether or not its good policy to help borrowers with their payments its obviously costly for taxpayersThe 40 million Americans with student loans are now saddled with more than 12 trillion in outstanding debt And with higher education costs rising much faster than inflation the already massive program has been growing at a spectacular clip direct government loans alone increased 44 percent over the last two years despite an aura of austerity in Washington The Obama administration has tried to ease the burden for some borrowers by reducing their payments to 10 percent of their income and forgiving their loans after 20 years this year the Education Department plans to make all borrowers eligible for that payasyouearn reliefStudent loan defaults increased somewhat last year but the department says the primary drivers of the unprecedented reestimatebudgetwonk jargon for the update of expected loan costswere Obamas policy changes the recent ones as well as the upcoming ones And because of a quirk in the budget process for credit programs the department can add the 218 billion to the deficit automatically without seeking appropriations or even approval from CongressThats a big quasibailout increasing the deficit nearly 5 percent The White House budget office was unaware of any larger reestimates since the current scoring rules for credit programs went into effect in 1992 As a January Politico Magazine feature on the governments unusual credit portfolio reported the Federal Housing Administration has stuck more than 75 billion worth of similar reestimates onto Uncle Sams tab over the last two decades most of them after the recent housing bust led to a cascade of FHAbacked mortgage defaults But its never had a oneyear shortfall quite as drastic as thisIts not yet clear whether this will be a hefty onetime revision or a harbinger of oceans of red ink as millions more borrowers get relief on their payments to the government Several reports by Barclays Capital have warned that Obamas generosity to borrowers could leave the student loan program as much as 250 billion in the hole over the next decade And behind closed doors officials in the White House budget office and the Treasury Department have criticized the Education Departments loan models as overly optimistic with some officials pushing internally for thirdparty auditsBut administration officials said theres no reason to think this years shortfall will recur They believe that their budgets going forward will accurately reflect their new efforts to help borrowers limit their payments that payasyouearn will be baked into the cake Historically reestimates for the better and for the worse have tended to cancel each other out across the government In fact this year the governments credit portfolio increased to 33 trillion larger than any US banks but the reestimates for all the programs besides student loans netted out to less than 1 billionThe administration argues that even the 218 billion student loan shortfall is a relative pittance for the Education Departments 740 billion book of direct loans the secondlargest government credit portfolio after FHA mortgage guaranteesAny reestimate should be considered in this context says White House Office of Management and Budget spokeswoman Emily Cain
