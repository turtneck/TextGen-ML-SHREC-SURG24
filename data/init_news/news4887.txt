The Summer of Trump officially closes with its silliest episode yet the spectacle of Trump Truthers an assortment of Trumpfriendly media figures who insist that the man who said President Obama is a Muslim and not an American and that Muslims must be gotten rid of at a New Hampshire rally was some kind of opposition plant not an actual Trump supporterFirst out the gate was Ann Coulter early Friday morning I say hes a liberal plant she tweeted Brian Kilmeade of Fox  Friends echoed Coulter insisting the antiMuslim questioner sounds like a plant to be honest Foxs Kimberly Guilfoyle and Eric Bolling continued peddling that theory all day Laura Ingraham agreed tweeting that the man sure sounded like a putupcartoon presentation bad actingMedia Matters ran down the list of rightwingers trying to bail out Trump who was uncharacteristically mediashy after the controversy erupted even canceling a scheduled public appearance on Friday allegedly to close a business dealBut it wasnt just official rightwingers Bloombergs Mark Halperin peddled the notion on SaturdayHe doubled down on his questions  its only OK to use theclich doubling down when talking about Halperin  in a long Twitter debate with journalists who challenged him insisting the guy sounded like the Travolta mumble in the dance scene in Pulp FictionIts one thing for paid rightwing propagandists to suggest Trumps questioner wasnt an actual supporter Its another for an allegedly serious journalist to push the claim with zero proof To be fair my friend Chris Hayes raised the question on his show Thursday night immediately after the Trump rally but it was more in the vein of telling viewers the theatrical questioner hadnt been found so no one could decisively say whether he was an actual Trump supporterBut it shouldnt be hard to believe a Trump supporter holds those views Trump personally took the birther nonsense from the fringe of politics to center stage in 2011 and he revived the claim in 2012 even as he was endorsing Mitt Romney Trump has also suggested Obama was Muslim telling Foxs Bill OReilly in 2011 that its possible Obama doesnt have a birth certificate He may have one but theres something on that maybe religion maybe it says he is a Muslim Besides the mans claim that Obama is a Muslim and also not American puts him squarely in the mainstream of the Republican Party A recent Public Policy Polling survey found that only 29 percent of Republicans believe Obama was born here and more than half say hes Muslim Those numbers climb among Trump supporters two thirds say hes a Muslim and 6 in 10 believe he wasnt born in the US I dont know why is so hard for anyone to believe that a man at a Trump rally would ask that kind of question To his credit Trump is denying claims that the questioner was a plant I dont think he was a plant he said Monday I knew that question was going to be a controversial one I have no obligation moral or otherwise to defend the president Then he brazenly blamed the entire birther issue on Hillary Clintons2008 campaign What Ive said is nothing compared to Hillary claimed the man who so dogged the president with birther BS he released his longform birth certificate at a public event Let me concede Its possible the man at the Trump rally was a plant So far nobody has found him to interview him at least not yet But I dont know whod bother to plant him What would they have to gain The kind of people whod be upset that Trump failed to rebuke the antiMuslim birther arent likely to support Trump in the first place most actual Trump supporters agreed with the guys premise
