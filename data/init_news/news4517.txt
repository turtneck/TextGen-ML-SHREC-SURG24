I am an educator I am a Black woman who may someday mother a Black child I have taught other Black mothers children Much of my educational success in elementary school is directly attributable to high performance on standardized tests that caused my white teachers to notice me and intervene on my behalf to get me tracked into higherachieving classrooms I believe all children deserve access to a good highquality publiceducationTherefore I dont have to condone cheating in any form and I dont to assert that what has happened in Atlanta to these teachers is a travesty The pictures that emerged last week of handcuffed Black schoolteachers being led out of Southern courtrooms in one of the countrys largest urban Black school systems were absolutely heartbreakingScapegoating Black teachers for failing in a system that is designed for Black children in particular not to succeed is the real corruption here Since the early 1990s we have watched the deprofessionalization of teaching achieved through the proliferation of teacher fellow programs and the massive conservativeled effort to defund public education in major urban areas throughout the country There is no longer a consensus that a good public education  a hallmark of American democracy  should be considered a public goodBlack children have for generations been the primary victims of this continuing social mendacity about the national value of education More than 51 percent of children who attend public schools live in poverty In Georgia the percentage of Black children living in poverty hovers right around 39 percent For Latino children the number is consistently over 40 percent Nationally the number for Black children is 39 percent according to most recent data and 33 percent for Latino youthEighty percent of children in Atlanta Public Schools are Black Eleven percent are white and 3 percent are Latino However only 50 percent of children in Atlantas Gifted and Talented programs are Black whereas 40 percent are white More disturbingly 98 percent of all students expelled from Atlanta public schools during the 20092010 academic school year were BlackThese numbers taken together paint an abysmal picture of students who are disproportionately poor overdisciplined and systematically tracked out of highperforming classrooms And yet we expect teachers to work magic in conditions that are set up for failureLest you think this is merely an Atlanta problem over at the Crunk Feminist Collective Susana Morris tells a similar story of attending a predominantly Black high school in Florida with advanced classes that were overwhelmingly whiteHer story mirrors my own In Louisiana in the 1980s and 1990s students took two standardized tests One the LEAP test measured basic proficiency and the other the California Achievement Test measured more advanced proficiencies In the thirdgrade I scored 100 percent on the LEAP test the only student in my overwhelmingly white class to do so The teacher Mrs Callender called me up to the front of the room and bragged about me to all the other students That same year on the CAT Test I scored in the 89 percent percentileMeanwhile I noticed one day during class that several of my white classmates among them my best friend Amanda were all mysteriously led out of class and then returned later with no explanation When I asked Amanda where shed been she said school officials had made her take a test but she wasnt clear what for She never mentioned it againThe next year fourth grade I walked into a classroom and met Beatrice Gaulden one of only three Black academic teachers I would ever have With her neon green and yellow Hammerpants her penchant for drinking eight tall glasses of water a day and her strict instructions each morning  we were not to approach her desk but rather to wait until she moved to a stool in the front of the room for open discussion time  she was a wonder Mrs Gaulden is a character in most of my childhood stories of transformation because she was so pivotal to my own sense of selfworth as an outspoken bossy loquacious bespectacled ponytailed Black girl in a predominantly white classroomBecause of Mrs Gauldens instruction my test scores leaped from the 89th percentile to the 99th percentile within one year of instruction She never taught to the test She simply taughtThat year the Louisiana Gifted and Talented Program came calling for me as they had called for my friends the year before I took the battery of tests they offered no doubt because Mrs Gaulden had asked them to look at my case They came back to her she would tell me years later and told her that I had not passed the tests She implored them to rescore my assessment They came back to her and reported an error in their scoring As if And so I became a gifted and talented student with even smaller classes more specialized instruction early opportunities to take the ACT and SAT and to travel I soared with the additional resources provided by the GT programBut my educational access was due to one magical Black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it Mrs Gaulden nurtured taught and challenged all her students regardless of race but she saw in me a Black girl who needed extra guidance and a little push and she willingly gave it Over the past generation we have watched the GOP helped along by an impotent Democratic Party systematically dismantle funding for public education underpay teachers and allow local school systems to institute punitive disciplinary measures that have turned our schools into a prison pipeline At exactly the same moment these reformers and their political counterparts George W Bush No Child Left Behind and Barack Obama Race to the Top have instituted highstakes testing tied to financial incentives for teachers as the solution to the structural risks overwhelmingly facing children of color Meanwhile testcheating scandals have proliferated in locales across the country In other urban locales like Baltimore Houston and Philadelphia principals and teachers were fired andor stripped of their licenses to teach This is a punishment that fits the crime Then theres Michelle Rhee the famed former chancellor of DC Public Schools who was accused of creating the very same culture of fear about test scores that Superintendent Beverly Hall has been accused of creating in Atlanta Hall was charged with racketeering So why was Rhee not subject to prosecution when testscore irregularities emerged in the District Bruce Dixon was already asking as much two years ago over at Black Agenda Report Not only has Rhee not been prosecuted but she maintains a fairly high level of bipartisan support from conservatives and political centrists for her views on education reform Halls trial was indefinitely postponed last year due to stage IV breast cancer She died last month at 68 years old Locking up Black women under the guise of caring about Black children is an unbelievable move in an educational environment that systematically denies both care and opportunity to Black children Locking up Black women for racketeering when the system couldnt be bothered to lock up even one of the bankers who gave disproportionate amounts of terrible home loans to Black women leading to a national economic crash and a disproportionate amount of home foreclosures among Black women in 2008 is patently unjust Given that public schools are largely funded through property taxes and that Black children are overwhelming reared by Black single mothers the failure to vigorously prosecute the financial institutions and lenders that gutted Black neighborhoods means that the system cosigned corporate acts of institutional violence against Black mothers and children and against neighborhood schools in Black communities But now we are expected to believe that prosecuting these teachers as racketeers is an act of justice Nothing is just about making Black women sacrificial lambs of an educational system hellbent on throwing Black children away The images of their handcuffed Black bodies being led in shame from the courtroom gives Black parents angry about the miseducation of their children a convenient target for their angst and outrage over a failing system Meanwhile the real racket  privatization and defunding of public schools diversion of taxpayer resources away from education and increasing political clout and payouts for school reformers proselytizing the false gospel of high stakes testing  gets obscured And white children still get educated well either in private schools or in suburban schools funded through a solid property tax base Everything I am today I owe to my mother and to a Black teacher who saw a spark in me and nurtured it For so many exceptionally achieving Black people a providential encounter with a Black teacher is the singular thing that made the difference No other group of people systematically and structurally love and care about Black children more than Black mothers and Black usually female teachers They have been the ones holding aloft the banner emblazoned with the revolutionary idea that Black Lives Matter before it was ever a slogan upon which to build a movement An attack on Black teachers is an attack on Black children Black families and Black communities We should stand in solidarity with these teachers and these students and say Not on our watch
