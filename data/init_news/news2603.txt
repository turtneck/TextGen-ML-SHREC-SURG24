Army Pfc Bowe Bergdahl was fed up He was five weeks into a deployment in southeastern Afghanistan and frustrated with his mission and his leaders He and his fellow soldiers werent going after the Taliban as aggressively as he wanted and his sense of disillusion added to the disgust for the Army that he had begun developing while still in basic trainingLooking to make a stand Bergdahl hatched a plan He would run away from his platoons tiny outpost in Paktika province late on June 29 2009 He would stay away from the Army a day maybe two and then reappear about19 miles away at a larger installation and demand to air his grievances with a general He knew that the region was crawling with insurgents but he had outsize impressions of his own capabilities according to an investigating officer and was determined to create enough chaos to get the attention of senior commandersThose were among the details that emerged in a preliminary hearing here late last week The soldier carrying just a disguise a knife and some provisions was captured by insurgents by 10 am the following morning beginning four years and 11 months of captivity and torture by the Haqqani network a group affiliated with the Taliban according to Maj Gen Kenneth Dahl the senior officer who carried out an investigation of Bergdahls actions and interviewed him at lengthThe case against Bergdahl who is charged with desertion and misbehaving before the enemy is the most closely scrutinized desertion prosecution in the military in decades  perhaps since that of Pvt Eddie Slovik a soldier who became the only American executed for desertion since the Civil War The officer overseeing the Bergdahl hearing Lt Col Mark A Visger is expected to make a recommendation in the coming days to US Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg NC about whether Bergdahl should be courtmartialedBergdahl now 29 and a sergeant was recovered in May 2014 in a controversial swap in which the White House approved the release of five Taliban detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba They are now in QatarEmotional testimony has underscored the relentless brutality that Bergdahl had to endure as well as the chaos caused by his disappearance and the lingering resentment of some of his comradesThe case has also raised questions about the Obama administrations handling of it which included inviting Bergdahls parents to speak at the White House after the soldier was recovered with national security adviser Susan E Rice saying he served with honor and distinctionBergdahl will require lifetime of care for injuries suffered in captivityThe White House has since concluded that it badly misplayed the optics of Bergdahls release according to administration officials Bergdahls parents were in Washington the day he was recovered and a quick decision was made to include them in a Rose Garden announcement with little thought given to the ramifications of making Bergdahl appear to be a hero the officials saidBergdahl joined the Army a few years after washing out of initial training for the Coast Guard The Washington Post reported previously that it was for psychological reasons but Bergdahls lawyer and Dahl were more specific in the hearing The future Taliban captive was diagnosed with depression and sent home after he was found in distress in a Coast Guard barracks sitting on a floor with blood in his hands possibly from a bloody nose Dahl testifiedHe wasnt ready for it Dahl said of life in the Coast Guard He was overwhelmed found himself in the hospital and was releasedBergdahl received a waiver to enlist in the Army He was physically fit and well regarded for his work ethic but quickly became disenchanted with his fellow soldiers and the Armys training program Among his gripes He couldnt believe higherranking soldiers wanted him to lock his wall locker to prevent theft and saw predeployment training at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin Calif as lame Dahl saidBergdahl was assigned to the 25th Infantry Divisions 1st Battalion 501st Infantry Regiment 4th Brigade Combat Team of Fort Richardson Alaska There he took offense to a motivational speech made by the senior enlisted soldier to the entire battalion The command sergeant major said in jest that like other soldiers he liked to pillage and plunder but Bergdahl took it literally Dahl saidIn Afghanistan there was another misunderstanding Dahl said Soldiers from Bergdahls unit werent all wearing their whole uniforms one day a violation that upset thenLt Col Clinton Baker Bergdahls battalion commanderBaker launched into a tirade to get his point across kicking rocks in the process Bergdahl was convinced that Baker had disturbed an Afghan grave a suggestion that perplexed the others present Dahl saidThe general found that Bergdahls childhood living at the edge of the grid in Idaho in relative isolation hurt his ability to relate to other people As a result he was an extremely harsh judge of character and unrealistically idealistic Dahl saidI think he absolutely believed that the things he perceived were absolutely true he addedBergdahl could have gone to a number of people in his chain of command with concerns about his platoon But he thought that they were in the Army for the money or otherwise incapable of responding Dahl saidIn some ways the soldier did consider others before running away from Observation Post Mest Dahl said He told Dahl that he picked the night he disappeared in part because he knew another platoon already would be on the way in the morning to relieve Bergdahls thus providing additional manpower to deal with his vanishing He didnt want to take his 556mm squad automatic machine gun with him alone outside the wire because he figured it would draw attention but also decided against stealing a 9mm pistol because that would have gotten a fellow soldier in trouble Dahl saidBergdahls disappearance was noticed around dawn when he was due to take a guard shift Capt John Billings his former platoon leader testified that he was in shock that one of his men could have vanished and initially thought his soldiers were pulling a joke on him Reality eventually set in though and he informed his company commander thenCapt Silvino SilvinoI felt sick to my stomach said Silvino now a major I didnt know what was going to come after that  I instructed him to go look high and low and everywhere he couldCoalition forces across eastern Afghanistan altered their operations that summer looking for Bergdahl exposing soldiers to additional and dangerous missions That remains a sensitive point amid allegations from Bergdahls fellow soldiers that at least six US troops died because of his actions Dahl said he examined a variety of evidence and found nothing that connected the deaths directly to Bergdahl But the searchandrescue operations undoubtedly altered security in the region military officials said and plunged the units involved into hastily planned missionsBaker the former battalion commander recalled that one platoon conducted 37 consecutive days of operations  long enough that new socks and Tshirts had to be delivered to the soldiers since theirs were rotting on their bodiesBergdahl meanwhile was already in Pakistan He was relentlessly beaten in captivity with rubber hoses and copper cables He repeatedly tried to escape said Terrence Russell an official with the Pentagons Joint Personnel Recovery Agency who interviewed Bergdahl after his returnBergdahl was moved to at least six different locations including one referred to as a Taliban prison After escaping once for nearly nine days Bergdahl was put in a 7foot cage blindfolded and left there for most of his last 3 years in captivity Russell saidBergdahl has been accused often of cooperating with the insurgents or even seeking them out but Russell said there is no evidence to support those claims The Haqqani network forced him to make videos that were released onlineRussell grew visibly agitated while describing the conditions Bergdahl faced wiping tears away at one point While the sergeant has been accused of many things Russell said he was an organization of one with no fellow prisoners who could keep his spirits upHe did the best job he could do Russell said And I respect him for itBergdahls attorney Eugene Fidell argued during closing arguments at the preliminary hearing that his client should not be courtmartialed for either of the charges he now faces There is probable cause Fidell acknowledged to charge him with a lesser offense being absent without leave for one day but the moment he was taken captive Fidell said that designation should have ended The maximum penalty for being AWOL for one day is 30 days of confinementAn Army prosecutor Maj Margaret Kurz said that Bergdahls actions hurt the Army his fellow soldiers and the mission in Afghanistan and he must be punishedOne does not just walk away into the Afghan wilderness she said and then return as though nothing happenedBergdahls former officer Absolute disbelief that I couldnt find one of my menIn sparse prose Bergdahl details his captivity for the first time
