Negotiators have been hesitant to publicly share details but there is obvious discord between Iranians and the US on Irans demand for sanctions relief Iranians have long insisted that a final agreement to be reached by June 30 should trigger an instant lifting of the broad sanctions imposed by the US the European Union and the United Nations American negotiators have argued that sanctions relief must occur gradually as Iran demonstrates compliance with terms of the nuclear agreementBoth sides are facing tremendous pressure back home to avoid compromising Sanctions have crippled Irans economy which is heavily dependent on oil exports Perhaps more importantly Iranians see the international sanctions as an injustice that should be reversed immediately as part of any comprehensive nuclear dealSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker RTenn is pushing for a vetoproof majority on a bill that would allow Congress to vote on the final deal and strip the president of authority to temporarily waive sanctions Sen Chuck Schumer DNY became the most recent Democratic senator to lend his support tentatively putting the Corker bill about four votes shy of the 67 needed to override a presidential vetoSens Mark Kirk RIll and Robert Menendez DNJ have formidable support for a separate bill which would impose new sanctions on Iran if negotiators fail to reach an agreement by the June 30 deadline Sensing hesitance from Democrats Menendez agreed to delay voting on the bill until after the March 31 deadlineObama has promised to veto both bills and has pleaded with lawmakers to hold off on legislation until the negotiations are complete The president said either the Corker or the KirkMenendez bill would likely derail negotiations at this point Failure to reach a political framework by Tuesday could prompt lawmakers to take actionSanctions are far from the only hurdle Iran currently has 19000 centrifuges including 10000 that are spinning to produce uranium While leaked details of the talks indicate that the parties have agreed to Iran keeping about 6000 centrifuges in operation there is disagreement about how sophisticated the remaining centrifuges can be and where they can produce uraniumOn Thursday The Associated Press reported that Tehran may be able to continue running centrifuges at Fordow a oncesecret underground bunker that would likely be invulnerable to a military strike if it were to host illegal nuclear activity in the futureMenendez responded to the report with outrage We have pivoted away from demanding the closure of Fordow when the negotiations began to considering its conversion into a research facility to now allowing hundreds of centrifuges to spin at this underground bunker site where centrifuges could be quickly repurposed for illicit nuclear enrichment purposes he said in a statement My fear is that we are no longer guided by the principle that no deal is better than a bad deal but instead we are negotiating any deal for a deals sakeThe rumored concession at Fordow would be in return for increased limitations on centrifuges and research and development work at other nuclear sites according to the AP Fordow would be subject to international inspections and the centrifuges there would operate on zinc xenon or geranium rather than uranium which can be enriched to fuel a nuclear weaponRegardless of the number of centrifuges ultimately left in operation Irans stockpiles of uranium puts its breakout period  the time needed to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon  less than the one year baseline that the US has insisted upon for any final agreementAt one point Tehran appeared willing to ship its stockpile of uranium to Russia where it would be converted to fuel rods In recent days Iranian negotiator Abbas Araqchi balked at the idea of sending uranium abroad as first reported in The New York Times An alternative to exporting uranium may be to dilute it into lowergrade material that could not be used for weapons  Further complicating the goal of reaching a political framework is defining what that means Because political and technical components of Irans nuclear program often overlap there has never been a publicly shared list of benchmarks for Tuesdays deadline In fact its unclear whether the political framework should produce a signed document or simply an understanding between the negotiating partiesThe March 31 deadline for reaching a framework agreement is a soft target Davenport explained in an email to The Huffington Post Given that the expectation for the end of March is a broad framework outlining the major parameters of a deal a signed document is extremely unlikely because there will still be technical annexes that both sides will want to see worked outWhile failure to reach a framework agreement by the end of March will certainly result in a backlash from those that want to derail negotiations and kill the prospects for a deal the real focus must remain on completing an entire agreement by June 30 Davenport added
