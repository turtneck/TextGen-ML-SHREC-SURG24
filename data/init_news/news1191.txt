At various points in 2011 Rick Perry Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich all surged to the front of national GOP primary polls But all along establishment favorite Mitt Romney had one bit of comfort He always remained ahead in the New Hampshire primary  by double digits in fact With the Granite State in his back pocket Romney didnt have to worry about coming up empty in all the early contestsBut Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio  this years GOP candidates who seem most likely to get establishment support  have no such relief Heres where they currently stand in the first two states to vote according to the relevant RealClearPolitics averagesMy headline is generous to Rubio whos been in fourth place in the most recent two Iowa polls with a mighty 6 percent and 8 percent supportEvery Republican nominee in the modern system has managed to win either Iowa or New Hampshire And its long been believed that since Jeb Bush had little chance of winning the evangelicaldominated Iowa caucuses New Hampshire was effectively a mustwin state for himBush still has time to make a comeback  millions of dollars in ad spending from his Super PAC might help  but the fact that he hasnt topped 9 percent in any poll there since August is surely setting off alarm bells in his campMarco Rubio meanwhile has been raising eyebrows with his relatively light schedule in Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina as Bloombergs Michael Bender recently reported New Hampshire operatives in particular are in disbelief that Rubio has largely ignored their state Bender writesThis seems to be deliberate on Rubios part  an effort to lower expectations for his own performance in the Granite State so the media doesnt consider it a mustwin for him If Bush is discredited by a loss there Rubio seems to hope the party will rally to him instead Yet a decision to effectively skip both Iowa and New Hampshire is a very risky one  as Rudy Giuliani found out with his infamously failed Florida strategy in 2008Like national presidential primary polls early polls of the first states to vote have frequently proven volatile and inaccurate For instance the eventual winners of the 2008 and 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses  Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum  were both in fifth place or lower in October of the previous year The stability of the New Hampshire polls for Romney in 2011 and 2012 is actually rather unusual in recent yearsAnd the good news for Bush and Rubio such as it is is that most of the candidates ahead of them are the political neophytes who most observers believe will flame out eventually  Donald Trump Ben Carson and Carly FiorinaHowever Ted Cruz  a candidate despised by the party establishment but who has a more traditional political background  is also ahead of Rubio in both states and John Kasich is leading both Bush and Rubio in New HampshireIt certainly remains possible that there could be a late rally to either Bush or Rubio from voters in one or both early states In 2004 for instance John Kerry surged out of nowhere late to win the Iowa caucuses He then won 45 other states and of course the nomination As of now though supporters of these candidates will find little encouraging news in the latest numbers
