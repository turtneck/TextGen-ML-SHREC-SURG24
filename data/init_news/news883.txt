Officials Concede Plan Could Change as Could Definition of Mosul by Jason Ditz November 03 2016 Share This The US has made much of its troops involved in the Mosul invasion not being combat troops even though one of the troops was killed in a roadside bombing while embedded with Kurdish combat troops As the troops near Mosul however Pentagon spokesman Col John Dorrian insists there are no plans so far for troops to enter Mosul Col Dorrian insisted that Iraqs government has said its just gonna be their forces He did however say he didnt want to say US troops would never be involved insisting that the plans could change at any time Other officials quoted anonymously by Reuters  suggested that the definition of Mosul could also change saying that suburbs and parts of the citys outskirts could easily be redefined as not Mosul allowing US troops to enter those areas without having to technically enter Mosul The Obama Administration initially promised no boots on the ground in Iraq but with some 6000 such troops in Iraq theyve seen been trying desperately to claim they are in noncombat roles This too has been difficult to sell with a number of those troops embedded in combat units Those troops are nominally advisers but are regularly being put into combat areas Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz
