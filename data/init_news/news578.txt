poll Hillary tops Trump by 39 points with Hispanics  Look out belowNO SANDERS WOULDNT BE A BETTER MATCH FOR TRUMP Bernie Sanders is looking a lot like John Kasich these days And no not because of their hand gesturesIn the final round of Super Sloppy Double Dare that was the GOP nominating process Kasich argued that he should be the nominee because he handily beat Hillary Clinton in hypothetical headtohead matchups while nowpresumptive nominee Donald Trump consistently laggedNow Sanders who is as Kasich was out of the running for the nomination is asking his party to throw over the frontrunner for the sake of general election viability And theres data to back him upIn this weeks Fox News poll and the most recent NYTCBS News poll Sanders outperforms Clinton against Trump And it had been true for Kasich tooBut it doesnt really matter First any Democrat without her enormous negative ratings would match up better with Trump than Clinton does Throw Martin OMalley or even an imaginary candidate insofar as those are different concepts in a poll and you might see a similar resultAnd thats because those candidates havent been the target of millions of dollars in attack ads or even garnered much in the way of media scrutiny These are not just hypothetical matchups they are in many ways hypothetical candidatesHeadtohead matchup polls in primaries can be useful if youre talking about frontrunners andor candidates who have been substantially defined in the minds of votersThen theres the question of how the process shapes the product Competing for your partys nomination definitely can damage your reputation Lordy day it canBut there is also a payoff at the end of the line as the party swings in behind its man or woman So its not just that Sanders headtohead matchups with Trump arent reflective of the generalelection reality neither are ClintonsThe current Trump bump is real The NYTCBS News poll tells the tale Eight in 10 Republicans said that the party should unite behind him despite their disagreements And in his battle with Clinton Trump is getting the same postvictory boost his predecessor Mitt Romney got four years agoAfter a primary season of unrivaled acrimony the realities of the binary choice of the general election are setting inThe big question now is what Clintons bounce will look likeIt will certainly be there Eighty percent of Democrats in the poll said that party unity was essential to victory and 83 percent said Clinton could do that For Republicans just 63 percent said unity was essential to victory and just 64 percent believed Trump could deliver on that taskThat discrepancy helps explain Trumps deficit in this surveyWhat we must wait to see is how big a boost Clinton will get  perhaps less than Trump considering that her party is already more united We also cant know whether the surge in partisan loyalty we see for Trump today will last or if the partys underlying fracture will reassert itselfThe answers to both sets of questions will depend on how well Clinton and Trump traverse the eight weeks until convention timeWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE The Scientist They dont snore but might creak

Hillary tops Trump by 39 points with Hispanics  Fox News Latino With less than six months to go before the presidential elections Latinos overwhelmingly support Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton over presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump according to a Fox News Latino poll released on Friday The poll found that 62 percent of registered Latino voters would head to the ballot box for Clinton in November while only 23 percent would support Trump on Election Day  a finding that many experts say is not surprising given the two candidates differing stances on issues important to
