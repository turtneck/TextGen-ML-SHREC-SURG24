Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a Plan B to halt a nuclear deal that would lift sanctions against IranThe measure which Republican aides said likely would be voted on Thursday would prevent President Obama from lifting the sanctions until Iran releases four jailed Americans and recognizes the right of Israel to existMcConnell made the announcement as Democrats prepared for a second time to filibuster a resolution of disapproval of the nuclear deal Soon after McConnells remarks 42 Democrats again filibustered the resolution preventing it from getting the 60 votes needed to advanceMy strong preference is for Democrats to simply allow an upordown vote on the presidents Iran deal McConnell said But if theyre determined to make that impossible then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and longoverdue relief to Americans whove languished in Iranian custody for years Either way this debate will continue
