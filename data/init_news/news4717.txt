 Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his governments repeated affronts to the White HouseIn the past weeks alone defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last years nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact which bolstered Hitler and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ethnic cleansing of JewsAmerican president Barack Obama meanwhile hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is antiIsrael The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton the Democratic partys candidate to succeed Mr Obama in Novembers electionIn reality however the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour Israeli expectations of a 45bnayear deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran dealIn fact Israel already receives roughly 38bn  if Congresss assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in Notably Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra fundsThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollars depreciation against the shekelA bigger blow still is the White Houses demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industryNonetheless Washingtons renewed military largesse  in the face of almost continual insults  inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog Even The New York Times has described the aid package as too bigSince the 1973 war Israel has received at least 100bn in military aid with more assistance hidden from view Back in the 1970s Washington paid half of Israels military budget Today it still foots a fifth of the bill despite Israels economic successBut the US expects a return on its massive investment As the late Israeli politiciangeneral Ariel Sharon once observed Israel has been a US aircraft carrier in the Middle East acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit WashingtonAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraqs and Syrias nuclear programmes A nucleararmed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later USbacked moves at regime overthrow as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenalIn addition Israels USsponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry the countrys most powerful lobby Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers That in turn serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catchup in the rest of the Middle EastThe first F35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December  their various components produced in 46 US states  will increase the clamour for the cuttingedge warplaneIsrael is also a frontline laboratory as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend that develops and fieldtests new technology Washington can later use itselfThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome  which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation  it largely paid for Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyberwarfare such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Irans civilian nuclear programmeBut the clearest message from Israels new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehoodSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat an initiative unveiled shortly before he leaves office that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peaceHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid dealIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu he would have used the aid agreement as leverage Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West BankMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal  he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity See more at httpwwwjonathancooknet20160919palestiniansloseinusmilitaryaiddealwithisraelsthashfL4Eq28Ndpuf Forget the FBI Cache The Podesta Emails Show How America is Run By Thomas FrankNovember 01 2016  Information Clearing House    The Guardian   T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clintons campaign chair John Podesta They are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answersThe class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest they are by and large pretty satisfied pretty contented Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live on the contrary they are the ones for whom such stories are written This bunch doesnt have to make do with a combover TV mountebank for a leader for this class the choices are always pretty good and this year they happen to be excellentThey are the comfortable and welleducated mainstay of our modern Democratic party They are also the grandees of our national media the architects of our software the designers of our streets the high officials of our banking system the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or finetune the Middle East with precision droning They are they think not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselvesLet us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta who has been a Washington power broker for decades I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard stealing someones email is a crime after all and it is outrageous that peoples personal information has been exposed since WikiLeaks doesnt seem to have redacted the emails in any way There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with we dont know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity and though they seem to be real there is a small possibility they arentRepublican nominee hunkers down at Valley Forge surrogates spread out as campaign enters final week Clinton camp accuses FBI of double standardsWith all that taken into consideration I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majestyThe dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work financial innovators Highachieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their highachieving children Foundation executives doing fine and noble things Prizes of course and high academic achievementCertain industries loom large and virtuous here Hillarys ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course but what is remarkable is that in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner constantly proffering advice about this and that In one nowfamous email chain for example the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman writing from a Citibank email address in 2008 appear to name President Obamas cabinet even before the great hopeandchange election was decided incidentally an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its miseryThe farsighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg who according to one missive wants to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valleys seat in Congress this man in turn appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats Specifically the miscreant Dem in question was said to be spinning and attacking donors who have supported Democrats John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker Joe Kennedy and others He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to Congressional candidate Ro Khanna many whom support other Democrats as wellAttacking billionaires In the year 2015 It was one of the correspondents appears to write madness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continueThere are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words Davos or Tahoe But it is when you search Vineyard on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us By vineyard of course they mean Marthas Vineyard the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations The Vineyard is a place for the very very rich to unwind yes but as we learn from these emails it is also a place of high idealism a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieveConsider for example the 2015 email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta and thus into history expressing concern that Hillarys image is being torn apart in the media and theres not enough effective push back The public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites Podesta to a dinner featuring food produced exclusively by the islands farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines We learn how a Hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that It wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make  but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events We even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers as one of several exhibits in his favor the fact that he joined the DSCC Majority Trust in Marthas Vineyard contributing over 32400 to Democratic senators in July 2014Hilariously in another email chain  the Clinton team appears to scheme to hit Bernie Sanders for attending DSCC retreats on Marthas Vineyard with lobbyistsThen there is the apparent nepotism the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or highprofile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta  the wardheeler of the meritocratic elite  for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful cronyThis genre of Podesta email in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should come from the industry itself And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration Read these emails and you understand with a start that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other They are all engaged in promoting one anothers careers constantlyEverything blurs into everything else in this world The state department the banks Silicon Valley the nonprofits the  Global CEO Advisory Firm  that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup There are honors Venture capital Foundation grants Endowed chairs Advanced degrees For them the door revolves The friends all succeed They break every boundaryBut the One Big Boundary remains Yes its all supposed to be a meritocracy But if you arent part of this happy prosperous ingroup  if you dont have John Podestas email address  youre out
