Ted Cruz has developed a reputation as the most conservative of the major 2016 Republican presidential candidates but he hasnt taken many specific policy positions to earn that moniker One exception His longtime support for a flat taxThe flat tax dramatically lowers the top tax rate and exempts capital gains and dividends from taxation Its astonishingly regressive the rich pay far less hedge fund managers and private equity types like Mitt Romney would pay literally nothing and while the exact rate varies from plan to plan its certainly not going to be as low as 10 or 15 percent meaning the plan would likely raise taxes for middleclass people currently in those bracketsCruzs flat tax proposal as you would expect drives liberals crazy Its a fiscal fantasy for people who wish the US existed as it did before FDR was president writes Wonkblogs Matt OBrien Its not an agenda for anyone whos interested in governing the country as it is todayBut liberals should take at least some of the ideas in the flat tax more seriously Just as a monomaniacal obsession with growth has made conservative tax policy into a regressive disaster an obsession with progressivity above all else is becoming an anchor on progressive tax thinking Its easy to come up with a flat taxlike plan thats not crazily regressive but still benefits the economy and the result would be substantially better than most of the tax plans Democratic politicians promoteWhen thinking about tax policy you first have to ask what you ultimately want the taxes for Sometimes  as with alcohol or carbon taxes  the tax does good in and of itself by deterring people from bad behaviors But mostly you want taxes to pay for worthwhile programs and liberals in particular need a tax policy that can raise a substantial amount of money to fund a large welfare state And the experience of most European social democracies is that to do that you cant just soak the rich You need broadbased consumption taxes such as valueadded taxes VATs that everyone paysIn his book Growing Public economic historian Peter Lindert notes that highbudget welfare states in general tax investment income less and consumption more His argument is that European social democrats realized that income taxes of the scale theyd need to fund a comprehensive welfare state would have a deleterious effect on growth and that the only way to sustainably pay for universal health care generous education and pension systems and so forth is to move toward more broadbased progrowth tax schemesWhich brings us back to Ted Cruzs flat taxThe term flat tax is mostly misleading It makes people think the flat tax is just an income tax but with one rate instead of many Its not really Rather its a kind of consumption tax  very similar to a VAT of the kind social democracies depend uponVATs work by taxing the difference between what a company paid on materials to make a product and what it sells that end product for the value added in other words As the Tax Policy Centers Len Burman explains the corporate tax side of a flat tax is just a VAT that also lets companies deduct the cost of wages Individuals then pay taxes on those wages themselvesEconomists tend to find that consumption taxes are better for the economy than income taxes because income taxes discriminate against saversTo see why imagine you make 50000 in wages and theres a flat 20 percent tax on all income Youd pay 10000 in taxes on your wages That leaves you with 40000Now youve got a decision to make do you want to take 5000 of the 40000 you have left and invest it or do you want to take that 5000 and spend it on a really awesome television If you invest it and make money off the stocks then the thing you bought with your money  the profits those stocks made for you  will get taxed again If you just buy the TV the government doesnt tax you a second timeUnder standard economic models eliminating this doubletaxing of savings promotes investment and thus boosts economic growth And its not just conservatives and libertarians arguing this a highly influential model by Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz both noted lefties gives this result A widely cited 2001 paper by David Altig Alan Auerbach Lawrence Kotlikoff Kent Smetters and Jan Walliser estimates that switching from income taxation to consumption taxation boosts growth in the long run by 19 to 94 percent depending on how you do itThe empirical evidence is murkier UC Berkeleys Danny Yagan found that the 2003 dividend tax cut  meant to reduce double taxation of savings just like consumption taxes  didnt do anything to help the economy But a recent paper by Tulanes James Alm and the IMFs Asmaa ElGanainy found that in 15 EU countries increases in VAT rates decreased consumption and boosted savings  exactly the result you get from the models The matter isnt open and shut but at the moment the weight of the evidence suggests consumption taxes are preferable for growth That gives credence to Linderts argument that to raise taxes enough to fund a welfare state without hurting growth too much you need to move to consumption taxationThe problem with consumption taxes is that theyre usually regressive VATs are sales taxes they make everything more expensive by a set percentage and because poor and middleclass people spend more of their incomes than the rich do the end result is that the VAT hits them more than it does the rich But there are a variety of ways to tax consumption without making the poor worse offThe simplest way would be to do take a flat tax but make it not yknow flat Recall that the main feature of the flat tax is its business component  again its like a VAT that subtracts out wages Its totally possible to pair that with a progressive tax on wages rather than a flat tax on wages The result is still a consumption tax but its a progressive oneThis idea  known as the X tax and originated by the late Princeton economist David Bradford  has been promoted in recent years by the American Enterprise Institute tax expert Alan Viard who along with Robert Carroll wrote an excellent book outlining a detailed X tax proposal The 2001 simulation by Altig et al found that replacing the income tax with an X tax would be better for growth then even the flat taxThe big problem with the X tax is that it doesnt touch capital income Mitt Romney wouldnt pay a thing So alternatively you could simply amend the income tax so that all savings is taxdeductible This would effectively turn the income tax into a consumption tax and do it in a way that makes sure capital income still gets hitBut the most reliable way to make a consumption tax progressive has nothing to do with the tax itself and everything to do with what the money it generates is used for Europes flat VATs are not themselves progressive the way an X tax or personal consumption tax are but they pay for transfer payments that are larger relative to income for lower and middleclass people than for the rich The overall system is progressive even if the tax isntSo theres a way to change the tax and transfer system so that its still progressive but doesnt punish savings and the change would likely boost economic growth Why arent Democratic politicians jumping all over thisThey flirt with the idea occasionally ThenHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi DCA stated that a VAT was on the table for funding healthcare reform in 2009 President Obama expressed openness to the idea in 2010 after his adviser Paul Volcker signaled support Volckers comments provoked Congressional outrage and the Senate voted 8513 to condemn the idea as a massive tax increase that will cripple families on fixed income but all but one of the 13 senators opposing that move were DemocratsBut years of Republicans promoting flat taxes and sales taxes have left a residual distrust for consumption taxation among liberals More to the point supplysiders insistence that marginal tax rates are the main determinant of the course of human history has done a lot to discredit among liberals the idea that taxes have much of an effect on growth at allThats fair so far as the recent debates in American tax policy go the idea that cutting the top tax rate from 396 percent to 35 percent could boost growth by any significant amount is nutty as are claims that big tax cuts like Ted Cruzs or Marco Rubios would boost growth so much theyd pay for themselves But the result of the backlash is that progressivity has become the only criterion by which many leftofcenter people judge tax proposals and more credible cases that tax reform could boost growth are ignored Thats really too bad especially for those who want adramatically larger welfare state Realistically that increase has to be paid for and consumption taxes are the obvious way to do itTo quote Paul Krugman if I can trade a somewhat regressive VAT for guarantees of decent retirement and universal health care Ill take itCorrection This post originally said that all 13 senators opposing an antiVAT amendment were Democrats Twelve were the 13th was thenSen George Voinovich ROH
