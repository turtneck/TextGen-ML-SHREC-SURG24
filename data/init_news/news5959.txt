The deal Tuesday to curb Irans nuclear weapons program came at the end of two years of an intricate ballet involving President Obama and the leaders of six other countriesBut as the debate moved from the negotiating tables of Vienna to the halls of the US Capitol Obama faced a new and complicated task to protect the agreement from opponents who would undermine it in Washington over the next two monthsI will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal Obama said Tuesday This is not the time for politics or posturing Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems It would take twothirds of both the House and the Senate to override such a vetoMost congressional Republicans remained deeply skeptical some openly scornful of the prospect of relieving economic sanctions while leaving any Iranian uraniumenrichment capability intact And Democrats offered only cautious endorsements of the deal that represents a cornerstone of Obamas foreign policy as Congress begins a twomonth review of the agreementHours after the deal was announced House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio accused Obama of abandoning his own objectives for the negotiations and called the agreement unacceptableIts going to hand a dangerous regime billions of dollars in sanctions relief while paving the way for a nuclear Iran he said If its as bad a deal as I think it is at this point well do everything we can to stop itSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said the deal appears to fall well short of the goal we all thought was trying to be achieved which was that Iran would not be a nuclear stateDemocratic leaders meanwhile mainly offered pledges to closely review the deal rather than outright endorsements In a morning statement Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid DNev called the agreement historic but he did not address the deal at an afternoon news conference until he was prompted by reportersMy staff hasnt read it I havent read it Reid said Lets find out what we have firstHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif called the deal the product of years of tough bold and cleareyed leadership from Obama but stopped short of a full endorsement Congress will closely review the details of this agreement she saidNot since George W Bush sought the approval of Congress to go to war has a president turned to lawmakers for their support on a matter of such international importance The congressional review of the deal will proceed according to a framework passed by Congress in May and signed into law by Obama It provides for a 60day review period during which lawmakers could do nothing and allow the agreement to take effect vote to approve the deal or vote their disapproval of itPassing a disapproval measure would have to survive the veto that Obama promised Tuesday Overriding that veto would require a twothirds vote in both houses  with the decisive vote likely to come in the Senate where the Republican majority is slimmerBroad Republican opposition to the agreement is expected after months of pointed statements and political maneuvering from GOP leaders Over Obamas objections Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a fierce critic of the negotiations to address Congress in March Shortly afterward 47 of 54 Senate Republicans signed a letter addressed to Iranian leaders that was intended to undermine the talksIsrael blasts Iran deal as one of the darkest days in historyAt least 13 Democratic or independent senators would have to join with Republicans to override an Obama vetoSome Democrats expressed pointed skepticism Tuesday starting with Sen Robert Menendez NJ who cosponsored the congressional review legislation In a statement he said the agreement ultimately legitimizes Iran as a thresholdnuclear state and doesnt end Irans nuclear program  it preserves itRep Steve Israel NY the highestranking Jewish Democrat in the House said he would review every word sentence and paragraph of the deal to ensure it satisfies my continued concernsUntil then he said you can continue to count me in the skeptical columnFew Senate Republicans indicated Tuesday that they were inclined to vote in favor of the dealSen Bob Corker RTenn chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has for months struck a relatively measured tone on the negotiations but said Tuesday that the deal amounted to managed proliferationI would say the agreement has taken a downward trend he saidCorker said he expected to hold hearings over the coming weeks before Congress breaks for its August recess but said the votes would probably be held in September  giving skeptics crucial weeks to marshal oppositionUnder the review law the 60day clock does not begin until the agreement is officially certified and submitted to Congress but it begins no later than five days after the deal is reached During the review period Obama is not permitted to relieve any Iranian sanctionsThe historic nuclear deal with Iran How it worksLawmakers have laid out a wide array of concerns including the terms under which international inspectors will be given access to Iranian facilities the pace of sanctions relief the extent that Iranians will be able to continue enriching uranium for peaceful purposes and the Iranian regimes support for terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyondIn recent days there has been close attention to the prospect that a UN arms embargo imposed in 2007 amid international concerns over the direction of the Iranian nuclear program might be lifted The agreement released Thursday set forth a path for the embargo on conventional weapons to be lifted in as little as five years and for those on ballistic missiles to be lifted in as little as eight yearsGen Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms traffickingLawmakers have seized on Dempseys quote in recent days as it appeared more and more likely that the arms embargo could be eased under the final agreementWho thinks its a good idea given the Iranians toppling of the Mideast to give them a lifting of the arms embargo that was not even part of the deal asked Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC during a morning appearance on MSNBC I would have never done that until they changed their behaviorThe announcement of the deal also triggered a wave of criticism from policy experts seeking to sway votes in Congress Experts at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy took aim at whether components of the deal would be sufficient to ensure Irans compliance and whether access to oil money now frozen in escrow accounts would allow it to make more mischief in the regionWhile the nuclear issue and Irans support of terrorism are ostensibly distinct they are in fact implicitly linked David Makovsky and Matthew Levitt wrote on the groups Web siteSen Dianne Feinstein DCalif offered one of the most robust defenses of the agreement to be found on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and predicted that even if Congress forced Obama to veto a disapproval it would not be overriddenAnythings possible but I just dont think so Feinstein said I think people are going to understand that were in a deteriorating situation in the Middle East and this offers the opportunity to turn the page  You know nations do change
