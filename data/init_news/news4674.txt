Donald Trump continues to rage against Hillary Clinton over her suggestion during the Democratic debate that Trump has become ISISs best recruiter Clinton argued that terrorists are using videos of Trump insulting Islam to recruit more radical jihadists and Trump has demanded an apologyThe Clinton camp has since walked back the video comment though her advisers continue to point to social media evidence of the broader claim that Trumps rhetoric has become a terror recruiting tool The Clinton camp has refused Trumps demand for an apologyMake no mistake Both Trump and Clinton must be very happy to be embroiled in this spat Indeed the Clinton camp has cheerfully fed the flames of this fight in what appears to be a concerted effort to boost Trump among GOP voters The theory may be that Trump benefits among those voters if he is perceived as a chief antagonist of Clinton thus helping him spread more intraGOP damageHeres the latest on this Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told a conference call of Clinton supporters that the Clinton camp takes the possibility of a Trump nomination very seriously The Wall Street Journal reports on the callOne person on the call mentioned the extent to which Mr Trumps name came up in the Democratic debate Saturday and asked if that represented a shift in the Clinton campaigns view of his viability as a candidate Mr Podesta said that Mr Trump has demonstrated to be a serious candidate for the Republican nomination and that he is someone who could very well be successful in their nominating process People have come around to the conclusion that this isnt justgoing to go away at some pointIts hard to know whether the Clinton camp really believes this But one obvious possibility is that the Clinton camp is signaling to top supporters that they should publicly make the case that Trump now looks like a genuinely viable candidate to win the GOP primary If so this takes the Clinton camps trolling of GOP voters to another level Hillary is attacking Trump because Democrats are afraid that hell become the nomineeBut there may be a deeper rationale here too As I reported the other day Democrats plan to increasingly make the case that Trumps simplistic bluster and belligerence are forcing the other GOP candidates to dumb down their rhetoric to match his thus revealing Clinton to be more prepared to lead in complicated and dangerous times than any of the GOP candidatesThis is a political and policy argument Democrats are claiming that Trumps rhetoric has become a threat to national security which in turn makes the other GOP candidates efforts to match it  or at least fail to condemn it in a fullthroated fashion  more consequential and reveals Clinton to be a steadier more reliable presence The bet is that while all the bluster may appeal to GOP primary voters it will taint the party in the eyes of the general election audience Clintons increasing efforts to highlight Trumps reckless antiMuslim demagoguery not only gives Trump a way to boost himself among Republican voters by arguing that he has emerged as Clintons chief foe its also designed to advance that larger argument TRUMP STILL LEADS BUT CRUZ IS CLOSING IN A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Donald Trump still leads with 28 percent of Republicans and GOPleaning independents nationally while Ted Cruz is a close second at 24 percent Marco Rubio has 12 percent and Ben Carson has 10 percentNotable details Trump leads Cruz among noncollege voters another sign thats where his base of support lies while Cruz dominates Trump among Tea Partyers and white evangelicals suggesting his assiduous courting of that demographic might be working Also Wheres that Rubiomentum CLINTON HOLDS VAST LEAD OVER SANDERS The new Quinnipiac poll also finds that Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 6130 among Democrats and Demleaning independents nationally Clinton leads among those who self describe as very liberal by 5242 and among those who are somewhat liberal by 6031 suggesting her campaign may be in the process of patching up whatever problems she had with the Democratic Partys left flankIndeed only 10 percent of very liberal Dems say they definitely wont support Clinton AMERICANS WOULD BE EMBARRASSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP One last fun nugget from the Quinnipiac poll 50 percent of Americans say they would be embarrassed by having Donald Trump as president while only 23 percent say they would be proud and another 24 percent say they would be neitherBut a plurality of Republicans 44 percent say they would be proud to have President Trump in the Oval Office while only 20 percent of them would be embarrassed by it TALK RADIO CONSERVATIVES RALLY TO CRUZ Politico reports on all the conservative talk radio hosts who are rallying to Ted Cruzs defense fending off attacks on the Texas Senator from Trump and Marco Rubio Notably radio conservatives are defending Cruz against Rubios false claim that Cruz once supported legalization as Rush Limbaugh does hereConservative radio is determined not to let GOP voters forget Rubios heinous support for comprehensive immigration reform which could give a big boost to Cruz over the long haul SANDERS HITS HILLARY OVER WALL STREET At Saturdays Dem debate Clinton said she wants to be loved by everyone including Wall Street On the campaign trail in Iowa Sanders went after Clinton over thisClinton has not embraced as robust a Wall Street reform agenda as the SandersElizabeth Warren wing of the party has wanted But Paul Krugman for one has argued that Clintons plan for Wall Street is better than the one Sanders has offeredIt will be interesting to how the GOP candidates attack this Its likely theyll blast the plan for hiking taxes AND THE TRUMP VULGARISM OF THE DAY At a rally in Michigan the Donald deconstructs Hillary Clintons debate bathroom breakTrump then described Obamas 2008 Dem primary victory over Clinton this way She was favored to win andshe got schlonged All this
