Jeb Bushs top challenge as a likely presidential candidate is to distance himself from his brothers policies But hes not doing that and in fact goes out of his way to defend himAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealUpdate This story was edited at4 pm after Mr Bushs Thursday afternoon remarks on IraqThis week Jeb Bushs foremost problem as a likely presidential candidate went on full display Can the former Florida governor get over his last name and his emotional personal tie to his brother the expresidentOn Thursday after three days of botched replies to a simple question Mr Bush finally said what most everyone expected him to say in the first placeKnowing what we now know what would you have done I would have not engaged I would not have gone into Iraq Bush said at a campaign stop inTempe Ariz according to The Washington PostBush said he had had trouble with the question because he didnt want to appear ungrateful for the sacrifices made by Americans during the war But the episode leaves lingering questions about Bushs willingness to distance himself from his brother former President George W Bush in the younger Bushs expected bid for president in 2016Republicans were baffled Monday when Mr Bush told Megyn Kelly on Fox News that he would have authorized the 2003 Iraq invasion even given what we know now about the faulty intelligence Ted Cruz Marco Rubio Rand Paul Chris Christie and John Kasich  all Republicans running for president or considering it  say they wouldnt have invadedDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton says her yes vote as a senator was a mistakeThe next day on Sean Hannitys radio show Bushwalked back his comment I interpreted the question wrong I guess he said But when asked again he demurred I dont know what that decision would have been Thats a hypotheticalThats a hypothetical is the allpurpose dodge any politician can deploy when he or she doesnt want to answer a question And it made Bush look unpreparedJeb should have been prepared to answer that question the second his brother stepped on Marine One to leave the White House in 2009 says Ford OConnell author of Hail Mary The 10Step Playbook for Republican Recovery You get four or five mulligans on the presidential campaign trail and he just used one of them upThe Iraq War remains deeply unpopular with the American public in June 2014 75 percent of the US public said the Iraq War was not worth the costs according to a CBS NewsNew York Times pollThe good news for Bush is that most Americans arent yet paying close attention to the 2016 race Its been 13 years since he last ran for office  reelection as governor of Florida  and hes still getting his political sea legs back Though hes not expected to announce for president until midJune hes effectively already running On Wednesday he said outright that he was running then quickly reversed himselfAt the heart of his campaign lies a paradox the great blessing and the great burden of the Bush nameHis fathers presidency 19891993 is remembered fondly by the general public though antitax conservatives still remember his breaking of the no new taxes pledge Bushs brothers presidency 20012009 gets lower marks Still Jeb Bush benefits tremendously from the political network his family opens up for him He could easily outraise the rest of the GOP field in the early going He has also assembled an Alist team of advisersBut his brothers legacy poses a particular burden not just Iraq but also the economic crisis at the end of his tenure And Jeb appears unwilling to throw brother George under the bus He even referred to his brother recently at a private event as an adviser on the Middle East a comment he didnt disown in his interview with Ms KellyThe real story in fact out of Bushs interviews with Kelly and Mr Hannity may be that he seemed to go out of his way to defend his brother on IraqNews flash for the world Bush told Kelly If theyre trying to find places where theres space between me and my brother this may not be one of thoseTo Hannity Bush said this The simple fact is mistakes were made as they always are in lifeGeorge W Bush seems acutely aware of the liability he poses to his brother Last month at an event in Chicago he practically gave Jeb permission to disown his recordHe doesnt need to defend me the second President Bush said according to PoliticoHe also acknowledged his mothers famous comment from 2013  Havent we had enough Bushes  and said Thats why you wont see me out there on the campaign trailIf nothing else its already clear that Jeb Bush wont sail to the Republican nomination as his father and brother did back in the day The theory that he could clear the GOP field by vacuuming up establishment money has already proved false He leads barely in national polls of Republican candidates but hasnt broken out of the pack In any case its too soon to put much stock in pollsOn Tuesday Bush advisers acknowledged that he is skipping the Iowa Straw Poll on Aug 8 a beauty contest that contains no upside for him as it favors candidates who appeal to the social conservative base of the Iowa GOP Thats a smart move analysts sayBushs real challenge is to present himself as a Republican of the future not a man burdened by his familys past With fresh faces like his former protg Sen Marco Rubio R of Florida and Gov Scott Walker R of Wisconsin gaining positive notice in the early going the battle is joined But so far Bush is still stumbling over the pastSome analysts suggest that Bush may be playing a completely different game  that he is just going to say what he thinks stay true to his family and let the chips fall where they may Perhaps this is his way of running joyfully as he described his possible campaign in early 2014 Let Jeb be Jeb is how Bush adviser Mike Murphy described the philosophy to The New York Times last DecemberPerhaps this brand of political authenticity will catch hold among Republican voters  and along with it some of the Bush views that dont fit standard Republican orthodoxy at the moment Among those are support for legalization of undocumented immigrants and the Common Core education reforms as well as an unwillingness to sign antitax pledgesIf Bush somehow manages to bend the GOP in his direction he could represent the partys future But thats a big if
