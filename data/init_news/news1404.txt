We Are Change  Remember remember the 5th of November Gunpowder treason and plot I see no reason why the gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot Old English folk rhyme anonymousBy Barrie Zwicker Special thanks to Truth and Shadows Today November 5 th  is Guy Fawkes Day also known as Gunpowder Day In 2016 its the 411 th anniversary of The Gunpowder Plot or Gunpowder Treason as it was first calledIt also happens to be my 78 th birthday So Ive been more aware of Guy Fawkes Day than most Im especially happy about how ubiquitous the Guy Fawkes mask has become The mask was hugely popularized in the movie V for Vendetta  As stalwart 911Truther Kevin Barrett wrote a year ago in a piece entitled  Unmasking Media Lies Why BBCs VforVendetta Mask Piece is Fawked Up V for Vendetta may be the most revolutionary film ever made Its obvious message is Lets get out there and visit some rough justice on the treasonous bastards who created the 911 and 77 media spectaculars and destroyed the freedoms for which weve been fighting for centuries Watch on YouTube V for 911 Vendetta Past Present and Future It is also possible to read the film from an interior psychological perspective Rather than just a call to action its about the psychological process of coming to terms with the 911 and 77 inside jobs by allowing oneself to feel the overwhelming anger that is the natural response Once one has faced the facts overcome fear and come to terms with ones own righteous anger THEN its time for revolution The real message of the V mask is simple We know you bastards blew up the Trade Center We know youre blowing up the economy We know youre lying to us 247365 We know youre trying to keep us poor and weak and fearful and impotent Well guess what Were not afraid of you Were not afraid to die And were coming to get you No wonder the BBC is afraid to admit what the V mask really means Yet for the first 71 years of my life I had entirely the wrong idea about the gunpowder plot what happened who was really behind it and its impact on history An impact that continues to this day It was in 2005 that I read I read Webster Tarpleys superb book 911 Synthetic Terror Made in USA right after it came off the press He introduced me to the historical elementTrue the brazen events of 911 and the mindboggling coverup that followed opened my eyes to stateexecuted terror frauds and the power they deliver to the dark forces that order them But I didnt know from nuthin about the Gunpowder PlotNor at that time did I appreciate that it and 911 are but two examples from thousands of false flag operations that have changed historyFalse flag ops are the leastrecognized highestimpact category of human deceit In terms of emotional wallop even the most brilliant lies perpetrated by the most talented demagogues pale in comparison to a big false flag op for the power to manipulate the public On this anniversary lets look more closely at this particular false flag op for some lessons As William Faulkner put it in his Requiem for a Nun  The past is never dead Its not even past Then we will touch briefly on one of the most recent false flag ops  a leading edge digital one that perversely misappropriates the Fawkes name On the Throne of England in 1605 sits James the First a Protestant the King who ordered the translation of the Christian Bible that bears his nameAs midnight approaches on November the 4th  the eve of the traditional opening of Parliament  armed agents of the King raid a basement room of the Houses of Parliament They discover and apprehend one Guy Fawkes His age 36 coincides with the number of barrels of gunpowder they find with him They find a tunnel leading to the room Fawkes is a known agitator for the rights of English Roman Catholics In his possession are a pocket watch a rarity in those daysHad he succeeded in detonating the gunpowder the next morning King James and his queen would be mangled bodies as would all the members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons Smoking rubble would be all that would remain of the Palace of Westminster complex including historic Westminster AbbeySo goes the palace version of the events of the late evening of November the 4 th  1605 The English public is stunned Its the equivalent of 911 A cataclysm Adam Nicolson describes it in his book Gods Secretaries The Making of the King James Bible  Upon his arrest according to the official account Fawkes admits his purpose was to destroy king and ParliamentThat there was some kind of plot is not in doubt By November the 8 th  on the rack Fawkes names 12 coconspirators Those not killed where they are tracked down are found guilty of treason later in a trial lasting less than a day They and Fawkes are hanged drawn and quarteredThe following Sunday November the 10 th the King James Version of the plot is broadcast from the leading pulpit of the Church of England that of William Barlow Bishop of Rochester Barlow thunders that the enemy meaning papists is satanic in its wickedness The King their hopedfor victim on the other hand is Mr Nicolson writes characterized as an unqualifiedly good man    virtually a ChristfigureSoon all the pulpits of England echo the official account Between 1606 and 1859 the Fifth is remembered in an annual service of thanksgiving in every Anglican church writes James Sharpe in Remember Remember A Cultural History of Guy Fawkes Day Until 1959  it was against the law in Britain not to celebrate Guy Fawkes Day Celebrate because from the beginning the public was giving thanks that the realm was saved and the treasonous conspirators dispatched For centuries effigies of Fawkes were burnedThe palace version becomes historical truth for humankind including me  duped again  for most of our livesMr Nicolson and others now cast serious doubt on that version Many anomalies concerning the events have surfacedFawkes was not apprehended in a basement room but rather a ground floor room one remarkably easily rented by the plotters There was accordingly no tunnel The authorship of the letter by which the King learned of the plot is murky It was turned over to the King by the Royal Chancellor Sir Robert Cecil the Earl of SalisburySir Cecil I would characterize as the Dick Cheney of his day Because plots were common at that time Cecil had an efficient network of spies seeded among Roman Catholic dissidents He kept tabs on all plots the spies discovered This one featured a large cast of characters from several citiesCecil kept the King in the dark about the plot except for the obscure letter The gunpowder it turned out was of an inferior nature unlikely to have achieved much result This was odd as Fawkes definitely knew a thing or two about gunpowder He had developed expertise with it while serving with distinction in Spains army against Protestant rebels in the Netherlands Its conceivable the gunpowder could have been switched by someone loads of it existed because of all the hostilities Some handwriting on Fawkess confession differed from the restIgnored until recently is a book by Jesuit historian John Gerard What Was the Gunpowder Plot The Traditional Story Tested by Original Evidence  Gerard died in 1606 but his book was not published for almost three centuries in1897 an interesting temporal fact in itself While its true as Sharpe writes that accounts of the plot differ as per the biases of the authors I find Gerards account pretty compelling He writesWhen we examine into the details supplied to us as to the progress of the affair we find that much of what the conspirators are said to have done is wellnigh incredible while it is utterly impossible that if they really acted in the manner described the public authorities should not have had full knowledgeExactly The evidence points to a particular kind of falseflag operation There are many variations In some 911 being the leading example an outrageous event is carried out by the perpetrators and blamed on the chosen enemy In others example Gulf of Tonkin nothing happens but a fiction blames the chosen enemy The Gunpowder Plot is midway a plot was underway but the precise intentions of the plotters can never be known The main feature is that with or without taking a hand in the plot the Cecil elements manipulated events brilliantlyCecil was heavily involved in an influential London group known as the war party It wanted to push James into a confrontation with the Spanish Empire from which the groups members hoped among other things to extract great personal profitThe war party considered it politically vital to keep persecuting Roman Catholics Sir Cecil set out writes Tarpley to sway James to adopt his policy by means of terrorismIt amounts to this Either Cecil and the war party made the Gunpowder Plot happen or they let it happen and made sure of a brilliantly timed expos And if they let it happen they made it happenJames himself had negotiated peace with Spain the previous year His other advisors told him there was no chance of a general Catholic uprising and that no foreign Catholic powers were involved in the plotThe King knew Sharpe writes that the reality of Catholicism in England around 1600 was very different from the image conjured up in government propaganda and contemporary Protestant myth Sharpe again even in the face of  persecution it seems that most of Englands Catholics remained loyal to their monarch and wanted nothing more than to be allowed to practice their faith unmolested The parallel with most Muslims living in the UK and Canada today springs to mindFor his part James downplayed the plot James and his ministers Sharpe writes showed more restraint than many modern regimes faced with similar problemsNevertheless the power of the imagery of what might have happened burned itself into the publics psyche and was repeatedly fanned by the Protestant and war promoting establishmentsThe outcomes of this ongoing propaganda campaign are incontestable Tolerance for English Roman Catholics is replaced by a period of terrible bloodletting for them Numbers are killed Catholics homes are burned A string of laws is passed restricting their rights and libertiesThe English become fixated on homeland security Nicolson writes An inclusive irenic idea of mutual benefit between Spain and England  trade between the two countries because of the peace treaty had been growing is replaced in England by a defensiveaggressive complex All Catholics of all shades never mind their enthusiasm or not for the planned attack are identified as the enemyMost significantly war with Spain ensues Englands course is set for a century of wars against the Spanish and Portuguese empires England for various reasons comes out victorious and on these war victories the British Empire is founded in blood deception and conquest Theres no way of knowing whether the British Empire  and all the consequences of its rule from Capetown to Canada to Iraq to its American colonies  would have emerged anyway or in what form or at what pace but we can see in retrospect that the Gunpowder Plot was pivotal in what did transpireIt would be a failure of imagination not to see the parallels with 911 and society in our day of blanket war propaganda teeming with covert agents everencroaching surveillance ever decreasing civil rights and liberties and either helpless or conniving leadersLets look at false flag ops generically Its difficult in my opinion to overestimate their terrible place in history and their place in making history terrible Think of the wars and millions of deaths that followed the Gunpowder Plot the sinking of the Maine in Havana Harbour in 1898 that kickstarted the US Empires expansion to the Philippines and beyond the sinking of the Lusitania that brought the USA into World War I the torching of the German Reichstag that boosted Hitler to power and enabled his bloody grab for world domination the assassination of John F Kennedy that yanked US foreign policy onto a warpath the alleged attacks during LBJs presidency the next year by North Vietnamese torpedo boats on US warships in the Gulf of Tonkin  attacks that simply did not take place but that provided the basis for the Tonkin Gulf Resolution passed 882 in the US Senate That resolution constituted the legal basis for escalating the Vietnam War with an eventual death toll of more than 3million And 911 To name a fewWithout false flag ops most wars would be harder to launch Some would barely be possible Think of the unprecedented millions of peace marchers who took to the streets prior to the invasion of Iraq If the deceptions are used to justify such wars were exposed earlier by a skeptical independent ferociously investigative media we all would be living in a different world Millions of horrible deaths and all the accompanying grief could have been avoided And the military would have to put on bake sales to raise fundsThere always has been a yearning for peace among the normal everyday citizenry finding meaningful work marrying and raising a family tilling the soil writing poetry inventing things or  as Pierre Berton said was his favourite thing  getting smashed with your friendsThere are exceptions but the horrible norm is that for wars to be launched maintained or expanded the people have to be fooled And history proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the most surefire way to accomplish that is to lumber them with an iconic outrage allegedly perpetrated by the designated enemy of the day And we go on sinking ever further into the mire of deaths  the deaths of innocents the death of promise for a better future the death of honest history the death of coming to grips with reality  because each new false flag op draws power from the fictions planted about all the previous onesAnd so the elites continue to hide their four aces in a rigged game Their most closely guarded secret retains the potency of the first one Remember remember the 5 th of November the 11 th of September Faulkner and George Santayanas comment that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat itBut today we also have to remember the future Added to the false flag ops false flag agents and false flag organizations of old are false flag digital organisms sent to infect particular publics One of the most recent of which Ive become aware is a rogue individual or group identified as  This tricky entity FawkesSecurity on Monday October 22 released via YouTube and Pastebin a bomb threat against an unidentified US Government buildingI for one smell digital gunpowderFawkesSecurity claims to be associated with the Anonymous collective The threat of violence however goes against everything Anonymous says it stands for Sources at Anonymous are denouncing FawkesSecurity and its bomb threatA report on this  from which I am quoting can be found at ExaminercomFollowing is an excerpt from the message of FawkesSecurityDear citizens of the world  We are anonymous As of today 200 kilograms of composite Nitroglycerin and commercial explosives have effectively been concealed in a government building situated in the united states of America on the 5th of November 2012   we are anonymous  we are legion  we do not forget  we do not forgive  on the 5th of November you will expect us As the Examiner report says the video displays many of the standard trappings of associated with Anonymous and yet the threat of violence is completely out of step with the ethos that guides Anonymous The Examiner report addsMultiple social media accounts have denounced FawkesSecurity and their bomb threat Many speculate FawkesSecurity is a false flag operation conducted by government agents in an attempt to discredit Anonymous Others speculate that FawkesSecurity is simply misguided and unfamiliar with the bullet proof idea that is AnonymousWhatever the case those who wrote the text above cant punctuate or capitalize worth a damnThe digital and physical worlds are not separate Agents of the state infest both Although unlikely if the threat by FawkesSecurity were to be carried out today one outcome could be to seriously besmirch Anonymous The question of whether Anonymous itself might be a false flag op or is or could be infiltrated or otherwise manipulated is one to be asked and answered further down the rabbit hole Such is the ultraelusive nature of reality todayWeve come a long way from 1605 technically but the general scheme is the same deception rides high wide and uglySegments of this post were originally published in an op ed page piece the author had published on November 5 th  2005 in The Globe and Mail others come from
