Bill Scher made the argument from the left as well as anyone could while this piece by the Wall Street Journals Gerald Seib coming from the centerright was more predictable and vexing Paul Waldman took a shot at it back in August here The Washington Posts Phillip Bump followed and endorsed Seibs argument But those takes rely at least in part on the notion that if Republicans gain the Senate theyll either have an incentive to help govern  or theyll shame themselves in the eyes of the American public if they dont Unfortunately neither premise is trueIn fact Im concerned that worsening political dysfunction perpetuates itself by convincing more Americans that politics is futile The Obama coalition in particular  younger less white less well off than even prior coalitions of Democrats  has gotten so little thats tangible from its historymaking turnout in 2012 and yes Ive read that Krugman piece and I mostly agree The prospect of its coalescing to become a permanent force in American politics has been at least postponed if not thwarted entirely by the deliberate GOP sabotage of the political processFor me the backdrop to this depressing midterm election is not merely ISIS and Ebola but continued unrest in Ferguson Mo where it seems unlikely Officer Darren Wilson will face consequences for shooting Michael Brown From New York to Los Angeles the issue of police violence just gets worse Theres increasing activism on the issue which is great to see  the crowds that turned out for Ferguson October over the weekend and into Monday were inspiringYet little of the activism is tied to voting at least partly because the electoral system has done so little to solve the problem even in cities with liberal mayors New York alone has paid a half billion out to the victims of police abuse just since 2009 Im excited by the new young leadership on police issues even as Im worried about this election  and maybe that combination makes me uniquely unable to deal with the notion that Democrats losing the Senate next month could have a silver liningBill Scher reprised his Politico argument on MSNBCs Up with Steve on Saturday continuing to press the case that Republicans will suffer politically if they look like a completely dysfunctional party incapable of governing Scher unlike Seib holds out no false hope that the GOP will get its act together and compromise with Obama if it wins back the SenateBut Republicans already look like a completely dysfunctional party incapable of governing and theyre on the verge of another great midterm win A year after the government shutdown its shocking even to me how little it ultimately cost the party politically Everyone knew that October 2013 polls werent as important as October 2014 and that the GOP would have a year to recover  but even I didnt believe that they would so completelyThe shutdown cost the economy 24 billion in growth It showed the nation the incompetence of House GOP leadership It exposed the civil war in the Senate The country saw that the party was craven dysfunctional agendafree and not merely incapable of governing but uninterested in it After the shutdown the share of voters identifying themselves as Republican dropped to 25 percent in Gallup polling the lowest level in 25 years and polls showed Democrats might have a shot at taking back the HouseBut a year later Republicans are in no danger of losing the House and have a better than even chance to take back the Senate Even at the time it was clear that a feckless frenetic media  which immediately went on to treat Obamacare web site glitches as just as catastrophic as the GOPs shutdown debacle  would let the party off the hook Yet so have voters The Republican base is more than content to have its leaders do nothing but block and sabotage Obama And the Democratic base still disproportionately sits out the midterms which lets the obstructionists dominate the agenda Seib holds out hope that a GOP Senate might be able to deliver on immigration reform Continued Beltway optimism about that prospect is delusional Given that the Senate already passed a slightly bipartisan bill GOP control wont change anything Sadly even the president fell for the fiction that the House would eventually take up the issue for far too long postponing executive action on deferring deportations so that he couldnt do it before the midterms  and now theres worry about depressed Latino 2014 turnout as a result Lets hope nobody in the White House falls for that again Scher takes special comfort from the fact that 2016 looms giving the GOP the opportunity to work out its dysfunctional family issues under the whitehot spotlight of a presidential campaign Theres no doubt 2016 will be much better for Democrats The base turns out for presidential elections and the Senate map that year will be as tough on Republicans as it is in 2014 on Democrats forcing the GOP to defend more seats and offering their rivals more pickups All of that is a given But even a 2016 rout is unlikely to force Republicans to focus on a policy agenda and commit to governing again All they have to do is thwart the plans of President Hillary Clinton or whomever and reap the rewards two years later Until the Democrats structural disadvantage in voter turnout is corrected American politics is an endless feedback loop of futility little or no policy change leads to a discouraged electorate which ensures little or no policy change which guarantees more voter apathy Democrats may yet keep the Senate and if they do it will come down to greater grassroots and national emphasis on turning out unmarried women voters more on that later this week But if they dont there will be no silver lining Sure it will be entertaining to watch de facto House Speaker Ted Cruz make life even more miserable for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Its a given that the 2016 Republican primary race will be as big a freak show as 2012 and maybe even with Mitt Romney again too But this optimist no longer believes the GOP will pay any lasting price for more cartoonish dysfunction But the rest of us will for a long time
