The global climate negotiations scheduled to take place at the end of this year in Paris are not a time for empty rhetoric or halfhearted commitments to cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions President Obama reminded the world Monday evening On the contrary he stressed This year in Paris has to be the year that the world finally reached an agreement to protect the one planet that weve gotwhile we still canSpeakingat a meeting of Arctic Circle nations in Anchorage AlaskaObamaoutlined the science behind his urgent call for climate action and stressedthat failure this time is not an optionOn this issue of all issues there is such a thing as being too late he said That moment is almost upon usThe warning rings frighteningly true as time is indeed running out not just for an Obama climate deal but for any climate deal As talks began last year in Lima Peru for a draft of the agreement intended to be signed and sealed this December in Paris experts reminded the delegates that the world has already used up nearly twothirds of its carbon budget  the amount of carbon we can continue to pour into the atmosphere while still having a chance at keeping warming below two degrees Celsius Its a limit some experts contend that weve already in effect blown past Yet with the day of reckoning nearing negotiations arent where they should be to say the least fewer than 60 countries representing just 61 percentof the worlds emissions have submitted their goals for cutting back many of which are considered to be not nearly ambitious enough In June UN SecretaryGeneral Ban KiMoon complained that talks were moving at a snails paceObama emphasized that the US is on track to meet its submitted goal  a 26 to 28 percent decrease in emissions from 2005 levels by 2025  thanks in large part to the finalization of the EPAs new regulations for coalfired power plants There isunfortunately still reason to doubt the sincerity of the presidents commitment to the radical action he says is needed Obama continues to pressthe fact that climate change is not only real  deniers he scoffed are on their own shrinking island  but a crisis that were experiencing right now a point driven home by his decision to speak from Alaska where the impacts of climate change are already taking a significant toll Yet at the same time his administration has allowed Shell to go ahead and drill for oil in the Arctic a decision that to many feels irreconcilable with his insistence that the world must address the key causes of climate change as quickly as possible  not to mention the contention among experts that our best hope of preventing climate catastrophe requires us to leave all of the Arctics oil and gas reserves in the ground I am not trying to suggest that there are not going to be difficult transitions that we all have to make Obama conceded Still he said This is within our power This is a solvable problem if we start now
