As predicted by anyone who knows how the FBI works and more importantly by anyone who knows the actual law in question Hillary Clinton wont be indicted by the FBI or the Justice Department over the use of a private email server Firstly conspiracy theorists and Hillary haters alike have been peddling the misinformation that the FBI is capable of indicting people which its not Secondly even if the FBI could singlehandedly indict someone which it cant theres clearly no evidence proving Hillary deliberately broke the lawWe also know that the announcement by the FBIs James Comey on Tuesday wont dissuade the aforementioned Hillary haters from continuing to beattodeath the Benghazi issue and everything orbiting it including the email server even though every investigation has turned up nothing and this includes investigations by the hyperlitigious Republicans who have no reason to exonerate Hillary and every reason to summarily jail her And among the usual suspects whose indictment fantasies border on obsessive theres Donald TrumpTrump joins a growing faction of politicians and observers who are actively abusing the rigged card whenever events dont go their way Broadly speaking Trumps been transparently courting disaffected Bernie Sanders loyalists by echoing their claims of a rigged primary process despite the fact that Bernie himself stated that the process was fair and square Bernie even went so far as to explicitly tell CBS News that the system is not riggedNevertheless garment rending over rigged votes or rigged investigations in America is indicative of the growing influence of conspiracy theory marketeering here fueled primarily by social media gossip and the exploitative rantings of radio flimflam artist Alex Jones whos made a fortune by taking advantage of those who are predisposed to believing wild schemes about sinister plots to undermine democracy Losing an election Well then its not that you ran a shoddy campaign the system is obviously rigged against you No scandal where you wrongly insisted there was one Rigged Or if your career and personal wealth are predicated upon marketing in allegations that the system is rigged then naturally everything is rigged Except that is the deeds of Jones and Trump who always deal in truths rightIn the social media age the old maxim is again proved a lie travels halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on The notion of a rigged system from toptobottom has become so entrenched that not even 13 published reports the involvement of 10 congressional committees the testimony of 252 witnesses the convening of 33 congressional hearings and 7 million in funding for the Benghazi select committee can dislodge it from the deranged brainpans of those who simply want the Benghazi conspiracies to be true Jones and Trump are observant enough to understand that social media users in particular are suckers and easy marks unthinkingly retweeting quick hits about unsourced or entirely fake claims If your Facebook news feed isnt festooned with fake articles inadvertently shared by friends who never bother to think critically and thats if they read the article in the first place before posting which they often dont youre one of the lucky onesHeres the real crisis though When everything is rigged then nothing is By turning every news event into either a false flag or a red flag or both legitimately rigged aspects of the system become drowned in a bathtub of gibberish and halfbaked pulp fiction Between Bernie loyalists continuing to screech about rigged primaries and Trump people engaging in daily meltdowns about the rigged email investigation along with the rest of us who are tasked with swatting down both sets of scandals there are very few participants who are paying attention to real crises such as for example gerrymandering and voter ID laws Indeed were four months away from another presidential election and exactly nothing is being done to expand opportunities to vote while offering voters a fair slate of candidates that arent shuffled into office again and again because congressional districts were deliberately redrawn to suit their victories The latter gerrymandering is exploited by both parties while voter ID laws have been passed by Republicans for the express purpose of disenfranchising Democratic voters and therefore electing more Republicans Casting a ballot in the United States of all places should be easier than ordering a burger at a drivethru window yet we can already safely assume that precincts across the nation wont have enough ballots or enough voting booths and lines will be prohibitively long We also know that nothing is being done to roll back voter ID laws each one making it unconstitutionally difficult for students lowerincome workers and elderly voters to cast ballots And we know that a growing list of Republicans have confirmed our suspicions about the ID lawsthat theyre designed solely to put a thumb on the scales for the GOP a fact thats supported by the reality that theres a 000000031 chance of voter fraud based on a Bush administration study from 20022007 Conveniently too much attention is being paid to a completely disproved conspiracy theory about Hillary and Benghazi as well as evidencefree allegations of Hillary somehow rigging the primary election in her favor even though there are volumes of statistics as well as quotes from various Republicans confirming the true purpose of voter ID laws As for gerrymandering the practice and its consequences are selfevident Put another way theres a reason why the House of Representatives is loaded with unqualified demagogues who somehow remain in office long past their shelflife If as much attention was paid to actual conspiracies as is paid to racist garbage like Obamas birth certificate or the Vince Foster suicide voting would be easier and wed have a real chance to elect a better and more competent litter of politicians for the 115th Congress
