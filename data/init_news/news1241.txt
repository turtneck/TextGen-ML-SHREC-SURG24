Donald Trump the actual Republican candidate for president now endorsed by his party leaders openly said he wants to exclude someone from a government job because of his race and ethnicityAs the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday Trump said he wants to disqualify the federal judge overseeing the Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers associationMr Trump said US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an absolute conflict in presiding over the litigation given that he was of Mexican heritage and a member of a Latino lawyers association Mr Trump said the background of the judge who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern US border Im building a wall Its an inherent conflict of interest Mr Trump saidThis is pure racism Theres no subtlety no dog whistle no coded languageSomehow this isnt too surprising Trump is after all the presidential candidate who launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and he proposed banning all Muslims from entering the USAnd with this latest remark Trump is just turning the thinly veiled subtext into text He had already previously brought up Curiels Mexican heritage suggesting that there was a conflict of interest because of it but not saying it quite so explicitlyReading this its hard for me a Hispanic American to avoid feeling a little personally insulted This suggests that Trump would probably dismiss my opinion  indeed this article  because of my name Yet millions of Americans  and a major political party  want him to be president despite his clear racismMaybe the media plays a role here After all instead of calling it like it is CBS News MSNBC the Washington Post and the New York Times have called Trumps comments about Curiel racially charged and racially tinged the weasel words the media typically uses to describe racism It makes one wonder What would it take for them to finally call Trump or his remarks just plainly racist If claiming a qualified vetted judge shouldnt be able to do his job because of his race and ethnicity isnt racist then what the hell isPerhaps the problem is Hispanic people are vastly underrepresented in media As the journalism organization ASNE found racial minorities make up less than 13 percent of the field  despite making up about 38 percent of the total US population That might make it harder for a lot of journalists to see just how racist Trumps remarks areIf thats the case maybe it would be helpful for the predominant white journalists in the field to consider If President Barack Obama or President Marco Rubio said all white people should be banned from acting as judge in a court case against him would that be considered racist And how is that any different from what Trump is doingThere should be no doubt about it now Donald Trump is racist He wants to exclude people from government jobs because of their race and ethnicity That is the literal definition of racism The media shouldnt shy away from pointing that out and the people supporting Trump should know thats exactly what theyre supporting
