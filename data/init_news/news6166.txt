  Bitcoin Soars As China Launches Crackdown On WealthManagement Products Oct 26 2016 336 PM 0 SHARES After trading in a tight range for much of the summer coiled within a 100 range around the mid500s over the past several weeks bitcoin has once again started to push higher closely tracking the decline in the Chinese Yuan as shown below However the most recent burst in bitcoin activity which sent it surging by over 20 overnight has little to do with any moves in the official Chinese currency which recently rebounded modestly tracking the recent dip in the dollar and is likely attributable to a long overdue crackdown on Chinas Wealthmanagement products a key component of Chinas shadow banking system As Bloomberg reported overnight  Chinas central bank is finally conducting a trial monitoring of banks offbalancesheet wealthmanagement products under its macroprudential assessment system A question one should ask perhaps is why the 19 trillion in asset locked up with WMPs had so far been exempt from regulatory supervision Just as notable going forward the WMPs will be included in calculating broadbased credit something we discussed last week when we showed just how vastly China is undercounting its broadest credit aggregate Total Social Financing by ignoring shadow debt  Currently the products arent included in the assessment framework however its not clear when or if the Peoples Bank of China will add them Bloomberg added Citigroup estimated that 13 trillion yuan 19 trillion of the products which are a key building block in Chinas shadowbanking system could be covered Other banks estimates are even bigger No matter the size the extra scrutiny will certainly cool growth of the unregulated products as China tries to rein in financial risks that could tank the economy Adding the products to the central banks calculations could help to emphasize requirements for lenders to limit dangers and maintain sufficient capital A change would mean regulators would be may be better able to control the pace of broadbased credit supply Judy Zhang a Hong Kongbased analyst at Citigroup said in a note WMP issuance and yields may shrink as lenders pass on extra costs to investors she said As Bank of America explained overnight in late 2015 PBoC officially introduced its MPA framework which expanded its focus from loans to credit in a broader sense covering not only loans but also banks bond investments equity rights and other investments financial assets bought with resale agreement and deposits with nondeposittaking financial institutions The MPA can make it more difficult for banks to adjust onbalance sheet assets to circumvent governments credit control The latest move adds banks offbalance sheet WMPs ie those without a principal guarantee to the mix This in theory should make it more difficult for banks to move assets off balance sheet  Chinese households companies and banks held a record 263 trillion yuan of wealthmanagement products as of June 30 and the China Banking Regulatory Commission has been tightening rules on WMPs since late 2014 Most of the products are nonprincipal guaranteed which means they reside off banks balance sheets The implications for th economy can be significant The cornerstone of PBoCs MPA is capital adequacy inline with Basel III So its possible that in the long term banks may be required to provide capital for at least some of its offbalance sheet assets including the WMPs As of Jun total balance of bank WMPs reached Rmb263tr Without considering future growth the additional amount under the MPA would be some Rmb155tr after deducting Rmb61tr products with guarantees already on banks balance sheet and Rmb47tr of cash and deposits This represents about 7 of banks onbalance sheet assets as of June Rmb217tr More important we should view the latest development in the broad context of policy tightening over shadow banking activities since early this year related reports linked in the sidebar However the most immediate practical consideration from the increased regulatory supervision of the 19 trillion in related product is that these funds many of which are of highly suspect origins will seek to shift away from the heightened scrutiny and find alternative venues Which may explain the latest jump in bitcoin as a modest portion of the funds locked up wealthmanagement products may have found itself into the digital currency promptly sending it higher by nearly 5 Should the crackdown on WMPs persist it may be just the catalyst to push bitcoin above its recent multiyear highs just why of 800 hit earlier this summer
