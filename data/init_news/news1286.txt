Bias bashers Vladimir Putin Condemns Europe for Upholding Child Rape Video The Russian president voiced his disgust at a decayed and immoral culture which has overtaken the West Print A society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow Ah Vienna A city that conjures up many delightful images The worlds finest coffee and strudel Cafes where the waiters still address you as Mein Herr and they havent changed the decor since the 19th century The worlds greatest music Mozart Beethoven Brahms A city of beauty and grandeur echoes of an empire of a former age And today a city where Muslim refugees are allowed to rape 10 year old boys in public toilets The Independent reports  A man who raped a 10yearold boy at a swimming pool in Austria has had his conviction overturned after judges found he may have believed the child consented Police said the 20yearold Iraqi refugee who has not been named assaulted his victim in a toilet cubicle at the Theresienbad swimming pool in Vienna on 2 December last year The child reported the rape to a lifeguard and his attacker was arrested at the scene reportedly telling officers in initial interviews that he was experiencing a sexual emergency after not having sex in four months Theresienbadjpg Viennas historic pools are not safe anymore The sexual emergency experienced by the rapefugee was apparently similar to the one experienced by 2000 rapefugees in the German city of Cologne on New Years Eve 2016 when they publicly raped 1200 German women as emasculated German men and police stood by and watched Apparently some of the women were merely groped The German government was appalled Thats why it decided to produce an illustrated manual teaching the refugees how to rape German women properly next time around Not to be outdone Austria has now decided to join its German brethren in refusing to defend even children from homosexual rape  as long as the children consent On Thursday Austrias Supreme Court overturned the rape conviction and ordered a retrial on the charge  Supreme Court judges ruled that the first court should have established whether the attacker thought his victim agreed to a sexual act and intended to act against the boys will We are in fact now witnessing the violent death of western civilization It is bad enough that Europe is being inundated by hordes of invaders of a culture religion and ethnicity totally incompatible with the West but most reprehensible of all is the total lack of any will to resist on the part of Europeans themselves and especially their governments with notable exceptions such as the Hungarians Far from it  they even take active steps to encourage and accommodate the invaders But we all know the real threat to Europe is not from millions of barbaric nonEuropean rapefugees its from Russia and Vladimir Putin Ask Poland Or Lithuania Russia is hell and Putin is the devil Heres what the devil himself had to say about this incident The Russian president said  I cant get through my head what they are thinking over there in Europe This is a result of the dilution of national traditions and values I cant even explain the rationale Is it a sense of guilt towards the migrantsA society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow It has no future Putin also noted that Russia as a state has encompassed multiple ethnicities and cultures for over 1000 years and that unlike Europe it has a proven track record of managing interethnic relations Despite the presence of a vocal liberal minority the great majority of Russians agree with their leader that if these are the kind of European values the West has on offer it is better to remain the backward conservative society that continually draws the unfettered ire of liberal paragons in Europe and America The only question is whether eastern European nations such as Ukraine Georgia and Poland  which are in their inherent culture and moral outlook far more similar to Russia than to the modern Germans Americans and French  will come to their senses in time to save themselves from the cultural rot devouring the core of the societies with which they are presently so enamored
