Nashville Tennessee CNN As opposition to Common Core began to swell in Tennessee Jeb Bush showed up to an education forum in March of last year advocating for state officials to keep the higher standards in placeNow a little more than a year later Bush returned to Nashville Saturday night to address the states GOP dinner but his push for the state to hold onto Common Core didnt succeed Earlier this month Republican Gov Bill Haslam signed a bill to review the controversial standards and rebrand them with a Tennesseespecific focusThe bill was widely viewed as a compromise between Common Core opponents  who wanted to get rid of it altogether  and supporters including Haslam who wanted to stay on track with the new assessmentsWhat happened in Tennessee has already happened in a number of states as the political momentum against Common Core has caught fire in the past two years fueled by an onslaught of criticism from conservatives who decry the standards as federal overreachAnd with New Jersey Gov Chris Christie  a oncestaunch enthusiast of Common Core  announcing this week that his state will gut the standards and come up with something else Bush who has yet to declare his allbutcertain candidacy remains the only toptier presidential hopeful who is still defending Common CoreThat doesnt mean he takes issue with states doing what Tennessee and New Jersey are attempting Hes made it clear that hes fine with states choosing an alternative path as long as those states maintain high benchmarks for studentsI think the governor Haslam has every right to do anything as it relates to education policy Bush told reporters Saturday night with Haslam standing by his side This should be a state issue And Washington should have nothing to do with this at allStill Bush  unlike other 2016ers  is not backing away from his endorsement of Common Core as an effective method of measuring student learning His brother after all pushed and ultimately signed No Child Left Behind in early 2002 which imposed test score standards on schools with lowerincome students that received federal fundingAs for Common Core Jeb Bush has expressed frustration with how the standards have been prone to misinformation that have in part helped turn the issue into a political footballBecause people have a different view of what Common Core is am I supposed to back away from something that I know works he asked at the same event in BedfordAs twoterm governor of Florida from 19992007 Bush focused heavily on education reform which included implementing higher standards as well as a school voucher program After he left office he launched a nonprofit called the Foundation for Excellence in Education that ultimately became a leading proponent of Common CoreContrary to what some believe Common Core standards were not developed by the federal government but by the National Governors Association along with help from state education leaders parents and teachers The standards dictate what students in elementary school and high school should know by the end of each grade and its up to the states to come up with testing and curriculum that align with those measurementsThe federal government got involved when it gave states financial incentives to adopt higher standards Those standards didnt have to be Common Core but since the standards were available 46 states have adopted them since 2010 though some have since changed or eliminated themWhile Common Core has sometimes been misunderstood perception is reality in politics said Gregory Gleaves a Republican strategist in Tennessee If the perception is out there that it comes from DC then it is a political problem And that was the case for those who supported Common CoreDespite praising it during his first term Christie on Thursday noted that hes heard constant complaints from parents and educators I felt like we had to give it a fair chance I think we did Weve given it a fouryear chance he said They feel as if its been imposed upon them from WashingtonWisconsin Gov Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal  also potential Republican presidential contenders  were initially on board with Common Core and helped implement the standards during their first terms but later moved to get rid of themJindal especially has become one of the most vocal opponents of the standards and a lawsuit he launched against the federal government over Common Core got a hearing in a Baton Rouge court on ThursdayThats why some states renamed the standards to give them a more local feel Iowa for example named it the Iowa Core This method was encouraged last year by former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee who reportedly told state education officials to lose the Common Core name Rebrand it refocus it but dont retreatFor his part Bush has politely tried to correct some misunderstandings about Common Core on the trail without trying to get to deep in the weeds At an event in Manchester a retired math teacher told Bush that he got frustrated with spending more time testing than teachingBush explained that tests are only administered on the state and local level  not by the federal government  and proposed that states should mandate that school districts tell parents why they are giving so many tests That would better facilitate a conversation between parents and educators on how to strike a balanceAnd thats the way it should be You can do that in New Hampshire he said urging the man John Potucek whos also a state representative to push back on the state about his complaints But please make sure you have accountability around students cause the net result is youre going to have a declineAfter the event Potucek told CNN he was surprised by Bushs answer and while he didnt agree with everything Bush said he said his Common Core stance wouldnt be a dealbreakerHe explained it in a way that I wasnt expecting and I have to kind of chew on it a little bit he saidIt doesnt always go well though At a town hall in Dubuque Iowa a retired local school board member named Les Feldman grilled Bush about his support for Common Core After a tense backandforth that lasted several minutes a somewhat exasperated Bush ultimately concluded with Im just for higher standards manPeople want a clear yes or no answerWhile opponents dislike Common Core for a number of reasons Republican primary voters mostly disagree with it because they see it as federal overreach into what should be a local issue Andy Ogles the Tennessee state director for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity said a onesizefitsall approach to education doesnt workThe education needs in Silicon Valley versus rural Iowa versus Tennessee are very different he said Ogles lead a grassroots campaign that helped mobilize opposition to Common Core in Tennessee and pressure state officials to search for a different approachAs for Bush Ogles said he doubts conservative voters will buy the likely presidential candidates argument that he supports both Common Core as well as a states decision to opt out and choose their own standardsTheres certain core issues that most people want a clear yes or no answer and I think this is one of those issues You cant be for it and then also be for state standards he said Ultimately hes going to have to make up his mind especially here in the southern statesAides say theres no conflict in Bushs position States had to opt in and they can opt outThe bottom line Bush has argued is that students need better accountability and there are a variety of ways to make that happen with higher standardsTheres got to be a better way Bush said at an event in Manchester New Hampshire earlier this month saying only half of high school graduates are college or careerready We cant just keep fooling ourselves and just say oh its because  kids in poverty cant learnThats crap a man in the audience interjectedThank you brother Bush said forcefully That is crap
