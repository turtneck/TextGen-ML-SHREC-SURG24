A stormy opening night of the Democratic convention battered the Philadelphia arena on Monday as defiant Bernie Sanders supporters resisted attempts to persuade them to embrace Hillary ClintonImpassioned pleas for unity from a trio of Democratic women led by Michelle Obama raised hopes that the tumultuous first day of the convention may provide catharsisBut despite a direct plea for calm from Sanders many of his 1846 delegates in the arena repeatedly jeered at mentions of the partys presumptive nominee for the first hour or two of the eveningOnly after the Vermont senator appeared on stage at the Wells Fargo Center to urge them that the decision to choose between Clinton and Trump was not even close did the rebellion that has divided the party for much of the year show signs that it had reached its peakAny objective observer will conclude that  based on her ideas and her leadership  Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States Sanders said after three minutes of trying to quiet the floorSigns that a week of bigname Democratic speakers may help overcome the uncomfortable split also emerged when the first lady delivered a speech that brought the room to a standstillBecause of Hillary Clinton our daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that woman can be president of the United States said Obama with evident emotion in her voiceIn this election we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best  Between now and November we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago added the first lady We need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing Hillary Clinton as president of the United States of AmericaEarlier even a live rendition of Bridge over Troubled Water from Paul Simon ripe with symbolism could not disguise scenes of open revolt that proved far more vocal than expected and caused consternation on stageCan I just say to the Bernie or Bust people you are being ridiculous said Sanderssupporting comedian Sarah Silverman as she called for unity and backed Clinton with gustoI will be respectful of you And I want you to be respectful of me demanded Ohio congresswoman Marcia Fudge of the vocal Sanders supporters after she was repeatedly interrupted We are all Democrats and we need to act like itThe tone of the evening was set when the religious invocation at the start of the session was interrupted by rounds of competitive chanting for different corners for the room Bernie Bernie drowned out by Hillary Hillary and back again as the pastor stood awkwardly on stageCongressman Elijah Cummings had his speech about the struggle of his family against racism interrupted by Sanders supporters protesting against trade deals Other speakers nervously approached applause lines not knowing whether they would be booed or cheered by the fractious crowdAt times there was a faint echo of the mood at the Republican convention last week where every mention of Clintons name also prompted boos albeit much louder and without the balancing cheers of her supportersDuring a twominute pause while an official photograph was taken of the hall a lone shout of Bernie punctuated the awkward silenceAnd as a violent thunder storm forced the evacuation of marquee tents outside the arena party officials sent a warning to those outsideA text to Sanders delegates was also sent to try to calm the storm inside I ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor said the text signed Bernie It is of utmost importance you explain this to your delegationsYet the anger was intensified by leaked emails suggesting bias against the Sanders campaign by party officials and the Democratic National Committee began the night with an apologyThese comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process it said The DNC does not  and will not  tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens againThe turning point came when Obama took to the stage to a rapturous welcome from Democrats waving a sea of Michelle purple placardsShe called Clinton the president I want for my girls and someone who knows that the world is not black and white and easily boiled down to 140 charactersOnly one person I trust with the responsibility to be president and that is our friend Hillary Clinton said ObamaMassachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren a popular figure on the left also focused her attention on defeating Trump in a calm speech that drew out what was at stake in Novembers electionFor me this choice is personal its about who we are as a people said Warren blasting Trump as a man who thinks of nothing but himselfIn an extended call for Sanders supporters to join her on the journey toward backing Clinton Silverman memorably described her Republican opponent as calling people names from his goldencrusted sandbox because he was given money instead of human touchRichard Trumka president of the labor organisation the AFLCIO struck a similar note He thinks hes a tough guy Well Donald I worked in the mines with tough guys I know tough guys theyre friends of mine And Donald youre no tough guy Youre a bullyBut it fell to Sanders himself to list the ways in which Clintons policies increasingly matched the priorities of his supportersI understand that many people here in this conventional hall and around the country are disappointed at the result  I think its fair to say no one is more disappointed than I am he saidOur revolution continues  Election days come and go but the struggle of the people to create a government that represents all of us and not just the one percent continuesAfter he left the stage an email to supporters announced he was creating a new organisation called Our Revolution which would transform American politics to make our political and economic systems once again responsive to the needs of working familiesJohn Parker a delegate from Florida said he was not too concerned with the rancor within the party on the first day of its conventionDemocracy is not always pretty and people have the right to their opinion he said It is what it is But look around were all good nowTheres no choice but Hillary Clinton We cant take Donald TrumpGary West a Sanders supporter and delegate from Texas said the email leaks revealed a major bias in the party Having volunteered out of pocket to organize for Sanders across the country West said he had not yet warmed up to Clinton and the controversy made it more difficultWe all suspected that these things were going on the rigging of the primaries and the collusion between the DNC and the Hillary campaign West said And we were all told we were crazyNobody on stage has brought it up as an apology to Bernie as an apology to the delegatesIts an uphill battle for Hillary to get the support of the progressive movement he added She has to prove herself
