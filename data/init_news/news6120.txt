CNN As the first primaries creep ever closer candidates are feeling the pressure to rise above the pack and prove their electoral viabilityEach candidate came in with different marks to hit Jeb Bush needed a gamechanging performance Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz wanted to maintain their momentum And Rand Paul wanted to get into the actRubio was once again the debates maestro  hitting all the right notes and not once appearing to bend under pressureThe Florida senator skillfully weaved his personal biography as the son of immigrant parents as he answered almost every question he fieldedHe also flashed his foreign policy chops and seized the opportunity to set up a contrast between himself and the less mainstream noninterventionist views of his opponent Kentucky Sen Rand PaulI know that Rand is a committed isolationist Rubio needled before offering a deftly handled rebuttal to Pauls questioning of how spending billions on the US military was conservativeWe cant even have an economy if were not safe Rubio argued Yes I believe the world  I dont believe I know the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the worldAs during most of Rubios responses  the audience roared in approvalWhile Ben Carson did have to answer one question about the controversy that has swirled around his campaign in the last week Rubio did not have to field the rolling questions about his finances notably his use of a Republican Party credit card for personal expensesThe Texas senator gave another classic Cruz performance on Tuesday night one that could serve to further his steady rise in the polls  and the rising chorus of pundits viewing him as the eventual conservative alternative to whichever establishment candidate emerges in a two or threeperson raceThe firebrand conservative slammed critics who dub his hardline position on illegal immigration as antiimmigrant calling that offensive he staked out the middle ground as Rubio and Paul argued for opposing degrees of American intervention in Middle East conflicts and he played to his base by slamming moderate establishment RepublicansThe Democrats are laughing  because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty we will lose Cruz saidHe hit one snag reminiscent of a memorable 2011 debate moment when Rick Perry forgot the name of the third agency he would eliminate Cruz naming five federal agencies he would abolish named just four  twice naming the Department of Commerce leaving the Department of Education off of his listThe retired neurosurgeon is sticking with what works offering supporters more of the same mildmannered reserved demeanor that has rocketed him into a dead heat with TrumpCarsons most notable moment is one that is sure to please his supporters who have been devouring his upbraiding of the mainstream media over the course of more than a week of questions about crucial elements of his inspirational biographyThank you for not asking me what I said in the 10th grade Carson said to laughter as Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto asked him about the impact of the media scrutiny on his campaignWe should vet all candidates I have no problem with being vetted What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth Carson proclaimed People who know me know that Im an honest personHis closing statement was also a memorable break from the feisty tenor of the evening coming right after Rubio and Cruz trumpeted their campaign websites Carson softly showed why he is connecting on the trailIn the two hours of this  of this debate five people have died from drugrelated deaths 100 million has been added to our national debt 200 babies have been killed by abortionists and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair he said This is a narrative that we can change not we the Democrats not we the Republicans but we the people of America because there is something special about this nation and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctnessThe former Florida governor improved but he was still upstaged by the competitionAfter his widely panned debate performance last month Bush got to work He hired a media coach got angrier on the campaign trail and attempted to reboot his struggling campaign with a new slogan Jeb Can Fix ItThe takeaway Jeb Can Sort of Fix ItBush forced his way into more speaking time got his points across more clearly and concisely and  perhaps most importantly  didnt pick a fight he wasnt going to win against RubioBut he also still appeared awkward at times and let up too easily where other candidates would have pressed further adding to the impression that he lacks the verve to lead his party into the general election And with several other candidates  namely Rubio  soaring above the field with exceptionally strong debate performances Bushs slightly aboveaverage performance just doesnt rank in the same categoryBushs two best moments came when he confronted Trump Bush jumped in as Trump suggested the US should stop being the policeman of the world to say that the billionaire is absolutely wrong on thisAnd on Trumps plan to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US Bush said its just not possible and its not embracing American values  drawing more applauseAs he did in the last debate Trump once again showed that he can be one man on the stump before a crowd of zealous supporters and another when hes debating a range of issues before a national audienceTrumps tone was measured and his message was largely policycentric Even when he faced pointed criticism and pushback from his rival candidates  notably Ohio Gov John Kasich former Florida Gov Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina  Trump didnt get personal He challenged their contentions and stuck to his message Yes the federal government should deport all undocumented immigrants and build a wall he insisted No the US should not be the worlds policemanAnd while sticking with the debating style he first debuted at the CNBC debate Trump even appeared to show some improvement  delivering longer and more indepth responses to questions on everything from the economy to foreign policyBut some of Trumps persona bled out When Carly Fiorina tried to get a word in declared Why does she keep interrupting everybody The crowd wasnt happy and booedThe former Fortune 500 CEO reclaimed her spot as one of the fields most effective and hardhitting debaters  a quality that first hoisted her onto the main debate stage after a standout performance in the cycles first primary debateFiorina played to her strengths as a business executive status as an outsider and displayed her command of the biggest foreign policy issues confronting the USHer sharpelbowed strategy produced results as she nabbed her most impressive moment of the night when she jumped into a foreign policy debate between Trump and Bush  piling onto Bushs critique of the brash frontrunner before putting forward her own credentials for the commanderinchief postSkipping from country to country in the Middle East after laying out specific steps she would take to bolster the USs standing in the face of Russian aggression Fiorina came away breathless over time  but wildly successfulBut theres a big footnote Her previous strong debate performances didnt yield sustainable results because she failed to capitalize off her gains in the polls Shell need to have a strategy ready this timeThe Ohio governor didnt miss an opportunity to jostle his opponents and the moderators for more speaking timeAs Trump defended his plan to deport all undocumented immigrants living in the US Kasich looked to get in a word edgewiseMaria can we comment on that Can we comment on that he asked a moderator in one of the rare occasions in which he actually asked  and got  permission to interjectBut its a strategy that Kasich has applied to previous debates  both taking on Trump and jumping in at every opportunity  without earning any real upward movement in the polls following the last debateThe Kentucky senator with strong libertarianleanings showed up at the Republican debate Tuesday night  diving into an impassioned defense of his foreign policy views challenging the hawkish instincts of the Republican Party and most of his fellow contendersPaul hasnt shined through in the previous debates but a relatively long back and forth with the surging Rubio gave Paul the face time and the speaking time he needed to make his mark
