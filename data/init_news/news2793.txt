Istanbul CNN The suicide bomber who killed at least 10 foreigners Tuesday in a popular central Istanbul tourist area belonged to ISIS officials said  an attack that shows the groups nerve reach and capacity for terrorNo group claimed responsibility for the blast yet Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pinned blame on the group that calls itself the Islamic State which has entrenched itself in neighboring Syria and Iraq while proving willing time and again to lash out elsewhereAt least eight Germans died in the blast between the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque tourist attractions in Istanbuls cultural and historic heart German Chancellor Angela Merkel said warning that figure may rise A Turkish official earlier told CNN that at least nine Germans were killed Davutoglu indicated that the 15 wounded were from inside and outside his country with German Foreign Minister FrankWalter Steinmeier saying nine of those were GermanThey havent just targeted those who died Davutoglu said They have targeted the whole of Turkey and the whole worldBorn in 1988 the man responsible for the blast was not among the thousands being tracked by Turkish authorities having newly come into Turkey from Syria Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus saidThis violence can be pinned on many groups including forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar alAssad Yet ISIS has been behind many of the worst atrocities there and elsewhere in the region a fact thats made the terror group a top target for civilized countriesA member of NATO Turkey has increasingly been engaged in this fight  including allowing the United States to launch strikes from Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey and clamping down to curb more fighters from going through its territory to join the group ISIS has responded by singling out Turkey as a primary target and a recent issue of its Dabiq magazine had a cover showing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan alongside US President Barack ObamaAnd Davutoglu stressed Turkey wouldnt back down after Tuesdays attack urging his countrymen and people worldwide to unite against this threatWe will continue our fight against terror with the same firm attitude said the Prime Minister insisting his country will continue working with the USled coalition to combat ISIS We will never compromise not one single inchI saw shocked tourists falling to the groundTuesdays blast rattled Sultanahmet Square around 1020 am 320 am ET and brought a rush of ambulances and security forces to an area that would have been heavily guarded on any dayIve never heard such a loud explosion in my life Sener Ozdemir a 45yearold shop owner told Turkeys semiofficial Anadolu news agency Just after the incident I saw shocked tourists falling to the groundTargeting outsiders would be in line with attacks executed or inspired by ISIS which has enemies everywhere and has proven willing to strike those who dont subscribe to its twisted hardline version of Sharia lawTurkey is a popular destination for Germans and Germanys foreign ministry urged travelers in Istanbul to avoid public gatherings and tourist attractions for now after the attackThe Peruvian foreign ministry said in a statement that one of its citizens is in stable condition at a hospital after being woundedA Norwegian citizen was taken to a nearby hospital after the incident foreign ministry spokesman Frode Andersen told CNNThe type of monuments that are in Sultanahmet Square are the type that ISIS has been blowing up in Syria Gohel told CNN Its seen as a place where you have a mesh of different entities Its a real melting potThe blast comes as Turkey deals with multiple security threats  from longstanding nemesis the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK as well as ISIS which has taken over swaths of Syria and Iraq on its quest to form a farreaching caliphateTurkeys actions against ISIS which first emerged out of Iraq but now has its de facto capital in Syria are more recent but have nonetheless made it a target of that terrorist groupIts military cooperation with the United States and other NATO nations in particular has angered ISIS said Fadi Hakura associate fellow at Chatham HouseTuesdays blast  if its confirmed to be the terror groups work  ups the ante for Ankara forcing it to step up its antiISIS fight even more according to the AsiaPacific Foundations GohelAn attack like this is designed to create economic political and social consequences Gohel told CNN Turkey has to realize that the pipeline that feeds ISIS from Turkey to Syria has to now be cut off because incidents like this are not oneoffs This could be part of a series of plotsAnd given that the dead arent Turkish this attack directly impacts other countries as well While its not known if the bomber targeted any one nationality the idea of terrorists targeting tourists is not new  as illustrated in last Marchs attack on Tunis Bardo Museum and Junes mass shooting at a Tunisian beachfront hotelWe have a free society  but there are people who want us harmed said Merkel referring to the Tunisia attacks and the more recent ones targeting civilians in Paris  We will persevere
