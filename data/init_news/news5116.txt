Home  SOCIETY  US NEWS  TOO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE COOL WITH COMMUNISM TOO MANY MILLENNIALS ARE COOL WITH COMMUNISM 0 SHARES 102716 We learn from history that we do not learn from history observed German philosopher Georg Hegel Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than a new survey showing that far too many millennials are not just cool to capitalism but are actually cool with communism As MarketWatch reports  Of the 2300 Americans polled by YouGov  80 of baby boomers and 91 of the elderly agree with the statement that communism was and still is a problem in the world today Millennials Only 55 Furthermore almost half of Americans between the ages of 16 and 20 said they would vote for a socialist while 21 would go so far as to back a communist Capitalism on the other hand is viewed favorably by 64 of those over the age of 65 compared with only 42 of millennials Citing these results the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundations Marion Smith stated as quoted by MarketWatch  One of the concerns the foundation has had since its establishment is that an emerging generation of Americans has little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history For sure This was evidenced when a teenager once naively asked me Whats so bad about communism Another registered a look of shock when I gave him part of the answer During the 20th century Marxist governments exterminated approximately 100 million people making them historys most murderous ideologues Related to this MarketWatch also tells us that a third of millennials say they believe more people were killed under George W Bush than Joseph Stalin clearly oblivious to Stalins psychopathic actions having accounted for upwards of 20 million of the above number Of course 82 percent of millennials at least knew who Stalin was This cannot be said regarding Chinese leader Mao Tsetung 42 percent of millennials were unfamiliar with this mass murderer of approximately 60 million Forty percent didnt know who Argentine Marxist and major Cuban Revolution figure Che Guevara was With respect to Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx the unacquainted with figures were respectively 33 and 32 percent Not surprisingly this ignorance goes beyond history While its troubling that almost half of those aged 16 to 20 would support a socialist theres good and bad news here And theyre the same thing These young people generally dont know what socialism is As I wrote in February People 18 to 29 just helped vault Senator Bernie Sanders to a resounding New Hampshire primary victory not at all deterred by his socialist label But while they view that positively they dont believe in socialist in Sanders wealth redistribution In fact this research shows that they cotton to it little more than do average Americans and no more than their age group did 20 years ago In other words millennials may like the word socialism but as with so many others they dont understand well what it signifies or the nature of those for whom they vote In reality the label socialism is applied loosely today yet it has a firm definition Note that socialism was popularized via Karl Marxs and Friedrich Engels Communist Manifesto  And under Marxist doctrine socialism  or the socialist revolution  is the transitional phase that extinguishes economic freedom and ushers in communism Moreover there are no communist governments because communism is the culmination of socialism the stage where the fanciful theory goes the government has melted away and everyone lives happily and harmoniously in a state of economic equalityinduced bliss Post navigation
