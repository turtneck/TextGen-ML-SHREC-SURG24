Heidi Schlumpf is a columnist for the National Catholic Reporter and teaches communication at Aurora University The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authorCNN The popular Pope Francis is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague The comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits including on the right to insult anothers faithSpeaking Thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the Philippines the Pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say a swear word against my motherStill the Vatican felt the need to clarify in response to a later CNN question about the punch that his words were spoken colloquially and consistent with the Popes free style of speechI dont for one minute think the Pope is advocating for any type of violence whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each others mamasWhat concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speechThe Pope responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine by Islamist militants in Paris last weekAlthough he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of Islam its not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretationLets just say its not what most public relations professionals would adviseAnd while the Pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane his Who am I to judge comment about gay Catholics came on the return flight from Brazil in 2013 hes still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzedThe Pope is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issueWhile no one can match the offensive tone of Donahue who actually said Charlie Hebdos Stephane Charbonnier didnt understand the role he played in his own death the gist of the Popes message was the same Criticism of religion is problematicAs an aside Ill be curious to see if those who slammed Donahue have the same harsh words for the PopePerhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another Christian Jim Wallis president of Sojourners a progressive evangelical community and publication He had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the Paris attacksI think most American Catholics agree that while blasphemy  offensive speech against God or religion  is not particularly nice it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed In the United States the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952Im hoping the Pope was only offering counsel to his followers rather than advocating for any sort of legal position No one has the right not to be offended Even the Pope
