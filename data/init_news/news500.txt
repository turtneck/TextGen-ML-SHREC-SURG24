Anonymous hacker Deric Lostutter faces 16 years in prison while Steubenville rapists walk free Please scroll down for video Deric Lostutter was part of the group affiliated with Anonymous who exposed the rapists of an underage girl in Steubenville Ohio While his actions eventually helped to highlight the terrible crime against the young woman and helped to bring the perpetrators to justice he has received no thanks from law enforcement who have instead elected to put him on trial for felony hacking If he is found guilty he will face up to sixteen years in prison Incidentally the rapists who were also found guilty at trial have already completed their exceptionally short detention sentences Steubenville hacker indicted for bringing rapists to justice The sobering details of the Steubenville rape case were detailed heavily in 2013 when the perpetrators came to trial Members of a local football team gang raped a high school girl and posted pictures and social media posts are bragging about they had done to her Only two of the perpetrators were ever arrested on charges of rape and kidnap Trent May and MaLik Richmond both of whom received far more local support then their victim Initially local authorities showed a reluctance to prosecute any of the perpetrators of this senseless and violent act owing to their privileged place in local society This led to international outrage and eventually a group called KnightSec which is affiliated to Anonymous decided to step in They hacked into the Steubenville High School sports fan website and exposed the coverup by school administrators and the identities of the girls attackers They also posted a video of several students making light of the rape victim They threatened to expose more individuals associated with the coverup if the rapists did not come forward and confess Eventually two young men did come forward and were convicted of the rape of a minor MaLik Richmond served a paltry tenmonth spell at the juvenile detention facility and Trent May served two years  According to Tor Ekeland a lawyer speaking for Lostutter he and his client were both incredibly surprised that he had been targeted by the FBI about this hacking He said I dont understand why they are prosecuting somebody who helped expose the rape of a minor This is not a situation where somebody you know hacked a hospital or took down a nuclear power plant This was an act of political protest against the rape of a 16yearold girl Now Lostutter must wait and see whether he will face the full sixteen years in prison that his crime can carry Naturally his supporters are appalled You get 16 years for forcibly entering your way into a computer but you get one year for forcibly entering your way into a woman I think thats the precedent the government is setting here  said Ekeland This article Anonymous hacker Deric Lostutter faces 16 years in prison while Steubenville rapists walk free is free and open source You have permission to republish this article under a Creative Commons license with full attribution and a link to the original source on Disclosetv Related Articles
