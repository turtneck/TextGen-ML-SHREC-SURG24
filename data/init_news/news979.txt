posted by Eddie It seems that the long wait to receive a signal from outer space has finally paid off because after years of silence two astronomers from the Laval University in Quebec claim to have found 234 signals from alien civilizations Ermanno Borra and his graduate student Eric Trottier the astronomers we mentioned begun analyzing stars and galaxies in search of light emitted at regular intervals After analyzing 25 million of them they found what they were looking for in234 stars which resemble our Sun in size According to the researchers the signals are emitted by alien civilizations The team was focused on the light spectrums Fourier Transform FT For the uninformed an FT is a mathematical device that helps scientists to find the origin of the signals components and how they came to be For example if the light is a muffin using the FT formula will reveal the recipe couldnt be simpler than that The FT analysis revealed periodic modulated components which the scientists believe are a result of the super quick light pulses less than a trillionth of a second sent by Extraterrestrial Intelligence ETI Their paper is published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and it reveals that the scientists discard any other possible explanation like instrumental effects rotation of molecules rapid stellar pulsations and peculiar chemistry They write  We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis  The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the Sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis  Only extremely powerful lasers such as the one found at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  could generate these superfast pulses Furthermore Ermanno Borra has previously published articles where he states that this is the least explored area of astronomy An inevitable question then arises Why would these aliens choose such a complex and energyconsuming way to communicate Surely they could have figured out a better way after all theyre supposed to be millions of light years ahead of us in terms of technology and science Although the team believes that the most logical explanation would be that aliens are trying to communicate with us they are aware that further research is needed to confirm their findings Breakthrough Listen  a Stephen Hawkingbacked project will take up the task of further analyzing the 234 stars the team found but the UC Berkeley team the projects science program base encourages people to be skeptical regarding the findings until further proof is available The Breakthrough Listen team released a statement saying  The one in 10000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study However extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations  Source
