If you want to stump a Democrat ask them to name an accomplishment of Hillary Clinton Carly Fiorina quipped at Wednesdays Republican debate The line got hearty applausebut it also cut to the core of one of the defining lines of attacks against the former first lady and Democratic presidential frontrunner After nearly forty years in public life what exactly has she accomplishedIts a question that even at times has tripped up Clinton herself During her 2014 book tour when ABCs Diane Sawyer asked her about her marquee achievement Clinton changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a womens forum in Manhattan last year I see my role as secretaryin fact leadership in general in a democracyas a relay race You run the best race you can run you hand off the baton Some of what hasnt been finished may go on to be finished she told Thomas Friedman Im very proud of the economic stabilization and the really solid leadership that the administration provided that I think now leads us to be able to deal with problems like Ukraine because were not so worried about a massive collapse in EuropeThe question Fiorina posed has also tripped up members of the Obama administration When State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki was asked last year to identify one tangible achievement accomplished through one of Hillary Clintons key projects as Secretary of Statethe firstever audit of the departmentPsaki punted I am certain that those who were here at the time who worked hard on that effort could point out oneHillarys supporters have been stumped too When Bloomberg Politics Mark Halperin asked a focus group of Iowans this summer about Hillary Clintons accomplishments one Democratic supporter said I honestly cant say I followed along with everything that was going onSo is Fiorina right Are Democrats really unable to defend Clintons record on the merits To find out Politico Magazine on Thursday asked the nations top Democratic leaders and thinkers to name Hillary Clintons biggest accomplishmentWhat is the most impressive item on Clintons record Which legislative or policy triumph from her many years in office will be most important on the campaign trail Not surprisingly those surveyed all came up with an answer to defend their partys likely presidential nominee Whether these count as marquee significant or tangible You be the judgeIts kind of hard to pick one accomplishmentBy Bill Burton former senior strategist for Priorities USA Action a super PAC in support of President Barack ObamaIts kind of hard to pick one accomplishment for Hillary Clinton Personally Im sure shed say her daughter and grandchild are her greatest accomplishments Professionally how about these three1 Her China speech on women2 Her role in killing Osama bin Laden3 Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China aggressive work on climate particularly at Copenhagen and the effort to create and implement the toughest sanctions ever on Iranhelping to lead us to the agreement currently on the tableThe sanction on Iran that brought them to the tableHoward Dean is the former governor of Vermont and the former chair of the Democratic National CommitteeHillary Clinton was the principal author of the sanction on Iran that brought them to the table We cannot afford any Know Nothings like Carly in the White HouseNearly every foreign policy victory of President Obamas second term has Secretary Clintons fingerprints on itAmerican foreign policy was stronger when Hillary Clinton left the State Department than when she arrived She took the reins from a Bush administration that had left Americas reputation deeply damaged and planted the seeds for the foreign policy successes we see today From the agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon to the landmark normalization of relations with Cuba nearly every foreign policy victory of President Obamas second term has Secretary Clintons fingerprints on itHer accomplishments extend to health care as well As First Lady she helped create and guide through Congress Childrens Health Insurance Program a key program that brought health care coverage to millions of children As a Senator she worked across the aisle to provide full military health benefits to reservists and National Guard membersSecretary Clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world She set records for travel while leading the State Department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited She made gender equality a priority of US foreign policy And she created the ambassador at large for global womens issues a post charged with integrating gender throughout the State DepartmentThe SCHIP program  which expanded health coverage to millions of lowerincome childrenAfter universal health care failed in 1994 the Clinton Administration was reluctant to go anywhere near healthcare againDemocrats lost the Senate and the House in 1994 and losing the house was for the first time in 40 years ThenFirst Lady Hilary Clinton ended up being the White House ally and inside player who worked with Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch to create the SCHIP program in Clintons second term which expanded health coverage to millions of lowerincome children She has other accomplishments but this one made a huge difference and came at a time when politically the Administration was cutting deals with Newt Gingrich on the budget and not necessarily all that enthusiastic about revisiting health careThis obviously isnt her only accomplishment but it is meaningful because she took a political battering after the failure in 1994 but came back to fight again and was able to work on a bipartisan basis during a very polarized time to get this done Seems relevantClinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to runBy Chuck Schumer US Senator for New York Democratic partyHillary Clinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to run for the Presidency Im lucky enough to have seen those accomplishments up close from her time as Senator from New York and as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was instrumental in helping secure 21 billion in federal aid to help New York rebuild after 911 She fought tooth and nail to protect the first responders who rushed into danger when the towers collapsed and was pivotal in the passage of legislation that helped those first responders who got sick get the care and treatment they deserved She worked night and day to protect and create jobs in New York whether that was at the Niagara Falls Air Force base or the Center for Bioinformatics at the University of Buffalo She also led the charge on the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Equity Act which is now the law of the landAs Secretary of State Secretary Clinton was not only inspirational figure for billions of women around the globe she also did much to restore the shattered credibility of the United States which had lost so much influence following the failed foreign policies of the previous administration She negotiated the ceasefire in Gaza that stopped the Hamas from firing rocket after rocket into Israel She helped secure the START treatys ratification and has advanced womens rights in countries around the globe Thats just a snapshot of what Hillary Clinton has accomplished over a lifetime of public service to New York and the country If you really want to stump a Democrat you should ask them which of Hillarys accomplishments is your favoritethere are too many to choose fromRebuilding Americas leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush yearsBill Richardson is a former secretary of energy and governor of New MexicoAs Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was key in rebuilding Americas leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush years She restored our alliances with the EU and key Asian allies as well as key relationships in Africa and Latin AmericaBy Chris Dodd former US Senator for Connecticut Democratic partyHaving worked with her in the Senate and on the HELP Committee the first thing that came to mind was her authorship of the Pediatric Research Equity Act This

for children It has improved the health of millions of children who take medications to treat diseases ranging from HIV to epilepsy to asthma Millions of kids are in better shape and alive because of the law Senator Clinton authoredBy Paul Begala political analyst for CNN and counselor to President Bill ClintonEasy Iran sanctions Sec Clinton accomplished the nearly impossible mission of getting China Russia the European Union and the civilized world on board with crippling sanctions against Iran This is what brought Iran to the negotiating tableMs Fiorina may not see that as an accomplishment since while she was CEO of HewlettPackard the firm sold hundreds of millions of dollars of computer products the the terrorist regime in Tehran evading US sanctions
