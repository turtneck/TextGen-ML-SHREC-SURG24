Email Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day Trump tweeted Monday morning Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on So naive Its a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process States backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process Sen Jeff Flake of Arizona who is often sharply critical of Trump tweeted Sunday Elections are not rigged Jon Husted the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged Trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls Before now Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August And Im telling you November 8 wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election Allen Raymond a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phonejamming scandal called Trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the Republic The idea that its rigged I dont know what hes talking about he said in August I know someone that rigged elections I mean you know the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesnt need to rig this election Trumps going to win Alabama and thats it She doesnt have to do anything Its painful to watch Raymond wrote How to Rig an Election Confessions of a Republican Operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between thenGov Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat and Republican US Rep John E Sununu Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20000 votes Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008 The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementHe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what Trumps talking about The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican I dont even know what hes talking about Raymond said But this idea that its 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense An election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about Now its stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire He said the lack of voterID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus These voterID laws whats the intention of that The clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots You know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore Because its unconstitutional People dont vote 10 times he continued There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort Its a total myth He said Trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline Hillary Clintons first four years in office The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both Trump and Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont Clintons main opponent in the Democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season The emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored Clinton Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against Sanders in his earlyAugust interview with Hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well
