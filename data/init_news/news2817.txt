There are some things that we have learned about the United States from this election Well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to societyThe federal government has been corrupted Probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe Democrats The best example of this was the behavior of FBI Director James Comey The FBI is part of the Executive branch of government so Comey reports to Loretta Lynch who in turn reports to Obama Despite this fact one expects that the FBI be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to After all the US was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the lawComeys actions reveal that the FBI has thrown equality before the law out the window At first the FBI investigated Clintons use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was Secretary of State But even though Clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences Comey exonerated her back in July with a hand slapIn a move that surprised everyone Comey reopened on October 28th the criminal investigation of Clinton after 650000 emails State Department emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiners computer Trump supporters rejoiced and Hillary supporters expressed outrage But the White House calmly called Comey a man of integrity Did they know something we didntIt turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just 48 hours before election day Comey exonerated Clinton again  The FBI director likely intended to clear Clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse Donald Trumps criticism of herThe big lesson is that the law is applied selectively Wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else Unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeedThe elites are in control but Elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the Great OzIve written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees By controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle The good news is that their control is not complete They are not omnipotentThe weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways The first was with the Brexit vote When Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the UKs membership in the EU he never dreamed that Britons would actually vote to leave All the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames Still through the work of men like Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson the British populace voted to leave the EU The Brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to winThe second way was the campaign of Trump himself The GOP had planned a coronation for Jeb Bush The rest of the GOP field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from Jeb Trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed Jeb and the rest of the little Jebs The elite plan to have Hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by Trumps campaign Even if Trump has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the Great Oz we see the globalists behind the curtainThe third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the Alt Right A tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population Only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the US Now we have grandmothers in Texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalistsThe overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite They exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us With sound strategy they can be defeatedThe Elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites In the past Europe had an aristocracy This aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country The aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war They also had the same religion as the rest of the country We already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to WikiLeaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religionWikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with Marina Abramovic a Serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  Spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated It also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the painWhile spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the US globalist elite Hillary Clinton John Podesta JayZ and Beyonce Lady Gaga and Gwen Stefani have all attended these rituals and I would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians CEOs and bankers also participate Getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the US There are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day European elitesThere are several things at work here Most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual It is more like a college fraternity initiation It only means something in terms of ones social standing Also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to Christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed massesIn both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us They dont share the same destiny as us If the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused And they even lack a common morality with us In their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of usThe fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them The aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen The modern elite lack this wisdom Once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestalConclusion With Trumps election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated However the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning In any case we can be grateful that the election of 2016 has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our societyRead More Rigged FBI Reveals It Has Evidence Hillary Clinton Broke Law But Will Not Prosecute
