Parts Of Patriot Act Expire Even As Senate Moves On Bill Limiting SurveillanceIt was a dramatic day on the floor of the United States Senate on Sunday Unable to overcome parliamentary maneuvers by Sen Rand Paul the body adjourned and let three controversial provisions of the Patriot Act expire at midnightTrying to beat a midnight deadline during a rare Sunday session Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to fast track a House bill that would overhaul the governments bulk collection of Americans phone recordsAt around 7 pm ET the House bill cleared a key procedural hurdle but as the sun set on Washington it became clear that a Senate rule allowing for 30 hours of debate would force parts of the Patriot Act to expire at least temporarilyThe Patriot Act will expire tonight Paul the Kentucky Republican who has led the charge against the governments bulk collection program said But it will only be temporary They will ultimately get their wayBefore this session Paul promised to use any parliamentary moves available to him to force any Senate vote on the measure to happen after the 12 am deadlineHe was warned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle that he was putting the country at riskTo go dark on this is a risk on Americans lives Sen Dan Coats an Indiana Republican said on the floor of the SenateMcConnell the senior Republican senator from Kentucky said that blocking this legislation should be worrying for our country McConnell said that even though he had vehemently opposed this bill previously  his chamber had also failed to move it forward earlier this week  he would attempt to pass itWe shouldnt be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive and we certainly should not be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden McConnell saidPaul fired back saying he worried that the House bill actually made the government better at collecting phone records in bulk He said he couldnt trust the secret court tasked with interpreting the law and that he wanted to add amendments to the bill He added that the US is using fear to convince Americans of the need for these programs but the country already has the tools to fight terrorists They could seek warrants he said instead of dragging Americans into what he said was an unconstitutional surveillance systemMark my words he said the battle is not overAt around 945 pm ET after a lengthy break McConnell took the floor again and admitted defeat He offered several amendments to the House bill and adjourned until 12 pm ET on June 1 guaranteeing that parts of the surveillance programs instituted by the US after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 would end entirely at least temporarilyIn a statement White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the Senate had taken an importantif latestep forward tonightThe White House has always supported HR 2048  also known as the Houses USA Freedom Act The bill ends the bulk collection program as we know it If passed the government would still have access to the data but it would now have to query databases kept by phone companiesWe call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as shortlived as possible Earnest said On a matter as critical as our national security individual Senators must put aside their partisan motivations and act swiftly The American people deserve nothing lessWell liveblogged the Senate action as it happened Keep reading if you want a playbyplayUpdate at 1103

934 pm ET Senate Still In SessionThe Senate is still technically in session A senator suggested the absence of a quorum which has given the Senate time to figure out what will happen nextUpdate at 931 pm ET Strong Support For Comprehensive ReformIn a statement Michael MacleodBall acting director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office said todays vote and the likely temporary end of the bulk collection program are a reflection of strong support for meaningful and comprehensive reform of the surveillance lawsHe added Congress should take advantage of this sunset to pass far reaching surveillance reform instead of the weak bill currently under considerationUpdate at 816 pm ET What To ExpectSo where do we stand right now The Senate now has the ability to move on the House bill but senators can debate the bill for 30 hoursManu Raju of Politico reports that Majority Leader McConnell plans to employ a prerogative Reid rarely used Making senators actually debate in postcloture time  or hell continue processCongressional Quarterly reports that a McConnell spokesman said there will  likely be no more votes tonightThis means three provisions of the Patriot Act are likely to lapse if only temporarilyUpdate at 800 pm ET Bulk Collection Will Likely LapseWyden and Sen Martin Heinrich a Democrat from New Mexico are still talking on the floorIts worth noting that according to White House officials who briefed reporters last week it is now likely there will be a lapse in the governments bulk collection programAs we reported While the statutory deadline is Monday June 1 senior administration officials said they have to begin winding down their surveillance programs at 4 pm ET on Sunday That process they said could be aborted as late as 8 pm ETWe are now past that windowSen Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon just finished a speech on the floor Wyden has been a longtime critic of the bulk collection programDuring his speech he reminded Americans that the administration had misled Congress in the past He was specifically referring to a hearing in which he asked National Intelligence Director James Clapper if the National Security Agency collects any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of AmericansClapper answered No sir before adding not wittinglyClapper ended up apologizing for that answerWyden said thats why the Senate has to ask the hard questionsIt is our job to ask the hard questions Wyden saidUpdate at 753 pm ET What Does The House Bill ContainWeve noted Pauls reservations about HR 2048  or the Houses USA Freedom ActFrom a previous post heres what that bill would doUpdate at 742 pm ET Patriot Act Will ExpireSen Paul said The Patriot Act will expire tonight But it will only be temporary They will ultimately get their wayWith that Paul stepped off the floor Heres a quick recap of what he saidUpdate at 728 pm ET Bill Will Ultimately PassSen Rand Paul took to the floor shortly after the cloture vote passed He conceded that the House bill would ultimately pass but tonight begins the process of ending bulk collectionHis issue with the House bill he said is that Congress may just be replacing one bulk collection program with anotherIts hard for me to have trust in the people who we are giving great power to Paul saidThe senator from Kentucky said he would offer up amendments to the billUpdate at 708 pm ET Procedural Vote Passes By Large MarginThe procedural measure to move onto the House bill ultimately passed by a large margin  77 to 17It means the Senate has overcome a major procedural hurdle but any senator can still debate the measure for 30 hoursThe votes are still coming in but the Senate has reached the 60 votes needed to limit debate and move on to the House billHowever Paul or any senator for that matter can force the Senate to debate the matter for another 30 hours before they can vote on the bill That is of course many hours after the midnight deadlineThe vote so far 75 in favor of cloture 15 opposedWith a temporary extension off the table Sen McConnell said he had only two options One let the programs expire Two try to pass the House billThe first option he said is completely unacceptable So he said he would move forward with the reconsideration of the House billThat motion passed with a voice vote and the Senate is now voting to limit debate and move on to the House bill Thats also known as a cloture voteAs Foxs Chad Pergram reports on Twitter that doesnt mean much because even if they get the 60 votes needed for cloture Paul can still require 30 hrs burn off clock before Senate can get on Hses NSA bill Means pgms would lapseUpdate at 616 pm ET McConnell Proposes To Extend Two SectionsSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took to the floor to propose a very limited bill  one that would extend Sections 206 and 6001 the socalled roving wiretaps and lone wolf provisionsJust like that Paul objected and McConnell said that his objection should be very worrying for AmericansThe nature of the threat is very serious McConnell said therefore we should not be disarming unilaterallyThe Senate has reconvened Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the floorUpdate at 605 pm ET The Debate So FarWhile we wait for the Senate to reconvene heres a little recap of what weve heard on the floor so far Democratic Sens Harry Reid and Patrick Leahy made the case that the Senate should act quickly to pass the House billLeahy said that it had been passed by the House in bipartisan fashion and that it makes significant changes to the governments surveillance programsReid said that this is an important national security program He said that CIA Director John Brennan and even Senate Republicans agree that allowing parts of this law to expire would threaten our national security In his words this is big time stuffIn his five minutes Sen Paul essentially scoffed at that notionHow will we protect ourselves he asked What about using the Constitution What about getting a warrantUpdate at 556 pm ET What To ExpectRight now the Senate is in recess Both parties are meeting to discuss how to go forward When the Senate returns we expect a series of votes to reconsider HR 2048  also known as the Houses USA Freedom ActThe Senate had already failed to move that measure forward earlier this monthIt did not take long for the drama to get started About an hour into the session Sen Rand Paul asked to speak for five minutes Sen Chuck Grassley a fellow Republican shot him down and Sen John McCain another fellow Republican suggested Paul should learn the rules of the SenateThats when Paul called for a live quorum  a roll call that determines whether a majority of the Senate is in the chamber to continue doing business To speed things up the live quorum was called off and Paul was given his five minutesThis in important debate Paul said This is a debate over the bill of rights over the Fourth Amendment  It is a debate over your right to be left alonePaul said that the surveillance programs put in place by Section 215 were illegal Then he issued a warning Im not going to take it anymore
