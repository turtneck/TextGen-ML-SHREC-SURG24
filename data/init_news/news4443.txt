With a strong win in South Carolina on Saturday night Donald Trump has officially upended the 2016 Republican primariesSPARTANBURG SC  When Donald Trump speaks he has a habit of gripping the lectern with all but the middle finger of his left hand The middle finger wriggles about curling up and down with the rhythm of his words On Saturday night as he addressed the crowd after winning the primary here by a tenpoint margin it seemed to be wriggling at all of usA couple of the pundits said Well if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together its going to equal Trump he said doing his best impersonation of a Beltway Idiot The crowd booed and Trump threw his hands out Right he said theyre geniuses They dont understand that as people drop out Im gonna get a lot of those votes also You dont just add them togetherIn the eight months since he first sailed down the escalator in Trump Tower to announce his candidacy Trump has watched as every single prediction about his campaign made by socalled experts has been proven wrong Not that winning South Carolina means hell win it allNewt Gingrich beat Mitt Romney here by thirteen points in 2012 As it stands now Trump has 61 delegates To win the nomination he needs 1237 But Trump wasnt supposed to make it this far to begin withIt was supposed to be a blip and then it was supposed to collapse under the weight of its own arrogance and then it was supposed to be destroyed by the knights in the establishment and then the voters were supposed to get seriousWell they were serious here at the Marriott on North Church Street on Saturday just like they had been at the Executive Court Banquet Facility in Manchester New Hampshire ten days ago after he won there but not in the way that anybody couldve anticipated back in JuneHis calls for a wall at the USMexico border were mocked by the experts then as proof of his inherent silliness And it is a stupid idea one that couldnt work even if he managed to get it done But on Saturday as he spoke about trade with Mexico people in the audience began shouting Build a wall He turned to one man and said Were gonna build a wall dont worry He turned back to the audience and asked them a question were gonna do the wall and by the way whos gonna pay for the wall A chorus responded MexicoThe polls here had shown for months much like in New Hampshire that Trump had a sizable lead over the rest of the field But to think that he could win anywhere was in a lot of ways to admit that everything we think we know about politics and what the people who participate in the process believe is bullshitHistory will say that on this night in South Carolina we took the first step forward to the beginning of a new American century Rubio declared from his rally in Columbia SCHe did not explain what was historic about the evangelical in the race losing the evangelical vote in a state where according to an exit poll73 percent of Republican voters said they consider themselves bornagain or evangelical Christians Trump whose cursing is part of his stump speech is on his third wife admitted on TV that hed never asked God for forgiveness and this week got into a fight with The PopeAnd then not only did he win but he won Beaufort the states only majorityCatholic county Ted Cruz who beat Trump in Iowa thanks to the evangelical community and invested millions here to turn them out again came in third place Marco Rubio a Catholic finished a distant second Jeb Bush a converted Catholic dropped out altogetherBefore Trump descended on stage bathed in pink and purple lights fit for one of his pageants his fans milled about on the red and gold carpet picking at plates of cheese and fruit and drinking booze from one of two cash bars The extent to which their outfits of sweat clothes or sequined minidresses or jeans and tshirts were accessorized with TRUMP swagscarves and pins and buttons and a silicone mask of his likeness in one casemade the event feel like a conventionHis fans are predominantly white usually older working people or retired working people Oftentimes theyre very religious but thats not what motivates them They feel as if the country has left them behind but they differ from the Tea Partiers of 2010 in that they are not political and they are uninterested in policy unless the policy amounts to a giant fuckyou to a deserving group like China or special interests The phrase Make America Great Again to them is a legitimate campaign platform
