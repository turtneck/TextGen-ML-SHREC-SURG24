link a reply to carewemust Vomiting black liquid caught my eye I know bleeding internally can cause black vomit sometimes it looks like coffee grounds But something in the HeatStreet article that Fox news linked too also caught my eye Max was buried in Canterbury cemetery after his mother arranged to have his body flown home a week after his death A postmortem examination was carried out by a pathologist in east Kent but Vanessa says that more than two months later she still does not know the result or whether there will be an inquest She added Apparently he had not suffered any obvious physical injuries but he could have been slowly poisoned which is why the results of toxicology tests from his postmortem are so important bolding by me Activated charcoal  which is black and readily available to anyone  is used to treat poisoning and could cause black vomit also Could Spiers have suspected he was being poisoned and tried to selftreat with activated charcoal I cant find much more about the black vomit as in if someone was with him beforeduringafter he vomited the black liquid or if it was found at the same time as he was found dead
