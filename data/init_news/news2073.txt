Written by Jacob G Hornberger Thursday October 27 2016 Several weeks ago contemporaneously with the release of Oliver Stones excellent movie Snowden friends and admirers of Edward Snowden launched a campaign to have President Obama pardon him for disclosing the NSAs supersecret illegal surveillance scheme to the American people and the world The reasons for the pardon request were excellently summarized in an oped that appeared in the New York Times entitled  Pardon Edward Snowden  by Kenneth Roth and Salil Shetty Not surprisingly the US nationalsecurity establishment and its assets within the mainstream press oppose a pardon for Snowden because they say he endangered national security with his disclosure of the NSAs topsecret illegal surveillance programs But notice something important Every time someone discloses national security state secrets the east coast doesnt fall into the ocean California isnt hit by earthquakes and the federal government isnt taken over by communists terrorists Muslims illegal immigrants or drug dealers Nothing ever happens Thats because as I point out in my ebook  The CIA Terrorism and the Cold War The Evil of the National Security State  ever since the federal government was converted into a national security state in the 1940s the term national security has been nothing more than a way to shield criminal wrongdoing on the part of the nationalsecurity establishment Remember MKULTRA It was a highly classified operation on the part of the CIA It involved drug experimentation on unsuspecting Americans It was enveloped within the concept of national security It was also a criminal operation Once it came to light the CIA ordered the destruction of all MKULTRA records so that the American people would never discover all the dark and sordid details of this Nazilike program The United States remained standing notwithstanding the revelation of the CIAs nationalsecurity state secret Consider the CIAs assassination attempts in partnership with the Mafia against Cubas president Fidel Castro during the 1960s Those assassination attempts were nationalsecurity state secrets They were also criminal in nature In fact they were no different in a criminal sense from the assassination of Orlando Letelier by Chiles DINA the Chilean CIANSA type organization with which the US partnered in the aftermath of the US nationalsecurity states coup that brought military strongman Augusto Pinochet into power in 1973 Did the United States collapse when the CIAs assassination plots were revealed to the world No more so than Chile collapsed when DINAs assassination plots were revealed to the world Speaking of DINA for years the US nationalsecurity establishment kept its role in orchestrating the coup in Chile secret from the American people CIA Director Richard Helms even knowingly lied to Congress when asked about the CIAs activities in orchestrating the coup Why did Helms intentionally lie to Congress To protect national security of course The CIAs position was that if people were to discover the role that the US government played in orchestrating the Chilean coup nationalsecurity would be threatened But when the US role in the coup was ultimately disclosed what happened Nothing Well except for the fact that Helms got convicted for lying to Congress He was lucky though They let him off the hook with a misdemeanor plea and probation When he returned to the CIA he was hailed by his subordinates for his heroic effort to protect national security Of course he wasnt as lucky as DNI Chief James Clapper who didnt get prosecuted at all for lying to Congress about the existence of the NSAs illegal surveillance scheme Why did Clapper lie to Congress To protect national security of course But when the supersecret illegal scheme ultimately came to light what happened to the United States Nothing Another false and fraudulent use of the meaningless term national security It was no different with respect to the CIAs kidnappingmurder of Rene Schneider the overall commander of Chiles armed forces The CIA felt that it needed to keep its plot against Schneider secret on grounds of national security including its smuggling highpower guns into the country and later its paying off the killers to keep them silent Once again they maintained national security dictated secrecy But when the CIAs role in Schneiders kidnappingmurder was ultimately discovered nothing happened The United States continued standing Interestingly not one single US official was ever charged in the felonymurder of Rene Schneider whose only crime was standing in the way of the US national security establishments illegal and unconstitutional in both Chile and the United States plot to replace a democratically elected president with a brutal unelected USsupported military general whose forces proceeded to round up incarcerate torture rape execute or assassinate tens of thousands of innocent people  that is people whose only crime was believing in socialism It was the same with the murder during the coup of two American men Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi a murder in which US nationalsecurity state officials were complicit Of course they kept their involvement in the murder secret under the principle of national security Hormans crime was that he had learned of US complicity in the coup and planned to disclose it to the world In the eyes of Chilean and US nationalsecurity state officials that obviously constituted a threat to national security Teruggis crime was that he was a socialist who had opposed the US governments war in Vietnam Despite the fact that a topsecret US State Department investigation revealed that US intelligence had played a role in their murder not one single US official has ever been indicted much less summoned to appear before Congress to explain why they murdered two innocent American citizens In a moral sense its not Snowden who needs a pardon It is the US nationalsecurity state that needs a pardon from him  and from the American people for converting our nation into a charnel house of secret dark illegal nefarious actions under the guise of the sham term national security Reprinted with permission from Future of Freedom Foundation  Related
