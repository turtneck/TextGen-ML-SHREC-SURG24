Posted on November 6 2016 by Eric Zuesse Eric Zuesse At 247 in this video about a key moment in the 7 September 2016 Town Hall debate between Trump and Clinton where Matt Lauer has asked her about her privatization of her State Department emails Ms Clinton says but the real question is the handling of classified materials which is I think what the implication of your question was Lauer did not deny that he was following the line of Comey that only the classified emails could pose a criminal problem for her However that assumption is flatout false and both Hillary Clinton knows it which is why she tried there to narrow the meaning of his question to the classifiedinformation issue  and also Comey knows it which is why he has his FBI exclude from its consideration the illegality of her privatization of official email itself  her theft of US government information her abuse of even nonconfidential information her destruction of evidence by destroying her government emails etcetera  there are several laws she broke which have nothing to do with confidential information but both the FBI and the news media at least until Comeys aboutface on October 28th were ignoring them and they still do ignore each one of them Here are six of those laws  They describe what nobody denies that she did and the maximum sentence under all of them if the FBI were to throw the book at her would be 72 years Conviction of her under them would be a slamdunk but all of these laws are being simply ignored So the questions here are Why is the FBI ignoring those criminal laws which she clearly did violate Why are Americas news media ignoring the FBIs ignoring these laws
