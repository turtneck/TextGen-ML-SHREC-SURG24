Watch The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer Wednesday at 5 pm ET for an interview with Rand PaulLouisville Kentucky CNN For Rand Paul its all led to this momentSince riding the tea party wave into the Senate in 2010 Paul has carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism  dogged advocacy of civil liberties combined with an antiinterventionist foreign policy and general support for family values  that he bets will create a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White HouseThe test of that theory began Tuesday when the Kentucky senator made official what has been clear for years Hes running for presidentToday I announce with Gods help with the help of liberty lovers everywhere that Im putting myself forward as a candidate for president of the United States of America Paul said at a rally in LouisvillePaul immediately hit the campaign trail for a fourday swing through New Hampshire South Carolina Iowa and Nevada  the states that traditionally vote first in the primaries and caucusesIn his speech he called for reforming Washington by pushing for term limits and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget He argued that both parties are to blame for the rising debt saying it doubled under a Republican administration and tripled under ObamaGovernment should be restrained and freedom should be maximized he saidThe lineup of speakers who introduced Paul sought to paint the senator as a nontraditional candidate with diverse appeal and by the time he got on stage he was the first white man to address the crowdThe speakers included JC Watts a former congressman whos AfricanAmerican state Sen Ralph Alvarado whos Hispanic local pastor Jerry Stephenson whos African American and a former Democrat and University of Kentucky student Lauren BoslerHe goes everywhere It doesnt matter what color you are Rand Paul will be there Stephenson said firing up the crowdSo far Paul joins only Texas Sen Ted Cruz as a declared candidate for the GOP presidential nomination His entry into the race will no doubt raise the bar of competition Cruz said in a statement welcoming Paul into the raceBut the field is certain to grow in the months ahead with Jeb Bush Chris Christie Scott Walker Lindsey Graham and others eyeing a campaign Marco Rubio a Florida GOP senator is expected to launch his campaign next weekBush who said his 2016 decision is a while off told reporters in Colorado Springs on Tuesday that libertarianism definitely has a place in the GOP but stressed that he differs with Paul on foreign policyFor now the nomination is up for grabs with no clear frontrunner Paul came in third place at 12 in a CNNORC International Poll of Republicans Bush led the pack at 16 while Walker came in second at 13But Paul 52 will split from his father in one important way his approach to the campaign Where Ron Paul often focused on creating a libertarian movement Rand Paul is planning a more strategic less purist operation that could have a hope of competing in a general electionThe elder Paul sat on stage at the rally on Tuesday with his wife though hes not expected to be a public face for his sons campaign He merely attended the event as a proud papa a source close to the senator saidElected in 2010 with strong teaparty support Rand Paul quickly rose to national fame in part due to his fathers backtoback White House runs in 2008 and 2012 but also because of Rand Pauls willingness to fight fellow RepublicansHe engaged in a war of words with Chris Christie two years ago over national security and federal spending and more recently hes taken swipes at Bush over issues like Common Core and medical marijuanaWhile he bills himself as a conservative realist Paul still tries to wear the mantle as the Republican most reluctant to take the country into warThe cautious foreign policy dance has drawn criticism from his fathers supporters who say Paul has become too moderate and from hawkish Republicans who fear he wouldnt go far enough as commander in chief to tackle problems overseas Democrats and some Republicans meanwhile have accused him of flipflopping and pandering to donorsOn Tuesday the Foundation for a Secure  Prosperous America  a hawkish group from the right  released a 1 million television ad buy against Pauls foreign policy which hits the airwaves nationally on cable as well as in the key early states that Paul will visit this weekPaul had been silent on the Iran deal until his speech on Tuesday when he vowed to oppose any deal that doesnt guarantee Iran gives up its nuclear ambitionHe also sought to sound aggressive on terrorism The enemy is radical Islam and not only will I name the enemy I will do what ever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind he saidIn an interview later Tuesday Paul argued that the ad was crazy and represented what he called the the naivety of the neoconsThese loud sort of juvenile voices putting pictures of bombs on ads these are the people who are so reckless that it would be a grave danger to our country to ever have these people in charge of our country he said in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox NewsIn the same interview Paul also weighed in for the first time on the religious freedom debate that took center stage last week after an Indiana law  which has since been changed came under fire for what critics said was discrimination against gay and lesbian couples getting marriedThe 2016 Republican field largely came out in defense of the law standing by the rights of small business owners such as florists and bakers to decline participating in samesex weddings Paul said he felt the law was unnecessary and that the countrys founding fathers would be aghast that laws needed to be in place to protect religious rightsThat being said he added I think the law ought to be neutral and we shouldnt treat people unfairlyAsked which takes precedence religious liberty or samesex marriage rights Paul said freedomI dont think you can have coercion in a free society very well he said So I would think we ought to try freedom in most of these thingsPaul is actually running for two offices at the same time trying to hold onto his Senate seat while also running for president Kentuckys election laws say candidates cant appear on a ballot twice but with reluctant support from McConnell a Kentucky powerhouse the states GOP will likely change its presidential preference vote from a primary to a caucus That would allow Paul to get around the ruleHis interest in the Oval Office has never really been a secret Shortly after the 2012 presidential election he started crisscrossing the country to paint himself as a nontraditional Republican eager to court voters who dont typically live and vote in red areasHe spoke at historically black colleges and universities as well as Democratic strongholds like inner city Detroit and the University of California Berkeley focusing on criminal justice reform and civil liberties two issues he believes can bring more people into the Republican PartyLiberal policies have failed our inner cities he said Tuesday Our schools are not equal and the poverty gap continues to widenBut Democrats are eager to paint Paul as another member of the same old Republican PartyOn issue after issue his policies are the same as the rest of the GOP but even more extreme and will turn back the clock on the progress we have made said Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statementAs one of the few national politicians who went to Ferguson Missouri Paul frequently boasts that there is no bigger defender of minority rights in the Congress than himselfHes steered clear of such hotbutton issues more recently Last week for example he was one of the few Republicans who didnt weigh in on religious freedom laws in Indiana and Arkansas that critics argued would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbiansPaul has also worked to maintain a following that includes a large swath of young voters who he partly inherited from his father Heavy on tech and social media his political team has opened an office in Austin Texas and will soon establish one in the heart of Silicon Valley Like clockwork Paul frequently holds up his phone during his stump speech and declares that what people do on their smartphones is none of the governments damn businessHis nontraditional style is complemented by Pauls wardrobe The senator is known for wearing blue jeans with boots and a blazer when hes on the trail and during the winter he opts for a turtleneck and sport coat rather than a tieAnd while hes not media shyhes given hundreds of interviews in the past year alonePaul can get shorttempered with reporters He shushed a female interviewer in February and last fall he blew up at a reporter who asked a question about foreign aid to Israel
