Another Primary Nights Results Confound At Least Some ExpectationsThe latest day of primary voting was bad news for one leading candidate good news for another and a setback for popular campaign narratives in both partiesYou may have heard that Hillary Clinton was about to extend her Super Tuesday dominance to Mississippi and Michigan putting the campaign of Bernie Sanders on the ropes once and for all The Clinton story seemed all the more plausible given her feisty show in her seventh debate with Sanders and the struggle he seemed to have in more populous statesAnd you may also have heard the reports of Donald Trumps momentum finally stalling out Over the weekend in votes in Kentucky and Louisiana latedeciders had broken against him Trump still won those states of course but only because so many people voted early for himThis Trump scenario made sense given the millions of dollars in attack ads paid for by rivals and by independent superPACs opposed to his nominationBut not so fast As it turned out it was the Clinton juggernaut that lost a wheel in Michigan  while Trumps model stayed very much on track He lost latedeciders again but it mattered even less than it had in the earlier testsSanders for his part once again defied expectations Michigan responded to his assault on trade deals while not entirely buying Clintons late attacks on his voting record on the auto industry bailoutClinton may also have been expecting higher turnout among AfricanAmericans who backed her with 65 percent of their vote but did not supply enough votes to overcome Sanders advantage outside of metropolitan Detroit Clinton also failed to win the county that is home to Flint the city with leadpoisoned water that she had made the focus of her campaignOnce again Sanders reprised his astounding dominance of the youth vote taking 87 percent of the votes of those under 30 He also won an overwhelming number of counties large and small throughout the stateYet another storyline that crashed and burned Tuesday concerned a candidate running well out of the money so far this season This was the myth known as the emergence of John Kasich the Ohio governor many hoped might become the establishment alternative to TrumpKasich went allin for Michigan in hopes of generating momentum ahead of his doordie primary in his home state on March 15 But Kasich finished third a hair or two behind Texas Sen Ted Cruz He may still win Ohio next week but he will not be a factor anywhere else on a day when three other top10 states will vote Florida Illinois and North CarolinaFor his part Cruz once again showed himself the master of the small state event he won in Idaho and the secondplace finish Michigan Mississippi Hawaii Despite his maddening failure to defeat Trump in Southern states with big populations of evangelical white Protestants Cruz has hung tough and racked up delegatesHe is now just 99 delegates behind Trump If he could win a few of the winnertakeall states he could catch him although the prospects of that appear increasingly remote And if there is any GOP candidate with a chance of preventing Trump from reaching 1237 delegates for a firstballot nomination it is now CruzIt might help Cruz stop Trump if his fellow freshman senator Marco Rubio dropped out rather than contest his home state of Florida next week But Rubio has vowed to remain for that test even though he remains behind Trump in Florida polling and must battle Cruz and Kasich for votes thereTruth be told Tuesday was a night of total frustration for Rubio demonstrating how utterly his campaign strategy has failed He not only finished third or worse in Michigan Mississippi Idaho and Hawaii  he won exactly zero delegates for the night His delegate count is now further behind Cruz than Cruz is behind TrumpRubio was the young and charismatic candidate many Republicans had hoped would step up as the antiTrump But Rubios recent attempts to do so with personal putdowns and constant attacks may have backfired judging by his performance since he adopted Trumps slashing speaking style Setting aside a smallturnout event in Minnesota and a primary in Puerto Rico Rubio has now staggered winless through twodozen primaries and caucusesIn the cold light of the dayafter it is possible the results from Tuesday will look different Had Clinton eked out another 20000 votes or so in Michigan the headline might have been about her crossing the halfway point in pursuit of the 2383 delegates needed to nominate on the first ballot at the July convention in Philadelphia She has 1221 now Sanders has 571The most frustrating element of the battle for Sanders is that even his best night since New Hampshire did not avail him in the delegate tally Clintons 66point dominance in Mississippi won her nearly all that states cache of 36 delegates while Sanders razorthin margin in Michigan meant the two candidates split that states 130 delegates almost evenlyAll of that makes it difficult for Sanders to overcome Clintons delegate lead even if he continues to best her in the voting booths from here through June Sanders strategist Tad Devine is fond of saying the race is a marathon not a sprint but winning a race of any duration still requires you to finish firstSanders needs to make a habit of doing just that and by wider margins than his breakthrough in Michigan gave him Still however steep the climb may appear this Tuesday made it harder than ever to count the Vermonter out
