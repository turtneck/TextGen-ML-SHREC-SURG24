CNN The mystery into the death of Freddie Gray grew more complex Thursday as several new reports put the focus on what might have happened during a roughly 40minute ride in the back of a police transport van Investigators found that Gray was mortally injured in the van and not during his arrest a Washington television station reported citing multiple law enforcement sources Police told reporters they have learned of an additional stop the van made as it was traveling to a police precinct An officer involved in the arrest believes Gray was injured before being put into the vehicle according to a relative who gave the officers account to CNN A second prisoner who was picked up after Gray told investigators that he thought Gray was intentionally trying to injure himself according to The Washington PostWhat happened to Gray the 25yearold Baltimore man who suffered a severe spine injury and died one week after his arrest has led to angry debate and protests nationwide For the first time Thursday Baltimore police walked with marchers and stopped traffic for them at intersectionsWhen the 10 pm curfew went into effect for the third night there were still many protesters on the streets Activists and local leaders were telling people to go homeA body was found a block away from a CVS pharmacy that had been looted and set on fire during Mondays rioting CNNs Ryan Young saw authorities tending to itIt was discovered in a parked semi truck Investigators did not say if the body was that of a man or a woman or if there was any connection to the riotsBut a dispatcher from an Illinoisbased trucking company that commissions the truck said Baltimore police called to ask about one of its drivers hailing from Baltimore His family had reported him missing for two to three days during a trip home said dispatcher Brad Rhodes from Henderson Trucking CompanyThe driver was supposed to return to work Wednesday but did not show up Rhodes did not confirm if the driver of that vehicle was the missing man and did not know the missing drivers fateThe sources quoted by the Washingtonbased station said the medical examiner had determined Grays death was caused by a catastrophic injury after he slammed into the back of the police transport van while inside it apparently breaking his neck a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the vanThe station said it was unclear what caused Gray to slam into the back of the van and whether Gray caused the injuryAn official in the states Office of the Chief Medical Examiner wouldnt comment to CNN on the report citing an ongoing investigation The official said the autopsy report on Gray could be delivered to the States Attorney Office as soon as tomorrow or early next weekStaff members were still doing examinations Thursday the official said The completion and delivery of the final report will depend on how quickly that evaluation is completed and compiled While it could be sent Friday there is still the possibility it wont be ready until early next week the official saidHow Gray was injured and whether police are liable for his death are questions now in the hands of the states attorney for Baltimore CityPolice led a news conference by announcing they handed their investigative files over to prosecutors a day earlier than plannedThe states attorney for Baltimore City confirmed she had received the report and said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings her team has been conducting its own independent investigationWhile we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified prosecutor Marilyn Mosby said We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice systemMosby will ultimately decide whether to file charges against any of the officersInvestigators delivered their report early because I understand the frustration I understand the urgency police Commissioner Anthony Batts saidThis does not mean that the investigation is over If new evidence is found we will follow it he added Getting to the right answer is more important than speedThe announcement of the additional stop by the police van was treated almost as a footnote in the police news conferenceThis new stop was discovered from a privately owned camera Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said without elaboratingMany observers though say that revelation and other reports makes the Gray case even more suspicious  and there has been no shortage of protesters taking to the citys streets to express their doubts about police accounts of what happened between Grays April 12 arrest and his deathThe Rev Jamal Bryant of Baltimores Empowerment Temple has been helping organize protests and speaking to people in the community Young people have told him in the past two days that they are absolutely frustrated and their confidence level is absolutely shattered and that Thursdays news only exacerbates those feelingsThey dont believe that Mr Gray was hurting himself in the van and this additional stop lends credence to the suspicion that something is absolutely off track he saidBatts told CNNs Chris Cuomo that people are jumping to conclusions and no one is trying to cover anything upI think its unfortunate that these little things are coming out I think that its inappropriate he added while out checking on his officers Thursday night I think people should take a deep breath to wait for states attorney to come out with the entire informationAttorney Andrew OConnell who is part of the Gray familys legal team described the police time line as a moving target meaning it keeps changing over timeWhat I would like to know and what we have been asking for from the beginning are the radio runs that are recorded during these stops he said Whenever a police officer makes a stop hes supposed to radio it in We havent seen those Those are usually the best way to get an accurate picture of what happened during an arrestAn official who had been briefed on the investigation told CNN that the stops are key to determining what happened and as OConnell pointed out each stop is supposed to be logged generally by the vans driver and that didnt happen in this case Thats why the initial police time line was missing the new stop the official saidBut where OConnell stopped short of leveling accusations CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins was more incredulousThey found out about it after doing this investigation where they interviewed over 30 people she said So what that says to me is that if its going to take a closedcircuit private camera to show the stop that they were not getting that information from the police officers during the investigationThis is why they investigateCNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes contended however that it was too early to assert something nefarious was at play and said finding and reviewing videos in an investigation is laboriousThis could be a private security camera that was from a business looking down the sidewalk and the street from their business that maybe just got turned over he said This is why they investigate More facts come up gradually When you have private citizens turn over videos to look at they may not have realized it was that van the business owner may not have known that it had anything to do with this caseHwang Jung owner of the market at North Fremont Avenue and Mosher Street where the newly disclosed stop took place said officers in suits came into his store last week asking to see surveillance footage from April 12 at around 830 amAfter viewing the footage the officers gave him their number and said two more officers would come copy the footage which happened a few hours later Hwang saidThe footage was lost he said when his store was looted in the days after Grays death He said he couldnt be sure exactly what day the officers came by but he thought it was early in the week of April 19It was April 24 a Friday that Deputy Commissioner Davis told reporters that there had only been three stops en route to the police station the first to put leg irons on Gray the second to deal with Mr Gray an incident he said that remained under investigation and the third to pick up a prisoner in an unrelated matterThe new stop Davis said Thursday came between the first and second stopsThe six officers involved in the case have been suspended and none has spoken publicly about what occurredBut a relative of one of the officers spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity She is related to one of the six officers but said the officer didnt request the interviewThe relative said she worries all six of the officers who encountered Gray during his April 12 arrest will be incriminated when only some might be responsibleSix officers did not injure this man she said Six officers didnt put him in the hospital Im worried that instead of them figuring out who did that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie GrayShe also told CNN that the officer doesnt know how Gray was injured but said he believes it happened during the arrestHe believes that Freddie Gray was injured outside the paddy wagon the relative saidShe also gave an explanation of why Gray was not buckled into the police van He appeared belligerentThey didnt want to reach over him You were in a tight space in the paddy wagon Hes already irate she saidPolice have said five of the six officers have been interviewed by detectives while the sixth invoked the right to decline to be questionedWJLA reported the van driver was the officer who has not be interviewedReport Gray was trying to hurt himself prisoner saysThe news of what the second prisoner told police was in a Washington Post account that cites an investigative document written by a Baltimore police investigatorIn it a prisoner who was in the police van with Gray said he could hear Gray banging against the walls of the van and thought Gray was intentionally trying to injure himselfThe prisoner was separated from Gray by a metal barrier and could not see him police have saidWhen asked about the report Gray family attorney Jason Downs said they cannot react to rumors and the family wants to see the medical examiners findingsHe disputed the notion that Gray caused his own fatal injuryAny suggestion that Mr Gray harmed himself in the back of that van is something that Freddie Grays family strongly disagrees with Downs told CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront on Thursday In this case common sense dictates that Freddie Gray did not sever his own spinal cord whether it was outside of the van or inside the vanRegardless of what happened the police commissioner said Gray should have gotten medical help soonerWe know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times Batts said last week
