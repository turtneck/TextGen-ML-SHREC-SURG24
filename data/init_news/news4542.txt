It started in 1998 with a 50 check out of the blueThe money was a donation from one of the highestplaced men in Florida politics  Jeb Bush the son of a former president who was about to be elected governor  to one of the lowest Marco Rubio 26 was running for the city commission in tiny West MiamiI remember him showing it off a Rubio friend recalled I got a check from Jeb BushIn the years to come the two men formed an alliance that at times even looked like a politicians odd version of friendship Rubio younger and gifted provided Bush with help in the state legislature Bush provided Rubio with donors endorsements and  at one especially curious moment  a golden swordBy this week however the relationship itself had become a kind of weaponSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you Rubio told Bush during Wednesday nights GOP presidential debate after Bush had criticized Rubio The power of the comeback was in its familiarity  in Rubios pitying sense that he knew Bush well enough to know Bush had betrayed himselfThat moment had been coming for months as a presidential election put the old allies on a path to collide They schmoozed the same donors Courted the same proestablishment voters Each threw insults  veiled then not veiled  at the otherA confrontation was coming And people who watched these allies turn into enemies had little doubt who would winIt was a godsend for Marco a chance to show off his political talents and get out of Bushs shadow all in the same sentence said Jorge Luis Lopez a lawyer in Miami who is backing Rubio For years everybody in Rubios camp always had to validate Is Marco ready to do it And now everybody sees Marco is ready to do it And it came from the lips of his own mentorFor now both Rubio and Bush are losing in this race But both say theyre playing a longer game After a while both men believe the outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson will fade and voters will come looking for somebody safer Both Bush and Rubio of course think the safe choice will be himThat competition has put the campaigns spotlight on a twodecadeslong relationship that never fit conventional categoriesFriends was always too warm a word even back thenEnemies is too strong even nowFrenementor said Dan Gelber a Democrat who served in the Florida House when both Rubio and Bush were in state governmentBush and Rubio were born 18 years apart into vastly different American experiences Rubios parents were Cuban immigrants who had worked as a bartender and a maid Bush was a Bush The first office he ran for was governor of FloridaAs Rubio rose in politics  interning for a congresswoman working for a politically connected lawyer  Bush took notice That was what the 50 was aboutThen in 2000 the two men realized they could help each other in new and more concrete ways Rubio was a new state legislator at a time when term limits had cleared out the old guard Bush was the governor looking for a new allyJeb looked around and suddenly Marco was one of the people he knew best in the House said a former colleague who worked closely with both men Rubio advocated Bushs ideas and Bush steered Rubio toward conservative politics especially the gospel of small governmentBy 2005 the two men were close enough that when Rubio gave an emotional speech after winning the race to be Floridas House speaker Bush made a show of his mentorship Bush honored Rubio with a gift a sword which he said belonged to a great conservative warrior named ChangChang is somebody who believes in conservative principles believes in entrepreneurial capitalism believes in moral values that underpin a free society Bush told a crowd so large that a plane had to be chartered to ferry wellwishers from Miami to Tallahassee Chang this mystical warrior has never let me downThis gesture was even stranger than it sounds It appears that Chang was not a real person but something from a Bush family injoke about Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kaishek Unleash Chiang Now Jeb  whose father was once the US envoy to Beijing  had garbled the story into something about a mystical warrior with a swordThe sword really meant something to Jeb a longtime friend and colleague of both men said He thought it was Marco who would continue his legacyAt the time the sword seemed to mean something to Rubio too He hung it in a place of honor in his office  or at least he used toI have it somewhere at home Rubio told reporters in New Hampshire this year I have young kids I dont want them to run around with a swordBush left the governors office in 2007 After that friends say he kept up his alliance with the stillrising RubioHe supported Rubio working donors behind the scenes when Rubio took on the Florida GOP establishment in the 2010 Senate race After Rubio won the two would meet for coffee after workouts in the gym at the luxurious Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables Fla where Bush has an officeThen the men  who now shared friends donors and allies  began to realize they would be rivalsHes entitled to do this  theres not something per se wrong Al Cardenas a power broker in Florida politics who backs Bush said of Rubio But we believe that most people would have decided not to proceedBush made clear last year that he planned to run In April Rubio announced his candidacy and pointedly told his audience that America couldnt go back to the leaders and ideas of the pastThis was the first of many signals Rubio wasnt just running alongside his old ally but against him lumping him in with Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton as symbols of the stale political orderThe minute I saw Rubios announcement I had every reason to assume regrettably that this was never going to be the same said Jorge Arrizurieta who first met Bush in the 1980s served in different roles during his governorship and is now a top donorIve heard many common friends call it a betrayal by Marco but not Jeb said Ana Navarro a Republican strategist who is a friend of both men but supports Bush in this race Jebs not a guy to cry over spilled milk Jebs got a goal ahead of him and wasting time psychoanalyzing Marcos motives wont help him get thereSince then Bush and Rubio have rarely spoken one anothers names  but they have talked about each other all the timeRubio for instance talked for 25 minutes in June at the Prescott Bush awards dinner  named for Jeb Bushs grandfather  without mentioning the Bush name He never mentioned Bush to a room full of seniors during a central Florida campaign stop in SeptemberBut in both places he implied a contrast telling the Prescott Bush awards crowd in Connecticut that it was time to transition from the past we are so proud of to the exciting future that awaits our countryBush has also deployed a knockhimwithoutnaminghim strategy against Rubio For months hes called for members of Congress who miss many votes  as Rubio has  to have their pay dockedIn late September Bush tried to burnish his leadership credentials by telling a TV interviewer that he relied on people like Marco Rubio and many others to follow my leadership in Florida Later the two campaigns squabbled about which one of them had a disappointing quarter of fundraising They both didBy Monday Bushs campaign  increasingly desperate amid a cash shortage and staff cuts  labeled Rubio a GOP Obama in a meeting with top donors That may not sound like an insult since Obama did manage to get elected president twice But Bush meant it in the context of Republicans who view the president as inexperienced and untrustworthyIn a broad sense Bush was losing the argument Rubio was overtaking him in the polls And the very thing that had made Rubio such an attractive ally before  he shared Bushs basic political beliefs but did a better job of selling them  made him a devastating rival nowI support Jeb because hes older hes got a lot of experience he was governor for two terms and did an extraordinarily good job but if Jeb doesnt make it I certainly hope Marco does said Barney Bishop a prominent Florida lobbyist who is backing Bush but has also given to Rubios super PAC A lot of us are torn between both Jeb and Marco because we think Marco has a great future ahead of him We dont want to see either one of them have to do battle with each other in order to get aheadTheir competition finally came to a head at Wednesday nights debate producing the defining moment in their relationship so farEven on the attack Bush seemed hindered by the relationship and by his blueblood sense of decorum Could I  could I bring something up here he saidMarco when you signed up for this the Senate this was a sixyear term and you should be showing up to work Bush saidRubio seemed to know that the intimacy of their relationship gave him more power not less He looked Bush right in the eye kneecapped him and then turned away from him to face the audienceMy campaign is going to be about the future of America its not going to be about attacking anyone else on this stage he said I will continue to have tremendous admiration and respect for Governor BushHe was talking about his old ally as though Bush was already gone
