Des Moines Iowa CNN As Christians they want to be compassionate As Americans they want to be safeThats the message from Iowa Republicans as they come to terms with the Syrian refugee crisis that has quickly dominated the presidential race Nearly the entire Republican field has taken a hardline stance toward admitting any more Muslim refugees raising the specter that Islamic militants could infiltrate the refugee population and therefore immigrate easily to the United StatesFor conservatives on edge after the attacks on Paris the rhetoric resonatesBut at least half of the votes cast in next Februarys primary here will come from those who come from the evangelical tradition And some here say theyre not watching the plight of persecuted Syrians as Republican primary voters but as Christians whose faith tells them to be compassionate  and that could mean accepting refugees who have nowhere else to turnIm not trying to cast aspersions on Muslims in general because Im sure the vast majority of Muslims are good people just like the vast majority of Christians are said Richard Tucker sitting alone an hour before a major Iowa faith conference began FridayYou can be very compassionate towards people but to me my first responsibility is to my family my community he said No matter how much compassion I may have for some other group if I dont think I can allow that group into my community or near my family and be safe then they cant be let inThe attacks in Paris last week immediately rocked the Republican race and the entire field spent much of the week telling voters how tough they would be toward ISIS and the Syrian refugee population Several GOP candidates said they would openly accept Christian refugees but that Muslims posed too great a riskLate this week several Republican presidential candidates raced even further to the right Ben Carson compared some in the refugee population to rabid dogs And Donald Trump said he was open to the idea of a national registry of all Muslims in the United StatesFor Iowans jittery that a Parislike attack could happen here at home that language might be a political winnerI really dont want to get blown up by them SOBs said Carl Arson a small farmer who came to Ted Cruzs town hall in Harlan Iowa on Friday to decide between Cruz and Trump Arson said he supported sending all Muslims currently in the US out of the country I dont trust them Isnt this a Christian nation Am I wrongThe refugee crisis has hung over all of Cruzs events for the past week as the Texas Republican tried to take the harshest antiISIS position At the Harlan town hall state Rep Steve Holt said Cruzs advocacy was another reason why he supported Cruz for presidentHolt told CNN that the US should consider another Trump proposal this week  closing down some mosques that foster Islamic extremism or antiAmericanismIm a 20year Marine Im a Republican Im not afraid of widows and orphans I do fear for the safety of my country and the safety of my children Holt said Ill tell you the compassionate thing to do wouldve been for President Obama to have a policy that would not lead to what were dealing with right nowOther Iowans of faith struggled more openly with the balance Michelle Steen a 61yearold greeter at the faith forum here said she does want the Muslim refugees to eventually be sheltered by the West but that she understands the need for a shortterm pauseSteen who supports Carson said she appreciated his analogy of airplane passengers securing their own oxygen mask during an emergency before helping their children or friendsLets get our country secure and then we can help others she said as evangelicals streamed into their seats Itd be better to wait and just be safe about itA few feet away Josh Byers a 37yearold pastor at Willowcreek Baptist Church in West Des Moines said he too believed the US put national security challenges before the dictums of his faith He said he supported not allowing Syrian Muslims into the United StatesBut that doesnt mean the church cant forcefully back Syrians in need helping to house the homeless and feed the hungry even if they are not ChristiansThe churchs role is not to be the state The states role is not to be the church Byers said Its very clear scripiturally that thats the case and practically it works out pretty well too
