On Sunday during an appearance on Face the Nation on CBS Speaker John Boehner ROhio tried to downplay the differences between the GOP leadership and the conservative rank and file in the HouseWe do have some members who disagree from time to time over the tactics that we decide to employ Boehner said at one point We get in an argument over tactics from time to time he said at another The goals are all the sameThat line was echoed by House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy RCalif during an interview with Chuck Todd on NBCs Meet the PressWe have a difference of opinion in strategy and tactics but in principle we are united McCarthy saidThose statements are only half trueThe true part is that Boehner McCarthy and the rest of the House GOP leadership team do have a broad strategy and a series of tactics they try to employ to both accomplish their legislative goals and pressure President Obama Whether thats Plan B Boehners attempt to avert the fiscal cliff while simultaneously forcing Obamas hand or the latest attempt to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security for three weeks Boehner McCarthy and the rest have a strategy behind most of these big legislative fights The lack of a backup plan on the other hand is a little oddThe untrue part is that the rump Republican resistance led by a handful of tea partyaligned conservatives has its own alternative strategy or even tactics Think back to the vote for speaker earlier in this Congress The establishment had a plan to get Boehner reelected to the Houses top job The resistance Not so much They nominated three alternatives to Boehner Dan Webster of Florida Ted Yoho of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas ensuring that the antiBoehner vote was splintered What did that reveal That even in making a purely protest vote there wasnt a whole heck of a lot strategy going on in the notBoehner crowdFast forward to Fridays vote on the threeweek extension backed by Boehner Yes the conservative coalition in the House was absolutely the key to killing that measure But to what end What is the broader strategy of voting that extension down The answer that group will give you is to tie the repeal of Obamas immigration executive orders to funding DHS But that is never going to happen Even if Senate Democrats allowed a vote on such a joined package and it passed which wouldnt happen Obama would veto it without a second thought And we would be right back where we startedThis is a classic lettingtheperfectgetinthewayofthegood approach It is neither a strategy nor a tactic to say we will get everything we want or there will be no deal Saying no isnt a strategy Jeb Bush addressed that reality during his questionandanswer session at CPAC last week Its good to oppose bad things Bush said We need to start being for thingsThats what Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy have been saying for quite some time The problem for Boehner and to a lesser extent McConnell is that they are not dealing with a group of members who see the world as they do While Boehner et al are trying to draw up a broad strategy of how to approach the final two years of Obamas presidency the resisters in the House are taking it issue by issue and always standing on ideological ground to oppose ObamaOpposition without a plan of what to do next is neither a tactic nor a strategy Thats why John Boehner may have the most difficult job of any speaker in modern history
