The vast majority of Republicans want Donald Trump to be president Theyve repeatedly told the pollsters theyve turned out in huge numbers for the GOP nominees rallies theyve given him a recordbreaking number of small donations and they are trying to help him win Some of them were for Rubio some of them were for Kasich and a lot of them were for Cruz but they have come together in an effort to save the country from Hillary ClintonA small minority of Republicans do not want Donald Trump to be president They prefer Hillary Clinton Unfortunately for most of the Republican Party this small group of angry dissenters includes many of the people at the top of the party  officeholders major donors strategists and conservative pundits These people have been able to leverage their connections with the mainstream press to repeatedly attack Trump  even though they refuse to say anything nice about HillaryThe Republican Party is led by people who have more in common with the Clintons than with the GOP baseTheir fundamental problem is that they are closer to Hillary on most issues than they are to Republican voters The honorable thing for them to do would be to leave the GOP altogether and work with the Democrats  as some like Andrew Sullivan haveBut theyre unwilling to do that Instead they take Hillarys side on every issue while claiming to be pushing the conservative line Furthermore it gives them an incentive to talk about everything in personal terms  as if they would have supported someone like say Huckabee if the former Arkansas governor had been nominated even though thats not true So instead of having an honest discussion as to whether the GOP should be a globalist party or a nationalist party everything dissolves into personal attacksWhen this election is over the vast majority of Republicans are going to remember that their supposed leaders  the same officeholders millionaires and pundits who told them that they had to come together and support John McCain and Mitt Romney  refused to do the same for Donald Trump They will know that what they have long suspected is true  the Republican Party is led by people who have more in common with the Clintons than with the GOP base And that knowledge will affect the future of the GOP for years to comeLaura Ingraham joined FOX News Channel in 2007 and currently serves as a contributor providing political analysis and commentary to FNCs daytime and primetime programming She is theEditorinChief of LifeZettecom In addition to her role as a contributor Ingraham is a frequent substitute host on FNCs The OReilly Factor As the host of the radio program The Laura Ingraham Show she is also the most listenedto woman in political talk radio in the United States heard by hundreds of radio stations nationwide Ingraham previously served as a litigator and Supreme Court law clerk
