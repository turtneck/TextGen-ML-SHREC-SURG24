Those who have the most years to save for retirement appear to be the most worried that when the time comes they wont be financially readyThats a key finding from a new report released Tuesday by Bank of America and Merrill EdgeThe survey of more than 1000 Americans found that among Gen Xers who were still working 74 were most likely to believe theyll be financially stressed in retirement based on how they are currently putting money away Among Millennials 67 had the same fearThats in contrast to 59 of current retirees who say they arent worried about money because of how they savedSome of that disparity can be attributed to the younger generations simply fearing the unknownThe retirees now know what their costs are in retirement says Aron Levine head of Merrill Edge at Bank of America They know what theyre spending in the near term their health care costs so its a little easier to understand and look out over the next few years vs Gen X and Millennials who are looking 20 to 25 years out in the future The unknown and everything they see and read suggests a very stressful situationBut a big source of the stress is that the younger generations are juggling many situations from aging parents to student loansIts that combination of having to deal with a lot of priorities and really focusing on paying down debt and the uncertainties around health care and other costs Levine saysHealth care costs are a top worry regardless of age with 65 of all those surveyed saying that unexpected medical costs would strain their finances in retirement A lack of Social Security benefits came in second with 38 of respondents saying that would stress their budgetsWhat people do see is that health care costs keep going up and the question ties into longevity Levine says If youre a Gen Xer or Millennial you say I may live a lot longer than previous generations  How do I save if Im going to live into my 90s Apparently a good number of Millennials believe the answer in part is getting money from family and friends The report found 43 of that age group say they are counting on some financial help from loved ones if they need it in retirement That may be tied into a belief that theyll get an inheritance to help tide them over Levine says and with Millennials in particular sharing is becoming a big part of how they live Zipcar and Uber and social media  so thematically for them its reasonable to think theyll get help from people along the wayA better path however would be to have a savings plan and many Gen Xers defined by the study as ages 35 to 49 and Millennials ages 1834 are not seeking help from a professional to create oneThe report found 24 of nonretirees are working on retirement goals with an adviser vs 38 of retirees who did the same before quitting workA lot of Gen Xers and Millennials are not seeking outside help to the degree previous generations did Levine say noting todays retired seniors had a plan They stuck with it they got help along the way and now that plan has worked for them for 30 or 40 yearsEric Roberge a certified financial planner whose business caters to Millennials says that its not too late for those who have been straggling with their savings to get on trackFor Millennials this is the time to take action around their finances he says This involves taking a hard look at their income and expenses and their assets and debt These items make up their financial foundationsNext he says identify an amount of money that they can contribute to their retirement accounts Saving early and often is a good recipe for creating an adequate amount of money that will support them in the future Early on in our working years is the best time to start And at that time the amount of money they are saving is much more important than how this money is investedAll the worry about the future might be leading to a silver lining Levine says The report found a significant bump in the percentage of people who say theyre making their future finances a priority jumping from 48 to 61 in one yearYou may see that come through in signing up for the 401k at work and taking advantage of opportunities when theyre given them to save more Levine saysEmotions and stress are starting to drive better actions whether its thinking about how to save more or taking specific actions to save more
