Donald Trump has regained the lead in Iowa but things can still change On the Democratic side young voters could tip the caucus toward Bernie Sanders but only if they turn out And many people who say theyre independents are just embarrassed partisans This is HuffPollster for Monday January 25 2016 TRUMP PULLING AHEAD AGAIN IN IOWA  The last four GOP polls from Iowa show businessman Donald Trump with substantial leads of 511 percentage points over Texas Sen Ted Cruz The HuffPost Pollster average has shifted to showing a more than fourpoint lead for Trump again after the two were essentially tied just a few days ago CNN Emerson College CBSYouGov Fox NewsExpect more upheaval in Iowa GOP polls over the next week  Philip Bump Earlier this month Fox News released a poll showing Ted Cruz leading Donald Trump by four points The two had a sizable lead over everyone else in the state and the poll was confirming what others were showing Cruz had an advantage On Sunday Fox released another Iowa poll with substantially different results Now Trump is up by 11 points a 15point swing in the two weeks between surveys This poll too mirrors the recent trend Trump has regained the advantage Its still a surprising development Trumps gained a lot across the board while most of his competitors have slipped So whats going on This is the same polling firm and the same methodologyThe story of this new poll is that Iowa has changed And over the next eight days it will change more WashPost HUGE AGE GAP AMONG DEMOCRATS IN IOWA  A new CBSYouGov poll shows Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders up by 1 percentage point over Hillary Clinton mirroring the very tight race the HuffPost Pollster average shows But unlike many other polls YouGov released vote preference by age revealing an enormous gap between younger and older votersTheres more evidence for a wide age gap  Most primary polls have small sample sizes making it difficult to break the results down by age group and find additional support for YouGovs numbers But the latest NBCWSJMarist poll reported vote preferences among those under and over 45 years old In the younger cohort 62 percent support Sanders while in the older group 60 percent support Clinton NBCWSJMarist  Why the age gap matters in Iowa In generalpeople below the age of thirty are less likely to turn out to vote in elections They have especially low voter turnout in the Iowa caucus With the exception of 2008 in the last five presidential elections only 34 percent of eligible caucus goers under the age of 29 voted in the Iowa caucus making up between 917 percent of the overall caucus goers But sometimes younger voters do show up to vote as was evident in 2008 when 13 percent of eligible caucus goers under 29 turned out to vote CIRCLE DES MOINES REGISTER ENDORSEMENT OF CLINTON AND RUBIO UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THE RACE MUCH  Harry Enten Lets look at how past candidates were doing in the polls before getting the Iowa papers endorsement and how they did once all the votes were countedSeven of the nine candidates since 1988 did in fact do better than we expected them to do before getting the papers endorsementThe papers endorsement is credited for greatly improving the fortunes of 2004 Iowa runnerup John Edwards but most of these candidates havent gotten anything like the Edwards bounce The average postendorsement bump has been a statistically insignificant 3 percentage points 538 A RACE FOR SECOND IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE GOP PRIMARY  Trump remains firmly at the top of the New Hampshire GOP polls but Florida Sen Marco Rubio Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich are battling for second Rubio and Cruz are basically tied in the HuffPost Pollster average with a little more than 12 percent support each Kasich isnt far behindNEW HAMPSHIRE DEMOCRATS HOLD STEADY  Bernie Sanders still has a solid lead in the New Hampshire polls The new CBSYouGov poll shows him with a massive 19point lead while Suffolk shows a more moderate 9 point lead HuffPost MORE AMERICANS INDEPENDENT THAN EVER BUT WITH A CAVEAT  Samara Klar and Yanna Krupnikov What distinguishes independents from partisans is not their political positions In fact most independents arent independent at all They hold clear partisan preferences but they utterly refuse to identify with their preferred partyWe find that many Americans are largely ashamed of the dysfunction in Washington Rather than associate with candidates and politicians who are portrayed by media as stubborn and aggressive a plurality of Americans would rather present an image of calm cool independence Not only are Americans likely to present themselves as independent but they also prefer that others do the same Vox  That limits a thirdparty or independent candidates chances  More from Klar and Krupnikov In order for political independents to rise up and elect a thirdparty candidate two things would have to occur First people who say they are independent would have to truly believe that neither of the two parties can effectively represent them Second the group of people who report that they are independent would have to have sufficiently coherent interests so as to coalesce around the same candidate Both of these criteria suggest it is unlikely that people who call themselves independents will move America toward a third party Vox  OBAMA FINISHES UP FINAL TERM WITH MIXED PUBLIC FEELINGS ON HIS LEGACY  Pew Report Overall views of Obamas legacy  like his job approval ratings  fall roughly between those of George W Bushs and Bill Clintons About as many say in the long run Obama will be a successful president 37 as say he will be unsuccessful 34 while 26 think it is too early to tellIn general Democrats view Obamas legacy in similar terms as they saw Clintons in 1999 Nearly twothirds 65 say Obama will be a successful presidentBut Republicans are much more critical of Obamas legacy today than they were of Clintons then And in their assessments of whether Obamas accomplishments will surpass his failures Republicans express even more negative views today than Democrats did about Bush in 2007 Pew HORSE RACE POLLING HAS A LIMITED LIFE SPAN  Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie Surveys of public opinion typically take place over two or three days then the results can start to age If the immediacy of information is unimportant the aging of a poll is not of great concern This is especially the case if the information sought is unlikely to change due to outside events During political campaigns however the information environment is dynamic so poll results tend to age quickly Depending on the information of interest to the reader an aging poll might still be useful But if you are following the horse race who is leading an election in a hypothetical matchup and want to know the support for candidates or issues in a dynamic environment a poll grows less valuable as it ages In some elections where voters have limited information about the issues and dont know the candidates very well horserace polling may be useless within a day or two of being completed HuffPost HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL  You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email Just
