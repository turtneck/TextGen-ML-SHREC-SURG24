He trusts no one and places a premium on revenge If you do not get even you are just a schmuckHe treats every decision he makes like a lover sometimes thinking with his head other times with other parts of his body because it reminds him to keep in touch with my basic impulsesAnd to make creative choices he writes I try to step back and remember my first shallow reaction The day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was for me a deep experienceThis is Donald J Trump as he sees himself and the worldCNN scoured thousands of pages of books speeches profiles and television interview transcripts from the past three decades to stitch together a portrait based entirely on the Republican presidential frontrunners own wordsTaken together his words offer further insight into the leadership style of the billionaireturnedpolitician whose extraordinary candidacy has simultaneously electrified and repulsed large swaths of the electorateTrump authored more than a dozen books about his experiences in the business world that shaped this outlook  most of them selfhelp treatises with titles including the 1987 bestseller The Art of the Deal 2004s Think Like a Billionaire Everything You Need to Know About Success Real Estate and Life and 2007s Think BigTrump himself has shared his story in detail Some recurrent themes in his writings include strength success selfconfidence distrust and revenge He has often written and spoken about what he sees as the decline of the United States a bedrock theme of his presidential campaignThe world is a vicious and brutal place he wrote in Think Big Even your friends are out to get you They want your job they want your house they want your money they want your wife and they even want your dogWhen people wrong you go after those people because it is a good feeling and because other people will see you doing it he writes I always get evenIf I had been the son of a coal minerTrumps life story in the broadest of brush strokes goes like thisHe was born the son of wealthy New York realestate developer Fred C Trump He went to a private military academy in high school attended Fordham for two years then the Wharton School of Finance from which he graduatedWhile his father did business in Brooklyn and Queens Trump set off to make his mark in Manhattan He became fabulously wealthy think penthouse helicopter yacht private plane in the real estate boom of the 80s then nearly lost it all when the boom went bust He has since rebounded to the tune  he says  of a personal fortune of 10 billion Forbes estimates his net worth at 45 billionAs he has run his empire and ascended as a mega star on reality TV Trump has often been accused of being a bully which he deniesHe does however acknowledge being a very assertive aggressive kidWhen he was in elementary school he formed the opinion that his music teacher didnt know much about musicSo Trump punched him in the face he wrote in 1987s The Art of the DealIn the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye he wrote Im not proud of that but its clear evidence that even early on I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known in a very forceful way The difference now is that I like to use my brain instead of my fists He adds that he almost got expelled over the incidentThe elder Trump completed his project and liked it so much that he glued the blocks togetherIt was a selfadmiration that would carry over into his real life as a builderIn Think Big he writes of the emotional reaction he has when arriving to work at Trump TowerI love to see the crowds of people oohing and aahing at the stunning marble and the breathtaking 80foot waterfall he wrote In truth I am dazzled as much by my own creations as are the tourists and glamour hounds that flock to Trump Tower  or any of my other propertiesThe mutual admiration of his work Trump wrote makes him feel a little closer to them even though weve never metThe billionaire developer has long felt a kinship with bluecollar workers  and he believes the feeling is reciprocated There is without question an aspirational nature to his candidacy and bluecollar workers have shown up at the polls in droves to support his bid for the Republican nomination  often expressing admiration for his success and a belief that his financial wealth will free him from the influence of special interests if he makes it to the White HouseRich men are less likely to like me Trump told Playboy in a 1990 interview but the working man likes me because he knows I worked hard and didnt inherit what Ive builtTrump acknowledges he was born wealthy  he grew up in a 23room house in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens  and that his father loaned him money to begin his own business But he stresses that he set himself apart when he headed to Manhattan and began building skyscrapers instead of affordable rental unitsI often say that Im a member of the lucky sperm club he wrote in 2009s Think Like A ChampionBut did it give me a natural talent I dont think so It gave me an advantage that I deliberately chose to develop into an advantageThere is an it factor people like him are born with Trump has saidTo explain what he meant by it Trump the son of a multimillionaire evoked the plight of mine workers with black lung disease in the interview with PlayboyIf I had been the son of a coal miner I would have left the damn mines said Trump then 43 But most people dont have the imaginationor whatever  to leave their mineThey dont have it  he saidTrump seems most selfcritical when writing about the near collapse of his realestate empire in 1990In the early 90s I was in a ton of debt I had gone from the smartest guy in town to a complete zero he wrote in 2007s Think Big I went from being a super genius to a moronHe recalled walking down the street one day with his thenwife Marla Maples and reflecting on his situation He pointed to a nearby manThat beggar over there is worth 900 million more than I am he wroteWhat do you mean Maples askedBecause Im 900 million in debt he replied and at least he has money in his pocketHe attributed his fall not only to the revision of the tax code by Congress in 1986  which he said destroyed just about any incentive anyone might have for investing in real estate  but also to his own complacencyYou just get a feeling of invincibility he said reflecting on his downward spiral in that bookYou let down your guard You dont work as hard Then things start to go in the wrong directionTrump who has written that he sleeps threetofour hours a night so he can devote as much time as possible to his work does not dwell on his misfortune on the campaign trail except to establish the depths from which he reemergedHe threatened to sue a Washington Post reporter who wrote about the bankruptcy of the Taj Mahal one of his casinos in Atlantic City according to an interview with that reporter on NPRs Fresh Air Trump also reacted indignantly to a question about his bankruptcies during CNNs September debate last year insisting that he merely took advantage of US laws to help his businessBack on top in the mid2000s Trump wrote Think Big which shows the evolution of his management style and his values as a leaderDO NOT TRUST ANYONE reads one chapter subheadingI used to say Go out and get the best people and trust them Over the years I have seen too many shenanigans and now I say Get the best people and dont trust themAnother maxim in Trumps world is revengeI always get even he writes in a chapter dedicated to the subjectShe was a nobody in her government job and going nowhere Trump wrote of the unnamed woman I decided to make her into somebodyUnder his mentoring Trump wrote the woman became powerful in real estate and bought a beautiful homeWhen Trump was under intense financial pressure in the early 90s he asked the woman to make a phone call to an extremely close friend of hers who held a powerful position at a big bank who would have done what she askedSo Trump got rid of her he wroteShe ended up losing her home Her husband who was only in it for the money walked out on her and I was glad he continued Over the years many people have called asking for a recommendation for her I only give her bad recommendations This woman was very disloyal and now I go out of my way to make her life miserableTrump punctuated the anecdote with several bullet points at the end of the chapter includingWhen somebody screws you screw them back in spades and Go for the jugular so that people watching will not want to mess with youThat approach was shaped by his own travails in business in the early 1990s as he watched his empire collapse around himI believe in an eye for an eye  like the Old Testament says he wrote in The Art of the ComebackSome of the people who forgot to lift a finger when I needed them when I was down they need my help now and Im screwing them against the wall Im doing a number And Im having so much funWhile Trumps writings and statements are geared primarily toward the business world he has routinely weighed in on politics over the yearsFavorite themes are the need for national strength and restoring Americas stature abroad which he says has been diminishing for decadesIn the Playboy interview he referred to the 1989 prodemocracy movement in Beijings Tiananmen Square in which some 10000 government troops killed an unknown number of protestorsWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square the Chinese government almost blew it Trump said Then they were vicious They were horrible but they put it down with strength Our country is right now perceived as weak  as being spit on by the rest of the worldIn Think Big he criticized thenSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a smiling waving lightweight who is no match for the murderous dictators she was dispatched to deal withCondi Rice just goes over there to get her picture taken Trump wroteTrump states without equivocation that he could accomplish a feat that has eluded politicians for decadesI could negotiate peace in the Middle East  very few other people could he wrote in Think BigAside from a brief flirtation with the idea of a presidential bid in 2000 however Trump has spent most of his years in the spotlight denying or downplaying such aspirationsI think Im almost too honest to be a politician he told CNN in 1997Im too forthright Im too  I think Im too honest he said but I do believe Im too forthright to be a politician
