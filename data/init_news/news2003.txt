San Diego CNN Hillary Clinton is back in the Golden State Bernie Sanders seemingly has been living hereThe former secretary of state begins a fiveday swing through California on Thursday that she hopes will result in a victory that convinces Sanders and his supporters that its time to unite against Donald TrumpBut Sanders shows no signs of going away The Vermont senator who has used a bus to traverse the state headlined over 27 rallies and forums last month and is expected to have a jam packed schedule the week before Tuesdays primaryClinton had planned to campaign this week in New Jersey ahead of that states Tuesday primary but the campaign decided instead to fly to San Diego for a speech on foreign policy that will also go directly after Trump as well as tout her own experience as secretary of stateClinton will argue that the choice in 2016 goes beyond partisanship because Trump is unlike any presidential nominee weve seen in modern times and he is fundamentally unfit for the job Jake Sullivan Clintons senior policy adviser said in a statementThe speech shows the predicament Clinton is currently in She is committing five days to battle Sanders in California a solidly Democratic general election state while also trying to focus on the presumptive GOP nomineeI wonder why Secretary Clinton and her husband Bill are back in California Sanders sarcastically told reporters Wednesday in Spreckels California I thought we had lost it It was all over but I guess Secretary Clinton maybe is looking at some polling would suggest otherwiseThe nonstop campaigning  coupled with a small ad buy dozens of surrogate events and targeted get out the vote efforts  is more than Clintons senior aides expected to commit to California months agoAides acknowledge Clinton could lose the state despite polls showing her up narrowly Internal polling has Clinton up double digits in New Jersey aides said and their thinking is that it doesnt make sense to be in the Garden State while the race in California is still tightClearly California is a big state and I am going to do everything I can to meet as many voters as possible Clinton told CNN on Tuesday I was proud today to be endorsed by Gov Jerry Brown and we are going to keep working as diligently and tirelessly as we can to get as much voters to turn out and vote for me next TuesdayI will tell you that in every state that we have gone into we have taken on the entire Democratic establishment Sanders said in response to a question about Browns endorsement Its not surprising to me that you know we will have the Democratic establishment supporting Hillary ClintonAt the same time the former secretary of state doesnt need to win California  or even come that close  to win the nomination on TuesdayClinton currently needs 70 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination according to CNNs estimate a number she is likely to win from the New Jersey primary Because results from New Jersey will come in hours before California top aides assume that most news networks will call the Democratic Primary on Tuesday before results come in from the West Coast And since delegates are awarded proportionally  this isnt winnertakeall as some of the big GOP contests were  a Sanders win in California wouldnt make a much of a dent in her leadBut Clinton aides said they were aware that losing California to Sanders would be embarrassing for her campaign and could hand the Vermont senator the needed momentum to justify staying in the race through Democratic convention in JulySanders has continued to rail on the superdelegate system throughout California blasting the Democratic establishment for allowing Democratic elected officials and party insiders to have a vote in who the party nominatesIt is a pretty dumb system Sanders said in Monterey California on Tuesday about the fact so many party insiders are behind Clinton Its an unfair system its a dumb system and its a system we will changeBut Sanders with a win in California hopes he will be able to turn the system to his advantage Sanders and his aides have argued for weeks that a win in California will help the Vermont senator convince super delegates currently backing Clinton to support him insteadSo far though the effort has been largely fruitless Clinton has maintained a sizeable superdelegate lead and Sanders has only been able to flip one delegateIn an attempt to lower the stakes in California the Clinton campaign has instructed surrogates to say that they expect California to be a close contest but to downplay its importance in picking the eventual nomineeEven if Senator Sanders wins each of the remaining contests by 32 points Hillary Clinton will still have earned the majority of pledged delegates and popular vote read talking points distributed to supporters on TuesdayClinton will continue to largely ignore Sanders in California aides said a tactic Clinton employed in late May during a string of events in Los Angeles and the Bay AreaHer speech Thursday will begin drawing from her record as secretary of state defending what some Republicans have said will be a liability for her in a race against TrumpShe will reflect on her experience making the tough calls and doing the hard work of protecting our country Sullivan said Shell reaffirm her conviction that strong principled American leadership makes both the United States and the world more secureSullivan added And you will hear in her speech a confidence in America and our capacity to overcome the challenges we face while staying true to our values  a strong contrast to Donald Trumps incessant trashtalking of AmericaSanders however is expected to continue to draw contrast with Clinton as primary day in California gets closer He spent Wednesday hitting Clinton for opposing an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing a controversial drilling tacticSec Clinton does not support a ban on fracking Sanders tweeted on Wednesday Instead she would simply impose a few more regulations on it Not good enough
