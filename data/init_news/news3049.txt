Comments about recent events in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray provide a glimpse at perhaps one of our greatest challenges  perceptionIn this case as in too many others involving police perception seems to be black and whiteI think that if you look at whats happened over the course of the last year youve just got to scratch your head said House Speaker John Boehner R on NBCs Meet the Press referring to the rash of fatal incidents involving police officers and African American malesI heard your call for no justice no peace said Baltimore City States Attorney Marilyn Mosby D to demonstrators in her city and around the country as she announced charges against six police officers involved in the arrest of Gray To the youth of Baltimore she declared Our time is now and urged peaceful demonstrationBoth comments made headlines And both though well intentioned carried subliminal messages freighted with racial not racist undertonesBoehners overly cautious remark was as starkly white as his OxiCleaned handpressed shirts A man more accustomed to golf courses and marble hallways than to gritty urban streets he was plainly trying to acknowledge that we have a police and race problem in the United States But he sounded like hed just landed on the planetYes quite headscratching all this police businessMosbys remarks jubilantly received by the Baltimore crowd provoked high dudgeon elsewhere Some of the words used to describe her performance have included showboating demagoguing and grandstandingTo some ears Mosby sounded as though the cops convictions were a fait accompli That she found the evidence convincing enough to justify the charges may ultimately also justify her bravura Lets do keep in mind that Grays offense was making eye contact with an officer and running awayGrays voice box was crushed and his spine all but severed according to his family Anyone who watched the video could see that Gray was in terrible pain as he was led to the police van where he was shackled and his pleas for help apparently ignoredThat his life ended in pain and horror is not in dispute But no less a legal luminary than Alan Dershowitz has taken issue with the charges saying Theres no plausible hypothetical conceivable case for murder under the facts as we now know themCharges brought against the six officers included one count of seconddegree murder four counts of involuntary manslaughter assault and misconduct in officeIn other words Mosby threw everything she could against the six officers Many have asked For justice Or to quell the passions of the streets Perhaps both Mosby surely calculated that announcing the charges as she did  with a microphone in a public place  would have a dramatic effect She declined to be interviewed for this columnMosby also was speaking as a member of her community long plagued with a history of police brutality including last years fatal beating of Tyrone West The medical examiners report concluded that West died of a prior heart condition that was exacerbated by dehydration the July heat and his police encounterNo charges were leveled against the police in that case Thus from the perspective of many among Baltimores protesters the current charges are long overdue Even so one does worry that the six officers are paying not only for their role in Grays death to whatever degree this is determined but also for the cumulative sins of othersTo the officers the cheering and hornhonking following Mosbys words must have sounded like the Colosseum mobs cry for blood To an older generation of Americans they were reminiscent of the reaction 20years ago when a mostly black jury found OJ Simpson not guilty of murdering his exwife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron GoldmanWhites He totally did itAfrican Americans Its our turn in so many wordsThis past week whites across the United States spoke softly about the Freddie Gray case Thank God three of the cops were blackPresident Obama speaking after Mosby leveled her charges called for truth How indeed do we get to it In a diverse nation well never all see things exactly the same way nor would we want to but we might at least strive to recognize our own biases and judge our own perceptions as harshly as we do othersRead more from Kathleen Parkers archive follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook
