The Islamic State is brutal but for a purpose It can succeed in the short term because locals dont appear to have any other optionsWhy is Angela Merkel calling for a ban on the full Islamic veilThis undated file image posted on a militant website last year shows fighters from the Islamic State marching through Raqqa SyriaIn the early days of the Islamic State back when it was still taking shape from the remnants of Al Qaeda in Iraq Muslim scholars advised the group to take a page from the United States militarys playbookDuring the Sunni Awakening of 2008 American troops had successfully nurtured tribal councils and militias as partners to eject murderous insurgents from their homeland in western IraqAl Qaeda in Iraq failed because of its brutality zealotry and arrogant belief that it was a state said critics both jihadi and nonjihadi  according to Will McCants director of the Project on US Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution in WashingtonSo what did the Islamic State do It doubled downBy 2014 those were the very qualities that made the Islamic State so successful says Dr McCants author of the new book The ISIS ApocalypseIt is well known that the Islamic State is now governing a wide swath of Syria and Iraq through a modernday reign of terror What is less wellknown is why that approach has been so successful even attracting tens of thousands of foreignersThe answer appears to be in how that brutality takes shapeToward local populations that have little choice but to obey the Islamic State can promise  and carry out untold savagery On Sunday the Islamic State killed some 70 members of a tribe in Iraq that had tried to rise up against the group To the foreign fighters who pledge their lives to the cause by contrast the Islamic State promises lakeside homes in Raqqa Syria and high salariesThe campaign of fear and intimidation that hangs over locals works largely because there are no other options Sunni Muslims in ISheld territory trust the Syrian and Iraqi governments  which are run by other religious groups even less than they trust the Islamic State And no foreign power is likely to step in and tip the power balance toward local tribes as the US did in the Sunni AwakeningThe result is a pseudostate that breaks all the modern rules  governing through a very calculated mix of opportunism and oppressionIt was a tough thing for me to see because I had bought into the idea put around by the western analytical community  but also by former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden himself  that if youre going to wage an insurgency and create a longlasting state you need to win over popular support says McCantsThe Islamic State has done the exact oppositeFor all its wanton spectacle the brutality of the Islamic State is not random It is part of a carefully calibrated statebuilding strategy that the group has been ramping up for yearsThe groups approach to establish control began with infiltration and ended with conquest as a Rand Corporation report released this month put it Time after time place after place the group would establish an intelligence and security apparatus target key opponents and establish extortion and other criminal revenueraising practices it noted Clandestine campaigns of assassination and intimidation have been part of the groups playbook for more than a decadeReports from groups on the ground as well as social media show that ISIS does rely on brutality much more than Al Qaeda says Harleen Gambhir a counterterrorism analyst with the Institute for the Study of War using a common acronym for the Islamic State This includes intentionally inspiring terror pushing the bounds so that it can intimidate those under its controlSundays slaughter was a typical example Ms Gambhir says These sorts of mass executions come frequently for those even vaguely hinting at rebellionThis summer an uprising in Libya was brutally put down by an IS affiliate which mass executed those in local tribes she adds This in turn eliminated all hints of social rebellionWhat the Islamic State has shown is that in the short term brutality  can be much more effective than worrying about others McCants says If you look at what IS has done you can see examples where control has been established by extreme brutality and kept up by extreme brutalityThe question is whether the Islamic State can maintain such a state over the long term Al Qaeda has long argued that its vision of establishing an Islamic caliphate is more sustainableIt thinks ISIS is going to burn out because of the way it treats locals Gambhir saysThe Islamic State instead has put a priority on bringing in foreign fightersISIS fighters  are given preference in obtaining food and basic needs of living she addsThere are clear signs that locals are chafing mightily under Islamic State rule says McCants But unless they get help from the outside they are going to have trouble throwing off the groupThat help is not likely to come from the US I have no doubt we could do it should we choose to says McCants but such an operation would necessarily include troops on the ground and embroil the US in the Middle East againMoreover it would let the local governments off the hook especially in Damascus and Baghdad McCants says As a result the problems that allowed the rise of the Islamic State in the first place including Sunni disenfranchisement by Shiitedominate governments would continueThis leaves us in the unsatisfying position of not having terrific options in the near term for destroying the IS McCants saysIn some ways the US might have more options in Syria McCants says because it is not working with the government Syria is always seen as the hard case but we also have greater freedom of choiceThe US could work with Kurdish forces to clear areas then build up local Sunni militias to hold them Yet Turkish officials balk at the idea of empowering Kurdish forces given the large Kurdish minority in TurkeyAs in 2008 the most promising center of gravity for the fight against the Islamic State is the Sunni tribes Many Sunnis support the group either because of intimidation or because they view it as their only protection against other groups the Rand report notes Although this will be difficult Iraq at least can start by ensuring fair treatment of the population when towns are recovered and by speeding the reconstruction of those townsThe question becomes how to empower them given the limited tools the US has at its disposalIn theory Iraqi government officials agree with the plan to engage Sunni tribal militias to some extent but theres been a lot of foot dragging he adds We could start arming the tribes ourselves but if they are not part of the Iraqi central government were kind of pushing the state of Iraq in a particular direction of a more federal stateStill McCants says the Sunni tribes should be our center of gravity too
