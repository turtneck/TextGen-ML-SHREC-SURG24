Typically the White House releases a few excerpts in advance of the State of the Union and 2015 is no exception to that rule Heres what theyve told us to expectWe are fifteen years into this new century Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world It has been and still is a hard time for manyBut tonight we turn the pageAt this moment  with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production  we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years and for decades to comeWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effortSo the verdict is clear Middleclass economics works Expanding opportunity works And these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the wayIn fact at every moment of economic change throughout our history this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot We set up worker protections Social Security Medicare and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity We gave our citizens schools and colleges infrastructure and the internet  tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take themThats what middleclass economics is  the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rulesI believe in a smarter kind of American leadership We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy when we leverage our power with coalition building when we dont let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents Thats exactly what were doing right now  and around the globe it is making a differenceIn Iraq and Syria American leadership  including our military power  is stopping ISILs advance Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East we are leading a broad coalition including Arab nations to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group Were also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism This effort will take time It will require focus But we will succeed And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISILNo foreign nation no hacker should be able to shut down our networks steal our trade secrets or invade the privacy of American families especially our kids We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats just as we have done to combat terrorism And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks combat identity theft and protect our childrens information If we dont act well leave our nation and our economy vulnerable If we do we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe
