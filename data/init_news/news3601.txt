Seven of the eight leading Republican presidential candidates gathered in Iowa on Thursday night for the seventh debate of the race Donald Trump the races clear frontrunner was less than 10 miles away from the debate site holding his own counterrally after deciding not to participate for decidedly vague reasonsI watched the whole thing We also annotated it Below is my take on the best and the worst from the night that was Rand Paul Maybe the senator just needed to take a debate off After not making the main stage in the sixth debate and refusing to appear in the undercard debate Paul was a major player in this one He showed off his trademark willingness to needle the other candidates he went after Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz at various points but also offered nuanced thoughts on racial profiling and abortion This was the Paul whom many political observers myself included thought we might see in this campaign A candidate willing and able to speak to issues his party has struggled to address in recent years Too little too late But at least he had a moment Megyn Kelly There has rarely been a debate moderator who has come under as much scrutiny as Kelly has during the course of this campaign Despite all of that negative attention Kelly showed on Thursday night why she is the face of Fox News She was pointed tough and wellversed on the issues And more important to me She showed her sense of humor and a willingness to not take herself too seriously That she performed so well with so many eyes on her speaks incredibly highly of her abilities Jeb Bush If you had any doubt about how much Donald Trump is in Bushs head this debate should have cleared it up The former Florida governor was from the getgo more relaxed and more forceful in this Trumpless debate than he has been in the previous six debates where Trump was included He owned his familys political legacy unapologetically He fought Rubio to a draw in an immigration back and forth He regularly was the only candidate aside from Paul who answered the questions asked of him Bush is still a somewhat okay very awkward candidate his halting closing statement was painful who doesnt really like going on the attack But without Trump looming over him Bush looked positively presidential Video reels of past candidate statements Fox ran video clips of both Rubio and Cruz saying things in the past that they have run away from in this campaign And it was great This is what debates should be about Holding candidates accountable Asking them to explain why what they said four years ago isnt what they are saying now I only wish Fox did this for all of the candidates Commercials Thank you Fox News A commercial every 30 minutes or so worked nicely both with my bathroom needs and my desire to consume somewhere between 100 and 120 Oreos blessed Ted Cruz Hedid the thing I hate the most in debates complain about the rules when he tried to game a bit more talking time and got shut down by moderator Chris Wallace The senators joking threat that if he kept taking incoming from the other candidates he might leave the stage Trump reference fell flat He was on the wrong end of a scolding by Paul over his conservative righteousness And time and time again Cruz found himself insisting that on a panoply of issues military spending immigration etc everyone was either wrong about his position or didnt understand it well enough Thats too much defense for Cruz to play especially in a debate without Trump Ben Carson Whoa boy Carson swung from barely being asked any questions to providing answers that often bordered on incoherence His response to a question about how to deal with Russia simply made no sense further adding to the narrative that he is far far out of his depth on foreign policy At one point he seemed stunned to even get a question which isnt the best look for a guy running to be the leader of a 300millionperson country Carson looked out of his league tonight Chris Christie The New Jersey governor felt a little like a Johnny OneNote tonight For every question he was asked the answer was how terrible Hillary Clinton is was and will be Okay I get that bashing Clinton is never a bad idea in a Republican primary but the strategy made Christie look very twodimensional and brought to my mind memories of Rudy Giulianis campaign in 2008 And not in a good way Fox News Channel The simple fact is that from an entertainment perspective this debate was less interesting than virtually all of the previous six The reason Trump wasnt there That of course is not entirely or even mainly Foxs fault But my guess is that the ratings for this debate will be significantly lower than the other Republican debates on major cable channels And if you dont think ratings are the way networks judge success I have a whole mess of compact discs theyre the future of music to sell you
