Let us be clear Republicans in the Senate are under no obligation to interview vote on or confirm President Obamas pick for the Supreme Court It does not matter that the president has nominated Judge Merrick Garland who is widely admired as a competent jurist It is not about the person it is about principle  but the GOP leadership has been remarkably inept at framing what that principle is and why they are in the rightThe point is this President Obama has caused this conflict by diminishing the role of the legislature and assuming unprecedented power for the executive branch He has purposefully skirted Congress for the better part of seven years instead pushing ahead on his mostly unpopular agenda through regulations and executive orders As a result the Court is being asked to act as referee ruling on the legality of Obamas my way or the highway presidency You dont change a referee in the middle of a contestThis isnt about Judge Robert Bork or the Biden Rule  this is a fight about President Obama undermining the checks and balances established in the ConstitutionFor instance President Obama has tried to essentially shut down our coal industry through new EPA regulations limiting carbon emissions These rules would create a massive dislocation to our economy which has long benefited from cheap energy including abundant coal That there is a significant cost to the economy is clear Hillary Clinton recently said Were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business How right and how cruelly nonchalant that statement is As reported in the New York Times The plan could transform the nations electricity system cutting emissions from existing power plants by a third by 2030 from a 2005 baseline by closing hundreds of heavily polluting coalfired plants and increasing production of wind and solar powerBecause of the sizeable cost to the economy lower courts have ruled against the presidents anticoal regulatory blitz The Supreme Court in an unprecedented move issued a stay requested by 29 states and numerous other groups which prevents implementation of the carbon rule while a lower court assesses its legality In effect the courts will rule on whether the White House is allowed to unilaterally punish one of our heritage industries and tens of thousands of workersAnother important issue before the Supreme Court is President Obamas executive action allowing some 6 million people living in the country illegally to be protected against deportation This unilateral effort to rewrite our immigration laws is opposed by a majority of Americans but it is a politically useful policy for Democrats hoping to win Latino votes Because of possibly harmful consequences 26 states sued to prevent the order from taking effectLast fall the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of those states upholding an earlier injunction that blocked implementation of the presidents executive order At the time Ken Paxton Attorney General of Texas which is leading the suit said Today the Fifth Circuit asserted that the separation of powers remains the law of the land and the president must follow the rule of law just like everybody else Thats the pointFor the Republican leadership refusing to consider Mr Obamas nominee is a matter of principle and also an opportunity to reward voters for having elected a Republican Congress Mitch McConnell John Boehner and others have come under heavy criticism for not effectively countering President Obamas policies In fairness substantial resistance from Congress led the president to go his own way using whatever tools he could find to pursue his legacy agenda Many think those tools went beyond the rightful scope of the executive branch Now it is up to the Supreme Court to decideBecause the Court will weigh whether Mr Obama has overstepped he cannot be allowed to put his thumb on the scale by adding another sympathetic jurist This is the message that Republican leaders need to send to voters the president has abused his authority and we rely on the Supreme Court to reestablish the checks and balances that prevent an imperial White House The GOP should not be cowed by the bloviating of the New York Times they are on the right side of this battleLiz Peek is a writer who contributes frequently to FoxNewscom She is a financial columnist who also writes for The Fiscal Times For more visit LizPeekcom Follow her on TwitterLizPeek
