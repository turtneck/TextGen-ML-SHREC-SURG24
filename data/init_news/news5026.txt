Establishment Republicans like the former governor of Florida rarely do so at an event dominated by a young libertarian wing of the party Bushs task on the other hand is to pay his respects and avoid any costly errors such as Mitt Romneys severely conservative outing at the same conference in 2012 The format of the event  a 20minute questionandanswer session with Fox News host Sean Hannity  plays to Bushs strengths but also carries risk as it will likely cover hostile territoryBushs attendance also gives conservatives an opportunity to shape the debate in their favor as well as a chance to protest moderate elements of the party that failed to sweep a Republican into the White House in the last two presidential electionsThe main sticking point regarding another Bush presidential campaign at least according to some conservatives at the conference is his support for the Common Core academic standards Bush has said he would remain committed to the standards if he runs for president a politically fraught move given their unpopularity in the Republican Party New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal Bushs likely rivals in the 2016 race who once supported the standards have since renounced themDorothy Marsh a retired teacher of 40 years from Jacksonville Florida said her son shared a class with little Jeb in high school Despite her familiarity with the man Marsh took issue with his enthusiastic embrace of Common Core which she described as overly restrictiveTeachers need to have creativity in their classroom Marsh told The Huffington Post on Thursday The last few years I felt like I got up and put on clothes that didnt fit I was wearing someone elses clothes This is not the way I reach children and I wasnt being an effective teacher because I wasnt comfortable in what I was doingEmmett McGroarty of the American Principles Project a Republican group that advocates for immigration reform and opposes Common Core said he was concerned the issue may cause longterm damage He sketched out a worstcase scenario should the party ultimately nominate a candidate like BushI think almost all the candidates on the Republican side will be against the Common Core That could fracture the vote and you could end up with a proCommon Core nominee McGroarty said In the general election that proCommon Core nominee will run against likely Hillary Clinton who has no Common Core baggage And that is going to make the Republican candidate I think unelectable Because the conservative voters will be disappointed their turnout will be suppressed and lowThe absence of visible support for Bush was conspicuous throughout the sprawling Gaylord National Resort and Conference Center on Thursday where backers of other GOP candidates flaunted Tshirts and banners and handed out stickers Some attendees said that they were willing to hear Bush out but he wasnt the first choice in their hearts or in their CPAC straw poll selections  the results of which will be announced on SaturdayHes too moderate like his brother Bill Bergmeier said of Bush They both move too much towards the Democrat side An Iowa native Bergmeier said he is looking forward to voting in his states firstinthenation Republican caucus next year but has no plans to vote for Bush I like Ted Cruz Scott Walker and Sarah Palin he saidJeffrey Capella a selfidentified staunch neoconservative said he doesnt have any real hesitations about Bushs candidacy Nonetheless Bush was not Capellas first choice in the CPAC straw poll I chose Florida Sen Marco Rubio as my first pick he said But Jeb Bush was number twoOther conferencegoers voiced concerns about Bushs family name and the difficulties it could give the candidate in the general election Bush recently declared himself my own man in an attempt to distance himself from his brothers legacy of costly wars and economic catastrophe But questions remain as to whether he can withstand direct attacks from his fellow Republicans once the campaign is truly underwayI see a strong candidate but I just wonder what his strategy is going to be said Austin von Henner a student at Southern Adventist University in Tennessee Von Henner said he appreciated that Bush has a firm position on issues like education and immigration policy but acknowledged they could use some finetuning before 2016 For a conservative mind he is allinall a good candidateStill there was a sense that if push comes to shove and Bush is the only option on the table some conservatives could hold their nose and vote the party line like they did for Romney in 2012
