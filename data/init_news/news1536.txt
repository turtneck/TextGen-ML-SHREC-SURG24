Back in March some of the financial sectors leading analysts bumped the chances of a global economic recession from 20 percent to 30 percent The chances are still minuscule but the danger always looms And given the tragic consequences of the Great Recession any new indicators leading to another potential recession ought to be met with at the very least a tone of seriousness Today with the Brexit referendum passing in favor of leaving the European Union and the subsequent decline in the British pound and specifically worsening indicators leading toward a British recession theres renewed fears of the Brexit shockfront crushing neighboring economies as wellIn the United States meanwhile the Republican position on Brexit seems to be based upon everything except the economic repercussions Instead the GOPs posture appears to be simply blurting the opposite of whatever President Obama and the Democrats have to say about it Indeed the standard for any GOP argument since 2008 has been simply put Opposite Day If Obamas for it theyre against it  even if Obamas position was once a GOP position the individual mandate NSA metadata collection predator drones immigration reform capandtrade and the list goes on While the GOP never really supported Brexit they should have especially knowing that the EU was one of the USs signature achievements after World War II further assuring there arent continued world wars as the atomic age began Beyond that the possibility of a Brexitinduced recession shouldve frightened them away However were assuming the GOP is driven by rational policy choices in 2016 Its notDonald Trump for his part isnt interested in the justifications for or the postwar history of Europe Hes only really interested in taking a position because as with his party its the opposite of Obamas and Hillarys Had he been less driven to blurt a reaction to a potentially cataclysmic event  an event that he was totally unfamiliar with just a month ago and if he had thought through a strategy that was a slightly more detailed than the 140 character limit on Twitter he wouldve picked up on a golden opportunity to link Hillary and the Obama administration to a forthcoming recession regardless of whether it was precipitated by BrexitThis week while appearing on stage with Elizabeth Warren for the first time Hillary Clinton accurately observed that the Wall Street fallout from Brexit cost Americans around 100 billion all of which vanished when the markets reacted to the Trumpsupported Brexit voteAverage Americans werent the only people impacted by Trumps beloved Brexit vote Around 400 of his fellow billionaires if you believe what he says about his net worth worldwide lost 1962 billion due to the leave vote This is what Trump supports Weird At the very least experts at GoldmanSachs are foreseeing a decline in the US economy from around 225 percent growth to twopercent straight up Britain itself appears to be poised for a recession late this year or in early 2017 Nevertheless Trump missed a fantastic opportunity to sidestep the Brexit vote and therefore to fully blame a wouldbe recession on Hillary Clinton and her allies in the Obama administration Instead if Brexit continues to disrupt the world economy hell absolutely remain onrecord as having supported the spark that touched off the decline Simultaneously and moving forward Hillary can easily marry Trump to Brexit and brand the downturn as the Trump Recession Conversely had Trump kept his selfdefeating mouth shut and perhaps continued to mock disabled people  you know because he has the best words  he couldve solely linked Hillary and Obama to the recession without even mentioning Brexit as an inciting incident But once again Trump stepped into the pitch and for no real political gain took a fastball to the side of his clownwigged noggin Sure Trump is politically astute enough to realize that playing Opposite Day politics plays well with his brainwashed cultlike base Theyre with him no matter what so in the nearterm it shouldnt matter After all another feature of modern GOP strategy is political expedience over longterm gains Trumps got a lock on around 30 percent of American voters but hes clearly underestimating the number of Republicans like George Will Glenn Beck or Sen Mark Kirk RIll who are easily capable of sidestepping a vote for Trump and supporting someone  anyone  else not to mention the scores of moderate undecided voters The question moving forward is whether Trump is capable of making any winnable political choices given how hes vowed to have so much winning you may get tired of winning Instead of positioning himself to immediately link Hillary to a sputtering economy hes linked himself to it Hes in effect dropped the ball on two issue areas that are normally owned by the GOP the economy and national security According to the new ABC News  Washington Post poll Obamas approval on the economy is hovering around 55 percent while Hillary has been seen more favorably than Trump on her reaction to Orlando If Trump cant win on these issues he might as well give up And Im not sure he hasnt
