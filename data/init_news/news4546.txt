Washington CNN Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning admitting he had not seen a video of a 400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in IranThe Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians to embarrass our president because we have a president whos incompetentWhat Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva SwitzerlandTrump admitted his error in an earlymorning tweet Friday without actually saying he was wrongThe plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying 400 million in cash going to Iran he tweetedThe plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying 400 million in cash going to IranIt was a rare reversal for Trump who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously  insisting hed seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11 2001 attacks His political rise began during the 2012 campaign when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate questioning the Presidents American citizenshipDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim saying he seems confused on CBS This Morning in an interview taped before Trump backtrackedI have no idea what hes talking about It the video doesnt exist He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this Kaine saidHe pointed to Trumps recent criticism of Kaine who Trump said in a lateJuly news conference did a terrible job in New Jersey  despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia not New Jersey Kaine said Trump must have confused him with Tom Kean who was New Jerseys governor until 1990He was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago Maybe thats what hes doing with this bogus video claim Kaine saidAsked if he thinks Trump is confused Kaine said I absolutely think hes confusedPaul Manafort Trumps campaign chairman responded to Kaine on Fox News Friday morning saying hes not sure there was confusion on Trumps partThe point that he was making is the cashtransfer took place and it was taking place consistent with the transfer of hostages Manafort saidAgain what the Obama administration wants to do is get off of the point The point is 400 million in cash that most likely ended up in terrorist camps used against the west was given in exchange for hostages and the President of the United States lied to the American people thats the pointTrump has made criticism of the US delivery of 400 million in cash via a plane to Iran  the first installment of 17 billion in payments related to a decadesold dispute over an unfulfilled us arms purchase before the Iranian revolution cut relations between the two countries and settled at the same time Iran released four American prisoners  a staple this week on the campaign trailBut Wednesday in Florida and Thursday in Maine he went a step further claiming hed seen video of the cash actually being delivered in IranIt was interesting because a tape was made Right You saw that With the airplane coming in  nice plane  and the airplane coming in and the money coming off I guess Right That was given to us has to be by the Iranians Trump said in Portland MaineAnd you know why the tape was given to us Because they want to embarrass our country They want to embarrass our country And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president whos incompetent They want to embarrass our president Trump said I mean who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape Its only for one reason And its very very sad
