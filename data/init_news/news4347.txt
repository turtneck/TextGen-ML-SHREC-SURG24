MOSCOW  Russias capital city was reeling Saturday after the shooting death of prominent opposition leader Boris Nemtsov just steps from the KremlinIts the end of an epoch an abyss said Artyom Faizulin a member of the opposition Progress Party standing near the spot where Nemtsov was gunned down on Moscows Moskvoretsky Bridge close to the Kremlin towersThe site where Nemtsovs body lay under a plastic sheet for almost two hours is now covered with flowers and candles brought by supporters in the freezing drizzleIts the start of a new more somber picture of our history and we will see more political killings Faizulin saidNemtsov 55 a former first deputy prime minister was shot and killed shortly before midnight Friday by an unknown gunman who jumped from a white car fired around seven shots then sped offNemtsov an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to appear at an opposition march scheduled Sunday against Russias involvement in Ukraine where a separatist conflict between proRussian rebels and Ukrainian forces has left more than 5000 dead since April Organizers canceled the march instead planning a gathering Sunday to mourn himMoscow which annexed Ukraines Crimea in March has denied allegations that it is arming separatist rebels and sending troops to Ukraines east Nemtsov had been working on a report proving Russias involvement in the conflictRussian authorities reacted swiftly to the killing of Nemtsov a leader of the liberal Parnas party who was once viewed as a potential handpicked successor to thenpresident Boris Yeltsin in 1999Putin condemned the shooting and took the investigation into the killing under his personal control Saturday morning His press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the incident a provocationBy Saturday afternoon the Investigative Committee said in a statement that it was considering several motives for the crime including murder as a provocation to destabilize the political situation in the countryTwo other hypotheses being considered by the Investigative Committee link the fatal shooting to Islamist extremists and to UkraineSome found it hard to believe the perpetrators are not connected to the government because the crime was committed so close to the KremlinThis is a sacred place for Russian history said Valery Kachayev an artist who was paying respects Saturday at the bridge where Nemtsov died Nothing like this has happened in Russias recent history Its like the state secretary being assassinated on the White House lawnColleagues were also skeptical about the official investigationIm certain that sooner or later the people who killed him will be found but I strongly doubt this will happen while the current regime is in power said Ilya Yashin one of the leaders of the Parnas Party While the investigation is being carried out under the current authorities who considered Nemtsov a personal enemy there is little hopeThe incident took place against a backdrop of unprecedented propaganda on Russian state television and social networks in wake of the Ukraine crisis in which political critics are often termed national traitors and fifth columnistsPutins popularity has skyrocketed following Russias annexation of Crimea despite the toll on the countrys economy A February poll by the Levada Center placed his approval rating at 86 one point higher than in JanuaryNemtsov had received anonymous threats in the past several weeks Yashin said His death is a result of what is happening in the country That hatred that has been stoked by the government in recent months in many ways led to such a highprofile political murder being committed Yashin saidMany of Nemtsovs supporters who gathered on Moskvoretsky Bridge on Saturday blamed the assassination of the outspoken politician on the Kremlin saying they feared the climate of fear in the country would get worseIts a move towards a new level of repression Kachayev said The regime has turned to political killingsOthers recalled the 1934 assassination of popular communist leader Sergei Kirov which served as a pretext for the start of Soviet leader Joseph Stalins repressions against his former colleagues Some historians believe Kirovs murder was the result of a Kremlin attempt to remove a rivalIndependent political expert Alexei Makarkin said he believes the killing was a complete surprise for the Kremlin but added it could seriously undermine future dialogue between Russia and the West already hampered by the Ukraine crisisThe crime itself he said may have been a provocation by radical elements galvanized by Russias support of proRussian rebels in UkraineThere is a party of war which wants to cut off all contact with the West said Makarkin who is vice president of the Moscowbased Center for Political Technologies For them Nemtsov is an agent of Ukraine of the enemy which the authorities have not arrested for some reasonRelations between Russia and the rest of the world will very much will depend on how the government investigates a crime committed so close to the Kremlin he added
