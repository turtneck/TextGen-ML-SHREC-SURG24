attacks in the Belgian capitalMy purpose here today is to assert in my judgment ISIS is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis Christians and Shiite Muslims he said during a news conference at the State DepartmentKerry said that in 2014 ISIS trapped Yazidis killed them enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls  selling them at auction raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations executed Christians solely for their faith and also forced Christian women and girls into slaveryWithout our intervention it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered he saidThis is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq genocide a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror groupThe move aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration appears to have workedThe measure was nonbinding but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 3930 to back a sense of Congress saying the crimes committed against Christians Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and in some cases genocideRepublican Rep Jeff Fortenberry whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the US authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep Anna EshooDuring debate on Monday Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of RepresentativesUnder a deadline set by Congress the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designationKerry though had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS also know as ISIL were genocideISILs campaign of terror against the innocent including the Yazidi and Christian minorities and its grotesque targeted acts of violence show all the warning signs of genocide Kerry said in August 2014 For anyone who needed a wakeup call this is itFortenberry praised the State Department for its decision ThursdayI commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation The genocide against Christians Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities  it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself he said The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authorityThat it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion in the face of unspeakable human suffering defies explanation Rubio who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate said in a statement At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation if the designation did not then yield some sort of actionI am very happy to hear that the US will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities he told CNN in an email This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups specially ISIS And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again because we were left in the hands of Islamic StateHe called on the State Department to push the UN to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and SyriaFurthermore he said it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that these crimes will not happen againAn international center advocating against hate terrorism and antiSemitism was one to join the chorusThe Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerrys acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide the organization said in a statement We reiterate our call that the US put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISISIn Defense of Christians a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide put out a statement from its president Toufic BaakliniIDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians Yazidis Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide Baaklini saidAnd the Archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl put out a statement of appreciationFor some time the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East For the US government to call this savagery by its proper name  genocide  is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land Wuerl said These words must now be translated into action
