On the front lines of the battle against the Islamic State suspicion of the United States runs deep Iraqi fighters say they have all seen the videos purportedly showing US helicopters airdropping weapons to the militants and many claim they have friends and relatives who have witnessed similar instances of collusionOrdinary people also have seen the videos heard the stories and reached the same conclusion  one that might seem absurd to Americans but is widely believed among Iraqis  that the United States is supporting the Islamic State for a variety of pernicious reasons that have to do with asserting US control over Iraq the wider Middle East and perhaps its oilIt is not in doubt said Mustafa Saadi who says his friend saw US helicopters delivering bottled water to Islamic State positions He is a commander in one of the Shiite militias that last month helped push the militants out of the oil refinery near Baiji in northern Iraq alongside the Iraqi armyThe Islamic State is almost finished he said They are weak If only America would stop supporting them we could defeat them in daysInside the surreal world of the Islamic States propaganda machineUS military officials say the charges are too farfetched to merit a response Its beyond ridiculous said Col Steve Warren the militarys Baghdadbased spokesman Theres clearly no one in the West who buys it but unfortunately this is something that a segment of the Iraqi population believesThe perception among Iraqis that the United States is somehow in cahoots with the militants it claims to be fighting appears however to be widespread across the countrys SunniShiite sectarian divide and it speaks to more than just the troubling legacy of mistrust that has clouded the United States relationship with Iraq since the 2003 invasion and the subsequent withdrawal eight years laterAt a time when attacks by the Islamic State in Paris and elsewhere have intensified calls for tougher action on the ground such is the level of suspicion with which the United States is viewed in Iraq that it is unclear whether the Obama administration would be able to significantly escalate its involvement even if it wanted toWhat influence can we have if they think we are supporting the terrorists asked Kirk Sowell an analyst based in neighboring Jordan who publishes the newsletter Inside Iraqi PoliticsIn one example of how little leverage the United States now has Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar alAbadi pushed back swiftly against an announcement Tuesday by Defense Secretary AshtonB Carter that an expeditionary force of US troops will be dispatched to Iraq to conduct raids free hostages and capture Islamic State leadersIs it too late to solve the mess in the Middle EastIraqs semiautonomous region of Kurdistan where support for the United States remains strong has said it would welcome more troops But Abadi indicated they would not be neededThere is no need for foreign ground combat troops he said in a statement Any such support and special operations anywhere in Iraq can only be deployed subject to the approval of the Iraqi Government and in coordination with the Iraqi forces and with full respect to Iraqi sovereigntyThe allegations of US collusion with the Islamic State are aired regularly in parliament by Shiite politicians and promoted in postings on social media They are persistent enough to suggest a deliberate campaign on the part of Irans allies in Iraq to erode American influence US officials sayIn one typical recent video that appeared on the Facebook page of a Shiite militia a lawmaker with the countrys biggest militia group the Badr Organization waves apparently new US military MREs meals ready to eat  one of them chicken and dumplings  allegedly found at a recently captured Islamic State base in Baiji offering proof he said of US supportThe Iranians and the Iranianbacked Shiite militias are really pushing this line of propaganda that the United States is supporting ISIL Warren said Its part of the Iranian propaganda machineThe perception plays into a widening rift within Iraqs ruling Shiite elite over whether to pivot more toward Iran or the United States Those pushing the allegations want to create a narrative that Iran is our ally and the United States is our enemy and this undermines Abadi who is Americas ally Sowell saidPolice call him an ISIS recruiter He says hes just an outspoken preacherIraqi government officials say they dont believe the charges and point out that Abadi regularly pushes back against them But Abadis own position has weakened in recent months He is battling for his political survival against a variety of Shiite militia leaders whose power has been bolstered by the increasingly dominant role played on the battlefield by the militias collectively known as Hashd alShaabi or popular mobilization unitsIraqi officials complain that their task is hampered by what is universally perceived as the lackluster US response to the threat posed by the Islamic StateWe dont believe the Americans support Daesh said Naseer Nouri spokesman for the Ministry of Defense using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State But it is true that most people are saying they do and they are right to believe that the Americans should be doing much more than they are Its because America is so slow that most people believe they are supporting DaeshUS warplanes routinely fail to respond to requests for air support because of US rules of engagement that preclude strikes if there is a risk civilians may be hit he said According to Warren that standard frequently is not met The United States has conducted more than 3768 strikes in Iraq as of Nov19 according to the US military and the tempo of strikes has increased lately US officials sayBut it also appears that the fighters are unaware when they do receive US air support The US military reported neardaily strikes in support of the offensive to recapture Baiji last month and continues to respond regularly to requests for strikes in the vicinity Warren saidIn the fight against the Islamic State Iraqs leader begins to look shakyThe fighters there insist there have been no strikes by the Americans at all Wed be better off without them said 1st Lt Murtada Fadl who is serving with the Iraqi elite forces in Baiji He said that the only air support had come from the Iraqi air force and that he wishes the government would ask the Russians to replace the AmericansIn a part of the world where outcomes are often confused with intentions and regional complexities enable conspiracy theories to thrive the notion that the United States is colluding with the Islamic State holds a certain logic according to Mustafa Alani director of the Dubaibased Gulf Research Center Most Arabs are too in awe of American might to believe that the United States is deliberately adopting a minimalist approach he saidThe reason is that the Americans arent doing the job people expect them to do he said Mosul was lost and the Americans did nothing Syria was lost and the Americans did nothing Paris is attacked and the Americans arent doing much So people believe this is a deliberate policy They cant believe the American leadership fails to understand the developments in the region and so the only other explanation is that this is part of a conspiracyOn the streets of Baghdad most Iraqis see no other explanationThe image of the US was damaged in the region so they created Daesh in order to fight them and restore their image said Mohammed Abdul Khaleq a journalist for a local TV station who was drinking coffee in a cafe favored by writers most of whom said they agreedA rare dissenting voice was offered by Hassan AbdulWahab 23 selling luggage in a nearby shop It is true that most people believe that he said But its not based on reason Its based on racism  because Iraqis dont like Americans in the first placeDid these tweets encourage a Chicago teen to try joining the Islamic
