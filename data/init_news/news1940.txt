For most of the past two years it looked like Bashar alAssads campaign to hold on in Syria was working Syrias weak uncoordinated and increasingly Islamist rebels were being gradually pushed back And while ISIS had seized vast parts of the country it and Assad appeared to tolerate one another in a sort of tacit nonaggression pact designed to crush the Syrian rebels It seemed that Syria and the world would be stuck with Assads murderous dictatorship for the foreseeable futureBut in the past few weeks things appear to have changed  potentially dramatically The rebels have won a string of significant victories in the countrys north Assads troop reserves are wearing thin and its becoming harder for him to replace his lossesA rebel victory to be clear is far from imminent or even likely At this point its too early to say for sure what this means for the course of the Syrian war But the rebels have found a new momentum against Assad just as his military strength could be weakening which could be a significant change in the trajectory of a war that has been ongoing for yearsBashar alAssads forces are losing ground against the rebels for example in northern Idlib province where two recent rebel victories show how strong the rebels have gotten First in late March Assads forces were pushed out of Idlib City the regions capital Second in late April rebels took Jisr alShughour a strategically valuable town that lies on the Assad regimes supply line in the area and near its important coastal holdingsJisr alShughour is a good example of how the regime is indeed losing ground Noah Bonsey a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group told me Most observers were surprised at how quickly it fell given that it is a town of some strategic importanceWhile rebels most dramatic victories are in Idlib theyre advancing elsewhere as well Theyve seized towns in the south and have repelled Assad offensives around the countryLosses in Idlib and the southern governorate of Deraa have placed great pressure on AssadCharles Lister a fellow at the Brookings Doha Center writes Frustration disaffection and even incidences of protest are rising across Assads most ardent areas of support on Syrias coast  some of which are now under direct attackBonsey concurs Rebels have seized momentum in recent weeks and months he says The regime is clearly weakening to an extent that was not widely reflected in the Englishlanguage narrative surrounding the conflictRecent regime defeats reflect growing unity among the rebels as well as fundamental weaknesses on the regimes sideThe Idlib advance in particular was led by Jaish alFatah a new rebel coalition led by several different Islamist groups While the coalition includes Jabhat alNusra alQaedas Syrian franchise the jihadis dont appear to dominate the groupThe operations also displayed a far improved level of coordination between rival factions Lister writes spanning from USbacked Free Syrian Army FSA brigades to moderate and conservative Syrian Islamists to al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat alNusra and several independent jihadist factionsRebel coordination is nothing new in Syria But this coalition stands out for its size and breadthThe number of fighters mobilized for the initial Idlib city campaign has been significant and thats been just as true in subsequent operations in the north Bonsey says The level of coordination weve seen over several weeks on multiple fronts is something that we have rarely if ever seen from rebels in the northAnd as the rebels have gotten more united the regime has gotten weaker The basic problem is attrition Assad is losing a lot of soldiers in this war and his regime  a sectarian Shia government in an overwhelmingly Sunni country  cant train replacements quickly enoughBonsey calls this an unsolvable manpower problem As a result he says Assad is becoming increasingly dependent on his foreign allies  Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah specifically  to lead the ground campaignBut Iran has shown limited willingness to commit heavily to areas like Idlib and rather is concentrating principally on defending the regimes core holdings around Damascus and the coast According to Bonsey its a matter of priorities which is to say that their resources arent unlimited and theyve so far preferred to concentrate them in the most critical areasIrans involvement in conflicts in Iraq and Yemen on top of Syria has left it really overstretched according to Daveed GartensteinRoss a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies The cumulative resource investment has certainly had an impact on Assad losing territory in Syria he concludesFor the regime the status quo militarily is not sustainable Bonsey says and Irans strategy in Syria does not appear sustainable The costs to Iran of propping up Assads rule in Syria are only going to rise with time substantially And whats happened with Idlib in recent weeks is only the latest indication of thatBonsey like most Syria experts does not believe Assad is on the road to inevitable defeatWhile much of the subsequent commentary to the Idlib offensive proclaimed this as the beginning of the end for President Bashar alAssads regime we are still a long way from that Lister writesFor one thing Iran sees the survival of the Assad regime as a critical strategic priority as it allows Iran to supply Hezbollah and maintain a close ally in the Levant Any postAssad government is likely to be Sunnidominatedand quite hostile to Iran Tehran is probably willing to go to some lengths to keep that from happening and Iranian intervention in the war has been a significant forceIn strict military terms there isnt yet a direct threat on the strategically essential territory that the regime and its backers continue to control Bonsey says and there isnt yet a reason to think the rebels are capable of threatening such a regionSince Assad cant crush the rebels in their strongholds then the conflict is looking a lot like a stalemate  which it already was before this rebel offensive beganMoreover the unity of this new rebel coalition could collapse The broad alliance weve seen in Idlib is held together by victory the more they push back Assad the more willing they are to cooperate But if Assads forces start beating them the ideological and political fault lines in the coalition could cause rebel groups to turn on one another Its happened  many times  beforeThe big question now according to Bonsey is how the regime and its backers choose to respond to these defeats A major decider in other words is Iran But as long as they see protecting the Assad regime as vital they are likely to do what it takes to keep his core territory intact
