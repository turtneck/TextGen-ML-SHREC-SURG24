This is horrifying news especially on the heels of theCharlie Hebdo shooting in ParisThis tweet fromInna Shevchenko an activist with the feminist group Femen who was speaking at the event is especially chillingShevchenkos tweet literalizes the broader threat posed by attacks on people whose only crime is speaking their mind When terrorists attack people for drawing Muhammed the intent isnt just to kill these people its to create a deterrent to anyone who might in the future use their speech rights in a way that radical Islamists dont like Writer Timothy Garton Ash calls this the assassins veto the idea that killers can use fear to put limits on free speechNothing makes that threat feel more real than gunfire literally interrupting an address meant to defend free speech
