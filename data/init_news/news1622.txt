Comments Mark Cuban has been vocally outspoken about the 2016 election after learning the dark truth about Republican nominee Donald Trump Initially Cuban actually supported Trumps candidacy as someone independent from politics as usual but as he and we all learned more about the dark past of The Donalds dirty dealings  sexual predations and more the Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner threw himself wholeheartedly into the political arena culminating with front row seats to the last presidential debate Cuban sat down with local radio broadcasters to discuss rumors that his antiTrump stance might cost him ticket sales for his NBA franchise Mark Cuban probably literally dropped the mic after this response You know what when its all said and done Id rather lose every penny than have Trump as president because I care more about the future of my family my children than I do about my pocketbook And so if it means we play to empty arenas Im down with that Maybe I pick up some fans Maybe I lose some fans I dont know Ive heard it from both Ive had people say theres no way I can support you I cant go to another Mavs game And Ive had people say you know what Were buying Mavs tickets What Ive heard more often than anything is are you gonna be this way once the elections over And the answer is no Youve known me forever Newy and Ive been apolitical my entire adult life and only because I know Donald and I know my feelings about what he would be like as president have I gotten this involved but come November 9 its all Mavs all the time Mark Cuban is a shining example of how any American should approach the political arena which he does by placing integrity over ideology and the good of the country in his viewpoints above the simple view of his bank accounts short term health Luckily Cuban is a franchisee in the NBA which is far and away Americas most progressive major sports league which doesnt guarantee ongoing success but does mean that the typical NBA fan values tolerance and diversity over racial segregation and hatred
