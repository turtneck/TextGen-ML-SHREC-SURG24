4 Fascinating Things Quantum Physics Does In Nature By Michael Danielson on November 9 2015 Subscribe Quantum Physics is a subject that is often discarded by everyday people as too esoteric or too newagey depending on which kind of QM you read about to be useful in everyday life We have all been introduced to QM as the science of stuff too small to really matter to everyday life But recent developments in biological science have revealed that life itself puts powerful quantum mechanical principles to use as an everyday part of its function Quantum Biology is one of the forefronts of modern science Quantum Physics in Bird Navigation Weve known for decades that many species of birds migrate each year most famously from north to south as the temperature drops in the temperate zones But how they navigate during those migrations has always been a mystery The magnetic field the Earth produces is terribly weak compared to the other forces that act on an animals body Furthermore biologists knew from studies that birds compasses are lightdependent and that they detect magnetic fields relative to the surface of the planet not the poles It wasnt until the rule of quantum entanglement developed that we began to develop a theory of how bird compasses worked Without delving too far into the science the theory is that birds eyes contain a protein that itself contains millions of entangled electrons When light enters the birds eye it knocks some of those entangled electrons loose but leaves others attached to the protein molecules The loose electrons are much more dramatically affected by the Earths magnetic field than the bound ones are but the entanglement means the bound electrons move the same way The subsequent wiggling of the protein that the bound electrons are attached to can be perceived by the birds retina and translated by its brain into a picture of the magnetic field its flying through Quantum Physics in Photosynthesis Plants it seems use quantum mechanics for one of the most important aspects of life on Earth turning sunlight into the power that life runs on The biggest mystery of photosynthesis for as long as weve understood it is how is photosynthesis so efficient Our best machines achieve efficiencies of upwards of 30  photosynthetic transfer of energy is upwards of 99 efficient There are so many directions a photon could travel once it gets captured by a molecule of chlorophyll that science had no idea how such a high proportion of photons made it to the reaction center where they were used in building new molecules The answer turns out to be quantum coherence  the ability of a quantum particle to act like a wave until something decoheres it The theory is that photons enter plant cells are captured by chlorophyll and rather than traveling in a particlelike manner they travel as waves  and the reaction center has the ability to decohere those waves back into particle photon form Quantum Physics In Your Digestion Enzymes are catalysts  chemicals that trigger other chemical creations But for decades scientists have been unable to determine how enzymes can speed up reactions so much up to a trillion times faster than they would naturally occur Recent research has shown that enzymes may be a trigger of quantum coherence  as above  using the wave side of the waveparticle quality to cause electrons and even protons to simply teleport from one atom to another bypassing the need for time heat and all of the other factors that enable or speed up classical chemical reactions Quantum Physics In Your Sense of Self Finally worthy of a mention in passing is the theory being debated right now by many scientists that quantum mechanics are fundamental to our consciousness  For centuries humans have proposed second processing systems in the brain or body that run parallel to our normal neuron firings and that these overlapping systems are what give rise to our ability to mentally separate ourselves from our circumstances  what we call being conscious Recent evidence has come up that the cytokine in the brain  what we used to think of as the brains skeleton holding it all together  is in fact a massive quantum processor Laced with what the scientists call microtubules that vibrate at incredible speeds the cytokine system appears to be operating on the quantum level as a trinary computer  able to hold values of onoff and the quantum superposition of being both on and off at the same time What exactly this would enable our secondary processing system to accomplish is currently being explored  but the results if we find them are bound to change a lot of our fundamental assumptions about what we as human beings are capable of Featured image courtesy of Cristbal Alvarado Minic

to be married to and a livein research dissistant who also happens to be his 7yearold son Hes politically oriented in the same direction that a vial of Bernie Sanders tears blessed by Pope Francis in a civil ceremony attended by Noam Chomsky and the entire administrative body of Planned Parenthood then sprinkled over the ghost of FDR by the light of the final episode of Phineas and Ferb playing on a projection TV powered entirely by kombucha and seitan would be oriented He is not afraid of complex runon sentences as long as they get the point across preferably with a little bit of poetry in
