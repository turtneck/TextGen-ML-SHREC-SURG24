Washington CNN The Supreme Court appeared closely divided along ideological lines during oral arguments Monday in a case that could determine President Barack Obamas legacy on immigrationConservative justices questioned Obamas authority to use executive actions to shield some 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito seemed particularly concerned with language in the administrations guidance that said the programs recipients would be lawfully present which they suggested would contradict immigration lawHow is it possible to lawfully work in the United States without lawfully being in the United States Alito askedRoberts added I mean theyre lawfully present and yet theyre present in violation of the lawLiberals on the bench seemed sympathetic to the administrations arguments Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted at one point that there are 113 million undocumented aliens in the country and Congress has provided funds for removing about 4 million So inevitably priorities have to be set she saidJustice Sonia Sotomayor said there are not enough resources to deport everyone They are here whether we want them or not she saidObama announced the moves to great fanfare in late 2014 as a response to congressional inaction on immigration reform But a federal court blocked them after Texas and 25 other states suedBusloads of immigrants rights activists  some of them undocumented  appeared on the courts plaza to support the policies The moves are meant to shield them from deportation and allow them work permitsNancy Garcia a US citizen from Milwaukee who was protesting with the Wisconsin group Voces de la Frontera Voices from the Border said she became active on the issue after Wisconsin lawmakers tried to crack down on undocumented immigrantsWere not drug lords Were not rapists Were good people Garcia saidTea Party Patriots member Gregg Cummings said he arrived at 6 am to find a spot in front of the court to protest the executive actions Cummings from Lamoni Iowa said he is concerned about the prospect of Obamas Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland changing the ideological balance of the courtOur number one purpose of being here is supporting the senators better standing strong on no votes on the new Supreme Court justice he saidCritics of Obamas moves say they are part of a pattern of the White House looking to go around the Republican CongressBasically the President has stepped in and taken over what normally would be associated with Congress Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in an interview Congress makes the lawsRoberts also seemed concerned with the scope of the governments argument defending Obamas moves Under your argument could the President grant deferred removal to every unlawful  unlawfully present alien in the United States right now he asked Solicitor General Donald VerrilliAt one point Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested that the president might have strayed into Congress territory Its as if  that the President is setting the policy and Congress is executing it he said Thats just upside downThe GOP Congress was involved at oral arguments as well The House of Representatives in an unusual move intervened in the case against the administration and had 15 minutes before the eight justicesThat only eight justices are hearing the case  due to the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia  could impact the final result A split court between the four Democraticappointed justices and four GOPappointed justices would mean the programs remain blocked and the case is sent back to the district court in Texas that blocked them in the first placeFor the administration a key argument before the court is to say that the states do not have the legal right to bring the case in the first place If it can convince a majority of justices on that issue the court may not even get to the merits of the immigration debateAll eyes were on Roberts who has in past cases sometimes limited who can bring challenges to court On Monday he asked some critical questions of the governments position but it was unclear how interested he might be in dismissing the case on standingThe question is Does Texas have the right to bring this case said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin Texas says if you give legal status to these people then well have to give them drivers licenses The federal government says theres nothing in this law about drivers licenses This law is directed entirely at the immigrants themselves it does not impose any obligations on the states So the states should not have the right to challenge it Thats the standing argument I think the Obama administration thinks they have a better chance at winning over one of the conservatives on standing than they do on the merits of the caseElizabeth Wydra President of the Constitutional Accountability Center who filed a brief in support of the government says she wouldnt write off the chief justice on the merits of the case or on the issue of standingOn the merits Chief Justice Roberts concerns seemed to be alleviated when the Solicitor General clarified that undocumented immigrantsgiven relief under the programs  are simply afforded deferred action but none the less are subject to removal proceedings at any time the executive changes its enforcement priorities she saidShould it win on that count the injunction would be lifted and the programs would be able to go into effect during the final months of the Obama presidencyHowever because the actions can be changed or reversed by the next President immigrants would have to decide whether to come forward for the remaining months of the Obama administration or risk doing so with the possibility of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz in the White HouseTheres no question that the ultimate fate of the deferred action policy hangs in the balance of the upcoming election said Stephen I Vladeck a professor of law at American University and CNN Legal AnalystLike any other executive order it can be modified rescinded or expanded by the next President and codified or overruled by the next Congress Vladeck added But the fact that the Supreme Court expedited its consideration of the Obama administrations appeal so that it could resolve the dispute by June suggests that even shorthanded the justices want to have their own say firstThe White House announced the programs in November 2014 issuing a fivepage guidance memo enabling qualifying undocumented workers to receive temporary relief from the threat of deportation and to apply for programs that could qualify them for work authorization and associated benefitsThe Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents DAPA targets the nearly 43 million undocumented parents of citizens and lawful residents and the second rule expands Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA initiative aimed at non citizens who came to the country as childrenWell bring more undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so they can play by the rules pay their full share of taxes pass a criminal background check and get right with the law Obama told an audience in Nevada after the programs were announcedThe programs remain frozen nationwide They were first blocked by a federal judge in Texas and a divided federal appeals court later upheld the preliminary injunctionObamas lawyers argue in court papers that the lower court rulings threatened great harm not only to the proper role of federal courts and to federal immigration law but also to millions of parents of US citizens and permanent residents aliens who are the lowest priorities for removal yet now work off the books to support their familiesAs a threshold issue Verrilli says that the states dont have the legal right to be in court because the Constitution assigns the formation of immigration policy exclusively to the National Government precisely because immigration is an inherently national matterHe stressed that the guidance from the government does not provide any kind of lawful status under immigration law as the aliens remain removable at any timeImmigrant communities fought for these programs said Marielena Hincapi the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center She says that her groups have been informing people about the risks of the rules being changed by the next president and she believes many will come forward should the Obama administration winTexas Solicitor General Scott Keller argues that the states have standing to bring the challenge in part because DAPA would create a new class of recipients for state subsidized drivers licenses in Texas He says that Texas would stand to lose millions of dollars if even a small fraction of DAPA eligible aliens appliedDAPA is an extraordinary assertion of executive power Keller wrote in court papers The Executive has unilaterally crafted an enormous program  one of the largest changes ever to our Nations approach to immigration he said In doing so the Executive dispensed with immigration statutes by declaring unlawful conduct to be lawfulHe points to the guidance and says that the eligible undocumented immigrations would be permitted to be lawfully present in the United States which would make them eligible for work authorization and some types of Social Security and Medicare benefitsTexas is supported by the GOPled House of Representatives who say that the programs went forward after the President failed in his attempts to persuade Congress to revise immigration lawsErin E Murphy a lawyer for the House called the administrations position the most aggressive of executive power claimsAndrew Pincus a lawyer who supports the administrations position says that allowing Texas to bring the case would have broad implicationsIf a state can sue every time the federal government does something to increase the states costs states could sue to challenge almost anything the federal government does he saidPincus points out that Texas is not objecting to the administrations use of prosecutorial discretion it just doesnt want the undocumented workers to be able to work legallyYou are saying to these people you can stay here but we are keeping you in a bubble he said
