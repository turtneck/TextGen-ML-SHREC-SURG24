Two months from Election Day Hillary Clinton has a clear edge over Donald Trump in nearly every measure traditionally used to gauge success in presidential racesShes raising huge sums of money and flooding airwaves with television advertisements A sophisticated data team with a history of winning White House contests is meticulously tracking voters in key battleground states Clinton also has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win in November  so many that she could lose Ohio and Florida and still become Americas first female presidentBut Trumps campaign believes there are pockets of voters eager to be persuaded not to back Clinton While Trump squandered a summers worth of opportunities to court those voters his campaign heads into the fall suddenly confident in its ability to make up lost groundTrump aides were gleeful Friday over the release of FBI notes regarding Clintons controversial email practices while secretary of state His campaign plans to come out of the Labor Day weekend wielding the report as a warning about the Democrats judgmentGetting Trump to make that kind of consistent case against Clinton has been a herculean task for much of the campaign But advisers say hes more receptive to his new leadership teams more scripted approach mostly because its coincided with a tightening in the public polls he monitors obsessivelyTheres a renewed focus on Hillary Clinton and her problems which I think has been beneficial said Matt Borges the chairman of Ohios Republican Party Hes got to sustain this for another couple weeksStill Trump aides acknowledge that the brash businessman needs to more to address his own shaky standing with votersTrumps campaign has spent no general election money on positive biographical ads despite having plenty of cash to do so Efforts to highlight a warmer side of the New York real estate developer at the GOP convention were quickly overshadowed by flaps of his own making Hes also angered anew Hispanics voters a fastgrowing segment of the electorate that Republicans are desperate to draw from by holding fast to his tough immigration policiesHes running up against a population trend and a demographic reality said Steve Schale a Floridabased Democratic strategistIf Trump can reshape the race hell need to do so quickly Early voting begins in some states this month North Carolinians can start submitting absentee ballots Friday In Ohio  a state no Republican has won the White House without  people can start voting on Oct 12 a week before the last of three presidential debatesBoth campaigns expect enormous audiences for the debates Clinton who has been in intensive study sessions with her debate team in recent days is sure to face higher expectations from voters Trumps political inexperience leaves him with a lower bar to clearPrivately Republican leaders say it will take more than strong debates for their nominee to alter a race that appears to be leaning in Clintons favor While Trump publicly maintains support from numerous highranking GOP officials a striking number of discussions among Republicans in Washington often begin with an assumption that Clinton will be president come JanuaryTrump advisers vigorously dispute that the race has slipped from their grasp They contend most Americans are just now tuning into the presidential campaign in a serious wayWere very much on schedule to do what we need to do to turn out the vote for Mr Trump said Bob Paduchik Trumps Ohio state director and one of the most experienced operatives on the Republicans staff Paduchik said Trumps efforts heading into the fall are focused primarily on rallying disaffected Democrats and independentsClintons campaign has long argued that Trump is overestimating the number of voters willing to switch from voting Democratic in presidential election to Republican But Clinton aides are monitoring movement toward a pair of third party candidates Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Partys Jill SteinTheres no question youve got two candidates who are both underwater on their favorables right now Joel Benenson Clintons chief strategist and pollster said by way of explaining the appeal of Johnson and Stein I think its important as this gets closer that people understand the stakes and the importance of their voteClinton and running mate Tim Kaine will have an allstar stable of Democrats making that case on their behalf through the fallPresident Barack Obama is expected to spend much of October campaigning for Clinton focusing in particular on increasing turnout among young people blacks and collegeeducated whites Vice President Joe Biden will camp out in working class areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders Clintons vanquished primary rival will be rallying the young voters and liberals who backed his campaignTrump will be largely on his own with the exception of running mate Mike Pence and a few loyal supporters such as New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani In the battle for control of the Senate most Republicans in competitive races have stayed away from TrumpDemocrats now see a clear path to taking back control of the Senate with party leaders identifying Illinois Indiana Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as favorable opportunities to pick up seats Democrats are also confident that if Clinton wins in some of the most contested state such as New Hampshire North Carolina and Nevada shell bring along the partys Senate candidatesThere are bright spots for Republicans in the Senate contests Sen Rob Portman of Ohio is running a campaign that mirrors Clintons more than Trumps  disciplined wellfunded and heavily centered on data  and appears on track to hold his seat even if Clinton carries the state in the presidential race
