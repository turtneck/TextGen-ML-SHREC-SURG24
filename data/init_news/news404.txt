Editors note The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on The Hillcom For more clickhereIm not one to gossip butThere is a flood of early talk in political circles about who will get the vice presidential nods fromDonald TrumpandHillary ClintonThe strategy for picking a running mate this year is wildly different from anything seen beforeThe textbook on picking a VP calls for a heavy focus on adding swingstate support for the top of the ticket The book also advises finding a running mate seen by voters as plausibly able to take over as presidentWell throw out the textbookNo one believes that any running mate is going to tip this years electoral map And no strong silent type fits the bill at a moment when voters want to shake up the systemWhen SenElizabeth WarrenDMass paid a visit to Clinton just days after she claimed the nomination speculation kicked into overdriveAnd phone lines got hot when former Speaker Newt Gingrich RGa and SenJeff SessionsRAla were overheard in a TV green room telling each other that the other one is the best choice to run with TrumpThe dynamics that frame the selection of a VP this year were evident in a Washington PostABC poll released last week It found that nearly 70 percent of Americans have an unfavorable of view of Trump a 10point increase since he entered the race last summer According to the same poll Clinton also reached a new personal high in her unfavorable rating at 55 percentClintons trouble is dwarfed by Trumps trouble He is viewed negatively by 94 percent of blacks 89 percent of Latinos and 77 percent of womenPicking a dazzling candidate as his running mate is one move that has the potential to change the way the world sees himThe last attempt to dazzle and distract with a vicepresidential pick was in 2008 GOP nominee SenJohn McCainRAriz got off to a good start with his surprise pick of littleknown Alaska Governor Sarah Palin She is beautiful high energy and that year she had the potential to attract women disappointed that the Democrats had selected a black man over a woman as their nomineeBut the sparkle wore off quickly when Palin began to look uninformed and inept Questions were raised about McCains judgment Palins family life also became a staple of the gossip columnsPalins selection looked especially bad in contrast with DemocratBarack Obamas pick of SenJoe BidenDDel Biden was experienced and known to be a good guy while his selection took the edge off the risk of putting a firstterm senator in the Oval OfficeThis time Trump and Clinton need running mates combining the qualities of Palin and BidenThe Trump campaign went nuts last month when Ben Carson said that Trumps shortlist included Palin SensMarco RubioFla andTed CruzTexas and two governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio were purportedly also on the listPalins downside is obvious a desperatelooking Christie wont do either And Trump cant afford to extend an offer to Rubio Cruz or Kasich because he cant risk being turned downThat problem is getting worse by the minute as Trump lags farther and farther behind Clinton in the polls Any dazzling vicepresidential pick has to think about his or her own political future What will happen to them if Trump suffers a Barry Goldwaterstyle blowout loss in NovemberGingrich remains a serious contender to be Trumps number two He is a wellknown personality and an ace with a TV soundbite who is also accustomed to dealing with controversy over his personal lifeBut Gingrich sharply criticized Trump for his attacks on New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Federal Judge Gonzalo CurielTrump then did an impromptu poll on possible running mates He asked the audience at a rally in Tampa to pick from Gingrich Sessions or former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Rice got the biggest applause from the crowdRice is a dazzler but the odds that she is willing to sign on are low to nonexistentMeanwhile on the Democratic side Clinton needs a star to bring young energetic supporters of her primary rival Vermont SenBernie Sanders back into the foldThat means Clinton cant bring on a centrist pick Moderate Democrats with close ties to corporate America like SensJoe Manchinof West Virginia orMark Warnerof Virginia or former Sen Evan Bayh of Indiana would anger the liberal base of the partyShe is left to choose among Warren and other leftofcenter Democrats such as SensSherrod BrownOhio andTim KaineVaWarren however has powerful detractors Critics say she lacks foreign policy experience and note that she has never run a city state cabinet agency or businessI think she will not pick somebody that she feels in her heart isnt ready to bePresidentor CommanderinChief former Pennsylvania Governor and DNC Chairman Ed Rendell recently told a Philadelphia radio station I think Elizabeth Warren is a wonderful bright passionate person but with no experience in foreign affairs and not in any way shape or form ready to be commanderinchiefClinton could find dazzle by naming the first Latino vicepresidential candidate But no one doubts she will win Latino voters energized by Trumps insults regardless If she still wants that option then Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro is the leading candidate Labor Secretary Tom Perez and California CongressmanXavier Becerrahave come on strong in the last few weeksWhen all the talk ends Trump has few options His best bet to dazzle is Gingrich Clinton has a wider range led by Kaine Castro and WarrenJuan Williams is a cohost of FNCs The Five where he is
