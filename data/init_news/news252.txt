When Donald Trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower he declared that it would be unlike any of his other venturesTrump University would be a noble endeavor he said with an emphasis on education over profits It was a way for him to give back to share his expertise with the masses to build a legacy as an educatorHe wouldnt even keep all the money  if he happened to make a profit he would turn the funds over to charityIf I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge I think Id be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money Trump said at the inaugural news conference in the spring of 2005The launch of Trump University coincided with two auspicious developments for the real estate mogul Through his thenyearold hit TV show The Apprentice the billionaire was developing an image as Americas savviest boss while the nations booming real estate market was giving hope to many who dreamed of striking it richAds touted Trump University as the next best thing to being Trumps apprentice Trump who every week on TV singled out someone to be fired pledged in a promotional video to handpick instructors Priceless information would help attendees build wealth in the same real estate game that made Trump richIn the end few if any of these statements would prove to be trueTrump University was not a university It was not even a school Rather it was a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country that promised attendees they could get rich quick but were mostly devoted to enriching the people who ran themParticipants were enticed with local newspaper ads featuring images of Trump then encouraged to write checks or charge tens of thousands of dollars on credit cards for multiday learning sessions Participants were considered buyers as one internal document put it According to the companys former president Trump did not personally pick the instructors Many attendees were trained by people with little or no real estate expertise customers and former employees have alleged in lawsuits against the companyI was told to do one thing said James Harris a Trump University instructor whose sessions have been repeatedly cited in the litigation in an interview with The Washington Post And that one thing was    to show up to teach train and motivate people to purchase the Trump University products and services and make sure everybody bought That is itA Trump spokesman said Harriss comments have no merit and accused Harris of looking for media attention to further his own agendaAll told Trump University received about 40million in revenue from more than 5000 participants before it halted operations in 2010 amid lawsuits in New York and California alleging widespread fraud The New York attorney general estimated Trump netted more than 5million during the fiveyears it was active He has since acknowledged that he gave none of the profits to charityThis account is based on a review of hundreds of pages of internal company records that have become public as a result of the lawsuits as well as new interviews with former Trump University employees and customersMany of the companys internal records including several playbooks that advised employees on strategies for pressuring customers were unsealed in court over the past week in response to a request by The PostTrump and his lawyers have vigorously disputed the allegations predicting that they will win in court and reopen the business They point to positive customersatisfaction surveys that have been submitted in the lawsuits and suggest they have been unfairly targeted by trial lawyers and a politically motivated attorney general in New YorkWe continue to believe that people got substantial value and that people were overwhelmingly satisfied said Trumps general counsel Alan Garten We are not going to be stopping what we are doing We are going to continue to zealously defend this case because at the end of the day we know we are not being tried by The Washington Post or by CNN  but in a courtroom by a juryGarten acknowledged that Trump never gave away the profits to charity He said it was always Trumps intention but that the lawyers leading the classaction suits against the company got a hold of this and  whatever profits existed sort of evaporated The unfulfilled promise was first reported last year by Time magazineIn his defense Trump has often cited the many positive reviews by former customers A number of them submitted sworn statements in court explaining their positive experiences at Trump UniversityKissy and Mark Gordon who own a residential development company in Virginia and jointly signed up for the most expensive program in 2008 said in an interview that they still use techniques they learned from the course todayDid we have an expectation that Trump was going to teach us No Kissy Gordon said We have a building background and the economy changed and we were looking for something in the same field to do something with it So we were there to learnGregory Leishman another former customer recalled speaking to his assigned Trump University mentor on the phone weekly and touring potential properties for purchase with him in New Haven Conn They gave me information I didnt have otherwise he said You can probably get all that information from reading books But Trump University was a crash course You pay more you get moreNonetheless the company has emerged as one of the most potent lines of attack against Trumps campaign for presidentIn the Republican primary Sen Marco Rubio Fla cited it as a fake university and sought to use it to help build a case that Trump was a con artistIn recent days Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her campaign have picked up on that themeTrump U is devastating because its a metaphor for his whole campaign promising hardworking Americans a way to get ahead but all based on lies tweeted press secretary Brian FallonTrump also last week invited a torrent of criticism including from legal scholars on the left and right for accusing the judge presiding over the California suits US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of being biased because he is of Mexican descent Trump has said that Curiel is Mexican although the 62yearold was born in Indiana and that because Trump wants to build a wall on the USMexico border the judge cannot properly do his jobThe focus on Trump University also reignited a controversy in Texas over the decision there by the state attorney general not to file a fraud case against the business Newly disclosed documents reported by Texas media show that investigators had probed the company for seven months and recommended a lawsuit The inquiry was shut down when Trump University closed up shop in the stateTrump later gave 35000 to the gubernatorial campaign of thenAttorney General Greg Abbott A spokesman for Abbott now the Republican governor of Texas has said its absurd to suggest a connection between the case and the donation that came several years later and that Trump University was forced out of Texas and consumers were protectedGarten also dismissed any connection between the Texas decision and Trumps donation saying investigators reviewed a few complaints  and decided not to proceedThe Trump University sales pitch began at free seminars such as one hosted at a Holiday Inn just outside of Washington in 2009In downturn aspiring moguls turn to Trump U for wisdomA placard outside the ballroom read Trump think BIG Inside aspiring real estate investors heard the theme song from The Apprentice the OJays classic For the Love of MoneyThen a Trump University instructor took the microphone All right you guys ready to be the next Trump real estate millionaire Yes or No he yelled according to a Post account at the timeThe purpose of these free 90minute introductions was not to turn attendees into millionaires but rather to set the hook for future sales according to employee playbooksThe playbooks directed leaders of the free seminars to conclude introductory events by getting in the sales mindset ready to sell sell sellThreeday courses typically cost 1495 the records show But people who paid to attend them were then urged to sign up for even pricier elite programsA workshop enrollment form distributed to participants laid out the options in categories starting with the Trump Gold Elite program At 34995 it was the most expensive option  providing three days of personal inthefield mentorship as well as special programs on real estate investment wealth preservation and creative financingThe Trump Silver Elite package priced at 19495 offered real estate and finance training The Trump Bronze Elite priced at 9995 offered similar but fewer coursesEmployees distributed profile surveys on the first day of the seminars in which participants would outline their financial goals as well as current assets and liabilities Attendees were told that the information would help them figure out how much they had to invest in real estate according to customer complaintsBut in the evenings after seminars had concluded for the first day staff members were instructed to use the information to rank each participant according to assets they had available to spend on more Trump University programsIf they can afford the gold elite the playbook advised dont allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold eliteA 43page sales playbook offered guidance on using psychological tools to convince students that they needed to sign up for the classes to fulfill their own goals  overcoming their worries that they might not need or be able to afford the classesCustomers dont have needs  they have problems the book advised Problems are like health The more a problem hurts now the more the need for a solution now And the more it hurts the more theyll be prepared to pay for a speedy solutionIn a section devoted to negotiating student resistance sales people were offered sample responses to common objections from potential students If a potential customer said he was concerned about going into debt to pay for the classes staff were advised to needle them I see do you like living paycheck to paycheckIf doubts persisted staffers were advised to invoke the big boss himselfMr Trump wont listen to excuses and neither will we the instructors were told to sayFormer students have said they were instructed to call their credit card companies on the spot and raise their borrowing limit to pay for the programHarris the former instructor recalled one of his typical pitches to urge customers to find money for programs Do you have any equity on your home Do you have a 401k or IRAHarris 47 said he was one of Trump Universitys biggest sellers Garten Trumps lawyer said Harris was one of the most highly rated instructorsInstructors had to sell hard to turn participants at free seminars into paying customersFor the four years Trump University operated more than 80300 people attended the free introductory sessions Those previews were offered 2000 times in nearly 700 locations around the countryBut only around 6000 people paid between 995 and 1995 to attend threeday seminars director of operations Mark Covais said in a 2012 affidavit According to Covais 572 people paid the full 34995 for the toplevel Trump University mentorshipThe entire program was built around Trump  his picture his quotes and the promise of obtaining access to his special formula for prosperityOne ad for the free Trump University seminars that appeared in a Corpus Christi Tex newspaper in 2009 promised attendees that they would Learn from the Master below a picture of TrumpI can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor read a quote on the ad attributed to TrumpThe California classaction lawsuit contains 49 separate instances of Trump University attendees being told their instructor or future mentor was personally chosen by Trump in 2009 aloneDonald Trump personally picked me one instructor told a group at a free seminar in May 2009 according to a transcript of the session filed as part of the New York case He could have picked anybody in this world but he picked me and the reason he picked me is because Ive been very very successful helping average people make a lot of moneyHarris the former instructor told an introductory meeting of potential customers in 2009 that Trumps personal generosity was a core element of the programHe did not have to start this university Harris told the group according to a transcript in the New York case He does not need the money  He does not get a dime of it Does everyone understand this Please say yes He does not need the moneyIn one presentation cited in the New York lawsuit Harris described Trump as instrumental to his own efforts to turn his life around just after high schoolI lived on the streets of New York mostly down in the subways for the first nine months and I did a lot of things to make some money he told a group attending a 2008 event And then I met a gentleman and he took me in and I lived with him for a year and he taught me how to do real estate He is still my mentor today So the reason I am here is because Donald Trump picked meIn an interview Harris said he met Trump once in the early 1990s backstage at an event at the Taj Mahal casino Here is the truth he said When I was at Trump University I had not one interaction with him ever Not oneIn reality the instructors were not close to Trump and many were not experts in real estate according to several exstaffers who have testified in the lawsuitsThe Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke said Jason Nicholas who worked for the company for seven months in 2007 and submitted a statement in the lawsuit In my opinion it was just selling false hopes and liesMichael Sexton who was president of Trump University acknowledged in sworn testimony in the New York case that none of the event instructors were handpicked by Trump Trump told lawyers in California that he would not dispute Sextons statement  nor could he remember a series of instructors including Harris by name or faceTrump also did not review course curriculum Sexton saidHe would never do that Sexton said Mr Trump is not going to go through a 300page you know binder of contentOnly when it came to marketing material was Trump deeply involved reviewing every piece of advertisement Sexton testifiedMr Trump understandably is protective of his brand and very protective of his image and how hes portrayed Sexton said And he wanted to see how his brand and image were portrayed in Trump University marketing materials And he had very good and substantive input as wellGarten the Trump attorney said Trump was engaged as any CEO would be in the operations Outside experts designed the curriculum Garten said but Trump was intimately involved in the process While Trump may not have selected every instructor Garten said he was very much involved in the process and the discussion of what type of instructor was desiredAt the courses students were supposed to learn Trumps secrets of real estate successBut in sworn testimony in New York Sexton could recall only one Trump practice that was incorporated into the courses Invest in foreclosed propertiesThe lesson underscored how Trump University which was formed to teach aspiring business people to profit from the fastexpanding housing market tailored itself after the 2008 economic crash to offer guidance on profiting from the aftermathOne ad placed in the San Antonio ExpressNews in October 2009 promised that seminars would allow participants to learn from Donald Trumps handpicked experts how you can profit from the largest real estate liquidation in historyAt a seminar called Fast Track to Foreclosure students were instructed to find OPM other peoples money to buy homes out of foreclosure at depressed prices dress them up with new paint and attractive landscaping  then flip them for profitAttendees were advised to use credit cards to invest in real estate and they were told how to persuade credit card companies to raise their credit limits If a credit card company representative asked for their income they were advised to add 75000 in anticipated earnings from their real estate venture before providing a figure for their expected earnings for the yearSome customers have also alleged they were told there would be a personal appearance at the session by Trump Instead they received the opportunity to get their photograph taken with a lifesize cardboard cutout of the mogulJohn Brown a customer who provided a sworn statement in the New York case described how he came to realize that I was not adequately trained which caused me to feel that Trump University had taken advantage of meBrown said he paid 1495 for a threeday seminar in 2009 and then used multiple credit cards to charge a 24995 Trump mentorship program Three years later he said he had made no real estate investments using Trump knowledge  but was still paying off 20000 from the coursesBecause of the Trump name he said I felt these classes would be the best
