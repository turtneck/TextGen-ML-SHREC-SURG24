The Federal Reserve lowered its economic outlook Wednesday after a harsh winter chilled the US economys growth reducing the odds for an initial interest rate hike as soon as the Feds June meetingIn a statement after a twoday meeting the Fed gave no clear signal of when it plans to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006 but policymakers have indicated they expect to act this yearThe Fed statement was released at 2 pm ETAs of 255 pm ET the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 55 points or 03 to 18056 and the Standard  Poors 500 index dropped 5 points or 03 to 2110 The Nasdaq composite was down 17 points or 03 to 5038 Yields on 10year government bonds sprang above 2The Fed said economic growth slowed during the winter months in part reflecting transitory factors Unusually cold weather for example hindered economic activity The Fed said it expects the economy to rebound and grow at a moderate pace in coming monthsWith that optimistic view the Fed didnt rule out a June rate increase as it virtually foreclosed the chances of an April hike in its statement last month Still its assertion that temporary factors were only part of the reason for last quarters slowdown suggests the central bank may want to hold off a few months before hoisting the target range for its federal funds rate which has been near zero since the 2008 financial crisisWhile a June rate increase does not look very likely it remains an option if the data suddenly turn much stronger than expected Jim OSullivan chief US economist of High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clientsPaul Ashworth of Capital Economics said it would take something quite spectacular to convince Fed officials to raise rates in JuneThe Feds statement noted that job growth moderated and household spending declined in recent weeks though inflationadjusted incomes rose strongly partly reflecting earlier declines in energy pricesBusiness investment however softened and exports declined the statement said The Fed added that inflation continued to run below the Feds target partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of nonenergy imports Fed policymakers said they expect inflation to rise gradually toward 2 over the mediumterm as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of low energy and import prices dissipateA strong dollar has hurt manufacturers exports and the plunge in oil prices has led energy companies to slash investmentThe government said Wednesday morning that the economy grew just 02 at an annual rate in the first quarter down from 22 in the OctoberDecember period and below the modest 1 pace expected by economistsMeanwhile inflation remains well below the Feds annual 2 target with the government reporting that the Feds preferred measure which excludes food and energy costs rose 09 last quarter Thats the smallest increase since 2010And employers added just 126000 jobs in March compared to average monthly gains of 269000 the prior 12 monthsThe Fed reiterated Wednesday that it will bump up its federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to the Feds 2 target over the mediumtermThe central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero since the 2008 financial crisis but with the economic recovery now almost six years old the central bank has been preparing financial markets and consumers for a return to normal interest rate policy Last month the Fed dropped a pledge to be patient as it considers boosting the rate signaling that it could make the move as early as JuneMany economists say the Fed is unlikely to act until September at the earliest so it can assess whether the economy is regaining the momentum it had built last year That timetable is consistent with Fed policymakers median forecast in March as well as with recent speeches by Fed policymakers including Fed Chair Janet Yellen
