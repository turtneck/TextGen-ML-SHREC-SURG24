Virginia According to its Web site the firms says it specializes in providing innovative strategic planning logistics operational and security management support services in challenging environments around the worldIn a statement Friday the company confirmed that three employees of Praetorian Standard Inc were killed and one was wounded in Afghanistan while supporting the efforts of the US

is exploring potential mineral deposit sources in AfghanistanThe victims whose names have not yet been released were working out of the firms Kabul officeIn Twitter messages and a subsequent statement Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid identified the shooter as Ihsanullah bin Mullah Rahmatullah from Laghman province in eastern Afghanistan He said the man had infiltrated the ranks of the Afghan security forces in anticipation of an opportunity to attack Americans and was working at Kabuls airportHe managed yesterday evening to attain his goal and opened fire with his rifle on a group of American occupiers the spokesman said The attacker was then martyred by return fire Mujahid saidThe martyr was able to successfully defend his religion  and the glory of his country and by giving himself away as a sacrifice he cast a number of the occupying disbelievers into the abyss of hell Mujahid saidHe gave a higher casualty figure for the attack claiming that three American soldiers died and four others were critically woundedAuthorities said Thursday that an Afghan national was also killed in the attack but it was not immediately clear whether that person was the shooter or an additional victimImmediately after Thursdays attack suspicion fell on a possible insider attack perpetrated by a member of the Afghan security forces who also had access to the military base at the airport An unidentified Afghan air force official told the Reuters news agency the shooter was an Afghan soldierIt was not immediately clear how the contractors were attackedReferring to the attacker as an infiltrator Mujahid used a term often used by the Taliban for an insurgent who had penetrated the Afghan army or police for months or years waiting for an opportunity to strikeWhen asked Thursday whether the incident was an insider attack a US military spokesman Col Brian Tribus declined to comment He said there would be no further comments on the incident until the investigation was completeThe sprawling base where the shooting occurred is protected by tall concrete blast walls and filled with hangars office trailers and maintenance buildings It is a hub for the coalitions air operations as well as the main base of the Afghan air forceAs of last year before a drawdown of US combat forces it was home to as many as 4000 foreign military personnel and civilian contractors from more than a dozen nations including the United States Top US commanders spent much of their time thereInsider attacks have long plagued the relationship between Afghan forces and their US and international allies breaking down trust and reducing interaction The assaults by rogue Afghan soldiers or police particularly rose in the last years of the NATO combat mission which formally ended in December Assaults reached record levels in 2012 when there were 37 such attacks that killed 51 people including 32 US troops according to the PentagonSince then US and coalition forces have tightened vetting procedures for Afghan security forces and required that all foreign troops be armed at all times The efforts have reduced the number of insider attacks but they nevertheless remain a major concernThe killings were a reminder of the threats faced by the roughly 10600 US troops and thousands of American contractors who remain in Afghanistan mostly to train and advise Afghan security forces Such tasks require close interaction with Afghans and it remains to be seen whether the attacks will have an adverse impact or restrict such relationshipsWe can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 640 pm Tribus said in an emailed statement Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national This incident is under investigationA US defense official in Washington speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the nationalities of those killed said the contractors were all Americans and that the fourth one had been woundedIn August a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform opened fire at a military training school near Kabul killing US Army Maj Gen Harold J Greene He was the highestranking US officer to be killed in 13 years of war in Afghanistan and the first general to be killed in the line of duty since the Sept 11 2001 attacks that prompted the United States to intervene militarily in Afghanistan combining with Afghan resistance forces to topple the radical Islamist Taliban regimeVirtually everyone on the base at the Kabul airport is armed But that did not stop US military officials from worrying about insider attacks during a flaglowering ceremony in early December that marked the official end of the coalitions combat mission Before the ceremony the officials warned journalists that if any rockets landed or if anyone started shooting to run and take coverWith the US military drawdown civilian contractors have become more visible Even though their numbers have also sharply decreased thousands of contractors remain in Afghanistan most of them based in KabulAs of mid2014 about 17400 US citizens were working in Afghanistan as civilian contractors for the Defense Department according to military figures reported by the Web site Danger Zone Jobs Other private contractors work for various international relief and development organizations A year earlier the Congressional Research Service put the number of Pentagon contractors at about 33000Thursdays killings broke a roughly threeweek lull in violence in the capital In the last two months of 2014 the Taliban intensified its attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country targeting foreigners as well as influential Afghans and symbols of government authorityThe shooting was the first suspected insider attack since US and NATO forces formally terminated their combat mission in Afghanistan Under an agreement with the Afghan government the previous coalition force is being replaced by a followon mission dubbed Resolute Support which began Jan 1 and consists of about 12000 mostly US troops focused on trainingEarlier on Thursday a roadside bomb killed a police commander and three other people in the eastern province of Laghman and a suicide bomber targeted the commanders funeral later in the day according to Afghan officials
