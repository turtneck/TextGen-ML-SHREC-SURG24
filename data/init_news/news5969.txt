When it comes to foreign policy Congress sits in the audience and cheers or boos But it seldom has any profound effect on the outcome of the actionHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueSpeaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio pauses while speaking about his opposition to the Iran deal during a news conference Sept 9 on Capitol Hill in Washington Even though opponents of the Iran nuclear deal cant win in Congress they arent going to go quietly This debate is far from over and frankly its just beginning Boehner said on Sept 10The almostcertain implementation of President Obamas Iran deal despite heated opposition from most congressional Republicans and some Democrats is yet more evidence that when it comes to major decisions of US foreign policy it is the White House that runs the gameCongress sits in the audience and cheers or boos But it seldom has any profound effect on the outcome of the actionAnd if anything the influence of Capitol Hill on the nations diplomacy and military action may be declining in todays highly partisan ageIt isnt obvious from the nations founding documents that the competing powers of the branches of government should lead to that result The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war after all The Senate participates in the ratification of treaties The power of the purse offers lawmakers a way to try and influence a wide range of foreign policy decisionsBut in general the unitary nature of the presidency allows it to make decisions and react to fastmoving foreign events while the legislature is still debating how to pull its boots onThis is simply an arena of policy that works to the commanderinchiefs advantage wrote Dan Drezner a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University earlier this yearOccasionally Congress has taken command of the nations diplomacy After World War I the Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles keeping the US out of the League of Nations In 1999 the Senate similarly blocked US accession to the Comprehensive Test Ban TreatyBut take the Obama administrations bombing campaign against the Islamic State Congress hasnt voted to explicitly approve it Instead the bombing is being conducted pursuant to an authorization of use of force that lawmakers passed in the wake of Sept 11 2001Both Republican and Democratic legislators would prefer that not be the case They would like to move a newer war resolution But after months of hearings and backroom wrangling they couldnt agree on wording Some wanted to authorize a full use of force including the possible presence of US military boots on the ground Others had a much narrower vision So the push for a new resolution has produced nothingSuch partisan gridlock has similarly reduced congressional influence on slowermoving foreign developments The deal to curb Irans nuclear program developed over months of negotiations Almost to a person Congress complains that it should have been tougher But it became a partisan issue particularly after House Republicans invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to denounce it at a joint meeting of Congress As it became more overtly political even some Democrats with reservations about its requirements lined up behind the White HouseEventually Congress approved a complicated review process that gave substantial power to the Democratic House and Senate minorities For President Obama to win all his party needed to do was maintain just enough cohesion to uphold an expected Obama veto of a disapproval resolutionBut they wont even have to go that far apparently On Thursday Senate Democrats blocked the GOPs effort to reject the deal A procedural vote on a resolution of disapproval fell two votes short of the 60 needed to proceedThe White House was quick to declare final victoryThis vote is a victory for diplomacy for American national security and for the safety and security of the world said Mr Obama in a statementThis is a bad deal with decadeslong consequences for the security of the American people and our allies And well use every tool at our disposal to stop slow and delay this agreement said House Speaker John Boehner following the Senate voteIn truth it seems to be all over but the suing Some House Republicans are urging a lawsuit to try and block the accord Speaker Boehner has said thats an option that is very possibleThus the Iran deal will stand as a major victory of President Obamas second term perhaps his signature accomplishment Or that designation might go to the administrations reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba after more than 50 years Thats another foreign policy move on which Congress had littletono influenceRecognition of governments is something over which the president does have unilateral power The Supreme Court affirmed that earlier this year on a 5to4 vote ruling that the White House did not have to give US citizens born in Jerusalem the option of listing Israel as their place of birth on an American passport Why was that an issue Its complicated For decades US presidents have said the status of Jerusalem must be determined by IsraeliPalestinian agreement which needless to say hasnt happenedThis is an issue on which the US must speak with one voice wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion That voice must be the presidentsHowever there is at least one presidential aspirant who has long said the White House advantage on foreign policy should be rolled back Its too easy for the Oval Office to drag the US into misbegotten wars in this persons view Congress should resume its rightful role as the check and balance on the nations overseas adventures he saysOne hopes Congress  both Republicans and Democrats  can regain the wisdom to reassert the authority that was so wisely given to it so many years ago he wrote in 2013 in a lengthy National Interest piece on the subjectThat would be former Sen Jim Webb of Virginia who served as Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration and later opposed the Bush administrations invasion of Iraq
