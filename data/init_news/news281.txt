They tease terrorists The prophet Muhammad cries A devout Muslim woman shows some leg and more They take on Pope Francis German Chancellor Angela Merkel French Prime Minister Manuel Valls There are nuns priests rabbis and imams They laugh at death itselfThe latest edition of Charlie Hebdo the satirical newspaper attacked last week by Islamist extremists for lampooning the prophet Muhammad became a symbol of freedom of expression as soon as it hit newsstands Wednesday  selling out millions of copies before dawn Yet in a country that mobilized Sunday by the millions in support of the papers right to mock France also found itself facing a mounting debate over the limits of free speech within its bordersFrench authorities on Wednesday detained and charged a notorious comedian Dieudonn Mbala Mbala with glorifying terrorism for an ambiguous Facebook post Sunday that to some appeared to show support for the gunman who killed four people in a kosher market FridaySince last weeks attacks at least 54 people have faced similar charges  including several underage pranksters and drunken louts who were mouthing off Authorities have used a beefed up antiterrorism law passed last year to expedite their cases and issue harsher jail sentences  with one offender arrested Saturday already receiving a fouryear sentence The Justice Ministry has also issued fresh orders for prosecutors to crack down on antiSemitic and racist acts or speechLaurent Lger an investigative journalist for Charlie Hebdo who survived the attack said there was no comparing the newspaper to Dieudonn  a French showman of Cameroonian descent who popularized a Nazilike salute and who jokes about the HolocaustDieudonn does not know the Charlie spirit Lger said Charlie never glorified terrorism Dieudonn is a bit too quick when he claims that his freedom of speech is being hampered His attitude is just making things worse by continuing the confusion that is destroying this countryYet others disagreed saying France was in danger of trouncing the very right it is aiming to protect freedom of expressionWe can definitely talk about hypocrisy here said Adrienne Charmet campaign coordinator for La Quadrature du Net a Parisbased Internet rights group In the past days we have seen a lot of people condemned for putting out words no matter how condemnable those words and receiving sentences that seem quite exaggeratedFrench opinion is split in two she added Some see it as the worst possible response to last weeks attack because many of those who have said these things were drunk or teenagers who did not know the weight of their words But there is another segment of the population that does agree because they feel these people are making themselves accomplices to terror Either way this crackdown on freedom of speech is a betrayal of last Sundays marchCharlie Hebdo was undoubtedly the hottest property in town Wednesday with lines snaking for blocks as Parisians clamored for copies that sold out within minutes An initial print run of 3million copies was expanded to 5million when kiosks across the country ran outSurviving staff members who worked day and night after the Jan 7 attack to ensure the issue came out on time produced the paper With their offices still roped off as a crime scene the staff worked out of a conference room at the leftwing daily Libration The offices there are being guarded around the clock by an extraordinary number of police officers and private security guardsThere was plenty inside the paper to stir controversy The 16page edition brims with the sort of irreverent offcolor humor that made Charlie famous  and infamous No one is spared ridiculeIn one cartoon two hooded terrorists are pictured in heaven with one asking the other Where are the virginsTheyre with the Charlie staff loser his accomplice repliesAnother pictures a harried and exhausted cartoonist hunched over his desk with a caption that reads Cartooning at Charlie Hebdo its 25 years of work The next panel shows hooded gunmen mowing people down with a Kalashnikov accompanied by the words For a terrorist its 25 seconds of workAs ever with Charlie Hebdo the goal is to provoke to stir debate and to make people laugh  while also reminding anyone who might think otherwise that reading Charlie can be distinctly discomfitingThe papers lead editorial offers a vigorous defense of secular values saying that staffers laughed when they heard that the bells of the Cathedral of Notre Dame would ring in their honorThe millions of anonymous people all the institutions all the world leaders all the politicians all the intellectuals and media figures all the religious dignitaries who proclaimed this week that I am Charlie need to also know that that means I am secularism the editorial saysDelphine RavionCasalta 39 spent an hour and a half visiting three newsstands Wednesday morning before she found her Charlie She sipped coffee at a cafe her copy proudly spread out before her eagerly taking in every wordIn France were still fighting for our freedom she said We had revolution for our freedom A lot of revolutions And great men like Voltaire and Rousseau The fight for those ideas continuesThe rush for copies of Charlie Hebdo came as French authorities detained and charged Dieudonn 48 After the unity march that brought 15million people onto the streets of Paris on Sunday the comedian wrote After this historic no legendary march a magic moment equal to the Big Bang which created the Universe or in a smaller way comparable to the crowning of the ancient king Vercingtorix I am going home Let me say that this evening as far as I am concerned I feel I am Charlie CoulibalyCharlie Coulibaly is a reference to both Charlie Hebdo and Amedy Coulibaly the gunman who killed four people in a Paris kosher market on Friday The comedian in a second Facebook post Monday sought to clarify his remark saying his purpose was to make people laugh and to laugh at death since death makes fun of us all as Charlie very well knows He concluded by saying They consider me to be Amedy Coulibaly when I am no different from a CharlieValls speaking in the National Assembly sought to draw a distinction between the creative caricatures of Charlie Hebdo and the comedians hatebased humor while insisting that France was not compromising freedom of speechThere is a fundamental difference between the freedom to be impertinent and antiSemitism racism glorification of terrorist acts and Holocaust denial all of which are offenses all of which are crimes that justice should punish with the most severity he said
