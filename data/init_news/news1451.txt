We are now at the point in this political season where everyone is hating on everyone elseThink about it When was the last time you saw a piece or watched a segment in which a candidate was portrayed positivelyPresidential campaigns are a tough business where every contender gets roughed up as the price of admission But the level of vitriolthe pundits against Donald Trump and his rivals and the candidates sliming each otherhas spiraled way out of controlIt hasnt been Morning in America for a long time In fact its pretty close to a dark and stormy midnightAnd the hyperspeed news cycle has all this unfolding at a headsnapping pace like an endless feed of Twitter tauntsIn the deafening din of the media echo chamber it sometimes seems like these are the sounds that break throughDonald Trump is a fascist threat to our way of life says racist things and loves to attack women over their looksTed Cruz is the most unlikable man in Washington maybe the world and such a nutty rightwinger hed probably like to shut down the government foreverJohn Kasich is a cranky spoiler impersonating a nice guy who is staying in the race out of pure egoHillary Clinton is a deceitful woman who gets on everyones nerves keeps lying about her email server and is lucky shes not in jailThe war over the wives controversy is perhaps the perfect encapsulation of the gutter campaign with Trump blaming Cruz for the posting of a nude magazine photo of his wife Cruz blaming Trump for unsubstantiated mistress allegations in the Enquirer and the media breathlessly following each twist and tweetIts a chickenandegg game to assign blame for the campaigns locker room tone to either the politicians or the journalists Perhaps it reflects the crude and often meanspirited tone of our cultureHere among thousands of possible selections is a sampling Lets start with Sundays New York Times oped page where everyone gets whackedRoss Douthat a thoughtful conservative voice says Ted Cruz looks like hes faking itThe fact that he seems so much like an actor hitting his marks fits with the story of how he became Mr True Conservative Outsider in the first place Basically he spent years trying to make it in Washington on the insiders track and hit a wall because too many of the insiders didnt like him  because his ambition was too naked his climbers zeal too palpable So he deliberately switched factions turning the establishments personal disdain into a political asset and taking his Ivy League talents to the Tea Party insteadOn such issues as the government shutdown over ObamaCare an exercise in selfserving cynicismCruz has proceeded with several fingers in the wind every time the conservative mood has shifted even a little hes shifted quickly too He accuses Cruz of first being obsequious toward Trump but turning to selfrighteousness now that the namecalling and scandalmongering have been turned against his reputation and his familyAfter that and with a parting shot that his cynicism can be repellent Douthat allows that the hardworking Cruz has earned his standing in the primariesOn the liberal side I have a lot of respect for Nick Kristof but in his Times column he buys into an increasingly common myth The headline is My Shared Shame The Media Helped Make TrumpAlthough many of us journalists have derided Trump the truth is that he generally outsmarted us with many exceptions for there truly have been serious efforts to pin him down and to investigate Trump University and his various business failings He manipulated television by offering outrageous statements that drew ever more cameras  without facing enough skeptical followup questionsIts not that we shouldnt have covered Trumps craziness but that we should have aggressively provided context in the form of fact checks and robust examination of policy proposalsWhile the press could always do a better job Id argue that there has been endless factchecking and it hasnt hurt Teflon TrumpThe second failure is that we wrongly treated Trump as a farce Not all of us Nick but that is especially true among the Huffington Post liberal crowd though plenty of conservative pundits fell into this trapBut I strongly agree with Kristofs last point We failed to take Trump seriously because of a third media failing We were largely oblivious to the pain among workingclass Americans and thus didnt appreciate how much his message resonatedWe inhabit a middleclass world and dont adequately cover the part of America that is struggling and seething We spend too much time talking to senators not enough to the joblessAlso on the oped page Maureen Dowd looked at President Obama tangoing into historythat is enjoying his trip to Argentina and Cuba and failing to reflect the public alarm over the Brussels bombingsBarack Obama started off as a man selfconsciously alone on stage and thats how he is exiting He is for better and worse too cool for school His identity is defined by his desire to rise above the fray Unfortunately he is in politics which is the frayThe president has a bristling resistance to what he sees as cheap emotion See flag pin 2008 That has led him time after time to respond belatedly or bloodlessly in moments when Americans are alarmed wanting solace and solutionsWell how about John Kasich He hasnt offended too many people rightNational Review Editor Rich Lowry is in the NeverKasich campThis truly is a year when the rules dont apply If they did John Kasich would be back in Columbus trying to figure out whether he sells his soul to Donald Trump or endorses Ted CruzInstead the Ohio governor is still out on the trail running a delusional vanity project masquerading as a presidential campaign There is no appetite for his pragmatic cant we all get along campaign among Republicanprimary voters who have made that abundantly clearOh and the Times news section joins the fray by quoting Kasich associates who recall a threedecade career in government punctuated by scolding confrontations intemperate critiques and undiplomatic remarksI could go on and on Slate says Trump seeks to destroy people who stand in his way especially women even if he looks disgusting doing itNew York magazine says that unfortunately for Cruz his logic backfires Because if real men do not attack women Cruz is fake as hell In fact he might be faker than TrumpMaybe on some level we get the elections we deserveThis is a reality show campaign in which reality perhaps in the form of terror attacks sometimes intrudes It is endlessly entertaining but often feels like tragicomedy with no heroesHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz
