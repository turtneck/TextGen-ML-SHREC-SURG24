Tuesday nightIn a state that has always been known for giving new political life to the hardestworking candidates he swept the field He lapped his closest challenger Ohio Governor John Kasich by double digits and he notched his first win in this presidential contest by acting more like a traditional candidateTrumps victory speech was gracious and restrained with a long list of thank yous for family members and campaign staff He acknowledged that he had learned the lesson in Iowa that the ground game matters and paid more attention to turning out his voters in New Hampshire Most striking he had nothing but compliments for his fellow rivalsIn fact Trump had been a mere spectator in the biggest brawl of the week  the showdown between New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Florida Sen Marco Rubio that recast the Republican raceEntering New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last Monday Rubio had been the candidate to beat but Trump didnt even touch him It was Christie who demolished Rubio halting his momentum during Saturday nights debate in a moment that could go down in history as one of the toughest exchanges of the GOP primary campaignThough on the sidelines Trump underscored the power of the moment during the commercial break as Christie walked across the stage to see his wife Someone grabbed Christies arm from behind and the New Jersey governor turned to see none other than the taunterinchief Donald TrumpOh my God That was brutal Trump muttered to Christie on the debate stage according to someone familiar with the exchange TremendousPerhaps staying out of the fray this week with the exception of a vulgar swipe at Ted Cruz on the eve of the election helped Donald Trump He swept a range of demographic and ideological groups appealing to sixinten New Hampshire voters who said they were looking for an outside candidateThe commanding victories in New Hampshire by two outsiders  Trump and Democratic winner Bernie Sanders  reinforce the tremendous vulnerability of the establishment in the 2016 presidential race Insiders in both parties are struggling to find their footing in a year when voters are fed up with the status quo Democrat Hillary Clinton is looking toward the March contests as her firewall John Kasich is trying to capitalize on his moment after climbing to second in New Hampshire Jeb Bush is hoping to hang on by engineering a strong performance in South Carolina Chris Christie has headed home to assess his chances amid indications that he will soon end his bid according to two sources And Marco Rubio is trying to regroup after a humiliating defeatMeanwhile Trump only got stronger Tuesday night After he underperformed in the polls in Iowa  a fact many Iowa strategists attributed to the weakness of his ground game compared to that of winner Ted Cruz  Trumps campaign made a concerted push to reach voters in New Hampshire who might not head to the pollsIn addition to his big rallies he added smaller more intimate events and retail stops where he could mingle with voters apparently with great successWe are coming to the end of a beautiful beautiful journey he said during a town hall in Londonderry Monday afternoon It should be a very big day for the nationThe dreamer takes on the doerThe outsiders understood that they had captured their moment Sanders congratulated his supporters Tuesday night by promising nothing short of a political revolutionHe vowed that his movement would bring together working people who have given up on the political processWe will all together say loudly and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us not just a few wealthy campaign contributors he told a boisterous crowd That is what this campaign is about That is what the political revolution is aboutThe momentum for a resounding win in the firstinthenation primary came a week earlier with his surprising strength in Iowa Votes were still being counted in Iowa when Sanders boarded his charter plane to New Hampshire after midnight The feat he had just achieved once seemed unthinkable the 74yearold democratic socialist from Vermont had come within a fraction of a percentage point of slaying Clinton the anointed candidate of the Democratic establishment and one of the most famous women in the worldHours earlier Clinton had dashed on stage to claim her somewhat tenuous victory before the networks even called it But as Sanders and his aides winged their way to New Hampshire past midnight they knew the narrative had shifted in their favorWith that razorthin margin the world would view the result as a tie That meant the Vermont Senator had cleared a huge hurdle dispelling doubt that he could be viable And that meant everything for the campaigns momentum in New Hampshire The money was pouring in onlineWhen we began this campaign I think it is fair to say we were considered to be a fringe campaign I would hope most people no longer believe that Sanders told reporters as he stood in the aisle illuminated by the ultra violet glow of the interior lights on his Eastern Airlines 757We are in this to the convention he said Tonight shows the American people that this is a campaign that can winSleep could wait By 515am that morning he was standing on the back of a flatbed truck in Bow New Hampshire his breath visible in the cold New Hampshire airJane and I we cannot believe that youre here at 5 oclock in the morning Sanders said as he and his wife rallied supporters in the predawn darkness Something is wrong with you guysBut the electricity surrounding him that morning was a harbinger of what would unfold in the week to comeFor Team Clinton the imperative of closing a polling gap of more than twenty points a week before the New Hampshire primary seemed almost surreal This after all was a state that had been kind to her and her husband It was here that Bill Clinton positioned himself as the comeback kid in 1992 Her tearful moment at a Portsmouth coffee shop sharing her struggles with a group of women in 2008 allowed her to rebound after her humiliating thirdplace finish in IowaLong before Sanders emerged as a threat this cycle she had insisted she was taking nothing for granted airing ads in New Hampshire as early as August Clinton and her aides labored throughout last year to build the narrative that this was her historic momentAt her first postIowa rally this past week with New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan she was greeted here in the Granite State as the first woman to ever win the Iowa caucuses Female senators flew up from Washington to canvass for her in hopes of breaking what she had called that highest hardest glass ceilingBut the overt appeal to the historic nature of her candidacy didnt seem to be resonating in 2016For weeks tensions had been swirling within her camp about how to knock out the charismatic Vermont Senator who had captured the same kind of cool that Barack Obama did in 2008 Some Clinton aides felt shed been playing it too safe Now behind by double digits the stage seemed set for a long and protracted delegate fightThough New Hampshire seemed like a lost cause she punched hard in Thursday nights debate skewering Sanders lofty proposals as fantasy that could never be achievedShe bristled at Sanders efforts to cast her as a creature of Wall Street Its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out she told him At the same time she continued to stumble through answers about the 675000 she was paid for three speeches from Goldman Sachs which only seemed to reinforce Sanders most powerful line of attack against her that she was the ultimate insiderDid you have to be paid 675000 CNNs Anderson Cooper asked Clinton during CNNs Democratic town hall in New Hampshire a day earlier on WednesdayWell I dont know Um thats what they offered she replied seemingly caught off guard by the question At the time she accepted those fees she told Cooper she wasnt sure she was going to run again for the White HouseI didnt know to be honest I wasnt  I wasnt committed to running she saidPreparing for defeat Clinton and her aides spent the week trying to lower expectations with the candidate herself wondering aloud whether she should have skipped the Granite State primary altogether and moved on to firmer ground in Nevada and South Carolina states with far more diverse populations where Sanders is not expected to run as strongSanders had a homecourt advantage in New Hampshire she and her surrogates insisted over and over again and there wasnt much she could do about itTheir argument is  and it has got some strength to it  look you are behind here you are in your opponents backyard Clinton told supporters at a campaign event in Derry midweek But ever the fighter she vowed to press on I know Ive got some ground to make up Im ready Im going to fight until the last vote is castBehind the scenes Clintons aides were already looking at the map ahead airing ads in South Carolina and Nevada to lock in minority voters who will be critical to their delegate counts and marshaling their teams in upcoming caucus states like Maine and Minnesota where Sanders thinks he can do wellIn a sign of resignation about Tuesdays likely result they even sent Clinton out of state Sunday to Flint Michigan to talk about the water crisis  an issue of great importance to many minority voters who have watched the scandal unfold in horrorThe most ominous development for Clinton the yawning gap between her and Sanders among young voters who broke heavily in Sanders favor according to exit polls Tuesday nightMost strikingly women under age 30 split 79 for Sanders to 20 for ClintonWhile many Clinton allies are deeply puzzled by gap Clinton has tried to strike a positive note stating at her campaign events including Tuesday night that even if young women were not with her she will still fight for themPressing her case she also stressed that the struggle for womens equality is far from over But she may have been harmed in the final days when others took that message too far Madeleine Albright the first female secretary of state touched off a firestorm as she mocked Sanders call for a revolution at Clintons rally in Concord SaturdayIntroducing Clinton at that event  which somewhat ominously was filled with outofstate canvassers and some political tourists  Albright said the real revolution in the 2016 race would be electing the first woman presidentWe can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder and a lot of you younger women think its done Albright said before pivoting to a scorching rebuke of young women supporting Sanders Its not done Theres a special place in hell for women who dont help each otherThe crowd cheered and Clinton laughed but the comments risked further alienating young women supporters of SandersThe controversy over Albrights comments was amplified by discussion of Gloria Steinems observation earlier in the week in an interview with Real Time host Bill Maher that young women were supporting Sanders to meet boysTheyre going to get more activist as they get older Steinem told Maher And when youre young youre thinking Where are the boys The boys are with BernieSteinem sought to smooth over her comments in a Sunday Facebook post but the sting of her words and Albrights remained Some young women voters in New Hampshire said they were dismayed by what they viewed as shaming by the Clinton campaign and its alliesGabrielle Greaves a University of New Hampshire student who had attended the CNN town hall with both Sanders and Clinton earlier in the week said the Albright and Steinem flap only reinforced the disconnect between the generationsOlder women just cant fathom why we arent voting for Hillary Clinton and I dont really think theyre trying to understand said Greaves a 19yearold Brooklyn native in an interview here in ManchesterI think a lot of older women think we dont understand how much Hillary Clinton has sacrificed and how much shes been through and what shes done for women Just because I dont think she should be president doesnt mean Im not thankful for the things she has doneGreaves added that theres just something I dont trust about Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders she said is a genuine soulI just want the older generation to have the confidence in us that we can make decisions she said Just because we have opposing views doesnt mean were not intelligent enough to think about these things and consider all the optionsThe question of trust continued to dog Clinton throughout her events all week in New Hampshire Interviews with voters after her rallies suggested she was having trouble closing the sale as some Democrats worried about her liabilities aheadJane Fargo came to Clintons Concord rally over the weekend holding a sign that said Convince Me in red letters She left unconvinced by the former Secretary of StateIm really torn Who is going to look out best for my interests My investments are going down Im looking at retirement in 12 years and its really scary said Fargo a 52yearold middleschool teacher from Bow I love Bernies fiery spirit Somebodys got to go shake up something and that sells me toward BernieStanding next to the bleachers in the gymnasium where Clinton had just spoken Fargo said she liked her ideas but worried about how entrenched she isShe just been in government forever so is she already sold out Or is she really going to go in and shake things up like Bernie is promising to doIm looking for change I want change Fargo said At the same time when they say Clinton will be ready on day one Ive got a feeling shell be ready on day one she said As for Sanders Thats my qualm right there you hit the nail on the headIn the final days Sanders rallies crackled with the kind of electricity that accompanies a candidate on the riseTaking the stage in Portsmouth Sunday afternoon he peeled off his jacket and tossed it to the beanieclad college kids on the stage behind him  who cheered as though they were in the presence of a rock starThe cheers built to a crescendo as he ticked through the items in his stump speech  railing against the rigged economy promising universal health care vowing to take on the big banks and a broken criminal justice system He engaged in callanswer exchange with the crowd as he encouraged them to shout out how much student debt they were carrying as he talked about his plans for free college100000  You win he said pointing to one woman in the crowdTo laughter he mocked the refrain he has heard from Clintons allies Your ideas are so ambitiousSanders paused for a beat We will get them done because people will demand that we get them done he thunderedClintons closing days of her New Hampshire campaign carried eerie echoes of her 2008 campaignBill Clinton who had been a subdued and measured advocate for his wife leading up to the Iowa caucuses lashed out at Sanders supporters in the final weekend  condemning sexist attacks and calling out the media for being too soft in their coverage of SandersWhen youre making a revolution you cant be too careful about the facts the former President said Youre just for me or against meHis critique of Sanders agenda as unachievable recalled 2008 when he dubbed Barack Obamas campaign a fairy tale Once again the former President warned Democratic voters were rolling the diceBy Monday the die seemed cast The conversation around the Democratic campaign focused not on a comeback but on a campaign shakeupLooking to change the story line Hillary Clinton was circumspect saying in an MSNBC interview that the campaign was taking stockOn the trail she struck a poignant tone in the final hours For me this is a labor of love she said at one of her last events at a restaurant on Manchesters West sideShe conceded defeat in a statement at 8 pm shortly after the polls closed in New Hampshire Tuesday nightI still love New Hampshire and I always will she said taking the stage with her husband and daughter at Southern New Hampshire UniversityBut she was looking ahead to South Carolina and the states beyond telling her donors in an email that she wouldnt be discouraged by the resultsI wish tonight had gone differently she wrote in a fundraising email But I know what its like to be knocked down  and Ive learned from long experience that its not whether you get knocked down that matters Its about whether you get back upOne political knockdown changed the trajectory of the GOP campaign in New Hampshire Christies merciless takedown of Rubio who had seemed on the cusp of muscling the other establishment candidates out of the race for a threeway contest with Trump and CruzGiven Tuesday nights results with Kasichs strong secondplace finish Christies maneuver to damage Rubio ultimately looked like a kamikaze mission for the governor who staked his entire campaign on New Hampshire but ended up in sixth placeA week earlier after Rubios surprisingly strong thirdplace finish in Iowa it had looked as though the establishment had finally found their candidate to rally aroundBut with the skill of a New Jersey street fighter Christie managed to singlehandedly halt what Rubios aides had dubbed Marcomentum Saturday night by taking his rivals greatest strengths  his youth his charisma his uplifting message  and turning them into weaknessesRattling Rubio with unflinching eye contact Christie had walked the Florida senator into a trap one that made him appear inexperienced unready for the role of commander in chief a robotic candidate programmed with scripted lines who seemed to wilt under pressure as sweat beaded on his foreheadI like Marco Rubio and hes a smart person and good guy but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States Christie said during that debate moment Weve watched it happen everybody for the last seven years The people of New Hampshire are smart Do not make the same mistake againDuring the past month the ChristieRubio rivalry had turned intensely personalRubios allies had set their mark on Christie in early January just as he seemed to be rising in the polls on the strength of his many town halls here Early that month the super PAC supporting Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC unleashed multimillion dollar ad buyThey put out a pair of scorching ads faulting the New Jersey Governor for his past position on Common Core for his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare and for New Jerseys economic woes One ad was essentially a montage of photos of Christie and Obama after Superstorm Sandy a sore spot with conservative votersThe other raised the specter of the George Washington Bridge scandal the scheme to close lanes and create traffic tie ups that embroiled officials in his administration Chris Christie High Taxes Weak Economy Scandals the ads tag line said Not what we need in the White HouseChristie and his allies were furious In private conversations Christie told aides he couldnt believe the response that Rubio was getting from voters and donors given his thin resume in Senate and what he viewed as a lackluster record of accomplishments according to a person familiar with the conversationsAfter Iowa with their poll numbers still in single digits Christie seized his moment to strikeSome members of Christies team became even more riled up by the calls they received after Iowa suggesting Christie should drop out so the party could coalesce around RubioAs candidates began shifting their campaigns toward the Granite state on Feb 2 Christie telegraphed his strategy to reporters remarking that it was going to be an interesting week for RubioHe tested his lines about the dangers posed by firstterm senators on the stump And then the real onslaught began when he unleashed his new attack line for Rubio  calling him the boy in the bubble who relied on advisers for canned linesRelishing his performance after the debate Christie quoted the great political philosopher Mike Tyson the heavyweightboxing championEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face he told reportersThe debate moment was played again and again  even on Tuesday morning as voters were headed to the pollsPeople close to Rubio acknowledged that his performance in the debate clearly had an impact in the polls But the headlines about how Rubio had choked were even more devastatingOn Tuesday night he took full responsibility Our disappointment tonight is not on you he told the crowd at his victory party Its on me I did not do well on Saturday and it will never happen againAllies of Bush and Kasich were virtually giddy in large part because the debate had reset the race for donors who had been leaning toward RubioOnce again these skittish donors were back on the sidelines  frozen at least for a time And it was clear that the fight for the establishment lane could continue for weeks to comeIn interviews on the campaign trail with New Hampshires famously late deciders many voters who had been enamored by Rubio admitted the debate had given them second thoughts They echoed Christies suggestion that Rubio might end up getting destroyed by Hillary Clinton in a general electionSome were baffled by the fact that Rubio had repeated the same line four times in the debate and then repeated a line almost verbatim in one of his final events What had once seemed like admirable message discipline from a polished candidate had turned into a viral meme In the final days Rubio was shadowed across the state by Rubio robots paid for of course by the Right to Rise super PAC supporting BushThe doubts introduced late in the game mattered on Election DayStephanie Tsepas who ran into Rubio at her polling place in Derry Tuesday had gone to see one of his town halls Friday and left with a headache she said because he seemed so robotic and rehearsedI felt like I was living in one of his commercials Tsepas said She had a chance to engage at a more personal level with the Florida senator at her polling place asking him about his plan to fund cures for cancer a disease that her husband hasUltimately she cast her vote for someone else though she would not say whomHe could be a great candidate for president Tsepas said of Rubio I just dont think now is his timeBut as the results showed the ChristieRubio duel that dominated the final days of the firstinthenation primary cut both ways After a disappointing finish Christie headed home to review his optionsHe may have taken a step too far in his effort to halt Rubios momentum Roger Fletcher who had been considering the New Jersey Governor decided he would side with the victim not the bullyThanks to Chris Christies bashing I went with Marco Rubio he wrote to Bash after casting his vote TuesdayThe fight to break out of the packThe ChristieRubio showdown was a moment that had long been in the making in the crowded establishment lane here in New Hampshire Four candidates  Rubio Christie Kasich and Bush  had labored in the shadow of Trump and ultimately Kasich benefited most from that jumble in the middle of the packFrom the beginning those four candidates knew there would be another ticket or perhaps two out of New Hampshire beyond Ted Cruz and Trump Though Cruz was not a natural fit for the New Hampshire voters his ground game has proven exceptional so far and was able to ride his Iowa victory into more comfortable territory in South Carolina without facing high expectations hereCasting about for more moderate New Hampshire voters Bush Kasich and Christie all committed early to the John McCain model driving from one corner of the state to another holding dozens of town halls and lingering until the last voters had a chance to shake hands and ask questionsBehind the scenes it was a bloodbath of negative ads and mailers behind the scenes By January the candidates and their allies had spent at least 30 million on negative ads according to Kantar MediaCMAGA large portion of that spending was by the proBush super PAC Right to Rise which sought to cast Rubio as a voteskipping political novice and Kasich as a budget buster who had agreed to expand Medicaid as part of Obamacare One mailer from Right to Rise showed pictures of Kasich and Rubio on a pair of red dice Dont roll the dice America needs a leader we can trustDespite all that spending Bush flailed as he repeatedly tried to take on Trump without success But he became a better campaigner during his time in New Hampshire He kept his town halls wonky and policyfocused insisting even during his final campaign stops here that he was still a joyful warriorVoters would often walk away from his town halls marveling that the campaigner that they had just seen on stage was a different person than theyd seen in the debates He became accustomed on the rope line to being counseled by voters who tried to buck him up by offering unsolicited advice about how to improve his debate performancesIn the final weekend his campaign ramped up its ground game which had focused largely on the populous southern band of New Hampshire by bringing in dozens of former aides to President George W Bush and President George HW Bush as well as friends from Florida to knock on doors and make phone calls He drew one of his biggest crowds with a special appearance by 90yearold Barbara Bush who called her son the worlds nicest man during an appearance Thursday night in DerryHes not a bragger  we dont allow that Barbara Bush said that night But hes decent and honest Hes everything we need in a presidentBecoming more emboldened over time Bush tried to cast his attempted takedowns of Trump as an act of valor going so far as to call Trump a whiner and a liar in one of his final tweets the day before the primaryIm defending the honor of people that I really respect Bush told CNNs Dana Bash in an interview Monday Im a joyful warrior Theres a difference between sitting back and watching someone try to hijack a party that I believe will allow people to rise up againLike Christie Bush also became increasingly willing to go after Rubio in the final weeks He offered his most pointed criticism of the Florida senator in an MSNBC interview Friday shrugging when asked what Rubio had accomplished in the Senate Nothing he said Hes a great guy But hes not a leader And he refused to apologize for the attack ads by Right to Rise Politics aint bean bag he told reportersAt his final rally in Portsmouth on Monday night Bush reminded attendees that hed gone to nearly every nook and cranny of New Hampshire including about 15000 different Dunkin Donuts His ground game was sophisticated and wellfunded  particularly after he had shifted resources and staff from his Miami headquarters to the Granite stateYoure from New Hampshire you can change the course of anything Bush told voters in Portsmouth Monday night If you dont think the pundits are right the obituaries that have been written about all the candidates including me if you disagree with that you can reset this race tomorrow You have that power No one else does Its an extraordinary responsibilityIn one of the ironies of Tuesday nights race it was Kasichs sunny campaign that ultimately notched him a second place finish behind TrumpKasichs advisers had always believed that he had a strong chance here because of his moderate record and potential appeal to New Hampshires undeclared voters And they invested in data to help target those latedeciding independent voters in the final hoursThroughout the process Kasich had also chafed at what he viewed as unfair attacks on his record After an event earlier this week he complained to reporters that his campaign had millions of dollars spent against themThey cant even build mailboxes big enough to put all the negative advertising in from all these campaigns he said But he believed his ground game would insulate us from all these attacksAs Rubio stumbled Kasichs strategists saw an opening bringing in some 500 outofstate volunteers to help them canvass and make phone calls in the final daysHe was one of the few candidates who looked like he was having fun on the campaign trail  taking a break between his 99th and 100th town hall in Hollis New Hampshire Friday to engage in a snowball fight with reporters and aidesIf we win I think it will send a powerful message Kasich said a day earlier because I think now is the time to be positiveHe touched on those themes in his victory speech after coming in second to Donald Trump asserting that there was magic in the air and describing his campaign as an effort to restore the spirit of America while leaving no person behindMaybe we are turning a page on a dark part of American politics he said because tonight the light overcame the darknessBut the path ahead remains cloudy for the establishment With a jumbled mess of candidates still vying for third late Tuesday night the brutal battle in New Hampshire that was supposed to clarify the race ultimately may have simply led to stalemate
