by MICHAEL TENNANT Seen any walnuts in your medicine cabinet lately According to the Food and Drug Administration that is precisely where you should find them Because Diamond Foods made truthful claims about the health benefits of consuming walnuts that the FDA didnt approve it sent the company a letter declaring Your walnut products are drugs  and new drugs at that  and therefore they may not legally be marketed  in the United States without an approved new drug application The agency even threatened Diamond with seizure if it failed to comply Diamonds transgression was to make financial investments to educate the public and supply them with walnuts as William Faloon of Life Extension magazine put it On its website and packaging the company stated that the omega3 fatty acids found in walnuts have been shown to have certain health benefits including reduced risk of heart disease and some types of cancer These claims Faloon notes are well supported by scientific research  Life Extension has published 57 articles that describe the health benefits of walnuts and The US National Library of Medicine database contains no fewer than 35 peerreviewed published papers supporting a claim that ingesting walnuts improves vascular health and may reduce heart attack risk This evidence was apparently not good enough for the FDA which told Diamond that its walnuts were misbranded because the product bears health claims that are not authorized by the FDA The FDAs letter continues We have determined that your walnut products are promoted for conditions that cause them to be drugs because these products are intended for use in the prevention mitigation and treatment of disease Furthermore the products are also misbranded because they are offered for conditions that are not amenable to selfdiagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners therefore adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes Who knew you had to have directions to eat walnuts The FDAs language Faloon writes resembles that of an outofcontrol police state where tyranny reigns over rationality He adds This kind of bureaucratic tyranny sends a strong signal to the food industry not to innovate in a way that informs the public about foods that protect against disease While consumers increasingly reach for healthier dietary choices the federal government wants to deny food companies the ability to convey findings from scientific studies about their products Walnuts arent the only food whose health benefits the FDA has tried to suppress Producers of pomegranate juice and green tea among others have felt the bureaucrats wrath whenever they have suggested that their products are good for people Meanwhile Faloon points out foods that have little to no redeeming value are advertised endlessly often with dubious health claims attached For example FritoLay is permitted to make all kinds of claims about its fatladen fried products including that Lays potato chips are heart healthy Faloon concludes that the FDA obviously does not want the public to discover that they can reduce their risk of agerelated disease by consuming healthy foods They prefer consumers only learn about massmarketed garbage foods that shorten life span by increasing degenerative disease risk Faloon thinks he knows why this is the case First by stifling competition from makers of more healthful alternatives junk food manufacturers who he says heavily lobby the federal government for favorable treatment will rake in ever greater profits Second by making it less likely that Americans will consume healthful foods big pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers stand to gain by selling more expensive cardiac drugs stents and coronary bypass procedures to those made ill by their diets But people are starting to fight back against the FDAs tactics The makers of pomegranate juice for example have sued the FTC for censoring their First Amendment right to communicate scientific information to the public Faloon reports Congress is also getting into the act with a bill the Free Speech About Science Act HR 1364 that Faloon writes protects basic free speech rights ends censorship of science and enables the natural health products community to share peerreviewed scientific findings with the public Of course if the Constitution were being followed as intended none of this would be necessary The FDA would not exist but if it did as a creation of Congress it would have no power to censor any speech whatsoever If companies are making false claims about their products the market will quickly punish them for it and genuine fraud can be handled through the courts In the absence of a government agency supposedly guaranteeing the safety of their food and drugs and the truthfulness of producers claims consumers would become more discerning as indeed they already are becoming despite the FDAs attempts to prevent the dissemination of scientific research Besides as Faloon observed If anyone still thinks that federal agencies like the FDA protect the public this proclamation that healthy foods are illegal drugs exposes the governments sordid charade
