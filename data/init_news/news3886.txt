passengers name wasnt in a police report obtained by CNN The passenger was detained briefly after the shooting one officer wrote in the reportScott family attorney Chris Stewart said the man with Scott was a coworker and friend But he did not identify the friend by name nor did Thom Berry a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman who confirmed Fridays meetingHis lawyer Andy Savage said Friday he has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media hasSavages office said in a written statement that it has yet to receive any investigative documents audio or video tapes other than a copy of Mr Slagers arrest warrantThe news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to is no longer involved in the caseThe dash cam footage shows Slager talking calmly to Scott during the traffic stop Scott apparently says he has no insurance on the vehicle and Slager returns to his car to do paperworkMoments later Scott gets out of his car and bolts A foot chase ensues Scott never reappears on the dash cam video but a witness later takes video of the officer shooting Scott several times in the back as he is running awayNothing in this video demonstrates that the officers life or the life of another was threatened National Urban League President Marc Morial said The question here is whether the use of force was excessiveOn Thursday a new witness emerged in the case Gwen Nichols told CNNs Brian Todd that she saw a scuffle between Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lotIt was like a tussle type of thing like you know like What do you want or What did I do type of thing Nichols said I didnt hear Mr Slager saying Stop Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over 1810443 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop according to court records That may be why he ran an attorney for the family saidCriminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slagers defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder caseDefense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting  that this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation a physical altercation with a suspect Callan said And that would constitute manslaughter under law as opposed to murder and it makes a huge difference in sentencingThe investigation has been turned over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division or SLEDIn a statement released Thursday SLED said its investigators found troubling inconsistencies from the very startWe believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter SLED Chief Mark Keel said in a statement The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicionsCell phone videographer Mr Scott never tried to fightFeidin Santana who took the video of the shooting told CNNs Anderson Cooper that he was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott who was on the ground He said he could hear the sound of a Taser in useSantana said he didnt see Scott go after the Taser as Slager initially claimed He said he believes Scott was trying to get awayMr Scott never tried to fight Santana saidNeither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video because Santana started recording shortly after thatHis video shows Scott running away from Slager before the officer aims his gun Slager fires eight shots toward Scott striking him five timesWhile the initial traffic stop may have seemed to be perfectly normal and professional and the foot chase a reasonable choice an analyst saw little justification for that last actIm not familiar with South Carolina police training but I guarantee you that they do not teach to shoot a fleeing unarmed man in the back said Jim Bueermann president of the Police Foundation a Washingtonbased nonprofitIf its determined that multiple officers attempted to cover for the shooting officer and its shown that those reports were false this will be a devastating blow for law enforcement everywhere he said
