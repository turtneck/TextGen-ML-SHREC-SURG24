OMalley prepare to debate at Drake University in Des Moines Iowa on Saturday November 14 It was the partys second presidential debateHere are the six key takeaways from the debateClinton distanced herself from President Barack Obamas nowcontroversial comment in an interview Thursday that the US had contained ISIS During Saturdays debate Clinton asserted that ISIS cannot be contained and must simply be defeatedAs she has in the past Clinton also suggested that she had argued early on that we needed to find a way to train and equip moderates Clinton reportedly argued for a more forceful administration plan to help the Syrian opposition early on in the civil war that has since explodedThe Vermont senator in the first debate appeared unprepared or unwilling to go after Clinton with any real vigorBut Saturday night Sanders suggested Clinton is in the pocket of Wall Street and tied her vote to authorize the war in Iraq to the rise of ISIS Clinton meanwhile knocked Sanders on his mixed record on guns and suggested his policy proposals are too simplisticIn the most forceful exchange of the night Sanders pointed to the millions of dollars in donations Wall Street has funneled to Clintons campaigns over her political careerWhy over her political career has Wall Street been a major the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton Maybe theyre dumb and they dont know what theyre going to get but I dont think so Sanders said I have never heard a candidate never who has received huge amounts of money from oil from coal from Wall Street from the military industrial complex not one candidate  Oh these these campaign contributions will not influence me But why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions They expect to get something everybody knows thatAs she did in the first debate Clinton hit Sanders on guns calling the Vermont senators vote to shield gun makers from some lawsuits a terrible mistake and urging Sanders to admit as much as she has done regarding her Iraq voteSanders responded by suggesting theres little daylight between himself and Clinton and OMalley on guns3 but he still holds backSanders didnt take the gloves off completely during Saturday nights debate in IowaInstead he took a pass on one of the biggest points of contention of the 2016 cycle Clintons record as secretary of stateGiven a chance to slam Clintons tenure Sanders demurred instead pivoting to his disagreement with Clinton over her vote in favor of the Iraq War in 2002 more than six years before she became secretary of stateRepublicans are already picking apart Clintons track record as secretary of state but Sanders simply wouldnt take the bait4 The moments that could come back to haunt ClintonHowever Clintons response to Sanders  when she beat back the suggestion that she is influenced by Wall Street donors  could really come back to bite herClinton explained her connection to Wall Street by tying her relationship to her role in helping to rebuild New Yorks financial district after the 911 attacksTwitter was ablaze Saturday night over the response and the Republican National Committee was quick to blast out a bestof compilation of political observers reactionsClinton at one point said she is from the 60s  a moment in the debate that could be replayed in political ads down the line suggesting she is part of the past not the future of American leadershipThe debate Saturday night began with the candidates pausing on stage taking a moment of silence to remember the victims of the terrorist attacks that ripped Paris apart just a day earlierClinton said while our prayers are with the people of France tonightthat is not enough and called for better coordinated efforts to root out ISIS the radical group that claimed responsibilityShe said Americans should see the terrorist attack as a reminder that the election is not only about electing a president its also about choosing our next commander in chiefSanders made brief note of the terrorist attacks at the top of his opening statement but quickly pivoted to the core message of the campaign a rigged economy that benefits billionairesStill Sanders made a bold claim in his reference to Paris Together leading the world this country will rid our planet of this barbarist sic organization called ISISAnd OMalley after saying his heart goes out to the people of France in this moment of loss quickly called for fresh thinking and new approaches  a definitive nod to his youth and the generational contrast the 52yearold offers to Clintons 68 years and Sanders 74All three candidates refused to say the fight was with radical Islam instead focusing on using the word jihadist to describe the threats spotlighted in the Paris attacks6 OMalley gets a zinger then shrinks awayBut OMalley also missed a couple of key moments where he could have shinedHis central contention is that its time for a new generation of leadership  meaning no more baby boomers like Clinton But he lacked a strong convincing response to one of the debates final questions When have you been most tested in your life and how did it prepare you for the presidencyOMalleys response conceded that he is untested  that nothing hes been through as mayor of Baltimore or governor of Maryland comes close to the crises he would face as PresidentTrump later responded to OMalleys insult on Twitter by calling him a clown
