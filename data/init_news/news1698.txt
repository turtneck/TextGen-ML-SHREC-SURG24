Waking Times If the matrix gives you Trumpocalypse then use secret alchemical means to create matrixshifting Trumpocalyptic lemonade  Rob Brezsny When people asked Carl Jung who actually met Hitler how he manipulated the psyche of the German people Jung replied Hitler didnt manipulate the psyche of the German people he was the psyche of the German people If as Mark Twain said History does not repeat itself but it rhymes and youre still wondering how this racist xenophobic authoritarian climatesciencedenying misogynistic grabthembythepussy candidate somehow made his way into the presidency then look no further than a mirror For far too long you have given into the idea that an authority will save you You were under the delusion that you needed someone to rule over you That delusion has led to someone who just so happens to want to rule over you Are you really that surprised If youre not careful your own Stockholm syndrome will have you thinking the state is moral and just and wants to empower you to be free It doesnt Its the complete opposite in fact It wants you to remain blindly subservient to its outdated laws and its chain of obedience which leads right up the immoralladen ladder to the president who holds the violent monopoly on power This isnt about who won the presidency This is not about bipartisan fuckery This is about the illegitimacy of any presidency ever  This is about the illegitimacy of authority and the immoral nature of entrenched power The state is unhealthy unsustainable immoral and violent and who ever rules over it is thereby illegitimate whether its the orangeheaded spoonfed baby of a man FrankenTrump vomiting hate and racism through narcissistic ignorant misogynistic and bigoted bully tactics or the status quo queen Killary Clinton spewing Military Industrial Complex rhetoric from her plutocratic pulpit backed by greedy corporations from Wall Street calling themselves persons backed by even greedier corrupt banksters with their vampiretentacles in every countrys pie As Larken Rose said The only us versus them that matters is not about race religion nationality or income level it is about aggressors and their victims 1 They Sheepishly Assume They Need Someone to Rule Over Them A man is no less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years  Lysander Spooner Its not your fault really You were born and raised in a culture that conditioned and brainwashed you into believing that you must answer to someone From your authoritarian upbringing to your indoctrinated school years you were propagandized and persuaded into thinking people are inherently bad so they must be led by people who are somehow not bad Huh Heres the thing people are for the most part a product of their environment Weve all been programmed to be kowtowing statists by an extremely unhealthy unsustainable immoral and violent state To break the cycle we must break our addiction to being ruled over by such a state We must reprogram our programming Unlearn what we have learned Recondition the precondition Its time to rise up and become an author of self selfauthority This is your life not your parents life not your peers life not your states life As Eliezer Yudkowsky said You are personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society you grew up in It begins by admitting that you need neither masters no rulers neither president nor queen to rule over you It begins by empowering yourself and taking responsibility for your own power 2 They Falsely Assume Leadership Means Rulership I find it extremely liberating to see that I was the cause of all my problems With this realization I have also learned I am my own solution This is the great big gift of personal accountability When we stop blaming external forces and own up to our responsibility we become the ultimate creators of our destiny Jenna Galbut Contrary to popular statist dogma it is possible to have rules cosmic law Golden Rule nonaggression principle without the need for rulers and masters Through bottomup leadership as opposed to topdown leadership It begins by not being an ignorant statist who gives hisher power to a tyrannical state It begins by speaking your own truth to power and then becoming a leader of your own It begins by being proactive with the power youve wrestled back from the state and then leading by example It begins by realizing that nobody no president no king not even God can give you permission to be free In fact every single president from Washington to Trump only had power because people believed it Without that petty belief they were nothing more than charismatic fallible men You and you alone must become a freedom unto yourself And that may require a little revolt Especially if you discover that youre not so well adjusted to a profoundly sick society As Niels Bohr said Every valuable human being must be a radical and a rebel for what he must aim at is to make things better than they are 3 They Ignorantly Assume Voting and Taxation are Moral and Just If taxation without consent is robbery the United States government has never had has not now and is never likely to have a single honest dollar in its treasury If taxation without consent is not robbery then any band of robbers have only to declare themselves a government and all their robberies are legalized Lysander Spooner Taxation without consent is immoral There is no way to wriggle out of this profound truth Its especially immoral in a state where violence is threatened if you do not consent Most nave statists assume they must pay taxes in order to live freely When really its the exact opposite of that Youre only free if youre able to choose to pay taxes or not without the threat of violence or imprisonment hanging over your head Otherwise its just soft slavery Deep down were all anarchists We know inherently and instinctively that all transactions should be voluntary Weve just been programmed to make an exception for the state Voting is indirectly violent as the result directly forces majority rule on the minority who did not consent Voting is a profound futility an egregious gamble As Robert Rorschach said If the outcome of a vote is unknown then voting is tantamount to gambling If the outcome of a vote is known then voting is futile Most nave statists have been conditioned to believe that voting is the only way to change things that one must do it from the inside Nothing could be further from the truth Real change only occurs outside the doingthingsoverandoveragainandexpectingdifferentresults ballot box No matter what youre only ever going to get a puppet popping out Trump just happens to be the latest jackinthebox albeit orange ugly and dumb 4 They Blindly Assume Their Nation State is the Greatest Nation State Dont believe yourself and dont believe anyone else If you dont believe what is not true will dissolve in front of your eyes Only what is true will remain because what is true doesnt need anyone to believe it  Don Miguel Ruiz Men never act so contentedly and conveniently evil as when they do so from a patriotic conviction With hypernationalized perspectives whipping their brains into xenophobic scrambled eggs and borderworshipping divisiveness cutting them off from any authentic engagement with the rest of the world statists are the new dogmatists They are brainwashed extremists worshiping law and order power and violence and grossly outdated notions of how to be a flourishing human in an everchanging world They assume waiving a flag is an honorable thing When flags are nothing more than propagandized bits of colored cloth that governments use first to shrinkwrap peoples minds and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury the dead  Arundhati Roy  Flags dont unite us as Belfast surmised they only reinforce our false sense of entitlement to lands we were born into by sheer chance And yet the inured statist myopically moos ignorantly sneering at other nations from a platform of convictions gotten at secondhand and without examination from authorities who have had their own convictions spoonfed to them by parochial forefathers who themselves didnt have the courage to question the legitimacy of authority As Mark Twain cryptically stated To create man was a fine and original idea but to add the sheep was a tautology Indeed Avoid the tautology and the Trumpocalypse Progressively evolve Liberate yourself from the outdated illreasoning that you ever needed a chain of obedience let alone a president 5 They Tragically Assume Violence is the Answer Like all great ideas anarchism is pretty simple when you get down to it human beings are at their best when they are living free of authority deciding things among themselves rather than being ordered about Clifford Harper This is by far the worst of the five outdated assumptions The fact that people still think that peace comes from waging war is mindboggling to those of us who have freed ourselves from the state and discovered empathy and compassion from our interdependence with each other as free human beings in solidarity with leaving a healthy world for our children Its simple really To become a better human all you need is a simplified perspective Your birth place Earth your race Human your politics Freedom your spirituality Love Its so easy its stupid All it requires is a shedding of your statist skin and a transformation into a free human being who seeks to free others from the sickness of statism The only way all of us win is through horizontal democracy thats void of centralized government In other words no masters no rulers In short democratic anarchy The Mohawk Onondaga Oneida Cayuga Seneca and Tuscarora peoples did it through the Iroquois Confederacy living in authentic democracy for hundreds of years before the tyranny of the state ruined everything So its not some farfetched utopian dream If they did it so can we Democratic anarchy combined with the nonviolent nonaggression principle  has the potential to usher in an age of peace and a progressively sustainable evolution for our species Read more articles by Gary Z McGee  About the Author Gary Z McGee  a former Navy Intelligence Specialist turned philosopher is the author of Birthday Suit of God and The Looking Glass Man  His
