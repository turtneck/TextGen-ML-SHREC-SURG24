The wife of the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting on American soil could face criminal charges if investigators conclude that she knew of the attack in advance but failed to warn policeNoor Zahi Salman told that FBI that her husband Omar Mateen had said he was going out to see friends but she feared he was going to attack a gay nightclub NBC News reported on Wednesday She tried to talk him out of it but did not contact law enforcement agenciesWielding an AR15style semiautomatic rifle and a handgun Mateen opened fire at the Pulse club in Orlando Florida early on Sunday in a threehour shooting rampage and hostage siege that ended when a Swat team smashed its way in and killed him There were 49 people killed and 53 were injuredAngus King a member of the Senate intelligence committee which received a briefing on the attack told CNN It appears she Salman had some knowledge of what was going on She definitely is I guess you would say a person of interest right now and appears to be cooperating and can provide us with some important informationPeter King chairman of the House homeland security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism told MSNBC If its true that she did know that it was going to happen and she tried to talk him out of it then its possible criminal action could be taken against her and again there might be more involvement by her so all that has to be investigatedThe possibility that Mateen 29 did not act alone but received support from other individuals or groups is now central to the FBIs inquiry King added If theres anybody else that he was dealing with anyone else he was talking with anyone else who may have known about this this is all where the investigation is going nowMedia reports also suggested that Salman was with her husband when he bought ammunition and a holster She allegedly told the FBI that she once drove him to Pulse nearly a twohour drive from their home in Fort Pierce Florida because he wanted to scope it out Mateen is said to have browsed militant Islamist material on the internet for at least two years before the mass shootingAs detectives tried to piece together Mateens last movements on Saturday night Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer who opened a family assistance centre in a stadium on Wednesday said What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locationsThe FBI director James Comey has said the agency is trying to determine whether Mateen had recently visited Disney World one of the Orlandos celebrated theme parks to consider it as a potential targetDisney which is donating 1m to an official fund for victims of the shooting installed metal detectors last December but declined to comment on the Mateen case A spokesperson said Unfortunately weve all been living in a world of uncertainty and we have been increasing our security measures across our properties for some time adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers additional canine units and law enforcement officers on site as well as less visible systems that employ stateoftheart security technologiesSalman will be key to the ongoing investigation as conflicting narratives emerge including evidence he had been influenced by militant Islamist ideas and reports he might have struggled with his own sexual identityA survivor of the massacre Patience Carter suggested on Tuesday that Mateen had an overt political motive Cowering in a bathroom she heard him demand that Americans stop bombing his country and pledge allegiance to Islamic State she saidCarter 20 who is African American told reporters at Florida Hospital He even spoke to us directly in the bathroom He said Are there any black people in here I was too afraid to answer but there was an African American male in the stall where the majority of my body was who had answered and he said Yes there are about six or seven of us and the gunman responded back to him and said You know I dont have a problem with black people This is about my country You guys suffered enoughThe account chimed with previous FBI statements that Mateen had called the 911 emergency service and made reference to both Isis and the Tsarnaev brothers who were responsible for the Boston bombings Investigators have said Mateen was probably selfradicalised and there is no evidence that he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as IsisMateen also called a local 24hour cable news channel News 13 the station revealed on its website on Wednesday Matthew Gentili who was the producer on duty at the time recalled that Mateen said Im the shooter Its me I am the shooter  I did it for Isis I did it for the Islamic StateSoon after the attack Mateens father indicated that his son had strong antigay feelings He recounted an incident when his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami while out with his wife and young sonSeveral media reports quoted men as saying they had seen Mateen at Pulse many times or that he had contacted them via gay dating apps such as Grindr and Jackd But Pulse denied that he had ever been a patron Untrue and totally ridiculous spokeswoman Sara Brady said in an email to ReutersMateens exwife Sitora Yusufiy told CNN she did not know if he was gay but added Well when we had gotten married he confessed to me about his past that was recent at that time and that he very much enjoyed going to clubs and the nightlife and there was a lot of pictures of himI feel like its a side of him or a part of him that he lived but probably didnt want everybody to know aboutAsked by the Guardian about rumours his son was gay Mateens father Seddique Mateen said Its not true Why if he was gay would he do thisSeddique Mateen declined to comment specifically on the investigation on Wednesday saying The FBI they always do a professional job and to the maximum extent of my ability I will support themMateen investigated twice by the FBI was on the governments terrorist watchlist for 10 months before being taken off G4S the security company that employed Mateen only psychologically evaluated him once at the start of his nineyear employment with the company and not again after the company was made aware he had been interviewed by the FBIThirtythree people remain in hospital including six in critical condition On Tuesday the first of the seriously injured to speak of their trauma was Angel Colon at the Orlando Regional Medical Center Hes shooting everyone thats already dead on the floor making sure theyre dead he said speaking from a wheelchair I look over and he shoots the girl next to me And Im just there laying down and Im thinking Im next Im deadSo I dont know how but by the glory of God he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip I had no reaction I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he wont know that Im aliveThe attending trauma surgeon on call that night Dr Chadwick Smith said It was singularly the worst day of my career and the best day of my career And I think you can say that of pretty much every person standing up hereThe atrocity continued to reverberate in Washington DC where Senate Democrats demanded tighter gun controls Donald Trump the Republican presumptive nominee broke ranks with the party by saying he would meet the influential National Rifle Association lobbying group which has endorsed him to discuss an idea for restricting gun purchases by people on terrorism watchlistsBarack Obama who will visit Orlando on Thursday launched a blistering assault against Trump over the candidates antiMuslim rhetoric which the president described as dangerous and contrary to American valuesWhere does this stop The Orlando killer one of the San Bernardino killers the Fort Hood killer they were all US citizens Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently  Putting them under surveillance
