The Clinton campaign reacted with yet another ad featuring Trumps own wordsthis time disparaging veterans and their families The antiTrump Priorities USA SuperPAC went even further witha new spot that shows Trump saying I love warTrumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conwayrespondedby saying the bizarre comment was taken out of context but the full quote which he gave last November ata wild Fort Dodge Iowa rallythe same one where he called Ben Carson a child molester is even worse than what it sounds like in the adTrump has never been in the service althoughhe has saidI always felt I was in the military because of his education at a militarythemed boarding school and he believes he has more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the militaryThat comment Im good at war says everything about Trump as he demonstrated last night at the town hall forum that he is indeed unfit to be president of the United States There were many aspects of his performance that had people gasping at the mere idea of this man in a position of real power not the least of which was his comment that President Barack Obama compares unfavorably to Russian President Vladimir Putin who has an 85 percent approval rating and is very much a leader because he has strong control over his countryBut it was around the question of ISIS and the Middle East where he really showed his true colors He was upset that Hillary Clinton had earlier claimed that he had lied when he said he had been against the Iraq War and defended himself by pointing to an Esquire magazine article from 2004  which doesnt really help since the war began in the spring of 2003 The factcheckers have declared hispants are on fire numerous timeson this but he just keeps saying itLast night he also made a passing reference to someone asking him about Iraq 14 years ago and you may be surprised to learn that atthat same crazy Iowa rally he told the crowd that a delegation fromthe White Housecame to him to ask his opinion and he advised not to go inbecause it would destabilize the region To the best of my knowledge this claim has never been validated Its possible of course this was the Bush administration But lets just say that its as likely as Trumps witnessing thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheering after 911Youll knock the hell out of one and the other one is going to come and take over the other You dont have to be a genius to figure this out even though I am a genius And by the way Im more militaristic than anybody in this room Im going to make our military so strong so powerful Everyone seems to think that Trump has pivoted from his position that he could not reveal his plan to defeat ISIS to his announcement today that he would give the generals 30 days from the inauguration to come up with one But thats wrong Trumps secret plan is not so secret At that same rally last fall Trump spoke about it plainly I know more about ISIS than the generals do Believe me   I would bomb theshitout of em   Id blow up the pipes Id blow up the  Id blow up every single inch There would be nothing left And you know what you get Exxon to come in there and in two months  you ever see these guys how good they are The great oil companies Theyll rebuild that sucker brandnew Itll be beautiful And Id bring it and Id take the oil At the forum he reiterated this belief that America should take the oil because he thinks this will make ISIS surrender and has taken to saying to the victor goes the spoils apparently unaware that this is a considered a war crime He has said in the past it would require a permanent force to protect the oil but that it wouldnt take much Trump said that under Obama and Clintons leadership the generals have been reduced to rubble and reduced to a point where its embarrassing for our country He sounded as if he planned to fire some of them which isnt actually something the president can do As he is wont to do he brought up his favorite GeneralGeorge Patton saying that hes spinning in his grave over the state of affairs in the military The good news is that he didnt bring up General Black Jack Pershing and endorse mass executions with bullets dipped in pigs blood as he often does on the trail He maintained that he still believes in his own plan for Iraq and says he wont necessarily follow the generals advice So the GOP nominee for commander in chief tells people that hes good at war has had a lot of wars of his own and loves war in a certain way despite never having been in the military He also believes hes a genius who is more militaristic than anyone in the room His plan to defeat ISIS is to blow up the Iraqi oil wells and have Exxon come in and rebuild them And he believes that half the military leadership are fools and thinks he can just fire the ones he doesnt like But theres nothing delusional about any of that so theres no need to concern yourselves that the pollnumbersare tightening If he happens to pull this off what could go wrong
