Sponsors say that the shootings in Garland Texas confirm their view of Islam as violenceprone But critics say the event was designed to be incendiary and to poison relations at a volatile timeWhen Pamela Geller and her controversial organization the American Freedom Defense Initiative announced it would hold a cartoon contest in Garland Texas their plan to satirize and lampoon the founder of Islam was intended to have both a defiant and provocative freespeech edgeSundays contest and its 10000 prize were prompted in part by the ParisCharlie Hebdo massacre in January Ms Geller said in March as well as the riots in Muslim countries sparked by the publication of satirical antiMuhammad cartoons by a Danish newspaper in 2005 And indeed as if on cue two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday nightThe incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught  with protests against Muslims in Texas and antiMuslim socialmedia attacks after the release of the film American Sniper In that context Gellers actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatredIt is an issue Geller has faced beforeTwo weeks ago she won a federal freespeech case against New Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority which had refused to put up one of her ads Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah  a quotethe ad attributes to Hamas MTVGellers organization has often clashed with officials in other cities including Philadelphia and Washington over their incendiary ads some of which compare Islam to Nazism In 2012 another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read In any war between the civilized man and the savage support the civilized man Support Israel Defeat JihadMany supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violenceprone religion But for others her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile timeAnd coming as it did right when we the United States of America are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together I can see this potentially aggravating the alreadychallenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference diversity and what kind of society we want to be says Gordon Coonfield director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near PhiladelphiaAfter analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiatives Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for Der Ewige Jude or The Eternal Jew a notorious Nazi propaganda documentaryIn one of the cartoons the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hooknosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife The caption reads When it comes to religion  Ive got the edge The face Coonfield notes is nearly identical to the contorted face of The Eternal Jew posterThat strategy for creating a sense of unity by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture he says Its ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used and the Nazis have become famous for using  propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst  so its kind of ironic that shes trying to link some of these things together when that is in fact her messageDespite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on SundayHer words are not just free speech says Linda Sarsour executive director of the Arab American Association of New York They are inciteful they incite hate against our whole community I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland Texas but at the same time Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that were in right nowShe intentionally put that event together in hopes that shed get the response that she received Ms Sarsour saysWe prayed but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her she added Muslim leaders specifically told people do not go anywhere near her Let her do whatever she does We dont care And there was no protesting outside  unfortunately except for these two guys from Arizona who were already on the radar of the FBI anywayAdvocates have tried to counter Gellers free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone In 2012 a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her support the civilized man poster with an opposing message that read In the choice between love and hate choose love Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighborsAnd last week the makers of the satirical film The Muslims Are Coming launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Gellers The Muslims are coming and they shall strike with hugs so fierce youll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love herBut in an era in which the Islamic State the Tsarnaev trial and the lingering aftermath of 911 still inflame fears about Islam many worry that Sundays violence will exacerbate the current tensionsFree speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most that you disagree with the most and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric Coonfield says This cant become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it without resorting to this kind of craziness
