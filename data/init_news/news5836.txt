Charities with ties to Hillary Clinton will refile at least five tax returns after errors in how donations from foreign governments were disclosed according to a published reportReuters reported early Thursday that the errors on form 990s includeunderreporting or overreporting by millions of dollars the amounts donated by foreign governments as well as not disclosing the donations as separate from total revenue Reuters also reported that officials may audit other returns filed by the Clinton Foundation as far back as 15 years ago in the event of more errors being foundThe report will likely add a new layer of scrutiny to the foundation which has been criticized by Republicans and ethics experts for its ongoing ties to several foreign governments during the early stages of Hillary Clintons run for the 2016 Democratic nominationAccording to Reuters the discrepancies are not evidence of wrongdoing in and of themselves but they do undermine the 990s purpose of holding charities accountable for their funding and expendituresFor example between 2010 and 2012 the Clinton Foundation claimed on tax forms that it had not received any money from either the US or foreign governments In fact several foreign governments gave the foundation tens of millions of dollars which was noted on the foundations updating donor listIn addition Reuters reports the Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI will refile its Form 990s for 2012 and 2013 after failing to note government grants in a separate section from total revenue CHAI had previously refiled returns from 2010 and 2011 for overreporting the amount received in government grants by over 100 millionHillary Clinton resigned from the Clinton Foundations board earlier this month ahead of announcing her presidential candidacy though her husband and daughter both remain directorsClick for more from Reuters
