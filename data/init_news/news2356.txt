Pinterest There have been plenty of stories of voter fraud across the country but a photoshopped picture has taken the internet by storm In it Donald Trumps name is left off of the ballot whil Hillary Clintons is listed twice The doctored photo hit Twitter and has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times Take a look at the picture for yourself  Hatrick Penry HatrickPenry October 24 2016 Hey guys seriously How is this not viral yet Are we going to be taken as that stupid and let it go This is an Oregon Ballot pictwittercom4eSSrK3aaB  Curt Schilling gehrig38 October 27 2016 About an hour after John Laussier started the hoax he took responsibility for it and admitted that it wasnt real In case its not super obvious that last tweet from me is a hoax Dont believe everything you read on the internet folks Is Trump on the Oregon ballot YES But a hoax grabbed a lot of retweets today Official sample ballot  httpstcoLR1smKW2pO pictwittercomWvMIhyzUHz  KVAL News KVALnews October 21 2016 Im hoping people figure out soon this was fake and in the future look at what theyre passing on Laussier told KATU  Weve got to act responsibly Get out your ballots take a good hard look and vote with some research Laussier told KATU that it was irresponsible of me to post the tweet and he apologized LawNewz reported  The Oregon Secretary of States Office told KGQ that they are evaluating whether the hoax violated election law Spokesperson Molly Woon emphasized to the television station that the Oregon Secretary of State is confident in the election process While Laussier makes a good point about people being discerning about what they share on the internet there are a couple of important points here First there is good reason for people to be vigilant about voter fraud  There are numerous reports of the problem across the country and its good that people are paying attention Second the mainstream media is largely in the tank for Clinton and operates as a propaganda machine Most people dont have the time  or if they do dont have the resources  to thoroughly vet something they come across You know who has both The media but they refuse to do so because of their bias If this ballot was real people may have been able to force change by bringing light to what would have been a serious problem That certainly doesnt mean that people shouldnt be discerning or that they should repost or retweet everything they come across Theres something to be said for people being vigilant paying attention and forcing those in the media and those in positions to do something about it to take a look Now that doesnt mean that people should automatically believe that somethings true and adjust their beliefsvoting decision because of it it just means that its good that people are paying attention and forcing those in a position to check it out to do so While Laussiers tweet was an interesting experiment the timing was poor given the rampant voter fraud going on throughout the country This was a hoax but there are plenty of instances where it isnt and people shouldnt be discouraged from being vigilant about it
