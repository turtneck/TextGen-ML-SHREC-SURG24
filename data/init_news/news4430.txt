In the television age running for president is automatically assumed to be a good thingeven as a long shotYou boost your profile Youre on stage for the big debates Cable bookers keep calling Your howtosaveAmerica book sells better Profile writers track down your elementary school teacher And even if you wash out early there are consolation prizes A Cabinet post A running mate selection A college presidency A cable gigThis is true even for those who dont have a prayer of winning the White House Without running Hillary Clinton never would have been secretary of State Joe Biden Al Gore and George HW Bush would never have been VP Mike Huckabee wouldnt have had a Fox show and Al Sharpton wouldnt be on MSNBCIn all honesty what else have they got to doThis is a challenge for the media who have trouble covering campaigns as packed as a Manhattan subway train Especially this year when the Republican field could actually top 20far too many candidates to fit on a debate stage or to include in a twominute evening news reportBut maybe my working thesis that presidential publicity is on balance a good thing misses an important point As conservative columnist Matt Lewis writes in the Daily BeastI suspect we tend to underestimate the downside of running for president Lets consider the 2012 GOP field which included Rick Perry Jon Huntsman Michele Bachmann Rick Santorum Herman Cain Ron Paul Newt Gingrich and of course Mitt Romney And to recap Perry said oops Huntsmans campaign never took off and he lost his ambassadorship to China Bachmann isnt even in Congress today Santorum hardwon second place finish hasnt set him up well for 2016 Cain was ripped apart after a sex scandal Paul and Bachmann had serious issues with the FEC andNewt lost his think tank  You tell meare they better off now than they were four years agoWell its true that if you selfdestruct like Herman Cain under the weight of sexual harassment allegations there are negative consequences On the other hand everyone has now heard of Herman Cain and he landed a big radio show Better than being an obscure former pizza executive noRick Santorum won respect for winning 11 states and is running again Newt Gingrich sort of redeemed himself years after being toppled as House speaker and got a CNN contract Rick Perry isnt so damaged that hes not running again Mitt Romney is such an elder statesman that many in the party begged him to run a third time and thought better of it once he began seriously considering itEven Jon Huntsman became a national figure and charmed the media elite and his daughter landed a spot on MSNBCBut Lewis insists on accentuating the negative especially people who have to give up a job to runlike say a Fox News gig And if you have a positiveor possibly inflatedreputation youll likely watch that evaporate as well Even if the opposition researchers and the media dont get you see Herman Cain theres a chance that youll slip up amid the sleep deprivation and the glare of cameras and bright lights Theres always the potential you could be exposed as someone who isnt as charismatic or knowledgeable as everyone suspectedIn fact its pretty easy to leave the impression that youre kind of dumbBut in America its more important to be famousLets take the trio that jumped into the GOP race this weekBen Carson was a worldrenowned surgeon and Fox News contributor before gearing up for his presidential bid He has made some comments equating ObamaCare with slavery saying straight men come out of prison gay that have not exactly enhanced his reputation But as a serious AfricanAmerican contender for the Republican nomination he will greatly benefit from the exposure in any future endeavorCarly Fiorina was previously known mainly for getting fired as HewlettPackards CEO and losing a Senate race to Barbara Boxer She has won plaudits for her fledgling presidential campaign especially her pointed attacks on Hillary and now has the firstname recognition that most corporate executives never achieveMike Huckabee was living the good life hosting a Saturday night Fox show and doing national radio commentaries after his 2008 run But the former Arkansas governor wants to prove that his success in winning the Iowa caucuses last time wasnt a fluke Now hell have his chanceNone of them are going to be lacking for employment if this presidential thing doesnt work outBut theres one more aspect that gets overlooked Most people who run for president have a set of ideas they want to push into the national square Bernie Sanders knows hell never be president but his ultraliberal views will get far more attention than if he had passed up the race against Hillary These candidates want to influence the debate and theres nothing like a presidential forum for accomplishing thatThey wont all get much media oxygen once the field is complete But its better than gasping for air on the sidelinesClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz
