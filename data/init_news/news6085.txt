Why I Wont Vote for Hillary Clinton  Evan Edinger but then he changes his mind on that TO CLOSE  Evan Edlinger will vote for Hillary against Trump because he thinks that whereas Hillarys actual trackrecord of policies not mere statements in public office have been horrific Trumps bad statements and lack of any trackrecord in public office at all make Trump even worse Thats what he thinks I think it makes Trump better  the better choice  as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official Hillary Clinton Edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official to no record as a public official Edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions One is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements versus actual political policies carried out as a public official which show Hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of Wall Street and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a persons private or business affairs versus a bad record as an actual public official Only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying  and thats Clinton not Trump who has a horrific record as a public official Trump has no record at all as a public official Edlinger at 130 in his video says that when he contemplates voting for HillaryTheres always one thing that comes in the way and thats trust He says he doesnt trust her  but what he doesnt actually trust is her words when he says hell vote for her hes simply ignoring her actions hes ignoring the real personasapublicofficial the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever Proven selfishness in ones private life is bad but proven selfishness and evil in ones publicoffice policies such as We came we saw he died Ha ha  is utterly disqualifying I argued in my Im a Bernie Sanders Voter Heres Why Ill Vote Trump  that Trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive President but even if he turns out to be a bad President he wont on balance be as horrific as will a President Hillary Clinton With Trump there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world with Clinton there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors  About the author Investigative historian Eric Zuesse is the author most recently of Theyre Not Even Close The Democratic vs Republican Economic Records  19102010 and of CHRISTS VENTRILOQUISTS The Event that Created Christianity  NOTE The Greanville Post editors have a clear position on this socalled election If you MUST vote vote Green for the Jill Stein Ajamu Baraka ticket as a PROTEST VOTE If that is not possible in your area do not bother to vote as all votes serve to legitimate a fraudulent process and the ongoing reign of the corporatemilitarymedia complex SUBSCRIBE TODAY NOTHING TO LOSE EVERYTHING TO GAIN free  safe  invaluable If you appreciate our articles do the right thing and let us know by subscribing Its free and it implies no obligation to you ever We just want to have a way to reach our most loyal readers on important occasions when their input is necessary In return you get our email newsletter compiling the best of The Greanville Post several times a week emailsubscribers namefieldYES desc groupPublic NOTE ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS NOT THE AUTHORS Print this post if you want Share This
