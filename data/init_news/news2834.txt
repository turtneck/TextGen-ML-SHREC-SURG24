Predictions are dangerous things That said heres a prediction for you John Harwood will never again participate in a GOP debate Republicans are beyond angry about the conduct of the CNBC moderators  Harwood Carl Quintanilla and Becky Quick  during Wednesday nights primary debate Actually more than one Republican asked me before the debate what I thought of Harwood as a moderator Ive known John for forever and I admit to breaking out in a mild cold sweat whenever I was told he was holding on the phone But I thought of him as a mostly fairminded smart reporter even if Ive also always thought of him as one of them as far as Republican thinking goes Generally I dont think there is anything wrong with having an adversarial group of moderators ask good questions But the moderators approach to this debate was beyond properly adversarial and was probably a gamechanger in more ways than one After every election the parties tweak the debate process and change the rules to one degree or another You can bet the old paradigm of turning over management of the debates to a specific media organization  especially one with a reputation for an antiRepublican bias  is going to endSen Ted Cruz RTex who had a breakthrough moment in the debate railing against the moderators insulting questions did a followup interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier and reiterated a pretty good suggestion about the debate structure Cruz asked why the Republican National Committee doesnt plan at least one debate with Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity and Mark Levin as moderators Well thats not a bad idea Its easy to suggest that the moderators should be at least neutralso they dont simply offer up a series of softball questions that dont challenge the candidates or put them outside of their comfort zones But the words Rush Limbaugh and softball questions have never been used in the same sentence I dont think this group of Republican candidates would ever feel coddled by Limbaugh Hannity and Levin That trio would all ask tough questions that are of real interest to Republican voters And I think it would be a ratings juggernaut Anyway Cruz is right  the moderators in the Democratic primary debate praised the candidates and avoided creating too much fighting or tension among the candidates Theres a big difference between a moderator asking probing questions that Republican voters want to know the answers to and taking pot shots and making belittling points under the guise of asking a questionAfter all this is the Republican primary contest and we have a big field of talented candidates Theres nothing wrong with asking questions that are central to Republican concerns and sensibilities The primaries should be all about Republicans asking other Republicans questions The debacle of the CNBC debate was probably the last gasp of the grandstanding liberal media as far as the GOPs managers are concerned The media will no longer be allowed to conduct debates the way they think their likeminded colleagues in the media want a Republican debate to be conducted Or in this case the way they think their likeminded colleagues in the media want the Republican primary process to be belittled disrupted and generally diminishedThat being said the GOP shouldnt overdo it in crying foul about the debate We dont need a Warren Commission and we dont need to get bogged down and look like a bunch of whiners Republicans should not be distracted by the process We are complaining that the debate wasnt about the issues so lets have our say but then move on and start discussing the issues that Republican voters care about
