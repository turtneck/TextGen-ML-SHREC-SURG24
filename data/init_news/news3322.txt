CNN The shootings main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed Outside of that the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblanceSo whats changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri in August and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston South Carolina last weekend And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incidentIts tough to say for sure but here are some of the stark differences in the cases the lessons learned by both police and the public and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the futureFerguson Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilsons gun and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts  often conflicting  of where Wilson was where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officerNorth Charleston Though its unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone its 100 clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran awayTakeaway Where Browns killing was a breeding ground for speculation  with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain  no such debate has emerged in the Scott shootingIt would be tough to extrapolate for certain but its possible that the clearcut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilsons fate dragged on for monthsNorth Charleston Its closer to an even split here with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47 black and 42 white The makeup of the citys police department is unclear though its been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 black Three of the 10 City Council members are blackTakeaway The ratio of white and black officers on the North Charleston Police Department appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the Ferguson Police Department but both are considerably off As for the city councils the latest election in Ferguson makes its governing body more representative than North CharlestonsBut before you place too much emphasis on the percentages there are other variables to consider like policing methods as CNN political commentator Marc Lamont Hill pointed out Changing the racial makeup of a department alone wont do the trick if officers arent taught the best practicesBlack people didnt march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us he said I want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly We need communitybased policing if were going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoodsNorth Charleston Its unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness Feidin Santana Even North Charlestons police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of Scotts shootingNot only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as hes running away it also shows him placing a darkcolored object next to Scotts lifeless bodyThat could be significant because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser and he feared for his life But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scotts body was actually the Taser Slager could be accused of planting evidenceIf there is no video folks dont believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country she said But with a video you cant say its not happeningNorth Charleston After Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend protests in North Charleston have been peaceful so farThe takeaway Some Ferguson residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way North Charleston is handling its own tragedy Lee Smith who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a Ferguson City Council seat said he was glad to see authorities in South Carolina charge Slager with murderI am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in Ferguson Smith saidFerguson It took Ferguson police six days to publicly identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting thenpolice chief Thomas Jackson decided not to visit Browns family And rather than charge Wilson and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit  as many civil rights advocates wanted  the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officerNorth Charleston Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday two days after Santana shared his video with Scotts family Mayor Keith Summey denounced the shooting and said Slager made a bad decision Both Summey and the police chief also visited Scotts familyWhen youre wrong youre wrong he said And if you make a bad decision  dont care if youre behind the shield or just a citizen on the street  you have to live by that decisionThe takeaway Former Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher said the city has influenced othersI think these situations are given much more scrutiny now said Fletcher who won a seat on Fergusons city council this week They have seen what has happened here in Ferguson Every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they doFerguson After Browns death in August many asked why Wilson didnt have a body camera The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels Three months later President Barack Obama pledged 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50000 police officersNorth Charleston Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott But after the shooting the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras so every officer on the street in the city will have one Thats in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered Summey saidBut National Urban League President Marc Morial said more body cameras will help protect not just the public but also policeI think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis its going to protect good officers who do the right thing Morial said But its also going to ferret out if you will bad actions by bad officers
