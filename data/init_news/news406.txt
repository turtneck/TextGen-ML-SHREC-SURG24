When Scott Walker pronounced himself agnostic about President Obamas patriotism and Christian faith it must have seemed like a clever formulation Ive never asked him so I dont know he said And about Obamas Christianity Ive never asked him thatWalker quickly found his pitch unequal to the presidential big leagues His argument cant be generalized into a rule I have never met Billy Graham for example but Im pretty sure what he believes As political attacks go this one is particularly heavyhanded  the equivalent of saying As far as I know my opponent is not a swindler and a degenerate A politician who tried this form of passive aggression before also got criticized for it During the 2008 Democratic primary fight Hillary Clinton said that Obama was not a Muslim as far as I know  sounding more like one of the wackier speakers at a CPAC conventionFor Walker this is more of a paper cut than a chest wound But for the Republican Party which some Americans associate with religious exclusivity it cant be good for a frontrunner to sound religiously exclusiveWalkers Baptist upbringing  he is the son of a pastor  does put a particular emphasis on the personal acceptance of Christ It was another Baptist governor Jimmy Carter who elevated the idea of being born again into the realm of presidential politics For evangelicals in general there is no such thing as a birthright Christian Faith requires a conscious and highly consequential decision  a choice that some do not makeBut here Obama has been as forthright as anyone could be I am a Christian and I am a devout Christian he said in a 2008 Christianity Today interview I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ I believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life But most importantly I believe in the example that Jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful I didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life I didnt want to walk alone on this journey Accepting Jesus Christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my idealsQuestioning this affirmation involves a serious charge  an accusation of the worst sort of cynicism And it is simply not the role of a Christian layman to publicly dispute the selfidentification of other Christians especially in a political context It is a practice that can lead down ugly alleys of sectarianismSome of course will find the whole idea that human beings can make profoundly consequential religious choices to be foreign And they may find proselytization  the necessary correlate of religious choice  to be offensive But here a little patience might be in order In many cases adult converts have come through low points of addiction humiliation or crisis They believe they have found past the limits of their own strength something extraordinary and undeserved which they can only describe as graceYou may find such converts to be deluded or annoying but there is little doubt that they have had a profound experience that defies adequate metaphor They feel they have been washed by water or refined by fire They have heard a voice in the night or a melody above the noise Things previously thought important  status or wealth  appear vanishingly insignificant They can say with GK ChestertonAnd all these things are less than dust to meBecause my name is Lazarus and I liveIn such cases people amazed by grace are wont to talk about it But this motivation is the opposite of selfrighteous judgment It is gratitude I have known people who after a single moment of transforming trust have spent the rest of their lives in astonished and vocal thankfulnessBut this type of faith by definition is unlikely to publicly judge the faith of others It is founded on recognition of personal limits and failure In the New Testament grace often moves in stealthy and unexpected ways  lavished on lepers Samaritans and tax collectors Perhaps the modern equivalents would be people with HIVAIDS illegal immigrants and  tax collectorsIn any case Christians should not look to the powerful for definitions of orthodoxy  or be proud of an unmerited giftRead more from Michael Gersons archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
