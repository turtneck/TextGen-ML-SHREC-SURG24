A South Korean naval vessel fired five shots as a warning to a North Korean patrol boat that briefly moved south of the countries disputed boundary line in the Yellow Sea Seouls defense ministry said MondayA South Korean military official told the Yonhap news agency that the North Korean vessel retreated northward after the warning shots were fired into the water However the incident underscores the heightened hostilities between the two KoreasThe brief encounter came hours after the United Nations Security Councilcondemned North Koreas launch of a longrange rocket that world leaders described as a banned test of ballistic missile technology and South Koreas president called another intolerable provocationNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un went ahead with the launch just two hours after an eightday window opened early Sunday and a month after the countrys fourth nuclear test He ignored an appeal from China its neighbor and important ally not to proceed and in another slap to Beijing he chose to launch the rocket on the eve of Chinese New Year the countrys most important holidayChina and the United States have been negotiating the text of a new Security Council sanctions resolution since Pyongyangs Jan 6 nuclear test which it claimed was a hydrogen bomb That claim has been met with outside skepticismThe US backed by Japan and South Korea wants tough UN sanctions reflecting Kims defiance of the Security Council But diplomats say China the Norths key protector in the council is reluctant to impose economic measures that could cause North Koreas economy to collapse  and a flight of North Koreans into China across their shared borderThe 15member Security Council strongly condemned the launch and pledged to expeditiously adopt a new resolution with further significant measures  UN code for sanctions The word robust referring to the measures was in an initial draft but was dropped in the final statementUS Ambassador Samantha Power told reporters that it cannot be business as usual after two successive North Korean acts that are hostile and illegalWhats important is that the Security Council unites Power said China is a critical player  We are hopeful that China like all council members will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security see the importance of adopting tough unprecedented measures breaking new ground here exceeding the expectations of Kim Jong UnHe said a new resolution should do the work of reducing tension of working toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula of maintaining peace and stability and of encouraging a negotiated solutionI believe the council needs to work together for a new resolution Liu added indicating that China may want negotiations with the United States to be widenedRussias UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin whose country is also a North Korean ally said It has to be a weighty resolution but it also has to be a reasonable resolution that doesnt lead to North Koreas economic or humanitarian collapse or further heighten tensionsRussias goal is to see sixparty talks aimed at denuclearization resume he said but in the current atmosphere thats unlikely because the North Koreans have been very unreasonable and are challenging the entire international communityWe think this is wrong for their national interests  for the Korean Peninsula  for the region Churkin saidNorth Korea which calls its launches part of a peaceful space program said it had successfully put a new Earth observation satellite the Kwangmyongsong 4 or Shining Star 4 into orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff and vowed more such launches A US official said it might take days to assess whether the launch was a successBut in Pyongyang North Koreans celebrated the launch with an official fireworks display Monday night state broadcaster KCTV reported according to CNNJapans UN ambassador Motohide Yoshikawa told reporters the missile which went over Japan and landed near the Philippines was a clear threat to the lives of many peopleThe Security Council underscored that launches using ballistic missile technology even if characterized as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle contribute to North Koreas development of systems to deliver nuclear weapons and violate four Security Council resolutions dating back to the Norths first nuclear test in 2006North Korea under Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kims governmentIn a development that will worry both Pyongyang
