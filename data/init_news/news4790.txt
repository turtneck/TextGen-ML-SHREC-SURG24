One of the big successes in US policing over the past three decades was the push to make law enforcement more datadriven The big crimetracking system that came out of this CompStat has been widely credited with helping cut crime in the USBut what if this approach has also led police to be too focused on data turning policing into a numbers game in which cops try to make as many arrests as possible and manipulate the figures to look goodJohn Eterno a retired New York City Police Department captain and associate dean and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College explained the problem in a new documentary by FiveThirtyEightInitially I think it was easier to bring down crime because crime was so high Its kind of like squeezing a lemon  when you squeeze a lemon the juice is easy to come out initially But over time its more and more difficult Commanders are under enormous pressures to make sure that the crime numbers go down And then the message filters down to the lower rank If the captains not doing well or the inspectors not doing well were not doing wellThis creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost Officers could achieve this by for example purposely misinterpreting some crimes as nonserious offenses or not counting them altogether That way the mayor and police chief can claim that serious crimes are dropping when in reality some serious offenses are just being defined as nonserious or not counted at allThe numbers game also increases demand on cops to look like theyre doing more to prevent crime So officers are sometimes encouraged to stop or arrest as many people as possible so they can appear as if theyre staying busy while on dutyAnd if some cops dont play along commanders will try to make their lives harder  by for instance putting them on the graveyard shift or denying them promotions Or in one whistleblowers case something much worseThe numbers game became a huge focus for the NYPD over the past few decades And when officer Adrian Schoolcraft tried to expose the abuse the NYPD retaliated  placing Schoolcraft in a psychiatric institution against his will for six daysSchoolcraft used a tape recorder to capture several examples of officers massaging the numbers at the NYPD Here are some examplesBut Schoolcrafts colleagues found out what he was up to One day when he got off work early an emergency service unit came to his apartment abducted him and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric wardAs they detained him police discovered the recorder in Schoolcrafts pocket One highranking official Deputy Chief Michael Marino couldnt believe it Absolutely amazing he said according to the recording When I came on the job a cop would never dream of doing that to another cop for all the money in the worldSchoolcraft later got the recordings to the Village Voice a news weekly that broke the story He is now suing the hospital that held him as well as New York City and the NYPDThe story shows just how deeply ingrained the numbers game can be in some police departments Officers are willing to take down their peers and sometimes friends just to avoid getting caughtI believe they couldnt afford to have someone expose the behavior so bad so criminal it would threaten their careers Schoolcraft told New York Citys ABC 7 in 2010 They reacted out of fear
