Washington CNN The GOPcontrolled House of Representatives passed legislation on Thursday banning all taxpayer money for abortions But that bill was a backup after another proposal to ban socalled late term abortions was suddenly yanked the late Wednesday night because of blow back from moderate Republicans who argued it was too extremeThe bill barring federal taxpayer funds was approved in the last Congress On Thursday it passed 242179 with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans to support the bill GOP Rep Richard Hanna of New York was the one Republican who voted against itEarlier on Thursday the White House promised to veto the legislation if it ended up on the Presidents deskThe vote came as tens of thousands of antiabortion rights activists descended on the National Mall for the annual March for Life Thursdays event coincides with the 42nd anniversary the of the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision which upheld a womans access to abortion based on privacy rights in the ConstitutionRepublican leaders initially planned to pass the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act a bill banning abortion procedures for women who are beyond 20 weeks into their pregnancy A similar version of that bill was approved by the House in 2013But a bloc of female GOP members  led by North Carolina Rep Renee Ellmers  opposed a provision in the bill that provided an exception for women who are raped but required that that they show evidence they filed a police report in order to have access to an abortion These members argued the vast majority of rapes go unreported and some are the result of incest Some male members agreed that provision shouldnt be included and urged leaders to strip it outIm prolife Florida GOP Congressman Carlos Curbelo told reporters on Thursday But he added Im certainly not going to ever put myself in the position where Im telling any woman that their account of a rape is valid or notHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi needled the GOP about the internal spat saying They didnt even have their act togetherAnd she criticized the GOP for spending time on the abortion debate instead of debating measures focused on job creationTheyre putting a bill on the floor that undermines the health of Americas women The bill is worse than the bill they pulled from the floor yesterday Pelosi said in a news conference That affected thousands of women maybe this affects millions of women It not only affects their health it affects the personal decisions of how they spend their own money for health insuranceReligious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions were unhappy with the Republican leaderships decision to cancel the vote on that measureI have nothing but respect for the speaker but this was not the best moment for the House Republicans by far  and happening on the day on the March for life Dr Russell Moore president of the Southern Baptist Conventions Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission told CNNThe latenight decision to pull the bill was a unusual win for more centrist members who argued that the bill sent the wrong message  especially to women and young people  at a time that the party was working to expand its support ahead of the 2016 national electionThis appeared to be messaging bill and the message that was being sent was not a very good one Republican Rep Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said noting that the bill was not going anywhere in the SenateI would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues because that distracts us from broader economic messages where I think we have much greater appeal to the larger public he saidSince Republicans took control of the House in 2011 House Speaker John Boehner has tangled with conservatives on a range of bills and in some cases their opposition has thwarted Boehners legislative agenda After the 2014 midterm election the GOP conference now has 246 members including 22 female members The willingness of many of these members and those who represent competitive districts to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislationThere is a growing sentiment in the conference that we want to move legislation that can make a difference for the American people and not take an infinite number of symbolic votes that might be good for a campaign ad or get people riled up Curbelo told CNNNorth Carolina Republican Rep Richard Hudson who said he wasnt involved in the discussions about the bill said None of us saw it comingHe pointed out that members voted on the same bill last year and said Now there is a concern then there wasntMuch of the criticism from antiabortion rights groups centered on Ellmers Moore said activists at the Match for Life took notice of the North Carolina Republicans roleIve heard the name Renee Ellmers once every 20 seconds this morning on the mall he saidShe issued a statement after Thursdays vote saying she still was still discussing bringing the 20week abortion bill ban bill back to the floorOur goal is to find a way to get this legislation in its best possible form she saidRep Trent Franks of Arizona the author of the bill that didnt get a vote told reporters he was disappointed and said he was confident the measure would have passed He said he didnt question his leaders commitment to fighting for antiabortion rights bills and said he had their word of honor the House would eventually hold a vote on it
