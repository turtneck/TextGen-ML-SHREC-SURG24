A recess appointment to fill the Scalia vacancy would cement the presidents troubling legacy of going it aloneThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia has served to highlight the divisions that characterize so much in WashingtonFirst and foremost the Supreme Court itself has long been as divided as the country itselfSplit 44 with a conservativeleaning swing voter Justice Anthony Kennedy  as a frequent tiebreaker in Scalias absence the court is leftin a dead heat in areas ranging from affirmative action to union dues to abortionScalia wasa critical part of the 54 conservative majority in a litany of major casesHowever it is the division in the Senate that could produce the next constitutional crisisFaced with a refusal of the Republican senators to move forward with a nominee for the court in the last year of the Obama Administration President Obama could use the nuclear option a recess appointment to the Supreme CourtUnder Article II of the US Constitution a president is allowed to temporarily fill vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate I have long been a critic of recess appointments to the judiciary While far less common than appointments to the Executive Branch such appointments have occurred historically including 12 to the Supreme CourtYetjudicial recess appointments undermine the integrity of the courts by using the equivalent of a judicial temp for a position that was meant to be held by a jurist with lifetime tenureThe framers wanted a president and the Senate to come to an accord on such appointments including the need to compromise to achieve such goals Obama however made it clear years ago that he was willing to go it alone when Congress failed to give him legislation or confirmations that he demandedHis unilateral actions have already produced a constitutional crisis over the fundamental guarantees of the separation of powersThis includes a unanimous 2014 decision of the Supreme Court that Obama violated the recess appointments clause in his circumvention of the SenateFor a president who has shown a tendency to go it alone when denied action by Congress a recess appointment may prove an irresistible temptation for ObamaThe Republican leadership has already signaled that it has no intention of moving forward with such a nomination objecting that in 80 years no president has moved such a nomination within his final year in officeWhile there is ample time to vote on a nominee the president could make an appointment if his nominee is denied or if his nominee is left to languish in the Senate Judiciary CommitteeThe Republicans may have unnecessarily tripped the wire by saying that they would not move forward on a nomination as opposed to slow walking and rejectinga nominationThe failure to even consider the nominee could give the president the rationale for a recess appointment Ironically the justice who tended to favor executive assertions of power and limit the ability of Congress to challenge such assertions was Antonin ScaliaThe president could claim that his power is in full effect with the current recess of the Senate He could also claim such authority with the end of the annual sessionGenerally the authority to make a recess appointment has been recognized with a recess of greater than three days The Senate can avoid that trigger by remainingin technical session with little or no business being transactedThat could push the target recess to the end of the session where Obama would make the appointment before the next Congress assembles in January  an appointment made in literally the waning days of his termI happen to think Obama is well within his rights to make the nominationAs hockey great Wayne Gretzky said you miss every shot that you never take And this is a shot most presidents would takeIf blocked however Obama should recognize that a new president will enter office in a matter of months or weeks with an endofsession appointment with a national mandateSuch a decision would undermine the integrity of the court with a display of raw muscle by a departing president It would cement Obamas troubling legacy as a president who waged an unrelenting campaign against the separation of powers that is the foundation of our constitutional systemThe difference between a statesman and a politician is often the exercise of restraint It is not enough to say that you can do something but whether you should do something This is something Obama should not doJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and a member of USA TODAYs board of contributors He has written and testified before Congress on the role and limits of recess appointmentsIn addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourBoard of Contributors To read more columns like this go to theOpinion front page
