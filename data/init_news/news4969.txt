Washington CNN Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders on Saturday said he supports Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultzs Democratic opponent in her August 30 primary adding that if he is elected president he would effectively terminate her chairmanship of the DNCSanders whose campaign has engaged in an increasingly bitter feud with the DNC chairwoman during his presidential bid said in an interview set to air on CNNs State of the Union that he favors Tim Canova in Floridas 23rd congressional district Canova is supporting SandersWell clearly I favor her opponent Sanders told Tapper His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman SchultzsOn Sunday afternoon Canova accused Wasserman Schultz of ignoring her home districts economic issuesIn her own votes in the House of Representatives I think shes making the problems worse Canova told CNNs Fredricka WhitfieldHe also expressed doubt that his political rival could heal intraparty rifts created during the primaryIf the Democrats come out of their convention united it might not be because of Debbie Wasserman Schultz but in spite of her efforts he saidSanders sent out a fundraising email on behalf of Canova on earlier in the dayThe political revolution is not just about electing a president sisters and brothers We need a Congress with members who believe like Bernie that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money the email saidSanders also told Tapper that if hes elected president he wouldnt reappoint Wasserman Schultz to head the DNCIn a response to Sanders on Saturday afternoon Wasserman Schultz insisted she would remain neutral in the Democratic presidential race despite the Vermont senators endorsement of her primary opponentI am so proud to serve the people of Floridas 23rd district and I am confident that they know that I am an effective fighter and advocate on their behalf in Congress Wasserman Schultz said Even though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent I remain as I have been from the beginning neutral in the presidential Democratic primary I look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fallSanders campaign has long been critical of Wasserman Shultzs performance as head of the committee claiming that the DNC has favored his presidential primary challenger Hillary Clinton Sanders and his supporters have complained about the nomination process and ways they believe it has helped Clinton including debates held on Saturday nights closed primaries in major states such as New York and the use of superdelegates  essentially freeagent party and union stalwarts who are overwhelmingly backing ClintonCanova who teaches at Nova Southeastern University Shepard Broad College of Law in Fort Lauderdale was asked in 2011 to serve on Sanders Wall Street reform advisory panelIm so proud to know that Bernie Sanders favors our campaign for progress for all Like Sen Sanders Im running a campaign thats truly backed by the people not big corporations  one that stands up to Wall Street interests instead of cozying up to them Canova told CNN in a statement Saturday Together I feel confident that our campaign of nurses teachers students seniors and workingclass Floridians can work together to demand accountability from our leaders and offer a more positive path forward to the people of Floridas 23rd districtWhile Sanders has a strong ability to raise money and thus could impact the race he did not fare well in Wasserman Schultzs congressional district during the March Florida presidential primary scoring 301 of the vote compared with Clintons 68We can have a long conversation about Debbie Wasserman Schultz just about how shes been throwing shade on the Sanders campaign from the very beginning Weaver told CNNs Chris Cuomo on New DayIts not the DNC Weaver added By and large people in the DNC have been good to us Debbie Wasserman Schultz really is the exceptionWasserman Schultz has pushed back against Sanders accusation that the party had rigged the system against himWeve had the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama These rules were adopted for state parties all across the country in 2014 she said earlier this weekAsked about the throwing shade line on Wednesday Wasserman Schultz told CNNs Wolf Blitzer My response to that is hashtag SMH shake my headSanders also said it is absurd that superdelegates began supporting Clinton even before she had a competitorTheres something absurd that I get 46 of the delegates that come from real contests real elections and 7 of the superdelegates he told Tapper Some 400 of Hillary Clintons superdelegates came on board her campaign before anybody else announced It was anointment And that is bad for the processSanders who has frequently cited polls saying he does better than Clinton in a matchup against Trump also said theres a good chance the former secretary of state can beat the presumptive Republican nomineeIm not saying she cannot beat Donald Trump I think she can I think theres a good chance she can the Vermont senator said But I am the stronger candidate because we appeal to independents  people who are not in love with either the Democratic or the Republican Party often for very good reasons
