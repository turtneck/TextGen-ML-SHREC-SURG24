Why you should vote for meIn January America is going to have a new president Things are going to change  that much is certain The question is what kind of change are we going to haveWe can build an economy that works for everyone or stack the deck even more for those at the topWe can keep America safe through strength and smarts  or turn our backs on our allies and cozy up to our adversariesWe can come together to build a stronger fairer America or fear the future and fear each otherEverything Ive done as first lady senator or secretary of State Ive done by listening to people and looking for common ground even with people who disagree with me And if you elect me on Tuesday thats the kind of president Ill beHere are four priorities for my first 100 days  issues Ive heard about from Americans all over our countryFirst we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II Well invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come Well produce enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade Well cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire  because in America if you can dream it you should be able to build it Well pay for it all by asking the wealthy Wall Street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share And this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days Creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidencySecond we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation The last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was Ronald Reagan and it was a priority for George W Bush Im confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship secures our border and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals This is the right thing to do and it will also grow our economyThird to break the gridlock in Washington we need to get secret unaccountable money out of our politics Its drowning out the voices of the American people So within my first 30 days I will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United We should be protecting citizens rights to vote not corporations rights to buy electionsFourth we need to get started on endtoend criminal justice reform Too many people have been sent away for far too long for nonviolent offenses I believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the lawTheres so much more we need to do together and we certainly wont get it all done in the first 100 days But were going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for American families  and Ill never ever quitI want to be president for all Americans  Democrats Republicans and independents Americans of every race faith and backgroundMy opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness fear and insults and spent months pitting Americans against each other Ive said many times that Donald Trump has shown us who he is Now we have to decide who we areBecause its not just our names on the ballot this year Every issue we care about is on the ballot too This is about who we are as a country  and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together or change that pushes us further apartIt all comes down to this I love our country I believe in our people And I think theres nothing we cant achieve if we work together and invest in each otherHillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for presidentYou can readdiverse opinions from ourBoard of Contributorsand other writers ontheOpinion front pageon TwitterUSATOpinionand in our dailyOpinion newsletterTo submit a letter comment or column check oursubmission guidelines
