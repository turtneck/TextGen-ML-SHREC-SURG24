With ideological extremism on therise in Congress President Barack Obama argued during his State of the Union that America must reform its electionsIf we want a better politics its not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president Obama said We have to change the system to reflect our better selvesObama was less clear on how exactly America might pull this off The president criticized gerrymandering  the process by which parties draw oddly shaped highly partisan congressional districts  and called for campaign finance reform and repealing restrictions to voter accessThese reforms however have gone nowhere In the meantime the incentives have only increased for politicians to stake out maximalist positions with little structural reward for moderates who anger their basesIt raises the question Does anybody out there have a better ideaAnne Kim a policy editor at Washington Monthly and a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute has proposed a new way to help fight polarization of CongressIn an essay published in the winter 2016 issue of Democracy Kim calls for the creation of one atlarge congressional seat in every state chosen by voters statewideWe currently determine our House seats by slicing up a states map into a bunch of different smaller segments except for states with very small populations that only get one atlarge representative Under Kims plan every state with more than two representatives would get an atlarge House member  someone who would be accountable to the whole state rather than a narrow sliver of itVoxs Matthew Yglesias has already advanced the idea of using atlarge districts to reduce polarization These plans envision treating the representatives as one atlarge group to be doled out proportionately after a statewide voteKims proposal is more modest and perhaps more practical By only asking for states to add one atlarge seat the plan preserves the benefits of the basic idea without requiring a wholesale transformation of how we conduct congressional electionsFederal and state law would have to be changed to make it possible But doing so Kim says would likely create several dozen House seats that are by definition not gerrymandered  and as a result are more responsive to the actual demands of their constituentsThis seems like a simple and easytounderstand mechanism to get moderate Americans a little more excited about a way for their voices to actually be heard Kim saysVoters across a state are significantly more moderate than those in a gerrymandered district Having a bloc of House members picked through statewide elections Kim says would make it at least more likely that theres an institutional incentive for politicians to move to the centerThe creation of new pluralitymoderate atlarge seats in many states would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates Kim writes in her Democracy essay Challenging the status quo might be an excellent and concrete opportunity to test moderate muscleTheres also precedent for these kinds of seats Before 1967 atlarge districts existed in southern states as a way to prevent African Americans from getting elected to Congress But that doesnt mean they couldnt be brought back now to serve a new purpose Kim saysIt would take an act of Congress  and thus a rare moment of bipartisan consensus  for the plan to be enactedBut in our interview Kim argued that her plan could help an embattled Republican leadership that wants to regain control of a nomination process increasingly ceded to hardcore conservativesIts a way to defang the Tea Party  Im not sure the GOP has gotten any favors by allowing that wing of the party to get as powerful as it has been Kim saysShe added If the GOP has learned anything about reasserting the power of the establishment this is certainly the way to do it Because it would give GOP moderates a voiceThe idea sounds interesting but its unclear if atlarge House members would reduce political polarization even if it were somehow implemented according to experts interviewed for this storyI think most political scientists would tell you that this is a nonstarter For one thing we already have 50 atlarge districts  states  and the Senate is just as polarized as the House said Morris Fiorina a political science professor at Stanford University who has done extensive research on polarizationAmerican politics is moving inexorably to the margins and even in a statewide vote the candidate will have to win a primary Fiorina noted In other words theres just not much reason to believe gerrymandering is the main culprit hereSinglemember or atlarge safe district or competitive the candidate has to win a primary dominated by the wingnuts Fiorina saidMatthew Dickinson a professor of political science at Middlebury College had a more measured response to the idea He too noted that the Senate is highly polarized and questioned the premise that gerrymandering was the key contributing factor to the rise of extremism in CongressIts an interesting proposition Dickinson said of Kims proposal but I suspect it will have less of an impact in reducing polarization than the author thinksBut Dickinson raised a possible counterargument to the counterargument Yes the Senate is very polarized But is the Senate polarized at least in part because the House isDickinson pointed to an academic paper from 2011 that argued this point noting that many of the highly partisan senators of today began as highly partisan members of the HouseThe polarization in the House has directly contributed to polarization in the Senate write Sean M Theriault of the University of Texas Austin and David Rohde of Duke UniversityIn addition Kim the author of the Democracy piece also pushed back on the idea that the Senate and the House were equally driven by party factionalismThe Senate is polarized but its not nearly as polarized as the House she said The most extreme member of the Senate is not as extreme as the most extreme member of the HouseKim also acknowledged that the plan would not represent a silver bullet for the problem But with Democrats and Republicans in Congress moving further apart than ever before she said it seems worth trying
