There was a danger sign for Hillary Clinton in a dank old industrial warehouse here along the Milwaukee River The cinderblock walls had been painted over with modernist murals bearing the likeness of Bernie Sanders This was now a campaign field office And the volunteers young and old who manned a phone bank Thursday afternoon vowed never to give up their time  or for some even their votes  to ClintonWould Teresa VanDoorn 44 a homemaker who had become a familiar face at the Sanders office support Clinton if she became the Democratic presidential nomineeNo VanDoorn said Voting for Hillary would be approving of the status quo and establishment  and I dont approve of that I would write Bernies name in I consider Hillary equal to the GOP candidates to be frankWhat about Lily Shea 19 who has been helping Sanders ahead of Tuesdays Wisconsin primary No I would write Bernie in  definitely she said I just dont trust her Whenever I hear her talk I get the feeling theres something else going on behind the curtainsThen there was Patrick Doyle 55 a Sanders true believer Asked if he could shift his allegiance to Clinton Doyle paused to think then said flatly Im going to do everything I can to make sure that doesnt happenClinton is well on her way to the nomination But Wisconsin  a fall battleground with a celebrated tradition of progressive activism and political reform  represents a phenomenon that could undermine her in the general election She has yet to energize some parts of the liberal base or even persuade them to be comfortable with her candidacyWhether she prevails in Wisconsins primary or as polls suggest is more likely Sanders edges her here Clinton would maintain her sizable delegate lead To overtake her Sanders would need blowout wins in many of the states still to vote including New York Pennsylvania and CaliforniaGeneral election polling indicates Clinton would easily defeat Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in Wisconsin and other swing states The data also suggests that the majority of Sanders supporters would vote for ClintonSanders sharpens attacks for a New York showdown with ClintonYet among Sanderss most fervent backers  the committed liberal activists who would be necessary in any grassroots effort in a general election and whose votes could be decisive if the race tightens  there is a strong distaste for Clinton To them she represents the moneyed specialinterest politics they have been fighting againstActress Susan Sarandon a Sanders surrogate gave voice to this view when she said on MSNBC a few days ago that she would consider sitting out the election if Clinton is the nominee and that a Trump presidency in the minds of some Sanders fans might bring about a more immediate revolution Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver later distanced the campaign from Sarandons comments and said Sanders would support the Democratic nomineeThis hostility has stirred hard feelings in the Clinton orbit At Clintons Milwaukee field office on Thursday Sen Cory Booker DNJ gave a pep talk to volunteers in which he testified to the former secretary of states competence resiliency tenacity and gritAs Booker wrapped up Winifred Thrall a 78yearold Clinton backer cried out Cory I wish that Susan Sarandon could have heard youIn an interview later Thrall bemoaned that so many Wisconsin progressives are backing a candidate Sanders who in her view has no experience  nothing but calling for a revolution in the streetsIts so upsetting Thrall said I have an old friend  we worked on McCarthy and McGovern together in Appleton Wisconsin  and I cant talk to her anymore because of her support of BernieFor Clinton a doublebarreled fight against Trump and Sanders in NYWisconsins primary is important because in many respects the state is a microcosm of the Democratic Party nationally and has an unusually engaged electorateWeve got industrial urban rural small towns colleges high tech  its all here said Democratic former governor Jim Doyle a Clinton supporter Eight years ago it was a big deal when Barack Obama came in and beat Hillary Clinton badly hereTad Devine Sanderss chief strategist said Wisconsin is a great proxy for a candidates strength in the general election This is a state that Democrats must haveThe primary is competitive This weeks Marquette Law School survey considered the states gold standard had Sanders leading 49 percent to 45 percent The poll shows that Sanders is leading 57 percent to 37 percent among selfidentified independents  part of an alarming national trend for Clinton of being unpopular with unaffiliated voters who can help swing general electionsIt will be critical for the nominee to be able to win substantially among people who lean Democratic and younger voters and it does leave the question of whether absent Bernie Sanders could Hillary Clinton really rack up large margins said Charles Franklin a professor who oversees the Marquette Law pollJoe Zepecki a Wisconsinbased communications consultant who is not working for either campaign said independent voters pose a big challenge for Clinton I dont think theyre going to waltz right over he saidSanders has an enthusiastic base in liberal Dane County home to the University of Wisconsin at Madison and he also has found support in rural farming areas and manufacturing towns He is trying to tap into the states tradition of political reform one of his ads features a dairy farmer from his home state of Vermont testifying to Sanderss independence from special interestsBarbara Lawton a former lieutenant governor who backed Clinton in 2008 and is supporting Sanders now said the Wisconsin electorate is deeply unsettled  in part because of nowchronic wage stagnation She said there was a tone deafness to Clintons campaign given her ties to Wall Street and support for trade deals that prevents her candidacy from resonating more with progressive DemocratsWere really looking for someone who you can trust Lawton said Theres such a longing for the truthMuch of Clintons support is concentrated in the largest city Milwaukee which has a sizable black population and suburban areas Booker the Senates only black Democrat spent Thursday trying to energize Clinton supporters in this citys neighborhoodsWhat happens in this primary in just a few days is going to affect the trajectory of this campaign Its going to affect the spirit of whats to come Booker told a few dozen volunteers at Clintons storefront office on Dr Martin Luther King DriveBoth candidates have been advertising here and are fanning out across the state this weekend The Clinton campaign is trying to maximize her performance in targeted congressional districts to ensure that even if Sanders wins statewide the two will roughly split Wisconsins 86 pledged delegatesWhat were seeing this year is so classic Theres the establishment candidate and the liberal challenger Doyle said Theres a long history of progressive liberal candidates making their last stands hereClinton allies rejected any suggestion that a loss to Sanders in Wisconsin would reveal weaknesses that could haunt her in a general electionThe word weakness deters any kind of response from me as it relates to Hillary There are no weaknesses said Martha Love a longtime African American leader from Milwaukee and a member of the Democratic National Committee Our state will fall in line behind the Democratic candidate because the other side  my gosh my gosh my gosh my goshMatt Flynn a former state party chairman and a Clinton booster echoed that view If she loses Wisconsin and people are lackluster and arent showing any passion about her does it mean shell struggle in the general election No because she is running against two of the biggest freaks in the history of American politics Trump and Sen Ted CruzAt Clintons Milwaukee office volunteers said they were not worried about Sanders backers eventually joining their effort Some said it may not take any persuasion at allJill Huennekens 46 a bartender who called Clinton my hero said she has been making phone calls on Clintons behalf for monthsTruthfully I cant remember one thats been Bernie or bust she said They tell me that they will support Hillary in November even if they want Bernie in the primary They say it even without my asking  Dont worry she has our support in NovemberCatherine Wolfe 59 another Clinton volunteer said the message she tells fellow Democrats is simple For those people looking for a revolution all they have to do is vote for a woman and well have a revolution
