WASHINGTON  There are no shortage of culprits in the national debate over rising income inequality but President Barack Obamas Labor Department would like to add one more to the list onthejob injuriesIn a new report issued Wednesday Labor Department officials argue that workplace injuries and illnesses coupled with an inadequate worker compensation system are contributing to the gap between rich and poor in the USAccording to the Labor Department roughly 4 million serious injuries and illnesses are reported by employers each year though the true tally is likely much higher Workers who suffer a serious injury earn an estimated 15 percent less or 31000 on average over the ensuing decadeThese injuries force thousands of working families out of the middle class and block many lowwage workers from getting ahead David Michaels head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration told The Huffington Post The studies all show that the majority of workers who get hurt never get any workers compensation and they have to pick up the cost themselves The workers who do get workers comp are never fully compensatedAccording to the report Adding Inequality to Injury The Costs of Failing to Protect Workers on the Job state laws and court rulings have made it harder for injured workers to recoup money with workers compensation now covering only an estimated 21 percent of lost wages and medical bills due to injury or illness The rest of the tab falls onto workers their health insurers and taxpayers in generalWhile inadequate for the average worker the system tends to be even less generous toward lowwage workers according to the report Immigrant workers in particular may be unaware of their rights have a limited grasp of English or simply be afraid to report their injuries for fear of losing their jobs As a result many dont even file claimsAccording to the Labor Department less than 40 percent of workers who are eligible to apply for workers compensation following an injury actually apply for itStructural changes in the labor force have made workers more likely to get hurt on the job Michaels said He pointed to the prevalence of temp workers in warehousing and manufacturing as well as independent contractors in the construction industryTemp workers have typically been on the job a shorter period of time and undergone less training making them more vulnerable to injury than permanent workers And when workers are misclassified as selfemployed independent contractors companies dodge the liabilities that would typically come with an injury giving them less motivation to ensure a safe workplaceWhen the worker is misclassified theyll never see workers compensation and they wont get unemployment insurance They really pay a very significant cost Michaels said And if an employer isnt concerned with liabilities they have very little incentive to prevent those injuries
