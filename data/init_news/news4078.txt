Flint Michigan CNN It was no Republican debate  nobody talked about the size of their hands or made up demeaning nicknames  but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were ready for action Sunday nightPersonal frustration peeked through as Clinton unloaded new attacks on Sanders over his opposition to the auto bailout and Sanders portrayed Clinton as a candidate straight out of Wall Street central castingSunday was also 90s night as the candidates essentially relitigated major political battles of the era  including NAFTA the assault weapons ban and crime bill  through modern eyesThe debate came two days before Michigans primary  a key test of whether Sanders can expand his appeal to a broader and more diverse electorate  and was shaped by the concerns of voters in this city that is still struggling with a water crisis for which local state and federal officials share the blameHere are five takeaways from Sundays debateSanders waved shouted eyerolled baited and goaded his way through the debateClinton laid into his opposition to the auto industry bailout That measure was part of a broader rescue of the financial industry a point Sanders was only too happy to make by saying If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout where some of your friends destroyed the economy And then Clinton said If youre going to talk tell the whole storySanders railed against the bailout saying that he decided to let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street  it shouldnt be the middle class  when Clinton tried to interject againCould I finish Youll have your turn he saidHe showed his frustration with Clinton again later saying Can I finish please All rightThe exchange demonstrated a new level of comfort with the handtohand combat of presidential campaigns But it was also a risky move making him sound potentially patronizing or dismissive of a candidate who could become the first female presidentThis from a candidate who entered the race bragging about never running a negative ad Sanders might keep their disputes focused on differences of policy  but at times Sunday night it looked and sounded personalWhen Clinton was asked about fracking she launched into a nuanced answer that gave credence to localities state governments and more Her bottom line There wouldnt be many places where it would be OK under herSanders had a much simpler answer No he said He doesnt support it And he said he doesnt care about all the Democratic governors who support itThis in a nutshell is the difference between them She has nuanced positions that look at the breadth of opinion across the country Shes also keenly aware of the limitations of government and strains to keep her positions within those limits  part of what she calls her responsibility geneSanders has definitive positions that take a look at his ideology Thats the Democrats choice nuance or no nuanceThis same difference showed up when the two delved into the Flint water crisis at the debates outsetClintons big move on stage  her newsmaking comment at the debates outset  was one shed resisted for months arguing it was simplistic But she went for it Sunday night saying she agrees with Sanders in saying Michigan Gov Rick Snyder needs to go I agree the governor should resign or be recalled she saidFirst thing you do is say people are not paying a water bill for poison water And that is retroactive he saidSo she readied an attack that Sanders didnt seem prepared for going at the Vermont senator for opposing the auto bailoutThe money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring Clinton said I voted to save the auto industry He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry I think that is a pretty big differenceThen she ticked off a list of states where she thinks that vote will hurt SandersGiven the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing I think it was the right decision to heed what Presidentelect Obama asked us to do she said You were either for saving the auto industry or against it I voted to save the auto industry and Im very glad that I didThe damage was done When Clinton dropped the auto bailout bomb the audience audibly ooooohed highlighting the potency of that argument in the home of the US auto industryBut he had his tonedeaf moments sparking outrage on social media when he seemed to suggest that black people grow up poor and in ghettos and white people do not  a particular eyeraiser because hed been asked about his racial blind spotsWhen youre white you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto you dont know what its like to be poor Sanders saidFor Sanders this is the central challenge facing his campaign Clinton blew him out across the South among AfricanAmericans and Sanders cant withstand her doing so again in big Midwestern statesMichigans March 8 primary will be a key test of whether Sanders can win with a more diverse electorate The following week  when Ohio Illinois Missouri Florida and North Carolina vote  will be his moment of truthNear the end of the debate Sanders also cracked a joke about boosting funding for mental health saying that when you watch these Republican debates you know why we need to invest in mental healthIt was the right target Republicans and the right audience liberals  but perhaps the wrong topic as he again risked appearing insensitiveOne for the baseThe debate was a strong sign that both candidates still see room to gain or lose ground among liberal voters They spent so much time jockeying to get to each others left that there was virtually no talk of Republicans at allClinton and Sanders defended government spending and intervention teachers unions gun control clean energy programs and efforts to fight climate change They talked about a beefedup role for the Environmental Protection AgencyThere was no talk about foreign policy the deficit entitlements  subjects always frontandcenter at Republican debatesIts a clear sign that the Sanders camp doesnt see the Democratic nominating contest ending anytime soon with liberal bastions like New York which votes in April and California June available as opportunities to rack up lots of delegatesIncreasingly Clinton is eyeing the general election on the campaign trail  axing her usual shots at Sanders from her stump speech focusing on the economy and laying into Republican frontrunner Donald Trump That wasnt apparent Sunday night
