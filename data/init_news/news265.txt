Im running on about an hour and a half of sleep and my nails are damn near chewed to the bone This because as a diehard Cubs fan I was up until nearly 100 AM working to come to grips with what I had just witnessed Once I finally went to bed I found myself tossing and turning so at 330 I said screw it Im heading to the officeMy beloved Cubbies had just won the World Series defeating the Cleveland Indians in what is likely to go down as one of the most EPIC game 7 battles in the history of professional baseball The Cubs havent won a World Series since 1908 making this Championship something we Cubs fans could only dream about until it actually happened last nightAs prediction hub FiveThirtyEight put it just a few days ago the chances were slim How slim Slimmer than the odds of Trump winning next TuesdayAn impossible scenario just become very possible And fortunately for America another seemingly impossible scenario is now suddenly started to look very possibleA Hillary Clinton indictment is now likely This coming via FBI sources telling Fox News host Bret Baier that the FBI is moving towards what is likely an indictmentBaiers report includes the following key points 1 The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year2 The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed and agents are currently combing through them The investigation has interviewed several people twice and plans to interview some for a third time3 Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clintons secret server on Anthony Weiners laptop They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature4 Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is likely in the case of payforplay at the Clinton Foundation barring some obstruction in some way from the Justice Department5 FBI sources say with 99 accuracy that Hillary Clintons server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies and that information had been taken from itThats a pretty strong case for indictment Of course the corrupted DOJ can still do everything in its power to block justice but it now appears the FBI is throwing DOJ demands out the windowGonna be an interesting few days ahead folks For those of us who are Cubs fans and news junkies sleep is not on the agenda
