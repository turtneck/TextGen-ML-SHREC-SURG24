New Jersey Gov Chris Christie suspended his Republican presidential bid Wednesday afternoon joining former HP executive Carly Fiorina in exiting the 2016 race after a disappointing finish in the New Hampshire primarySources say Christie met with staff in person Wednesday in Morristown NJ and also held a conference call to announce his decision to his campaign teamThe announcement was widely expected after the twoterm governor returned home after his loss Tuesday night to weigh his optionsChristie had finished sixth in the primary contest while Fiorina finished seventhIn a statement on Facebook Christie said I ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people not the people work for the government And while running for president I tried to reinforce what I have always believed  that speaking your mind matters that experience matters that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation And so today I leave the race without an ounce of regretThe decision to drop out immediately kicks off the race in the rest of the stillcrowded GOP field to scoop up their support And it marks the end of the 2016 road for two candidates who showed political promise earlier in the race  only to watch their support fade as the elections themselves nearedChristie was banking on a solid performance in the New Hampshire contest seen as more friendly territory for the Northeast governor who did poorly in Iowa But even as he touted his executive experience the other current and former governors in the race outflanked him Tuesday nightWhile the toughtalking Christie received widespread attention for his aggressive criticism of Florida Sen Marco Rubio at Saturdays debate that spat seemed to hurt Rubio more than it helped Christie Rubio finished fifth but Christie ended up well behind the freshman senator pulling just 7 percent in the stateHis exit from the race completes a drastic turnaround in the governors political fortunes In 2012 he delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention after having gained national political fame for taking on the states public employee unions and his nononsense approach to governing His periodic confrontations with hecklers captured on film also made him somewhat a YouTube starBut he was politically damaged by the scandal in his administration over subordinates blocking traffic on the George Washington Bridge in a seeming act of political retribution against a local mayor Christie has denied knowledge of the decision but has struggled ever since to get out from under the cloud of controversyHis persona as the telling it like it is candidate also seemed to take a backseat last year to Donald Trump who if anything was more brash more unscripted more confrontational than Christie In the crowded field he struggled to break throughFor a time in late 2015 Christie looked like he could be in contention for second place in New Hampshire He was devoting time and resources to the state and gaining attention for his impassioned and personal remarks on drug addiction  in a state where heroin addiction and treatment is a major election issueBut in the end voters gravitated more toward Ohio Gov John Kasich who finished second Tuesday Trump easily won the Republican contest while Texas Sen Ted Cruz finished thirdFormer Florida Gov Jeb Bush and Rubio finished fourth and fifth respectively followed by ChristieMeanwhile Fiorina who was the only female GOP candidate in the 2016 running called it quits Wednesday after failing to crack the top five in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday nightWhile I suspend my candidacy today I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them Fiorina said in a written statementShe added I will continue to serve in order to restore citizen government to this great nation so that together we may fulfill our potentialFiorina entered the tumultuous Republican primary in April She promoted herself as an outsider with business experience and argued that as the lone woman in the GOP field she was best positioned to oppose likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton After a standout performance in the first undercard debate Fiorina rose to the mainstage and soared in the polls in the fall But her momentum quickly stalled and by the end of the year she had dropped back downFiorinas first major foray in to politics was in 2010 when she ran for Senate in California and lost to incumbent Sen Barbara Boxer by 10 pointsThroughout her presidential bid Fiorina emphasized her meteoric rise in the business world A Stanford University graduate she started her career as a secretary earned an MBA and worked her way up at ATT to become a senior executive at the telecom giantBut she was also dogged by questions about her record at HewlettPackard where she was hired as CEO in 1999 She was fired six years later after leading a major merger with Compaq and laying off 30000 workersThe Associated Press contributed to this report
