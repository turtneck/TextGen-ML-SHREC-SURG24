Since 911 can there be any doubt that the public has become numb to theeuphemisms that regularly accompany US troops drones and CIA operatives into Washingtons imperial conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa Such euphemisms are meant to take the sting out of Americas wars back home Many of these words and phrases are already sowell known and well worn that no one thinks twice about them anymoreHere are just a few collateral damage for killed and wounded civilians a term used regularly since the First Gulf War of 19901991 Enhanced interrogation techniques for torture a term adopted with vigor by George W Bush Dick Cheney and the rest of their administration techniques that were actually demonstrated in the White House Extraordinary rendition for CIA kidnappings of terror suspects off global streets or from remote badlands often followed by the employment of enhanced interrogation techniques at US black sites or other foreign hellholes Detainees for prisoners and detention camp for prison or in some cases more honestly concentration camp used to describe Guantnamo Gitmo among other places established offshore of American justice Targeted killings forpresidentially ordered drone assassinations Boots on the ground for yet another deployment of our troops and not just their boots in harms way Even the Bush administrations Global War on Terror its label for an attempt to transform the Greater Middle East into a Pax Americana would be redubbed in the Obama years overseas contingency operations before any attempt at labeling was dropped for a noname war pursued across major swathes of the planetAs euphemisms were deployed to cloak that wars bitter and brutal realities overthetop honorifics were assigned to Americas embattled role in the world Exceptional indispensable and greatest have been the three words most commonly used by presidents politicians and the gung ho to describe this country Once upon a time if Americans thought this way they felt no need to have their presidents and presidential candidates actually say so  such was the confidence of the golden age of American power So consider the constant redeployment of these terms a small measure of Americas growing defensiveness about itself its sense of doubt and decline rather than strength and confidenceTo what end this concerted assault on the words we use In George Orwellsclassic 1946 essay Politics and the English Language he noted that his eras equivalents for collateral damage were needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them Obviously not much has changed in the intervening seven decades And this is as Orwell intuited a dangerous way to go Cloaking violent even murderous actions in anodyne language might help a few doubting functionaries sleep easier at night but it should make the rest of us profoundly uneasyThe more American leaders and officials  and the media that quotes them endlessly  employ such euphemisms to cloak harsh realities the more they ensure that such harshness will endure indeed that it is likely to grow harsher and more pernicious as we continue to settle into a world of euphemistic thinkingIn the future some linguist or lexicographer will doubtless compile a dictionary of perpetual war and perhaps since they may be linked imperial decline focusing on the grim processes and versions of failure language can cloak It would undoubtedly explore how certain words and rhetorical devices were used in twentyfirstcentury America to obscure the heavy burdens that war placed on the country even as they facilitated its continuingfailed conflicts It would obviously include classic examples like surge used in both Iraq and Afghanistan to obscure the way our government rushed extra troops into a battle zone in a moment of failure only ensuring the extension of that failure and the nowclassic phrase shock and awe that obscured the reality of a massive air strike on Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians collateral damage but not the decapitation of a hated regimeDont think however that the language of twentyfirstcentury American war was only meant to lull the public Less familiar words and terms continue to be used within the military not to clarify tasks at hand but to obscure certain obvious realities even from those sanctioned to deal with them Takeasymmetrical warfare the gray zone and VUCA Unless you spend time in Department of Defense and military circles you probably havent heard of theseAsymmetrical warfare suggests that the enemy fights unfairly and in a thoroughly cowardly fashion regularly lurking behind and mixing with civilians hostages because that enemy doesnt have the moxie to don uniforms and stand toetotoe in a kinetic smackdown with US troops As a result of course the US must be prepared for underhanded tactics and devious weaponry including ambushes and IEDs improvised explosive devices or roadside bombs as well as a range of other unconventional tactics now all too familiar in a world plagued by violent attacks against soft targets aka civilians It must also be prepared to engage an enemy mixed in with a civilian population and so brace itself for the inevitable collateral damage that is now so much the essence of American warThat groups like the Islamic State ISIS would choose to fight asymmetrically should hardly come as a surprise to anyone whos ever been confronted by a much bigger and better armed kid in a schoolyard Misdirection a sucker punch a slingshot even running away to fight another day are asymmetrical approaches that are sensible indeed for any outgunned and overmatched opponent The term is a truism nothing more when it comes to the realities of our world It is however a useful way of framing matters for those in the Pentagon and the military who dont want to think seriously about the grim course of action focused significantly on civilian populations they are pursuing which often instills anger and the urge for revenge in such populations and so in the end runs at cross purposes to stated US aimsThe gray zone is a fuzzy term used in military circles to describe the perplexing nature of lowerlevel conflicts often involving nonstate actors that dont qualify as fullfledged wars These are often fought using nontraditional weapons and tactics ranging from cyber attacks to the propagandizing of potential terror recruits via social media This zone is unnerving to Pentagon types in part because the vast majority of the Pentagons funding goes to conventional weaponry thats as subtle as a sledgehammer bigticket items like aircraft carriers nuclear submarines main battle tanks strategic bombers and wildly expensive multirole aircraft such as the F35 now estimated to cost roughly 14 trillion through its lifecycle Much of this weaponry is too big to fail in the funding wars in Washington but regularly fails in the field precisely because its too big to be used effectively against the latest crop of evasive enemies Hence that irresolvable gray zone which plagues Americas defense planners and operativesThe question the gray zone both raises and obscures is Why has the US done so poorly when by its own definition it remains the biggest baddest superpower around the one that outspends its nonstate enemies by a factor so large it cant even be calculated Keep in mind for instance that the 911 attacks on American soil were estimated to have cost Osama bin Laden at most a halfmillion dollars Multiply that by 400 and you can buy one made in America F35 jet fighter If the gray zone offers little help clarifying Americas military dilemmas what about VUCA Its an acronym for volatile uncertain complex and ambiguous which is meant to describe our post911 world Of course theres nothing like an acronym to take the sting out of any world But as an historian who has read a lot of history books let me confess that to the best of my knowledge the world has always been is now and will always be VUCA For any future historian of the Pentagons language let me sum things up this way instead of honest talk about war in all its ugliness and uncertainty military professionals of our era have tended to substitute buzz words catchphrases and acronyms Its a way of muddying the water It allows the world of war to tumble on without serious challenge which is why its been so useful in these years to speak of say COIN Counterinsurgency or 4GWFourthGeneration Warfare Much like its most recent enthusiast General David Petraeus COIN has once again lost favor in the military but FourthGeneration Warfare is still riding high and sounds so refreshingly forwardlooking not like the stale Vietnamera wine in a post911 bottle that it is In reality its another iteration ofinsurgency and COIN mixed and matched with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedongs peoples war To prevail in places like Afghanistan so 4GW thinkers suggest one needs to win hearts and minds  yes that classic phrase of defeat in Vietnam  while securing and protecting a definite COINage the people against insurgents and terrorists In other words were talking about an acronym that immediately begins to congeal if you use older words to describe it like pacification and nationbuilding The latest 4GW jargon may not help win wars but it does sometimes win healthy research grants from the government The fact is that trendy acronyms and snappy buzz words have a way of limiting genuine thinking on war If America is to win or far better avoid future wars its war professionals need to look more honestly at that phenomenon in all of its dimensions So too do the American people for its in their name that such wars are allegedly waged The Truth About Progress in Americas Wars These days Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter often resorts to cancer imagery when describing the Islamic state Parent tumor is an image he especially favors  that is terrorism as a cancer that Americas militarized surgeons need to attack and destroy before it metastasizes and has children Think of the ISIS franchises in Libya where the organization has recently doubled in size Afghanistan and Yemen Hence the proliferation of surgical strikes by drones and similarly surgical Special Ops raids both of which you could think of as Americas equivalent of white blood cells in its war on the cancer of terrorism But is terrorism really a civilizational cancer that can be cured via the most aggressive kinetic treatments Can the US render the world cancerfree For thats what Carters language implies And how does one measure progress in a war on the cancer of ISIS Indeed from an outsiders perspective the proliferation of US military bases around the world there are now roughly 800 as well as of drone strikes Special Ops raids and massive weapons exports might have a cancerous look to them In other words what constitutes a cancer depends on ones perspective  and perhaps ones definition of world health too The very notion of progress in Americas recent wars is one that a colleague Michael Murry recently critiqued A US Navy Vietnam War Veteran he wrote me that for his favorite military euphemism I have to go with progress as incessantly chanted by the American military brass in Iraq and Afghanistan We go on hearing about 14 years of progress which to hear our generals tell it would vanish in an instant should the United States withdraw its forces and let the locals and their neighbors sort things out Since when do fragile gains equate to progress Who in their right mind would invest rivers of blood and trillions of dollars in fragility Now that I think of it we also have the euphemistic expression of drawdown substituting for withdrawal which in turn substitutes for retreat The US military and the civilian government it has browbeaten into hapless acquiescence simply cannot face the truth of their monumental failures and so must continually bastardize our language in a losing  almost comical  attempt to stay one linguistic step ahead of the truth Progress as Murry notes basically means nothing when such gains in the words of David Petraeus during the surge months in Iraq in 2007 are both fragile and reversible Indeed Petraeus repeated the same two words in 2011 to describe similar US progress in Afghanistan and today it couldnt be clearer just how much progress was truly made there Isnt it time for government officials to stop banging the drums of war talk in favor of progress when none exists Think for instance of the Americantrained and now retrained Iraqi security forces Each year US officials swear that the Iraqi military is getting ever closer to combat readiness but much like one of Zenos paradoxes the halfsteps that military takes under American tutelage never seem to get it into fighting shape Progress eternally touted seems always to lead to regress eternally explained away as that army regularly underperforms or its units simply collapse often abandoning their Americansupplied weaponry to the enemy Here we are 12 years after the US began training the Iraqi military and once again it seems to be cratering this time while supposedlyon the road to retaking Iraqs second largest city Mosul from its Islamic State occupiers Progress anyone In short the dishonesty of the words the US military regularly wields illustrates the dishonesty of its neverending wars After so many years of failure and frustration of wars that arent won and terrorist movements that only seem to spread as its leaders are knocked off isnt it past time for Americans to ditch phrases like collateral damage enemy noncombatant nofly zone or even worse safe zone and surgical strike and adopt a language however grim that accurately describes the military realities of this era Words matter especially words about war So as a change of pace instead of the usual bloodless euphemisms and vapid acronyms perhaps the US government could tell the shocking and awful truth to the American people in plain language about the realities and dangers of neverending war
