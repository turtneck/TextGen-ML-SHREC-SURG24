President Obama called for an end to mindless austerity on Thursday as he announced his desire to end sequester spending cuts in his budget for 2015The acrosstheboard cuts agreed to by both parties have been in effect since 2013 after lawmakers were unable to produce a more strategic deficitcutting plan Members of both parties have problems with the cuts which indiscriminately affect both domestic and defense programsObamas proposed 74 billion in added spending  about 7 percent  would be split about evenly between defense programs and the domestic side of the budget Although hes sought before to reverse the sequester spending cuts Obamas pitch in this years budget comes with the added oomph of an improving economy and big recent declines in federal deficitsTaking a defiant tone Obama vowed not to stand on the sidelines as he laid out his opening offer to Congress during remarks in Philadelphia where House Democrats were gathered for their annual retreatWe need to stand up and go on offensive and not be defensive about what we believe in Obama said Mocking Republicans for what he called their leaders newfound interest in poverty and the middle class he questioned whether they would back it up with substance when it matteredRepublicans promise to produce a balanced budget blueprint this spring even as they worry about Pentagon spending The Senates No 2 Republican John Cornyn of Texas dismissed the Obama proposals as happy talk And Sen Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania chided the president for abandoning spending disciplineGOP lawmakers are focused primarily on reversing restraints on military spending while Democrats and Obama are seeking new domestic dollars for education research health care and infrastructure Republicans argue that spending more in so many areas would undo the hardfought reductions in the countrys annual deficitThey also oppose many of the tax hikes Obama has proposed to pay for the increased spendingNeither party has tender feelings for the sequester which cut bluntly across the entire federal budget and was originally designed more as a threat than as an actual spending plan With the economy gaining steam while deficits decline both parties have signaled they want to roll some of the cuts back A bipartisan deal struck previously softened the blow by about a third for the 2014 and 2015 budget yearsBoth parties are generally inclined to boost spending for the military which is wrestling with threats from terrorism and extremist groups and has been strained by budget limits and two long wars At what point do we the institution and our nation lose our soldiers trust asked Gen Raymond Odierno the Army chief of staff at a Senate hearing WednesdayYet among congressional Republicans theres no unanimity about where more Pentagon funds should come from  a division within the GOP that Obama appeared eager to exploitSome House Republicans want to cut domestic agency budgets to free money for the military  an approach that failed badly for Republicans two years ago Some are eying cuts to socalled mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare while others want to ignore the spending restraints altogetherWhatever it takes within reason to get this problem fixed is what Im willing to do said Sen Lindsey Graham RSC adding that he would be willing to consider more tax revenue just to get the damn thing doneThe budget constraints stem from the hardfought budget and debt bill of August 2011 that both parties negotiated and Obama signed into law The threat of acrosstheboard cuts to virtually every federal agency was supposed to force Democrats and Republicans to compromise on smarter less onerous spending cuts but the measure kicked in when a supercommittee failed to reach an overall fiscal dealThe White House said Obamas budget would be fully paid for by cutting inefficient programs and closing tax loopholes  particularly a trust fund provision the White House has been eying Spokesman Josh Earnest said that and a few other tax tweaks would not only pay for Obamas increased spending but also offset middleclass tax cuts the president wants to create or expandAt the same time Earnest was quick to concede No president has ever put forward a budget with the expectation that Congress is going to pass it in its current formDetails of what Obama will ask for in his budget began to trickle out ahead of the budgets formal release Monday The Interior Department announced Obama would seek 1 billion for Native American schools while Vice President Joe Biden said the budget would call for another 1 billion in aid for Central American nationsAt the Pentagon Obamas increases would help pay for nextgeneration F35 fighter jets for ships and submarines and for longrange Air Force tankers On the domestic side Obama has proposed two free years of community college and new or expanded tax credits for child care and spouses who both workIn his meeting with House Democrats Obama also insisted that Republicans must not be allowed to use a funding bill for the Homeland Security Department to try to quash his executive actions on immigration The White House has called that approach a dangerous view that would risk national securityThe Associated Press contributed to this report
