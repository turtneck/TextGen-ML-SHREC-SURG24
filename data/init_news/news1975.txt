  Its Not Broken So Lets Break ItCalifornia Set To Let Public Schools Teach Primarily In Spanish  November 8 2016 1021 am A  a   From The Daily Caller  Reporter 610 PM 11062016 California isnt even close to a swing state in the 2016 presidential election but that doesnt mean nothing is at stake for voters in the nations largest state After Tuesdays vote hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en espaol thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English Californias Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227 a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago in 1998 Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach overwhelmingly in English with limitedEnglish proficiency LEP students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible When passed Proposition 227 overthrew the previous norm of bilingual education  But now with Californias immigrant population higher than ever the state is poised to reverse course Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass Ironically supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues They argue that the bill will allow for dual immersion programs where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment In the long run they argue this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage Dual immersion is legal already it just requires parents consent What these disputes are about is which is the default English or Spanish Supporters also claim that returning to bilingual education will improve students English acquisition favorable ads emphasize that Proposition 58 will ensure that all students learn English But the primary thrust of the proposition is clear Students from nonEnglish homes will find it far easier to have their children be primarily taught in their native tongue while spending far less time learning English
