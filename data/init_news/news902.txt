WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to define what it meant by one person one vote a half century agoThe justices will consider a challenge brought by two rural voters in Texas who claim their state Senate ballots carry less weight than those cast in urban areas with large numbers of noncitizens ineligible to voteUnder the current system in nearly all states state legislative districts are drawn with roughly equal populations The standard dates back to decisions made by the Supreme Court in the early 1960sIf the justices change the standard from total population to legal voters illegal and some legal immigrants would not be counted along with children and most prisoners who have committed felonies That would equalize the power of each vote but result in districts of unequal populationIt also would make it harder for Hispanics in ethnic areas to elect the candidate of their choice because their voting strength would decline or the districts would be less compact and subject to legal challenge That could help Republicans in rural areas and hurt Democrats in citiesStates and localities most likely to feel the effect of any change include Texas California Arizona New Mexico Florida and the New York metropolitan area While only state legislative districts would be affected a separate challenge could be filed to change the way congressional districts are drawnIn the Texas case Sue Evenwels mostly rural district has about 584000 citizens eligible to vote while a neighboring urban district has only 372000 As a result voters in the urban district have more sway to influence the outcomeA federal district court in Texas ruled that the state Legislatures use of total population could not be appealed But as far back as 2001 at least one justice Clarence Thomas had said the issue should be reviewed by the Supreme CourtThe oneperson onevote principle by its terms entitles voters to an equal vote the challengers said Unless the districting process no longer protects that right the judgment below cannot standThe organization behind the challenge the Project on Fair Representation also was the source of other major Supreme Court cases challenging minority preferences Among them Fisher v University of Texas challenging the use of affirmative action policies in college admissions and Shelby County Ala v Holder challenging a major section of the Voting Rights ActThe challengers were backed by a halfdozen conservative and libertarian groups an unusually large number for a case that had yet to be granted by the high courtTexas responded that the justices had never required legislative districts to be drawn based on the number of voters rather than total population Multiple precedents from this court confirm that total population is a permissible apportionment base under the Equal Protection Clause the state saidThe case will be taken up during the courts next term which begins in October
