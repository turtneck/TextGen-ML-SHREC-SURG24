sense if we add to the 16 nations which are carrying out air attacksGermany is providing weapons and equipment to Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in northern Iraq Steinmeier said it was the right

obliging members of the 28nation bloc to give aid and assistance by all the means in their power to a member country that is the victim of armed aggression on its territory French Defense Minister JeanYves Le Drian said EU partners could help either by taking part in Frances operations in Syria or Iraq or by easing the load or providing support for France in other operationsThe airstrikes came as The Wall Street Journal citing two Western security officials reported that 27yearold Abdelhamid Abaaoud had been sought as a target for an airstrike but could not be located A Western intelligence official told the paper that efforts to monitor communications between Abaaoud in Syria and jihadists in Europe were complicated by an inability to tell whether Abaaoud or his teenage brother was speakingAbaaoud was named by French officials as the key figure suspected of planning and organizing the Paris attacks which included a series of suicide bombings outside the countrys national stadium and a massacre at a concert hallHe came to public notice in Belgium last year for taking his then 13yearold brother with him to Syria and appearing in an ISIS propaganda video in which he boasted about his pride in piling the dead bodies of infidel enemies into a trailer At some point Abaaoud returned to Belgium only to escape the authorities in January of this year after police foiled a plot to attack officers he had masterminded on behalf of a cell based in the Belgian town of Verviers In the ensuing gun battle two of Abaaouds alleged accomplices were killed but Abaaoud somehow escapedHe told the monthly ISIS magazine Dabiq in its February issue that he slipped away from European intelligence agencies because Allah blinded their vision He added My name and picture were all over the news yet I was able to stay in their homeland plan operations against them and leave safely when doing so became necessaryFrench officials who identified Abaaoud as a prime suspect to The Associated Press cited chatter from ISIS figures that Abaaoud had recommended a concert as an ideal target for inflicting maximum casualties as well as electronic communications between Abaaoud and one of the Paris attackers who blew himself upWestern officials told the Journal they had no knowledge of the planned attacks on the French capital as they sought Abaaoud and admitted they did not know whether his death would have been enough to stop the attacks which were carried out by seven suicide attackers including a set of three brothersA Belgian official told the Journal it is certain that Abaaoud knew Salah Abdeslam who was being hunted by authorities across Europe early Tuesday on suspicion of his having been involved in the Paris terror The two jihadists grew up not far from each other in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek and spent time in the same prison for petty crimesPeople in Paris fought back in their own way  by continuing to eat drink and be merry Bar and restaurant owners urged
