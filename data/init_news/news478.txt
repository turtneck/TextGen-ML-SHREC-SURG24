Mark Warner Virginia Ron Wyden Oregon In both houses of Congress these were the barest of margins  218 Yes votes in the House and 60 Yes votes in the Senate in each case exactly the minimum required for passage Another indication of how toxic this trade bill is No Democrat dared touch it who didnt want to or have to Black Lives Matter and the TPP And now the TPP has become even more toxic since the Black Lives Matter BLM socialjustice movement has endorsed the antiTPP position Politico Pro has this sub required my emphasis Obamas latest TPP foe Black Lives Matter By Andrew Hanna Monday Oct 31 2016 The Obama administration will face an unexpected adversary as it gears up for what could be a blockbuster lameduck fight over the TransPacific Partnership the Black Lives Matter movement The group  best known best for its protests of police shootings of AfricanAmericans  has joined the fray over the Asian Pacific trade deal as part of its growing focus on economic issues contending the pact would lead to greater racial injustice  It ties past trade deals to the closures of factories that have hurt black workers disproportionately and increased black poverty  Its involvement could influence the votes of a handful of wavering Democrats should Congress tackle TPP during the lame duck There are groups that are going to pay a lot of close attention to what they say especially the Congressional Black Caucus said Bill Reinsch a fellow at the Stimson Center and close tradevote watcher Only a small band of 28 House Democrats voted to give the president fast track authority to complete TPP including three members of the Congressional Black Caucus Reps Gregory Meeks DNY Eddie Bernice Johnson DTexas and Terri Sewell DAla A fourth black caucus member Republican Mia Love of Utah also voted for fasttrack authority With antitrade fervor whipped into a fever pitch by the presidential election campaign their votes are considered key to passage of the pact  and all are under increasing pressure to abandon the president should the pact come to a ratification vote The pretend reason of course for TPP support is support for a major legacy want by the first black president The proClinton members of the Democratic Platform Committee for example resisted to the end any explicit language about TPP on the grounds that the Party must support its president Democrats Prioritize Party Unity Over Including Stand Against TPP In Platform Members of the Democratic National Convention Platform Committee shot down an attempt to include specific opposition to the TransPacific Partnership TPP trade deal in the platform despite the fact that both Democratic presidential candidates have taken positions against the TPP The attempt failed because members appointed by Hillary Clinton and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed it was improper to oppose the TPP when President Barack Obama fervently believes in the agreement However by putting party unity before taking a firm stand against the trade agreement the door was left open for Clinton to go back to supporting the TPP  which was the case when she was secretary of state It is hard for me to understand why Secretary Clintons delegates wont stand behind Secretary Clintons positions in the partys platform Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Even platform committee chair Representative EJ Cummings normally progressive on trade issues chose to vote against the resolution He too bragged about not voting for trade agreements I dont want to do anything as he ends his term to undercut the president of the United States Im just not going to do it And thats where I stand Cummings proclaimed Thats the pretend reason  supporting the first black president  for most of them anyway The real reason is different and not unexpected  money and everything money can buy The Democratic Party as its currently configured exists to enable the fire hose flow of corporate and bigwealth dollars into its coffers Opposing that flow gets you the Sanders treatment but Im not spilling any new beans in saying that This move by Black Lives Matter takes away the pretend reason and thus puts some careers at risk BLM has high visibility at the moment It will be worth watching the result the actual TPP vote as this plays out later What to Watch For in the Lame Duck Once the Democrats figure out how many Republicans will defect from their leadership in each house of Congress there were 50 House Republican defections last time plus six not voting and five Senate defections plus two not voting theyll know how many Democrats will have to take one for the team  vote Yes on TPP so others with reputations to protect like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi  dont have to The numbers needed to pass TPP in the Senate have changed this time Only 51 votes are needed there now thats part of what fast track means Finding 50 No votes in the Senate is not an impossible task but its a very high bar  depending on the way Republicans vote as few as four Democrats like Ron Wyden could guarantee passage So the greatest vulnerability for TPP is in the House  Can Democrats again muster something like 28 procorporate votes Which Democrats will chose to take the fall a second time Corporatists like Ron Kind will eagerly comply But will Earl Blumenauer  bowtie bicycle guy  Will CBC members Sewell and Johnson with BLM lobbying hard against them Or will other House Democrats be needed and willing to take the fall so Pelosi can move TPP across the line Again Fast Track passed the House with zero votes to spare What if the Republican opposition  including the opposition to Speaker Ryan in the wake of the Trump debacle  swells to more than 50 This could be a very close vote TPP Obamas Legacy and A Glide Path to His Life as an ExPresident The Politico article quoted above helpfully notes this about Obamas legacy If successfully pushed through Congress ratification of the trade accord would be the last major piece of legislation of the Obama presidency The prospect that black lawmakers and activists could help to hand him a defeat is complicated by Obamas position as the first black president  This is part of President Obamas legacy  said CBC member Gregory Meeks Will Barack Obama get his legacy wish along with his legacy library and foundation The New York Times a few weeks ago told us this about Obamas future plans and needs Publicly Mr Obama betrays little urgency about his future Privately he is preparing for his postpresidency with the same fierce discipline and fundraising ambition that characterized the 2008 campaign that got him to the White House The longrunning dinner this past February is part of a methodical effort taking place inside and outside the White House as the president first lady and a cadre of top aides map out a postpresidential infrastructure and endowment they estimate could cost as much as 1 billion  The presidents aides did not ask any of the guests for library contributions after the dinner but a number of those at the table could be donors in the future So far Mr Obama has raised just over 54 million from 12 donors with gifts ranging from 100000 to 1 million Michael J Sacks a Chicago businessman gave 666666 Fred Eychaner the founder of Chicagobased Newsweb Corp which owns community newspapers and radio stations donated 1 million Mark T Gallogly a private equity executive and James H Simons a technology entrepreneur each contributed 340000 to a foundation set up to oversee development of the library The real push for donations foundation officials said will come after Mr Obama leaves the White House  Shailagh Murray a senior adviser oversees an effort inside the White House to keep attention on Mr Obamas future and to ensure that his final 17 months in office barring crises serve as a glide path to his life as an expresident  A glide path to his life as an expresident I guess you could call him after his 2008 trademark ever hopeful and looking for change Interesting times indeed 0 0 0 0 0 0
