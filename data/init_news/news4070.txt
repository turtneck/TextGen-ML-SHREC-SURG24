The Democratic vicepresidential nominee SenTim Kaine of Virginia and the Republican nominee Gov Mike Pence of Indiana debated Oct 4 at Longwood University in Farmville Va Here is a roundup of 25suspicious or interesting claims that were made As is our practice we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debatesKaine surely meant to say nuclear weapons but it came out as chemical weapons Later in the debate he said Clinton went toetotoe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russias nuclear stockpileEven so Kaineoverstates the impact of the 2011 New START Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement which Clinton helped negotiate as secretary of stateNew START placed tighter limits on deployed strategic weapons but Russia was actually already meeting the treatys limits for the most part when the treatys implementation began Indeed Russia has increased deployed nuclear weaponsfrom 1537 in February 2011 to 1796in September of this year Also the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons nor does it require them to destroy any existing weaponsRussias total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline from 40000 since 1986 The totalhas hovered around 4500 since 2012 during Obamas presidencyKaine leans way over on his skis here The Iranian nuclear agreement was actually negotiated by Clintons successor John Kerry though Clinton helped tee up the negotiations by increasing sanctions on the Islamic Republic The deal which has been sharply criticized by Republicans did increase the amount of time that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon by reducing its centrifuges for uranium enrichment and its stockpile of enriched uranium international monitoring of Irans nuclear facilities was also implemented But key elements of the deal expire in 15 years some go longer and Irans nuclear infrastructure remains in placeWhile Iran has insisted it has no interest in building nuclear weapons the deal does not eliminate the risk that it will obtain nuclear bombsThe agreement limits Irans civilian nuclear program and it is alsocontains an indefinite prohibition on activities related to a weaponsprogram defined in Annex 1 Section T Whether those elementseliminates thenuclear weapons program is a matter of opinionIndeed Clintons economic plan would raise an estimated 146 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade according to an analysis by economist Mark Zandi But the tax hike falls almost exclusively on the most highly paid the analysis saysThis figure does not take into account the impact of her other proposals on the economy For example his report also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans the economy would add an additional 32 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency Combined with anticipated job creation under current law that adds up to 104 million jobs But the report also said that Clinton would face significant roadblocks to getting her economic plan through Congress resulting in far fewer job gainsTrump has indeed said all of those thingsDuring his campaign announcement Trump said When Mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best Theyre not sending you Theyre not sending you Theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us Theyre bringing drugs Theyre bringing crime Theyre rapists And some I assume are good people We awarded Trumps claim connecting illegal immigrants from Mexico and crime Four PinocchiosIn 2007 Trump called Rosie ODonnell a slob a pig and a degenerate in a single speech He has called Arianna Huffington a dog and said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had the face of a dogTrump did say that the Indianaborn US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel had an inherent conflict of interest because of his Mexican heritage and Trumps plan to build a wall along the USMexico border Trump has said McCain was not a war hero and that McCain is a war hero because he was captured I like people that werent captured Trump has indeed said We have a situation where we have our inner cities African Americans Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous And Trump was one of the most highprofile birthers who questioned whether Obama was a US citizenEarlier in the campaign Trump said women who receive illegal abortions should be subject to some sort of punishment But he reversed that statement several hours later after widespread criticism from those on both sides of the abortion rights issue He amended his statement to say that the doctors not women should be punishedThis is correct A key difference here is that Nixon did not release his taxes while he was a presidential candidate he did so in 1973 a year after he was reelectedPresidential candidates have no legal obligation to release their returns but there has long been a tradition to do so for the sake of transparency Trump has cited a pending Internal Revenue Service audit even though the first president to release his taxes Nixon did so in the middle of an audit Moreover Trump has not released his tax returns from before 2009 which are no longer under audit according to his attorneyPence is correct on raw numbers regarding education spending but is incorrect when the figures are adjusted for inflationIn fiscal year2017 state spending on higher education and K12 education is the largest in Indianas history But adjusted for inflation the 2017 appropriations are not quite as high as they were in 2010 and 2011 said Lawrence DeBoer Purdue University economist and an expert on Indianas state budget By 2017 Indiana state spending on education will be almost back to 2011 levels DeBoer saidOn infrastructurePence began improving the states roads only after an emergency repair of the Interstate 65 bridge led to a monthlong traffic problem and caused a political liability the Associated Press reported Political ads attacked Pence for saving money in the states reserves at the expense of underfunding the states infrastructurePence then proposed a plan to improve roads that relied on borrowing drawing down state reserves and accounting gimmicks to reach an advertised 1 billion sticker price the APreported In the end he got just a fraction of that after Indianas Republicancontrolled Legislature balked And much of the money set aside for local governments came from local taxes held in state reserves that were already supposed to be returnedClintonhas said she would expand Obamas executive actions on immigration and has advocated for comprehensive immigration reform including a pathway to citizenshipBut she also has supported enhanced border security And her immigration proposal includes humane targeted and effective enforcement and focusing immigrationresources on detaining and deporting those who pose a threat to public safetyUpdate Hacked emails released on Oct 7 showed Clinton apparently said in a paid closeddoor speechto a Brazilian bank My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders through green energyThe Clinton campaign has refused to authenticate the hacked emails but campaign manager Robby Mook said in an Oct 9 CBS Face the Nation interview that Clinton was talking about integrating green energy between North and South America  If the question is Does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders Absolutely not And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interests of workers in this countryThis is correct Clinton has said she supports President Obamas decision to accept 10000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 and that she would support an increase up to 65000 That is a 550 percent increase from 10000 But Clinton has not yet disclosed her plan for the new fiscal year or beyondThis map below shows where Syrian refugees have ended up in the United StatesMaybe the GOP ticket did not precisely use the word great or better but Kaine pretty much hits the target herePence told CNN just a few weeks ago I think its inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been Pence made these remarksjust after Trump asserted that Putin has been a leader far more than our president has been a leaderKaine repeats a line that recently earned Hillary Clinton Three Pinocchios But no credible analyst would cite the Bush tax cuts as playing a key role in spurring the economic crashKaine puts it even more starkly than Clinton The Clinton campaign tried to suggest income inequality exacerbated by tax cuts led to the stagnation of the middle class and spurred excess borrowing and leverage  key components of the crash along with lax regulation But thats a real stretch given that ahousing bubble was the key trigger The causes of the Great Recession are complex and debatable but theres no debate that itis wrong to put the Bush tax cuts at the top of the listThis isnt a direct quote about deporting all undocumented immigrants but Trump did say that all criminal illegal immigrants likely referring to undocumented immigrants convicted of a crime are going to be gone It will be overAmong other claims Trump made at the Aug 31 Phoenix rally about removing those here illegallyBut Trumpalso laid out his deportation priorities during the speech Among themTargetingat least 5 million and as many as 65 million undocumented immigrants who would be subject to swift removal That is about half of the 11 million undocumented people estimated to be living in the United StatesPence misconstrued anAssociated Press report here similar to the way Donald Trump did earlier in the campaignThe AP analyzed State Department records and looked specifically at Clintons meetings on the phone or in person with 154 people who were not federal employees or foreign government representatives This narrowed down the denominator to a small subcategory of people Clinton met with as secretary of state since the majority of her diplomatic work would involve representatives of foreign governments In addition the AP reportis based on partial records released by the State Department so far and does not reflect the full scope of people with whom Clinton met as secretary of stateThe AP found that 85 of those 154 people or more than half had donated to the Clinton Foundation or pledged commitments to its international programs The 85 donors collectively contributed as much as 156 million the AP reported There were representatives from at least 16 foreign governments who donated as much as 170 million to the charity but those representatives were not included in the 154 number the AP reportedThis is wrong Counting from January 2009 nearly 11 million privatesector jobs have been created in the United States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics If you count all jobs including government jobs the figure is 105 millionSo how does Kaine come up with 15 million Hes counting from the low point for jobs in Obamas presidency February 2010 When you start the clock from then the tally is 15 million privatesector jobs and 148 million overall jobsThe last time we checked February 2010 was 6 12 years ago So with this claim Kaine is trying to wipe off a year of Obamas presidencyMoreover as a general matter regular readers know that we tend to discount jobcreation records by a president as so much of the record is due to economic forces beyond a presidents controlMark Zandi a respected economist at Moodys Analytics did issue a report saying that if Trumps economic plans were fully implemented 35 million jobs would disappear incomes would stagnate debt would explode and stock prices would plummet This compares to an anticipated increase of 6 million jobs under current Obama administration policies In another report Zandi also said that if Clinton were able to fully implement her economic plans the economy would create an additional 32 million jobs during the first four years of her presidency Combined with anticipated job creation under current law that adds up to 104 million jobsBut both reports were highly skeptical that either candidate would be able to get their plans through Congress  even a Republicancontrolled one during a Trump presidency  because so many of Trumps positions are such a departure from GOPprinciples Even so the report said the US economy would likely suffer under a Trump presidency The report was issued in June and Moodys has not issued an updated report that would reflect additional policies announced by Trump including a revised tax plan But the report said Trumps trade policies would be especially damagingPence makes it sound like this is US taxpayer money  and he uses a toohigh estimate Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe With sanctions lifted in theory those funds would be unlockedBut the Treasury Department has estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations it would have about 55 billion left Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China For its part the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually 32 billion not 55 billionTrump has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete but he has not said he wants to get rid of it Asked specifically by The Washington Post in March if he wanted to pull out of NATO he said Idont want to pull it out NATO was set up at a different time NATO was set up when we were a richer country Were not a rich country anymore  I think NATO as a concept is good but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved Trump has argued that distribution of costs has to be changed but as we have noted Trump frequently overstates the burden on the United StatesKaine is referring to Trumps 2000 book The America We Deserve where he made such a comparison about Social Security and said he wanted to privatize the program The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme The pyramids are made of papermacheTrump added in the book Privatization would be good for all of us As it stands today 136 percent of women on Social Security live in povertyBut that book was published 16 years ago On the campaign trail Trump has said he wants to keep Social Security intact Im not going to cut it His specific plans for the program however are vague His campaign has said the key to preserving Social Security and other programs that benefit AARP members is to have an economy that is robust and growingFor more on Social Security and allegations it is a Ponzi scheme see The Fact Checkers guide to critical questions about the programThis is a zombie claim that just wont go away We have awarded it Three Pinocchios and fact checkers repeatedly debunked this during the 2012 presidential electionIndeed the number of ships 272 as of Oct 4 is the lowest count since 1916 245 ships But a lot has changed in 100 years including the need and capacity of ships After all its now a matter of modern nuclearpowered fleet carriers versus the gunboats and small warships of 100 years ago The push for ships under the Reagan era to build the Navy up to 600ship levels no longer exists and ships from that era are now retiringThis talking point is a poor way to depict the countrys naval fleet needs Gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are not the same And military budgets fleet needs and historical circumstances are much different in 2015 than they were in 1916Pence reprises a GOP talking point from the 2012 campaign but its not correct Obama substituted a different system but it was on the recommendation of thenDefense Secretary Robert Gates a Republican Gates in fact had recommended the original plan to President George W Bush and then decided the new system implemented by Obama was more effective less costly and timelier than the Bush planGates in his 2013 memoir noted that while the Obama administration had stumbled in failing to lay the diplomatic groundwork for the shift looking like a bunch of bumbling fools the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries The Polish and Czech governments were relieved he wroteI sincerely believed the new program was better  more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat Gates added While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian reset we in Defense did not Making the Russians happy wasnt exactly on my todo listIn fact Gates says the Russians quickly concluded that the Obama plan was even worse from their perspective as it eventually might have capabilities that could be used against Russian intercontinental missilesHow ironic that US critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians Gates added sardonically It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington  just once in my career  say Well I got that wrongTrump has walked back the particular claim that Kaine cites that wages are too high Of course Trump has flipflopped on the minimum wage at least five times since August 2015 and has consistently contradicted his own statements making it hard to track exactly where he stands on the issue at a given time Trumps stance on this matter as of August 2016 was that he supports raising it to 10 at the federal level but believes states should set the minimum wage as appropriate for their stateDuring a November 2015 Republican primary debate Trump was asked whether he was sympathetic to the protesters cause since a 15 wage works out to about 31000 a year His full answer with the part Kaine is quoting in boldDays later Trump clarified he was referring to whether he would increase the minimum wage He would not raise it because then it would be too high he saidKaine correctly notes that Pence as a congressman voted in 2007 against raising the minimum wage above 515Pence made this claim in the context of abortion and choosing whether to be for or against abortion rights But polling does not support this In fact it shows young adults views on abortion rights are about the same as their elders unlike issues like marijuana and gay marriage where young people are more liberalAmong adults aged 18 to 29 58 percent said abortion should be legal in all or mostcases and 39 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases according to a 2014 Pew Research Center poll That was similar to those aged 30 to 49 59 percent supported abortion 38 percent opposed and those aged 50 to 64 56 percent supported 37 percent opposedPartialbirth abortion is usually used to refer to laterterm abortions using a specific fetusextraction methodClinton has said she supports a ban on lateterm abortions including partialbirth abortions as long as the health and the life of the mother are protected As senator Clinton opposed the PartialBirth Abortion Act of 2003 which did not include a health exceptionEarlier this year Clinton again said she is on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the motherTrump has indeed said that countries such as South Korea Japan and Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons because nuclear proliferation is inevitable Trump has said that countries like Japan and South Korea would be better off if they were armed with nuclear weapons in order to defend themselves from North Korea And Trumps said he considers nuclear weapons a last resort though he would not rule anything out regarding their useFor example during a CNN town hall in March Trump was asked So if you said Japan yes its fine you get nuclear weapons South Korea you as well and Saudi Arabia says we want them tooTrump answered Can I be honest with you Its going to happen anyway Its going to happen anyway Its only a question of time Theyre going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely But you have so many countries already China Pakistan you have so many countries Russia you have so many countries right now that have themThis is an odd inaccurate comment The RussiaGeorgia war took place in 2008 when Clinton was still a US senator Bushs secretary of state Condoleezza Rice lodged the protests Whatever diplomatic pressure the Bush team had put on Russia over Georgia was abandoned when President Obama was elected and the administration decided to pursue the illfated resetKaine gets this right as Pence repeated a false claim that is popular on the right The Clinton Foundation does not dole out grants like a typical foundation but instead directs the donations it raises directly for specified charitable activities So simply only looking at the grants does not tell the whole story about the foundations activitiesThe American Institute of Philanthropys Charity Watch gives the Clinton Foundation an A rating for its efficiency the top rating is A It says the foundation spends 88 percent of its expenses on programs and 12 percent on overhead It also says the Clinton Foundation spends just 2 to raise 100Send us
