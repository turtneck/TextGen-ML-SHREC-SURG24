On Friday morning a US airstrike killed Abu Alaa alAfri a senior leader in ISIS whom the US says it considers the organizations secondranked leaderThis isnt the first time alAfri has been reported dead  though the US government has allegedly verified his deathBut if as seems likely alAfri is dead this will be yet another instance in which ISISs No 2 official has been killed In August of last year for example a US airstrike killed Fadhil Ahmad alHayali then identified as the groups No 2This continues a trend that news consumers may recognize from counterterrorism efforts against alQaeda in which the group seemed to lose one thirdincommand after Osama bin Laden and Ayman alZawahiri after anotherAs some Twitter wags noted this all harks back to a 2006 Onion article Eighty Percent Of AlQaeda No 2s Now DeadBut whats actually going on here Why is the US killing so many ISIS deputies while somehow failing to hit leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadi And does it even matter when you kill toplevel ISIS officialsAnalysts have developed a few theories as to why the US keeps hitting secondincommands but not the leader One of the most plausible is that Baghdadi is a much harder target whereas the nature of the No 2 job involves exposing oneself to greater risk of being targetedAs a leader Baghdadi serves as ISISs chief executive and ideological head He doesnt have to move around all that much or actually go out in the field his job mostly involves issuing orders and on occasion making propaganda tapesThat means he can sit wherever hes hiding out avoiding the kind of contact with the outside world that makes it easier for US intelligence agencies to find youHowever not every ISIS leader has the luxury of doing that Baghdadis top subordinates the ones he gives orders to have to go out in the field and run ISIS operations If you command a major combat theater in Iraq for example you actually have to be in that part of Iraq If you run ISIS finances you need to make sure the extortion and oil operations are running smoothlyWhen youre out actually doing the work  managing ISIS outposts talking to people lower down on the food chain  you cant hide away like Baghdadi does That makes it easier for US electronic satellite or human intelligence assets to find you  and serve up targeting data for an airstrikeThis difference in responsibilities probably explains why the US despite targeting Baghdadi multiple times hasnt managed to kill him  and yet has successfully taken out many of his deputiesThat would be my guess Will McCants a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution told meWhile the US government is understandably trumpeting its alleged strike on alAfri theres reason to suspect that killing the groups No 2 isnt actually all that consequentialGroups such as ISIS and alQaeda are bureaucratic by design so they are often able to deal with dronestruck senior officers by rapidly promoting new people to replace themThis theory got some quantitative support in a 2014 study by the University of Georgias Jenna Jordan who found that socalled decapitation strikes  in which the US killed a senior leader of a terrorist group  had little effect on reducing violence from that groupIn the paper Jordan argues that this is because alQaeda is a bureaucratic organization It has something like a formal command structure division of labor clear assignment of responsibilities and the like This allows lowerlevel leaders to take over after one is killedAnd this would likely apply to ISIS as wellEach individual decapitation doesnt cripple the organization Daveed GartensteinRoss a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies told meSo alAfris killing probably will not in itself be that consequential for ISISs futureThat said GartensteinRoss pointed out that alAfri had strong connections within the alQaeda network ISIS and alQaeda are at war in Syria which distracts and thus weakens both of them and there is little reason to believe that this is changingBut GartensteinRoss points out that the possibility of rapprochement while already quite low may have just gotten a little lower with alAfris killingGiven his connections there was a danger that he could be involved in rapprochement between alQaeda and the Islamic State he saidHowever the ideological and personal gaps between the two groups will likely remain too wide to bridge anytime in the near future That would have been true even if alAfri had lived So his death is probably not a substantial change for ISISs prospects
