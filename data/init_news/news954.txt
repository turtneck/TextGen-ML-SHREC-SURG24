Washington CNN No deal is better than a bad deal say critics of President Barack Obamas nuclear talks with IranBut what if Republican and Democratic opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacyThe price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between Iran and the West  potentially leading to warWe would have to deal with a resumption of Irans nuclear activities which we dont want to see take place Iran would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions which they dont want said Gary Samore a top nonproliferation official during Obamas first termFor now the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the United States and Iran are still at the table as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions beckonSecretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif are haggling over the remaining issues in Lausanne Switzerland ahead of an endofthemonth deadline for a framework agreement which then must be finalized by July 1But time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled Irans economy in return for assurances that Tehran will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bombThe White House puts the chances of a deal at only 5050 Disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure Iran will be allowed to keep the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspectionsDespite the controversy stoked last week in Washington when 47 GOP senators sent a letter to Irans leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed many analysts believe that the talks will go on even if the endofMarch deadline slipsNot because all sides are desperate to keep talking But I think sufficient momentum has been created in the last month or so that they see real possibilities said Robert Einhorn a former senior US State Department arms control officialObama may now have slightly more political leeway on the talks than before  ironically because of attempts by US and Israeli critics to pen him inA few weeks ago skeptical Democrats appeared to be lining up with Republicans and approaching a vetoproof Senate majority that could have forced Obama to submit a deal to Congress or accept the passage of new sanctions Either move could have killed the agreementBut the Republicans letter and a fiercely critical speech to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the proposed deal prompted some skeptical Democrats to close ranks at least temporarilyBut Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNNs Dana Bash on State of the Union that Obama was on the cusp of agreeing a very bad deal that would allow Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact He said that if an agreement is reached he would bring up legislation that would give Congress 60 days to back or reject a deal despite fresh pleas from the White House for the GOP to hold off If no deal is reached McConnell said on Sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on Iran he saidRepublican sources meanwhile said that despite the furor over the letter from the senators no Democrats had yet formally pulled support for legislation requiring the Senate to have a say on the deal That leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on Iran in the coming monthsThe opening for diplomacy is meanwhile not endless And if no deal emerges by July political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards Iran may be unstoppableIf diplomacy fails how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses who gets the blame and the political pressures exerted on Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Washington and TehranIf at the end of June there is not a deal and talks have broken off I think that it is inevitable that the Congress will adopt new sanctions legislation said Einhorn now with the Brookings InstitutionWhat that will mean is the Iranians will reciprocateIran could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20 level that would get it closer to a weaponAnd if it bars international inspectors the world would have no idea how far Iran is from making a bombThe administration thinks that if the United States gets the blame for using hardball tactics that derail talks  if say Congress imposes more sanctions as administration critics want  there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place let alone double down and impose new onesIn addition to unilateral US sanctions Congress has imposed the United Nations European Union and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off Iran from international partners and not just the American economyCornelius Adebahr a European security specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace predicted Iran would reap a propaganda victoryIt would give ammunition for Iran to say the US is not reliable he saidMassachusetts Institute of Technologys Jim Walsh a specialist on the talks said the Iranian government would have little choice but to hit back at a tougher US stanceThe Iranians are just not going to take it They are going to feel condemned to respond Both sides will take their shovels and dig the holes deeperWalsh continued We would be between a lame duck US president for whom negotiations had just failed a weakened Rouhani for whom negotiations have just failed and a coming US presidential election  not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlementAborted negotiations that leave Iran rededicated to its nuclear program raise the specter of Tehran with a bomb  or some enemy country taking military action to stop itBut critics of the deal being worked out in Switzerland dont agree that such an outcome is the likeliest scenarioGOP hawks and Israel believe Tehran is so desperate for sanctions relief especially at a time of low oil prices that it will have no choice but to offer a better deal than the one currently on the table and agree to the complete halt to uranium enrichment that Israel and conservatives demandIf Iran threatens to walk away from the table  and this often happens in a Persian bazaar  call their bluff Theyll be back because they need the deal a lot more than you do Netanyahu maintained in his Congress speechFormer Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made the case in a USA Today oped Friday that Obama should walk away from a flimsy nuclear agreementThose opposed to the deal reject the administration that follow their advice would likely blow up the talks and set Washington on an inevitable path to war as the only remaining way to disable Irans nuclear infrastructureInstead GOP congressmen counter that several bills they are pushing with significant Democratic support do not forestall the possibility of continued diplomacy if talks fail They say that extra sanctions would increase Obamas leverage in diplomacy not weaken itEven if talks do succeed this year the longterm future of an agreement still wouldnt be assuredThe diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in Tehran who whatevers written on paper could push to illicitly expand Irans nuclear program and close in on a bomb Its not just Republicans who fear Tehran may violate any deal or test the limits of compliance Some people who back the talks admit that may be the case tooIn Washington Congress will be required to lift the existing sanctions on Iran to sustain the agreement in years to come  a step that is hardly a givenAnd the stiff Republican opposition means a deal is not assured of surviving the arrival of a new president in the White House come 2017 A future Republican president could reverse Obamas sanctions waivers fairly quickly as the senators warned in their letter to IranWhether the new president would want to do so is another matter however especially if Iran lives up to the terms of a deal which would include stringent verification by international inspectorsHe or she would risk a heavy political price A unilateral Washington pullout would likely infuriate US partners and leave the rookie president facing a boiling crisis that could overwhelm the new administrations nascent foreign policyThats what the administration is counting on  if there is compliance and the deal is working well said EinhornKerry reminded Congress this week that Britain France Germany China and Russia would all be cosignatories of a dealIf all those countries have said this is good and its working will a new president just turn around and nullify it on behalf of the United States he asked Thats not going to happenCongress would face the same costbenefit calculation when it comes to the sanctions only lawmakers can expunge In the event of a Democratic White House victory in 2016 the congressional math could also change in favor of a dealAnd if Republicans keep their majorities lawmakers who are bent on thwarting Obama may be less willing to handcuff a new GOP president
