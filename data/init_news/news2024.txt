Washington CNN It might be the best job in town  at the worst possible timePresident Barack Obama is suddenly searching for a new Supreme Court justice after the death of conservative icon Antonin Scalia left a rare vacancy at the pinnacle of US jurisprudenceNormally an open spot on the exalted bench  complete with a lifetime tenure and a boatload of benefits  would have those who labor in the laws dusty obscurity salivating at the chance to crown their careers in the black robes of the nations highest court And candidates with political inclinations have extra incentive to covet this particular seat as it comes with a chance to tilt the ideological balance of the court and shape the nations future for decadesScalia speaks at the University of Minnesota as part of the law schools

was one of the most influential conservative justices in history He was 79US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia who was found dead on Saturday February 13 was one of the most influential conservative justices in history He was 79But this time things are differentWhoever accepts Obamas nomination will walk into a wall of political fire A pitched battle is already raging over Scalias seat embroiling the White House Congress and presidential candidates eager to whip up grassroots activistsWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz insisted Monday that Obama will nominate a successor to ScaliaBut for all their troubles whoever is chosen could very well not end up with the jobSenate Republicans are warning that they may not even grant Obamas nominee a hearing saying it should be up to the next president to fill the vacancyA nominee could be left hanging in limbo for a year with no guarantee that even if a Democrat wins in November theyll end up on the court Of course if a Republican wins the White House they can forget itAt worst if the GOP relents and holds confirmation hearings the nominee could emerge so damaged by the political tumult that their reputation could be shredded along with their hopes of one day reaching the Supreme CourtFor Obamas next nominee the ordeal will be many times worse And there doesnt seem any obvious way for Obama to shield his pickIt is possible that he could bend this like Beckham and get it through Jonathan Turley a professor of law at George Washington University told CNNs Jim Scuitto But I wouldnt bet on it it The fact is you are replacing a conservative icon Any moderate nominee is going to move this needle to the left on the court and it is going to be a battle royaleThe sudden opening on the court is emerging as a top issue in an already vicious White House campaign and threatens to expose the eventual nominee to the full fury of the conservative political legal and media machineSo it would be no wonder if a candidate might choose to take a pass on the partisan anger that surrounded the likes of Clarence Thomas who did make it to the court Ronald Reagans nominee Robert Bork and Harriet Miers George W Bushs White House counsel and Supreme Court pick did not make it through the acrimonious processIt would be difficult to see for instance why one oftenmentioned potential presidential nominee Kamala Harris the California Attorney General who is running for a Senate seat would instead opt for a Supreme Court spot that might be a mirageThere might also be a case for the President to take on a pass on someone like Sri Srinivasan a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who many see as a Supreme Court justice in waitingSrinivasan who has historic potential as the first IndianAmerican on the high court was confirmed unanimously by the Senate for his current post But his supporters might see a nomination now as a waste given the risk that he could be burned by a bitter confirmation process and left too stigmatized to be viable in futureSo what type of nominee might be willing to take on such a poisoned chaliceFor sure whoever is picked would have to be a rare glutton for punishment But some legal experts believe the White House will still have no trouble drawing up a listNumber One  most judges if they are not sitting on the Supreme Court toil in relative anonymity said Professor David Ryden of Hope College Michigan whose research focuses on the how the Supreme Court influences the electoral process They are human beings There is the lure of the limelight and there is the honor of being namedDaniel Franklin a Georgia State University political science professor and author of the book Pitiful Giants Presidents In Their Final Term said that for lawyers the Supreme Court is the equivalent of the big leagues That could mean that even a nomination as challenged as this one is specialIf you say you have a remote chance of playing center fielder for the Dodgers I would take it he said It is still a pretty big dealThere are some potential ways out of the imbroglio for Obama that involve finding an unorthodox candidate who might be flattered by a nominationSince the effort to replace Scalia comes in the twilight of his presidency Obama has much less leverage than when he picked Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in his first termThat means he may have no choice but to settle on someone less palatable to liberals but who might increase his minimal chances of winning a confirmationThe president is on the ideological spectrum at one point and the Senate is on the ideological spectrum on another said Franklin Even in a normal circumstance the President has to meet the Senate somewhere in the middle with his preference while getting someone as close to his preference as possibleFranklin added Now he has to move that point closer and closer to the Senates point of preferenceIf Obamas priority is to get a justice confirmed at all costs he could call Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnells bluff and name a moderate establishment Republican who GOP senators would feel forced to support  perhaps someone like GOP Sens Orrin Hatch of Utah or Sen Thad Cochran of Mississippi as the nominee Franklin saidBut that approach  effectively installing a prolife nominee with big abortion cases looming  would enrage Obamas liberal backersStill it would move the court incrementally left on some issues from where it stood when Scalia was alive And since Hatch and Cochran are 81 and 78 respectively they would unlikely be a choice that would haunt the President for decadesSuch a scenario however seems remote given the political ire of the times Obama seems more likely to take a more nakedly political routeHe could pick someone he knows is unlikely to be confirmed but who would be willing to do a service for their party and become a cause celebre throughout election seasonA politician already locked in the heat of partisan battle might work in this case  thats why the names of Democratic Sens Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been floated Neither have reelection races in 2016 and both are rumored to have presidential ambitions that might benefit from a spell in the national partisan spotlightAnd if for some reason their colleagues found it impossible to block them in the Senates clubby atmosphere there are worst places to end up than on the Supreme CourtAnother approach would be to choose a candidate who is a woman or a minority  perhaps someone from the Hispanic community  who could be crucial in driving up Democratic turnout in NovemberStalwart Republican opposition to such a nominee would enable Democrats to paint the GOP as prejudiced and motivated by considerations other than legal reservations  and perhaps might embarrass some swingstate Senate Republicans up for reelectionAnd even some judges already on lower courts might be willing to serve as a political placeholders for such a strategy said Ryden of Hope CollegeJudges have their own political preferences and agendas and there are many on the federal court bench  who would fit that label and be happy to collaborate on a strategy with the White House  even if they werent the ones who would immediately benefit from it he said
