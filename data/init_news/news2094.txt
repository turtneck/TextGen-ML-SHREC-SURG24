Last year during the early days of the presidential campaign Donald Trump boldly promised Im gonna win the Hispanic voteThe past few days have suggested he was wrong After Trumps immigration speech focused on deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants and building a wall at the USMexico border several of his top Latino advisers resigned or threatened to resign And a new huge survey shows Trump isnt just losing the Latino vote  hes losing it by far more than the past few decades of Republican presidential candidatesThe survey by Americas Voice and Latino Decisions found that if the election were held today 70 percent of registered Latino voters would vote for Hillary Clinton Only 19 percent would vote for Trump About 2 percent said they wont vote for president 4 percent said theyd vote for someone else and 4 percent said theyre undecided or dont knowThe findings are quite credible The survey was huge reaching 3729 Latino registered voters online and by phone between August 19 and 30 It has a margin of error of 16 percentage pointsThe findings are incredibly damning for Trump To put this in context this means that the Republican Party and Trump have effectively eliminated any gains the party made with Latino voters under President George W Bush who supported immigration reform that would have allowed unauthorized immigrants to gain legal statusIn 2000 and 2004 Bush got 35 and 40 percent of the Latino vote That was up from the share of the vote that Ronald Reagan 35 and 37 percent George HW Bush 30 and 25 percent Bob Dole 21 percent got It was also higher than what John McCain 31 percent and Mitt Romney 27 percent got in subsequent electionsTrumps numbers then are below the previous six Republicans to run for president And theyre especially low at a time when the Latino population has grown  from 148 million people in 1980 to 552 million in 2014As for why Trump has so little support among Latino voters its basically what youd expect 70 percent said that Trump has made the Republican Party more hostile to Latinos And 68 percent said that Trumps views on immigrants and immigration made them less likely to vote for Republicans in NovemberMeanwhile 75plus percent of Latino voters said President Barack Obamas actions on immigration  such as letting undocumented immigrant youth stay in the country  made them more likely to vote for Democrats And 64 percent said Hillary Clintons views on immigrants and immigration made them more likely to vote for DemocratsSo Republicans seemed to be on a downward trend with Latino voters after George W Bush But with Obama Clinton and Trump that slide seems to have sped up by quite a bit
