Physical Gold Demand and Fear Posted on Home  Silver  Silver News  Physical Gold Demand and Fear These two factors are clearly in play today as the metals move higher in a surge weve been expecting since late last week However these gains might just as quickly be reversed so there are a few indicators youd better be watching From Craig Hemke TFMetals  As mentioned in the title of this post both physical demand and fear seem to be driving price today How can we measure physical demand Sometimes it shows up as a lack of overnight London Monkey trading As prices were firming last week we noticed this phenomena occurring again httpwwwtfmetalsreportcomblog7941somepossibleencouragement And now look at the action overnight earlier today in London Dont ask me to quantify this because I cant This is pure conjecture based upon learned experience As Ive followed this stuff daily for nearly seven years now Ive noticed a clear correlation between London demand and the London Monkey daily price smash And this clearly correlates with price trend So when The London Monkeys stand downas they have more than half the time the past two weeksthis tells me that demand for physical is strong on London and consequently you can expect price to rise in New York too Also affecting things today is fear This is the fear that Donald Trump is going to be the next president of The United StatesI guess Why this is such a fear I dont know Perhaps instead a better word is uncertainty The gold price is anticipating the uncertainty that a Trump victory would bring Either way when you get a 14point turnaround in a major national poll just one week before the election the effect is rather startling httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsthefixwp20161101postabctrackingpollclintonfallsbehindtrumpinenthusiasmbuthasedgeinearlyvoting And its not just the metals Weve been tracking the impending breakout and surge in Bitcoin too and its up 3 today and back through 700 Since the previous breakouts on this weekly chart added 40 or so to the Bitcoin price Id say your next target is likely near 1000 Turning to the metalsJust yesterday we discussed the likelihood of a surge higher Prices had found support atnear the respective 200day MAs and with copper surging higher we thought that a move like were seeing today was coming And while this is all very nice well and good we really havent accomplished anything significant until prices move back above the 50day moving averages Yes silver never closed below its 200day and gold is now more than 1 back above its own 200dayBUTif you want to reverse the recent downtrend and get the hot momochasing Spec HFT algo money to come charging back into the synthetic paper gold derivative then you need this move to extend up to and through the 50day For the sake of clarity the charts below show nothing but the location of the 50day MA for both the Dec16 gold and Dec16 silver THESE ARE THE KEY LEVELS TO WATCH A move through and close above these levels should excite the algos and drive price even higher So watch them both very closely and be sure to note the sharp down angle of both too This makes the pressure to jump to and through even greater Two other key indicators were going to be sure to keep watching are copper and the HUI Copper is up another 1 as I type This is the 7th consecutive up day and I have a last of 2222 The HUI is also higher but not as much as you might hopeexpect Ive got it at 218 and up about 55 points What should you be watching Lets get copper to continue higher and move up and out of this pennant AND lets get the HUI back above 220 Both of these would help spur the metals even higher too Theres a lot more going on but I think Ill stop here so that we can get this posted for everyone TF
