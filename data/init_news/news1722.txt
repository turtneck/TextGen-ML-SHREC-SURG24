FERGUSON Mo  Unrelenting protests over the death of an unarmed black teen here last summer thrust this St Louis suburb and its 21000 residents into an international spotlight and ushered in a year of national changesFerguson Police officer Darren Wilson who is white fatally shot Michael Brown Jr a black 18yearold on Aug 9 2014 The encounter lasted just two minutes but the shooting led to months of massive and at times violent protests The world watched as crowds hurled bottles and looted liquor stores while police in military gear threw tear gas and clashed with those on the streetsUnder the slogan BlackLivesMatter Ferguson protesters kicked off a movement around alleged incidents of police misconduct leading to rallies in several cities with such cases Although a grand jury did not indict Wilson and the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges against the officer Browns violent death prompted a national look at alleged racial profiling police brutality and the relationship between police officers and communities of colorA year later all I can say is that Mike Brown his death his murder have given me a new sense of purpose in life and that is to always be a truth teller and to stay true to why I came out on Aug 9 says Johnetta Elzie 26 who emerged as leader in the Black Lives Matter movement as the protests developed I didnt come because there was an organization that asked me to come I came because I was tired of seeing black people dead in the street by the hands of police officersBlackLivesMatter coalesced into a partnership of leaders and organizations Last month in Cleveland hundreds of protests came together for the inaugural Movement for Black Lives Convening Elzie and others regularly fly to cities where a fatal police encounter has occurred to support local protestersBrowns death and the protests that followed also turned the spotlight on other controversial deaths including Tamir Rice 12 shot while playing with a toy gun on Nov 22 by a Cleveland police officer Walter Scott 50 shot on April 4 by a North Charleston SC police officer while allegedly running away and most recently Samuel DuBose 43 shot on July 19 during a traffic stop by a University of Cincinnati police officerHearing statistics of police brutality incidents can be jarring but seeing new cases every few days forces you to acknowledge the pervasiveness of police brutality said Keisha BentleyEdwards a professor at the University of TexasAustin who studies race adolescence and academic and social developmentSeeing the impact on an actual person their families and their communities personalizes these incidents beyond numbers she saidIn Ferguson the police chief a local judge and a city manager who are all white resigned after a Justice Department review found that the Ferguson Police Department engaged in a broad pattern of racially biased enforcement that permeated the citys justice system including the use of unreasonable force against black suspects Two of the citys new leaders interim Police Chief Andre Anderson who began work July 22 and Interim City Manager Ed Beasley who was hired June 9 are black Fergusons population is 67 blackPolice departments elsewhere sought to buy body cameras while other departments added training on diversity community engagement bias and how to deescalate tense encountersAt the national level President Obama created a Task Force on 21st Century Policing and banned the sale of some kinds of military equipment to local law enforcement agenciesPolicing has taken a hard look at itself said Chuck Wexler executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum There has been a renewed emphasis on looking at how we hire how we train how we investigate how we release information to the public All of these aspects have had a seismic impact on policingDarrel Stephens executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs said police departments are studying the findings of President Obamas task force and looking at ways to implement its recommendationsIts safe to say police officers are a little bit more cautious about what they are doing and how they approach their work today Stephens saidYet police are also frustrated he said Police budgets have remained flat making it impossible for some departments to modernize equipment boost training and increase salaries to retain and recruit the best people he saidSome police officers have grown weary of constant comparison to those police officers who abuse their power Fear of provoking the next Ferguson has made some officers unwilling to be aggressive at their jobs said James Pasco executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police Pasco credits aggressive policing tactics for making communities much safer and lowering crime rates over the past 20 yearsDarren Wilson will be forever scarred and forever affected by this and so will every other officer every time they think of the event Pasco said Its going to have a chilling effect on their willingness to undertake that kind of appropriately aggressive policingFor Elzie one of the Black Lives Matter organizers the changes have yet to go far enough This year she will work toward legislation passed to hold police accountable for any misconductI hate that it keeps happening and we have to keep paying attention to these deaths Elzie said That is depressing
