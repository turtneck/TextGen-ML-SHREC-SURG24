The spending proposal will almost assuredly get strong pushback from Republicans in Congress who now control both the House and the Senate and wield even more power than they did four years ago For that reason alone the budget is another sign of a president feeling unhindered in his final years of office and eager to take advantage of an improving economyDetails of the budget have been guarded closely by administration and Capitol Hill officials But sources on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue said Obama will propose increasing discretionary spending by about 70 billion several sources cautioned the proposed increase likely will be slightly less The money would be divided equally between defense and nondefense accountsThe President will propose to end the acrosstheboard sequester cuts that threaten our economy and our military a White House official said The Presidents budget will fully reverse those cuts for domestic priorities and match those investments dollarfordollar with the resources our troops need to keep America safeAn administration official told The Huffington Post that the spending additions the president will outline  which appear larger than those he proposed in last years budget  would be offset by cutting spending and closing tax loopholes The overall budget the official added would have measures to reduce the deficit through a similar combination of savingsFor Republicans the proposal will likely be perceived as fiscally reckless if not politically brazen After all it was the GOP wins in the 2010 election that set the stage for sequestrations acrosstheboard budget cuts in the first placeAfter that election cycle Obama attempted to craft several debtreduction deals with House Speaker John Boehner ROhio as a nod to conservative victories But the deals never came to fruition And in the summer of 2011 as the debt ceiling was nearly breached the two sides fell back on an exchange that neither truly likedUnder The Budget Control Act of 2011 spending was reduced by nearly 1 trillion and Congress created the socalled Super Committee to find roughly 15 trillion more in savings When the committee failed to find consensus mandatory sequestration cuts kicked in forcing more than 1 trillion in cuts over 10 years Sequestration was delayed a few months starting at the beginning of 2013 But by March of that year it was law of the landThough Republicans have lamented sequestrations effects on defense operations  and some have worried about nondefense programs in their districts  they have largely resisted proposals to replace sequestration with any package that includes tax hikesRepublicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times only to see the president continue to demand tax hikes said Cory Fritz a spokesman for Boehner Until he gets serious about solving our longterm spending problem its hard to take him seriouslyBut Obama also may find critics of his budget proposal on his side of the aisle  for not being bolder A roughly 70 billion increase may seem healthy if not daring But as The New York Times noted it represents a small portion of a budget expected to reach 39 trillion and it comes at a time when the deficit is shrinking Senate Budget Committee ranking member Bernie Sanders IVt for one has called for a major government investment in infrastructure and other domestic priorities well beyond where the Obama administration appears willing to goThe administrations hope is that somewhere in the ideological middle albeit closer to the liberal side of the divide there will be enough lawmakers to forge a majorityRep Paul Ryan RWis and Sen Patty Murray DWash were able to craft a deal to alleviate some of the budget cuts brought on by sequestration in December 2013 A request for comment from Ryans office was not returned late Wednesday night
