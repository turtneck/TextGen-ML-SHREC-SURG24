Pinterest At a prestigious Boston school they have a pretty strict dress code No gangrelated colors no cutoffs nothing too offensive or revealing Women at Boston Latin School cant wear skirts whose hemlines are more than four inches above the knee and their bra straps cant be the spaghetti style where theyre so thin theyre barely there This is a middle and high school folks  not a college for adults Its a way of showing a little decorum  a little respect for yourself and for the school And it promotes rape culture  Because for radical feminists telling them not to dress provocatively is telling them that men are sexist pigs who simply cant resist the wiles of a woman They call it victimblaming and while theres a point to it  you cant blame a woman for being assault if shes jogging alone in a park but certainly you can bring up a womans attire if it is specifically designed to attract attention from the opposite sex Lets be honest Women sometimes dress for attention They want guys to look at them But under leftistfeminist theory they shouldnt So as HeatStreet reports theres a Changeorg petition that claims this dress code sends the message that we live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a females clothing is appropriate or inappropriate The dress code they claim creates a a sense of shame towards girls sic bodies and reinforces the notion that yes it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person Im not sure what these women want Do they want to be able to attend school wearing microminiskirts and just bras Pasties Maybe we shouldnt have a dress code at all In reaction to the idiotic controversy Boston Latin School changed their policy allowing women to wear leggings as long as theyre not seethrough The rest of the policy will stay in place until Nov 1  then it will probably be changed again Heres how their petition reads By allowing the school to dress code us we are telling the school several things Yes we still live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a females clothing is appropriate or inappropriate Yes a body should be covered in order to be attractive Establishing a sense of shame towards girls bodies is okay and perfectly acceptable Yes a girls body is a sinful temptation that needs to be covered up at all costs for others to focus on their education Yes a females body is more tempting and sexual than a males body Yes it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person Are these statements correct to you Is it okay to assign a dress code in this manner If the answer is NO then sign this petition to tell Mr Contompasis to reconsider his dress code restrictions What a bunch of nonsense These are CHILDREN They do not get a say in establishing a schools dress code PERIOD
