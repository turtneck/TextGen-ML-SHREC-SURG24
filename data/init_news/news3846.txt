Writing at the Hill analyst Mark Plotkin figures he knows why Ted Cruzs poll numbers have tanked in Indiana ringsRemember when the Republican presidential candidate stumbled over the word rim as he was trying to recreate a scene from the movie Hoosiers for some reason Well that slipup will doom him in basketballloving Indiana just as so many have been doomed by so many other slips of the tongue before Indianans love basketball very much apparently and they will be very mad if you say ring to them Traditionally we call that a hoop here in Indiana the Indianapolis Stars Allison Carter noted drylyWhy look at the polls The Cruz mistake happened April 26 shortly thereafter his poll numbers started to sinkHard to argue with that Except that something else happened April 26 Donald Trump beat the tar out of Cruz and Ted Kasich in five statesThis Republican race has been a teacup ride for the ages whipping back and forth between Trump is doomed and Trump is inevitable usually based on whatever good or bad luck Trump has had in the most recent voting Hispast six efforts have been exceptional his best of the campaign so our teacups are spinning toward inevitable once again and faster than everAnd that makes some sense There arent many contests left and Trumps magic number  how many of the remaining delegates he needs  continues to sinkIndiana is one of the two biggest states left on the calendar and it gives out its delegates in a winnertakemost fashion  win the state and the congressional districts and you get all the delegatesYes Trump has won six in a row and by very wide margins But just as Bernie Sanders won sevenof eight before the race shifted back to Hillary Clintonfriendly territory Indiana aint the Northeast In the Northeast no one has any idea what to call a basketball loop The Midwest isdifferent terrain where Trumps margins of victory have been more modest  when he has wonLets say for example that Trump doesnt win Indianas primary Tuesday This is unlikely FiveThirtyEights forecast shows that Trump has an 83 percent chance of winning There are reports that Trump is finally figuring out how to run a ground game that is how to get his supporters to the polls But Cruz has consistently been stronger and smarter which is one reason he pulled off a surprise win in Iowa That was a caucus and not a primary one of several reasons he probably will still lose in Indiana But if he doesnt Back go the teacupsEven if Cruz loses and Trump wins  as is likely  the race isnt over Winning Indianas delegates makes Trumps job much easier particularly given his big lead in New Jersey  the third biggest state left and one that gives all of its delegates to the winner  and in California Both of those states will vote June 7 and between the two of them will offer Trump enough delegates to clinch the nominationBut lets go back to Indiana One of the reasons polls appear to have shifted against Cruz in the state is that the air is coming out of his campaign Gallups survey data indicates that Cruzs favorability rating has tanked among Republicans since Trumps big victory in New York The implication People who were supporting Cruz out of a desire to stop Trump have lost some of that enthusiasm This also could explain the dip in IndianaIt also suggests that opinions are relatively fickle driven by a sense of viability Even if Cruz doesnt win tonight a betterthanexpected performance a close race could prompt some rethinking Plus there are still several states between now and June 7 where Cruz could do well Nebraska South Dakota Montana If voters are responding to the variations ofthe race as polls suggest we could have another variation in the cards even if Trump wins in Indiana Maybe Possibly There are a bunch of states where Trump will do well tooI understand why Trump keeps insisting that an Indiana win would cap off his nomination I understand  and agree with  arguments suggesting that it makes his nomination all but certain But Id note that our impulses to declare finality in the wake of particular results often have proven to be shortlived Trump wouldnt actually clinch until the night of June 7  abouta month from now One month ago Cruz was about to dominate in Wisconsin and give the wan Stop Trump effort its only real win Things changeAnd besides What if Trump mispronounces avocado California could definitely be up for grabs
