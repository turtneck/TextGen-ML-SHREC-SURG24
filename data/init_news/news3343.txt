Kahlida Lloyd can explain her reasons for voting for Hillary Clinton even if she is not especially excited about them But she has a hard time making the case to obstinate friends why they should support the Democratic presidential nomineeLloyd 31 a lawyer sought advice from other black millennials during a recent lunchtime gathering in downtown Washington What should she say to encourage young black voters who rallied in 2008 and 2012 to help Barack Obama make history as the first African American president to show a little of that enthusiasm for ClintonI just dont want the first woman president to be elected because the other person sucks but thats where I think we are Lloyd said in an interview after the event last week hosted by WeVote a new effort aimed at mobilizing young black voters People either say Donald Trump is not where its at so Im going to vote for Hillary Or you have people say Donald Trump is not where its at Im not going to vote at all And thats not coolYounger African Americans like many millennials are not excited about this years presidential election The Clinton campaign which has sought to reassemble the Obama coalition has struggled to connect with a key piece of it voters under 30Turnout among African Americans under age 30 spiked from 49percent in 2004 to 57percent in 2008 but it dipped to 53percent in 2012 according to Census Bureau data While 43percent of Obama supporters under age 40 were very enthusiastic about him in 2012 just 24percent of Clinton supporters under age 40 feel the same way about her now according to September averages of Washington PostABC News polls from four years ago and this yearBlack activists and organizers frustrated with the Clinton campaigns inability to engage young voters have taken it upon themselves to challenge their peers to consider the consequences if Republicans take the White House and keep control of both houses of Congress They also have encouraged young voters to focus on state and local elections because those officials make decisions about how police departments and schools are run issues that more directly affect their livesFor Black and Engaged millennial activists politics is localVoting rights were an important victory of the civil rights era and because Trumps campaign has laid bare racist attitudes the seeming indifference of black millennials to the election has sparked broad discussion within the African American communityBut young people who say that the political system has failed them argue that they dont owe it to anyone  not even the oftencited warriors of the civil rights movement  to participate in the presidential election Many are critical of some black political leaders for framing the election as a choice between an archenemy and an old friend rather than talking about the issues such as what they view as broken economic and criminal justice systemsWe know what the issues are What we cant seem to get is candidates to talk about them in a nuanced way said Lauren Brown 34 a public relations professional who said she has not been moved by Clintons talking points on addressing police violence against black people or economic equity for women of color This election cycle is more about who you hate more than who you likeBrown decided to vote for Clinton after taking part in a discussion during an event hosted last month in Philadelphia by a civic project called Black and Engaged about the stakes in the campaign Trumps debate performances also helped sway herCarmen Berkley director of civil human and womens rights for the AFLCIO said many black millennials have to stop waiting to have that same level of excitement they felt for Obamas campaign If I had my choice of who would be the president it probably would be Michelle Obama but shes not running for president Hillary Clinton isBut the first lady and the president could be effective surrogates to persuade young black people to put aside their doubts about voting for Clinton Although Michelle Obamas wellregarded speech taking on Trumps vulgar comments about women was made before a largely white audience in New Hampshire it was widely shared and discussed on social media and black women in particular praised the first lady for speaking out about sexual harassmentBlack women are most worried about the outcome of the 2016 election poll findsDenise Horn a spokeswoman for the campaign said the Obamas are among several surrogates including Sens Bernie Sanders Vt and Elizabeth Warren Mass who are popular among millennial voters and will continue to make the case for ClintonBerkley 31 said some black millennials are being overly critical of Clinton for instance by continuing to criticize her for supporting her husbands 1994 crime bill and using the term super predator to describe some young offenders They dont give her credit for having apologized or for pledging to work to achieve criminal justice reform Here you have a candidate who says I messed up and Im willing to change Berkley said I think that is powerful We have  as activists organizers and everyday people  the power to bring pressure on political leaders to get what we wantSymone D Sanders 26 a top aide to Sen Bernie Sanders during his Democratic primary campaign cofounded WeVote along with three other millennial activists to urge their peers to register and vote Lloyd was among about 145 people who attended the Washington event Similar gatherings are planned around the countryOther efforts to engage millennial activists include BlackPAC which got funding from the proClinton super PAC Priorities USA to do outreach in Florida and the Color Of Change PAC which got money from the progressive For Our Future super PAC to court voters in battleground states via text messageI think its extremely important that the message we take from this room when were going out into our individual networks is that this is not the election to sit on the sidelines Sanders said during last weeks discussion There are so many things as President Obama has said that are on the ballot Our progress as a country is on the ballot criminal justice reform and the future of criminal justice reform in this country is on the ballot our economy and who will be able to get a job is on the ballot So if those are the things you care about that is why we have to go to the pollsBut Lloyd told Sanders and members of the panel that she had been having trouble convincing others that they should vote for ClintonAfter the first African American president of the United States of America we cannot afford not to vote said panelist MaryPat Hector national youth director for the National Action Network and a student at Spelman College in AtlantaWe cannot risk Supreme Court justices that are going to push us back All of the things that weve worked so hard for not only as African Americans but as women can be gone  tomorrow We cannot allow someone who does not care about us win So if that means voting for Hillary Clinton then so be itDeRay Mckesson a prominent leader in the Black Lives Matter movement also on the panel said the campaign has not offered a compelling affirmative reason to vote for Clinton nor a credible surrogate who can speak to young black voters in the way that Atlanta rapper Killer Mike represented SandersI dont know who is out there like that for Hillary Trump drives us all nuts but we know Trump wants to build a wall Mckesson said Im an insider in the criminal justice space and sometimes Im like What is it Hillarys going to do That is a problemClinton campaign aides say she has not only talked about issues affecting communities of color but has offered detailed proposals to address such concerns as criminal justice income inequality and infrastructure in neglected neighborhoodsAddisu Demissie director of national voter outreach said the campaign has been doing extensive outreach to black voters  including millennials  in their communities and in recent weeks African American celebrities and athletes have been more active on the trail Over the weekend hiphop artist Pusha T joined fellow Virginian and Clinton running mate Tim Kaine for a campaign event in Liberty City a predominantly black lowincome community in MiamiMaya Harris senior policy adviser said Clintons economic agenda touches on various issues that are related to wealth and income inequality specifically addressing the African American communityDoes that mean there are not more policies that we could or should pursue if she is fortunate enough to be elected president Of course not she said But is her policy agenda one that recognizes the specific circumstances and challenges and lack of opportunities in the African American community not only recognizes it but puts forth solutions to begin to address those issues and create opportunities AbsolutelyLloyd who said she gave money and volunteered for Obamas campaigns had not been active for Clinton The WeVote discussion inspired her to sign up for a textathon She sent messages to more than 500 mostly black voters in PennsylvaniaI definitely think that event ignited something in me made me want to take advantage of opportunities to share with others she said
