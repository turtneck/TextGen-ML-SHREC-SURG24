If he gives it I will not accept it Trump said at a news conference in Cleveland at the close of the Republican National ConventionI dont want his endorsement he added Just Ted stay home relax enjoy yourselfHe also suggested that if Cruz were to seek the White House he would set up a super PAC to oppose himAnd Trump speaking the end of a week dedicated to unifying the party once again revived the conspiracy theory published in the National Enquirer that linked Cruzs father to John F Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald  an accusation that has no evidence behind itTrump doubles down on denial of linking Cruzs dad to JFK assassination Trump doubles down on denial of linking Cruzs dad to JFK assassination I dont know his father I met him once Trump said I think hes a lovely guy a lovely guy All I did was point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast Now Ted never denied that it was his father Trump first suggested that Cruzs father was involved in the assassination of Kennedy the morning of the Indiana primary citing the tabloid story Cruz allies have since repeatedly pointed to that low blow from Trump as a reason for refusing to support the Republican nominee And on Thursday Cruz referenced the incident as he drew an angry reaction from members of his states own GOP delegation I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father Cruz said Trump Heidi the best thing Cruz has got going for him Trump Heidi the best thing Cruz has got going for him Trump devoted a significant portion of Fridays event billed as a thank you to convention staff and organizers to attacking his former primary rival Speaking at the RNC on Wednesday Cruz had declined to endorse Trump instead urging delegates to vote their conscience Cruz said that the Trump campaign had seen the speech beforehand and that he told Trump personally that he would not make an endorsement But Trump appeared to dispute that on Friday morning saying Cruz went offscript at the convention So Ted Cruz took his speech that was done was on the Teleprompter said hello then made a statement that wasnt on the speech then went back to his speech Trump said See to me thats dishonorable Trump likewise said it was dishonorable of Cruz to abandon his pledge to support the Republican nominee But Trump said that Cruzs camp started it with an ad that ran in Utah showing racy photos of his wife Melania Trump The ad was put out by a PAC with no official ties to the Cruz campaign but Trump said Friday that he doesnt buy that Folks a lot of us are political people Trump said Were not babies His people are on the PAC At one point in his remarks Trump even suggested forming his own PAC to oppose Cruz if the senator runs again in four years I dont see him winning anyway frankly But if he did its fine Trump said Although maybe Ill set up a super PAC if he decides to run Turning to his running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence Trump asked Are you allowed to set up a super PAC Mike if you are the president to fight somebody
