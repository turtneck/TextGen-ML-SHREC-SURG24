Its not that Americans wont elect wealthy presidents but political experts say a candidate needs to use empathetic language and offer policies that show relatability to voters Sen Marco Rubio tried to do this MondayFlorida Sen Marco Rubio officially announced his intention to run for president of the United States at an event in Miamis Freedom Tower Monday eveningCall him the unMitt In announcing his presidential candidacy on Monday Sen Marco Rubio R of Florida highlighted his everyman credentials the son of Cuban immigrants  his father was a bartender and his mother a maid  who was able to achieve an American dream that he wants to make sure is operative for future generationsOn Monday there were no Mitt Romney insensitivities about a wifes couple of Cadillacs or about immigrants deporting themselves As Senator Rubio commented after Mr Romneys defeat in 2012 Its hard to make an economic argument to people who think you want to deport their grandmotherWhat Rubio was getting at back then was the Republican nominees apparent lack of empathy for voters Pollsters measure that with questions such as Does the candidate understand or care about people like youIn 2012 Romney failed the empathy test big time losing the care about question 81 to 18 percent against President Obama in national exit polling  even though he led in every other category that voters said mattered most in making their decision leadership vision and valuesThe empathy question is very very important and probably in the end is the ultimate criteria says Democratic pollster Celinda LakeThe question is particularly important right now because voters think politicians are out of touch with their lives They think this economy is not working for average people says Ms Lake known for the Battleground poll she does with GOP pollster Ed GoeasIts not that Americans wont elect wealthy presidents  think FDR JFK and the Bushes One does not need to come from humble roots to be president says Margie Omero a Democratic strategist with the bipartisan polling firm Purple Strategies But she says a candidate needs to strike the right tone use empathetic language and offer policies that show relatability to votersClearly one of Marco Rubios strengths is his ability to put himself in the shoes of voters or at least use the language thats familiar to voters Ms Omero says He has a skill at using that everyman everyperson tone Ultimately people want to see policies as wellOn Monday evening Rubiopoured on the empathy and optimism even as he warned about a diminished America and endangered opportunity for all He touched only briefly on policy points  citing a need for tax and immigration reform the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a robust foreign policy that does not cave on Iran or ignore human rights abuses in places like CubaThe youngest candidate to enter the race jabbed his older opponents saying the country needs leadership that breaks free from ideas stuck in the 20th century an indirect dig at Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Jeb BushBut Rubios main focus before supporters at Miamis Freedom Tower which is a former US point of entry for Cuban refugees was his familys story of opportunity in America and its universal messageAfter telling of his dads long nights behind a bar and of his fathers words to him  quoted in Spanish  that the son could achieve all the things the parents never could Rubio went on to speak of the dreams of other Americans  of single moms students landscape workers and yes bartendersIf their American dreams become impossible we will have just become another country But if they succeed this 21st century will also be an American century he said describing that as the message of his campaignDemocrats typically have an advantage on the empathy question say strategists from both parties But demographic changes in the electorate make it a necessity that Republicans improve that performanceThe GOP white voter base is shrinking  a point driven home during presidential election years when more minorities come out to vote Romney won only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 The 2016 GOP nominee will have to perform in the mid40s with Latinos says GOP pollster  and Rubio adviser  Whit AyresIts important for Republicans to do better on cares about people like me because youre going to have an electorate thats going to be around 31 percent nonwhite said Mr Ayres at a Monitor breakfast last monthOf course the electorate is big and diverse and people like me can be well everyone women Evangelicals AfricanAmericans young people seniors business owners the middle classIts certainly a lot to ask of any one candidate to be able to understand everybody strategist Omero says People dont expect presidential candidates to agree with them on every single issue but that that person has an open mind and that they love the voter  they want to hear about the voters problemsAt this early stage in the campaign candidates  and those preparing to jump in  have room to grow in their messaging and identification with voters Omero says noting that none of the candidates are really popular right nowSen Ted Cruz R of Texas in reaching out to conservative Evangelicals likes to share his faith and tell the story of how his boyhood family was preserved by his fathers turning to Jesus Christ His father  who fled Cuba when he was 18 years old  eventually became a Baptist preacherSen Rand Paul R of Kentucky who has a strong libertarian streak is reaching out to Millennials and minorities through casualness in his dress and manner some unorthodox policy positions and a message that bashes both Democrats and RepublicansWisconsins Republican Gov Scott Walker who has not yet formally announced his candidacy talks of his concerns as a parent and as someone who grew up in a kind of poor household supported by his preacher father and a mother who was a parttime secretary He flipped burgers to help pay for college  which he never finishedTheyre positioning themselves against Jeb Bush pollster Lake saysMeanwhile Mrs Clinton too needs to connect with voters in an empathetic way  not so much on policy but in her manner and personal storyHer comment last year that she and Bill were dead broke when they left the White House was a turnoff to many In the video announcing her campaign Sunday she vowed to serve as a champion of everyday AmericansI think people feel that she is fighting for them  that she has the policies in place and experience and dedication of service to fight for the middle class says Omero But she like the Republican field is going to need to continue to connect to individual voters
