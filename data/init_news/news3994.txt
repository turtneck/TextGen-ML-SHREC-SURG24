Washington CNN Donald Trump is poised to breeze through another round of primary contests this week  while the Republican Party splinters around himTrumps ascent to the top of the GOP which was capped last week with Ted Cruz s devastating loss in the Indiana primary happened so fast that even the billionaire himself was surprised And the whipsawed party establishment now faces immediate choices  none of which particularly appeal to themJust not ready for TrumpWill they unite behind their partys standardbearer Will they sit out the 2016 campaign Or will they fight on in a quixotic quest to undermine TrumpTrumps opponents are still sorting through the wreckage of the GOP primary season for a path forward But it has become painfully clear over the past five days that party unification will be tough to come by if it happens at allTrump himself enters his first full week as the presumptive nominee by signaling that he has limited patience for or interest in the establishments rebellion Though the election is six months away he announced Monday that New Jersey Gov Chris Christie will lead his transition teamBut when CNNs Chris Cuomo gave Trump a chance to take on Ryan and the GOP establishment during a New Day interview Monday Trump demurred His response Well see what happensHe used the interview to offer fresh evidence of his willingness to thwart tradition Trump who is building his presidential bid around his business acumen and knowledge of the economy told Cuomo the US should take the unprecedented step of defaulting on the debt because you print the moneyTrump is making quite clear he doesnt intend to cast off the provocative style on the campaign trail that alarmed the Republican establishment and resonated so deeply with primary voters After spending days on the receiving end of criticism from the likes of Ryan Romney and Graham Trump and his supporters hit back  hardSarah Palin a key Trump surrogate and 2008 vice presidential nominee took the unusual step of backing the littleknown Republican businessman challenging Ryan for his Wisconsin seatHis political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people and as the leader of the GOP the convention certainly he is to remain neutral Palin said And for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of hisFor his part Trump didnt seem too worried about the talk of the GOP disintegrating because of his nomination Speaking on ABCs This Week Trump questioned the need for party unity arguing that his campaign is unlike any before and wont rely on the same political calculationsDoes it have to be unified he asked Im very different than everybody else perhaps thats ever run for office I actually dont think soHe went on I think it would be better if it were unified I think  there would be something good about it But I dont think it actually has to be unified in the traditional senseThose comments underscore the growing debate over whether Trumps unorthodox candidacy will doom the GOP in the fall or whether the anxious party leadership has grown so out of touch with the electorate that its missing the genuine anger fueling Trumps riseFacing the likelihood of running against the first female nominee of a major party Trump sought to recast Clintons image by reviving the impeachment saga of the 1990s and arguing that she was dismissive of women who had extramarital affairs with her husbandAnd some of those women were destroyed not by Bill Clinton but by the way Hillary Clinton treated them after it went downBut I think for the most part she went on Americans are concerned about things like who will be able to appoint the next Supreme Court justices which will affect an entire generation coming up I think thats what people are concerned about much more so than Bill Clintons obvious indiscretions and Donald Trump having been divorced a couple of times but owning up to itTrump also caused some confusion over the weekend by taking positions on the minimum wage and taxes that are not only out of step with GOP tradition but also his own stances during the primaryOn taxes he said levies on the wealthy would go up under his administration He argued that while he supports acrosstheboard tax cuts he would likely bargain away cuts for top earners during negotiations with CongressOn my plan theyre doing down he said on This Week But by the time its negotiated theyll go upHe added Were going to submit the optimum  Thats what Id like to get and well fight for it But from a practical standpoint its going to get renegotiated And in my opinion the taxes for the rich will go up somewhatAnd after he told CNNs Wolf Blitzer last week that he was looking at raising the minimum wage he told ABCs George Stephanopoulous that he hasnt decided in terms of numbersBut I think people have to get more he said while acknowledging the shiftIm allowed to change he said You need flexibility George whether its a tax plan where youre going to  where you know youre going to negotiate But were going to come up with somethingSuch shifts however are deeply unnerving to many of Trumps opponentsThey have argued that he effectively fooled many primary voters into supporting him and will change his tune once he has to appeal to a broader electorate ahead of the general electionThat fear is partly whats fueling speculation over a potential thirdparty run from someone like Romney who met privately with Kristol the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard last week to discuss how to get an independent candidate into the raceProfiteers tempt and endeavor to hook us with compulsive addictions Romney said Entertainment media distracts us from the things that bring enduring achievements and happiness
