Sunday nights Democratic debate comes at a crucial moment The two frontrunners  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  are closer in the polls than ever and the Iowa caucus is only two weeks awayUp until now Clinton has done well in debates its a format that suits her But Sanders message is breaking through and hes gaining in the polls nationally leads in New Hampshire and is neck and neck with Clinton in Iowa That means the pressure is on for both candidates Sunday night The debate taking place in Charleston SC begins at 9 pm EST The NBCYouTubeCongressional Black Caucus Institute debate will air on NBC broadcast stations and livestreamed on NBC digital platforms including its YouTube channelHeres what the candidates need to do  and avoidNeeds Show why her plans are pragmatic solutions that work for the progressive base while still respecting Sanders supporters Shes gotten away from her answer in the first debate that shes a progressive who likes to get things done Then again its tough to make that argument to primary votersAvoid Lawyerly unclear answers that play into an inauthentic narrative especially paired against Sanders whose authenticity has been key attacks that could be seen as cheap shots like on health careNeeds Convince Democratic voters who are skeptical hes presidential material that he can win show a facility with issues beyond his core messageAvoid Pulling punches like hes done in past debatesNeeds Somehow appear relevant as it is he barely made it onto the debate stage His poll numbers had to be rounded up to qualifyAvoid Being dismissed especially after the question on the investigation into his discounted purchase of furniture from the governors office when he left1 Where does the race stand Hillary Clinton seemed to have a comfortable lead on Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders last year but that has slipped considerably and they are in a neckandneck raceSanders has picked up momentum with his message and his passion  and Democratic voters like him He continues to lead in New Hampshire where hes been in the top spot for the better part of the last five months Hes also closing in Iowa which is perhaps more surprising but thats a place where passion counts because of how the caucuses are conductedBeyond the first two states Clinton still has leads with nonwhite voters who are critical to Clintons firewall in the South But that firewall might not look as insurmountable if she loses one or both of these first crucial contests2 What about the issues  whats dividing these two Sanders has gained steam because of his clear message on Wall Street and income inequality Hes tried to tie Clinton to big financial institutions and Clinton has struggled in defending those ties as Sanders has labeled her the status quoLately its been health care and guns Sanders voted for Obamacare but he prefers a singlepayer system Clinton wants more modest tweaks It may have been a bad tactic for Clintons daughter Chelsea to try and go after Sanders from the left and accuse him of wanting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act Clinton stood by her daughter Bigger picture Clinton has criticized Sanders for how to pay all of the reforms he wants Sanders has not been completely forthcoming on a financial and tax plan though he promises to explain laterClinton has harped on Sanders past support for more moderate gun measures including his support for a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from liability if a gun made by one of them is used in a killing On Saturday the day before the debate Sanders came out in favor of a measure to amend the law3 So with these dividing lines do they go negative in the debate Theres a risk in going negative but more so for Clinton Sanders voters are very loyal Clinton is losing ground and cant afford to be completely positive But how to attack Sanders in a way that resonates and seems authentic will be a challenge Clintons making the case shes the more electable  and certainly most Democratic voters would do anything to make sure a Republican isnt elected especially Ted Cruz or Donald Trump
