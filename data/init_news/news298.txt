Terry Branstad urged his fellow Iowans to vote against Cruz because of his opposition to ethanol  and former VicePresidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed TrumpRepublican pollster Daron Shaw says We tend to overinterpret every little thing in a presidential race but here we actually have solid evidence Trump didnt just win last week in Iowa  he won it by enough to put some distance between himself and Cruz Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic pollster Chris AndersonBut a lot can change before Iowans caucus February 1A third of Republican caucusgoers say they may change their mind 33 percent Even one in four Trump supporters says they may ultimately go with another candidate 25 percentCruz tops the list when GOP caucusgoers are asked their secondchoice candidate When first
