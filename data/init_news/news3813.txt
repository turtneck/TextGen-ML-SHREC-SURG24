By Judi LynchIn this time of great chaos and spiritual evolution we all have our roles to play Some of us are activators while some of us are motivators Our everchanging lives all have unique purpose and themes to understand in our personalities forms of expression and creativity Existence takes each of us on a future journey to discover our emotional strengths spiritual connections and metaphysical abilities Everyone has a light to shine in their own unique wayIn current society it is incredibly necessary in times of fear change and anxiety to bring in positive thoughts actions and motivations Now more than ever we need to hold onto the light that brought us here To live in reality means to face the challenges that humanity has created and aspire for better understanding of our purposes to be heardIt can certainly seem like we have many souls who incarnated here to start fires make judgments and declare war on mankind In those people we witness what the lower vibrations can manifest with negative energy and toxic thoughts They help to wake us up in unity for our light to increase instead of dim We are not here to cower in fear and anxiety but to overcome those feelings of hopelessness with courage In learning to own who we are we believe without fear of persecutionWe need the light bearers who work to lift others up onto the higher ground We have people among us with new ideas methods and discoveries to do just that Those who dare to aim for what is beyond the stars into the possibilities of tomorrows miracles use every option and future theory to their advantage Many people are here to motivate our compassion to take action on changing what can bring us harm The peacemakers and protectors of this world have a unique mission in which to find balance between what we see as good and evil among usIts easy to tell ourselves and others to turn off the television become more spiritual and less materialistic Better yet why not gather together and demand that the programming offered become more intellectual beneficial and enlightening to humanity Why do we turn it off instead of offer alternatives to educate people to evolve Do we really need another program where people are allowed to bully hit and abuse each other in awful ways Do we really need to know everyones personal business in a million reality shows about nothing Why did it come to this when we have the technology to land on Mars Do we really need another crime or murder dramaNot only horribly graphic disgusting and disturbing they are putting out incredibly negative energy with a generous dose of anxiety ridden fear There really are more good guys than evil ones we should be reminded of this We dont need more examples of bad behavior Our children and grandchildren need hope positive roles models and tools to manifest a brighter future for everyone on the planet Instead of watching people kick each other and pull each others hair maybe we could watch them heal each other with unconditional love compassion and a humor that doesnt disrespect anyone Now theres a conceptEvery single one of us is here to shine a light on something to bring awareness to a cause to be a catalyst for great present and future change to be an example of why change is needed It has become a necessary art to learn how to discern the energies and motives of those around us to keep ourselves in light minded thoughtWe are here to hold the light no matter what seems like darkness around us Just like the sun lights the Earth every day we hold the energy that sustains us in this Universe All the creative forces all those who heal others grow food rescue animals know the meaning of cooperation is necessary in our survival We have so much we could share with each other if we know how to shine a light on our voices passions skills and dreams together This is how we build understanding holding the light to outshine our fears in moving forwardJudi Lynch is a psychic medium intuitive counselor healing channel and author She is president of the Crystal Healing Foundation Inc a 501c spiritual charity and featured columnist for OM Times Magazine She has authored two books Friends with Lights and Conscious Ascension and has read for clients all over the world To learn more or contact for a session see psychicmediumjudilynchcom  or email judi judilynchcom Source OM Times
