For weeks Hillary Clinton has looked for the knockout blow that finally forces Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic primaryShe may have gotten it tonight in KentuckySanders has to start winning every state by a landslide victory to have even a mathematical chance of catching Clintons nearly 300delegate lead Kentucky was called for Clinton as an apparent winner at around 930 pm by NBC and after 10 pm by Kentuckys secretary of state who called her the unofficial winnerSanders has maintained that hell stay in the race until the end of voting and we dont have any new reason to believe hell fly the white flag after Clintons victory tonight And his hardline response to the Democratic Party over this weekends events in Nevada certainly doesnt suggest hes ready to call it quitsBut Sanders needed to win Kentucky to maintain an increasinglyfarfetched path to the Democratic nomination The fact that he lost tonight  albeit by what appears to have been a very small margin  will only dramatically increase the calls for him to exit the raceThe loss is particularly tough for Sanderss campaign given that Kentucky was one of the more favorable states for him remaining in the raceGiven the West Virginia results I think Sanders is probably favored said Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginias Center for Politics in an interview Tuesday morning before voting began Sanders has a very good chance in KentuckySanders will probably face steeper odds in the upcoming contests in California and New Jersey where have polls have Clinton leading by as much as double digits Polling from Kentucky was scarce but the states largely white and rural voters were widely expected to break for Sanders  as they have throughout the countryKentucky has a large number of registered Democrats who are much more conservative than the rest of the party a group that has in other states backed Sanders in part as a protest vote against the partys establishment according to KondikMore than half of Kentuckys registered voters are signed up with the Democratic Party even though the states election results have hewed decidedly Republican in recent years wrote the polling firm Morning Consult in a preview of tonights contest Thats an indication of the rightward shift of downscale whites especially in once unionheavy Coal Country those are voters who used to call themselves Yellow Dog DemocratsThese voters broke for Sanders by a big margin in West Virginia and they very well may have in Kentucky as well But even if they did it does not appear to have been enough to offset the big difference between Kentucky and West Virginia diversityAfricanAmerican voters are far more numerous in Kentucky  in part because of its cities like Louisville and Lexington Kentuckys 2008 primary electorate was 9 percent black compared to just 3 percent in West VirginiaBlack voters have rescued Clintons campaign since her first big win in South Carolina in February And tonight they may have helped push her opponent out of the raceCorrection A previous version of this story incorrectly said Kyle Kondik works for the Center for Responsive Politics rather than the University of Virginias Center for Politics
