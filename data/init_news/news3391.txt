Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders meeting Thursday night for their last debate before the New Hampshire primary squared off fiercely on the question of whether the party should strive toward its liberal aspirations or set its sights on the achievableThe dynamic between the two contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination was far more intense  and far more personal  than it has been in their previous faceoffs That reflected how close their race has become in the wake of a virtual tie in Mondays Iowa caucuses The debate was sponsored by MSNBC and the New Hampshire Union LeaderThe Take ClintonSanders battle boils over Clinton used her opening statement to needle the senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist over what she has contended are unrealistically liberal plans for universal health care free college and other programsIm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes and Im not making promises that I cannot keep the former

saidAs they had at a town hall forum the night before the two remaining Democratic presidential contenders also squabbled over the modern definition of the word progressive which has become the preferred term for the Democratic leftA progressive is someone who makes progress Clinton saidThe Fix Winners and losers from the fifth Democratic debateSanders who enjoys enormous enthusiasm among the partys liberal base continued to make the argument that Clinton is too heavily dependent on those who have financed her campaign and made her personally wealthy He said that he does not only talk the talk but walk the walk I am very proud to be the only candidate up here that does not have a super PACClinton accused Sanders of engaging in a very artful smear of her character She insisted she had never changed her position on any issue based on having received contributions from special interestsSenator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign Ive tried to keep my disagreements over issues as it should be But time and time again by innuendo by insinuation there is this attack that he is putting forth Clinton saidDefending the paid speeches she gave in the period between leaving the State Department and announcing her presidential campaign Clinton said she may not have done a good job of explaining what she was doingThey wanted me to talk about the world and how she saw threats and challenges Clinton said of the groups that paid her fees of 200000 and moreAsked whether she would release transcripts of closeddoor paid speeches Clinton replied I will look into itThe two contenders voices raised argued over whose plan and ideas would more effectively police Wall Street and the larger financial systemBreak them up Sanders thundered referring to the nations biggest banksClinton said leading economists have judged her regulation proposals to be tougherBut Sanders kept bringing the argument back to her ties to Wall Street Through the end of December the financial industry had given at least 214million to support Clintons 2016 presidential run  more than 10 percent of the 1578million amassed to back her bid according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings by The Washington PostClinton also was asked whether she could guarantee that repercussions from her use of a private email system at the State Department would not blow up her campaign She said she is 100percent confident that an FBI security review will come to naughtI have absolutely no concerns about it she saidThe Clinton team is expecting a loss in New Hampshire the state that resurrected her 2008 campaign after a devastating thirdplace finish in Iowa This time she battled to the narrowest of wins in the Iowa caucusesOn Thursday two new New Hampshire polls indicated that she has much ground to make up against Sanders before Tuesdays primaryAn NBC NewsWall Street JournalMarist College survey had Clinton running 20 points behind Sanders in New Hampshire 58percent to 38percent A tracking poll by CNNWMUR  the kind of daily gauge whose results are more volatile  showed an even wider margin with Sanders beating Clinton by better than two to one 61percent to 30percentSo it was no surprise that Clintons campaign was aggressively playing down expectationsAt a breakfast Wednesday morning sponsored by Bloomberg Politics Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters We face some pretty significant head winds here in New Hampshire Senator Sanders has been leading here for some time since the summer Its hard to underestimate the neighboringstate advantage in this raceHowever resigned Clintons team may be to a loss here Tuesday it thinks the electoral terrain will turn in her favor afterward as the campaign moves to states with more diverse populations The Sanders operation however has warned that they have been organizing in other states including South Carolina and Nevada and should not be underestimatedSanders is also proving to be a fundraising powerhouse reaping millions from small donors over the Internet which means he has the capacity to continue his campaign for a long timeOn Thursday Clinton played up what she sees as her greater electablity in a generalelection contest in NovemberIve been vetted Theres hardly anything you dont know about me an asset in the withering scrutiny of the general election Clinton saidSanders brushed aside a question about his electability He cited polls that suggest he would run stronger than Clinton against GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in a number of battleground statesHe also cited the enthusiasm that he is generating Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout when people are excited when workingclass people middleclass people young people are engaged in the political processI am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November Clinton saidNonetheless the rivals ended the debate on a note of solidarity Clinton said that Sanders would be the first person she would consult if she won the nomination Sanders added On our worst days I think its fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate for presidentShortly before the debate the Clinton campaign released unofficial fundraising figures for January showing she brought in 15million which is 5million less than Sanders received in the same period Clintons team has been warning supporters of a Sanders donation surge and noting that he is already outspending her in television advertising in the earlyvoting statesThe Clinton campaign also confirmed that she will break from campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday to visit Flint Mich where a costsaving decision led to dangerous levels of lead in the city water The crisis in the economically depressed heavily African American city has become a cause celebre among liberals and Clinton has been in the forefront of criticism of the states Republican leadership for falling down on the job She claims some credit for pressuring the governor to accept federal helpHer allies have used the Flint crisis as a point of comparison with Sanders saying that his call for the governor to resign did nothing to help the citys residentsThe Flint issue and Clintons hastily scheduled trip also serve to divert attention from her falling fortunes in New HampshireAlthough she will campaign in New Hampshire for part of the day her departure will be read as an attempt to change the subject from her tenuous position here
