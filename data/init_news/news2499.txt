When Friday began there were 14 states where samesex couples still could not legally marry By the afternoon  after a confusing day of orders and counterorders by governors attorneys general and county clerks  couples had married in all of them but oneThe holdout was Louisiana There Attorney General James D Buddy Caldwell R condemned the Supreme Courts ruling which legalized samesex marriage nationwide as federal government intrusion into what should be a state issueWhats more Caldwell said he had read the text of the decision And hed found no specific line saying that Louisiana had to obey itTherefore there is not yet a legal requirement for officials to issue marriage licenses or perform marriages for samesex couples in Louisiana he said in a statement Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal R who announced Wednesday that he is running for president criticized the justices decision but said his state will comply with it once an appeals court officially gives the orderAcross the country some conservatives called for resistance to the high courts ruling which they said tramples on the Bible and the Constitutions protections of states rightsThe GOP candidates are split into two fields over gay marriageIn most places that didnt happen Friday But in several states conservative officials did try to delay or block the implementation of the decisionIn addition to Louisiana there was Mississippi which blocked almost all samesex marriages saying it needed a lower courts permission to proceed A few samesex couples in Mississippi did get married in the window between the Supreme Courts ruling and the states order to stopIn Alabama two officials announced another method of resistance If they couldnt stop samesex marriage they would stop marriage itself They said they would no longer issue marriage licenses to anyone gay or straight ever againI will not be doing any more ceremonies said Fred Hamic R the elected probate judge in rural Geneva County The other was Wes Allen R the probate judge in Pike County Both said that state law doesnt require their counties to issue marriage licenses at all If people want to wed they can go to another countyIf you read your Bible sir then you know the logic The Bible says a man laying with a man or a woman laying with a woman is an abomination to God Hamic said I am not mixing religion with government but thats my feelings on itAnd then there was Texas where confusion reignedBefore the Supreme Courts ruling state Attorney General Ken Paxton R had warned county clerks not to issue samesex marriage licenses until he could give them ordersThen the decision cameHe denounced the ruling in general terms but never told clerks how or whether to implement it That left county officials on their ownAt the Williamson County clerks office in Georgetown just north of Austin officials said they were not issuing samesex marriage licenses Friday pending a review of the justices decision by county officialsWere good lawyers we have to read the whole thing and then issue guidelines said Brandon Dakroub first assistant county attorney The forms would have to be updated for one thing The old ones are meant for one man and one womanIn the meantime officials had posted a sign in the hallways telling samesex couples what to do if they couldnt wait Bexar Travis and Dallas counties are issuing if you cannot wait for our software changes the sign saidThat was true Clerks in more liberal urban Texas counties had begun issuing licenses anyway without waiting for guidance from the state capital But that wasnt always easy In Harris County which includes Houston the county attorney actually ordered the county clerk to begin issuing them But the clerk refusedWe were told if we use the wrong form it will be null and void a deputy clerk told the Houston Chronicle Later in the afternoon Harris County began issuing samesex marriage licenses after allAdding to the confusion in Texas Gov Greg Abbott R issued a memo that required state agencies to respect the sincere religious beliefs of people who dont agree with samesex marriage But his memo didnt say anything about when or how samesex couples could get marriedTexas state Rep Cecil Bell Jr R  a leading voice of resistance to samesex marriage  said he hoped the states leaders would try to stop the implementation of the rulingSomebody would sue he saidBut a lawsuit would take time And Bell said time is their best hope nowHopefully it takes long enough to where we have  a situation where the Supreme Court changes because a Republican president appoints new justices who see samesex marriage differently he saidIn the remaining states that had not permitted samesex marriage  Arkansas Georgia Kentucky Michigan Missouri Nebraska North Dakota Ohio South Dakota and Tennessee  state officials said they will carry out the courts rulingRecognizing that there are strong feelings on both sides it is important for everyone to respect the judicial process and the decision today from the US Supreme Court Michigan Gov Rick Snyder R said in a statement The possibility of a backlash to Fridays ruling was anticipated by Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr In a dissent he said that samesex marriage already had a lot of political momentum  but that the courts decision could shortcircuit that Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over samesex marriage he wroteThe Fix The Supreme Court did Republicans a favorSome conservatives  mainly without political power themselves  said that the only correct response was to resist the decisionI will not acquiesce to an imperial court any more than our Founders acquiesced to an imperial British monarch said former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee R who is running for president We must resist and reject judicial tyranny not retreatHuckabee did not say what exactly he meant by resist In Arkansas at least one county began issuing marriage licenses to samesex couples on FridayIn other cases the call was for a kind of secondorder resistance Private citizens couldnt stop the marriages perhaps but they could refuse to bake wedding cakes or provide services for receptionsOr leaders of larger institutions could risk their bottom lines by refusing to treat samesex unions like other marriagesRick Scarborough the leader of a Texasbased group that gathered 55000 signatures to defend marriage said that for instance a Christian school could fire an employee for being married to another manThats what we mean by civilly disobeying Were not going to change our practice or our pattern to fit the whims of the Supreme Court he said If you sue us well face the lawsuits and well continue until bankruptcy  or jail time if requiredScarborough is a minister but he doesnt have a church of his own to put on the line Still hes encouraging others to do so reminding them of a song about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego  Old Testament figures who were cast into a furnace because they would not renounce GodThe song we teach our kids is They wouldnt bend they wouldnt bow they wouldnt burn he said In this fight Scarborough said Christians may not be that fortunate We are not going to bend we are not going to bow If necessary we are going to burnBut Russell Moore the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention said the church should not seek legal confrontations  but rather should focus on a spiritual message describing the value of heterosexual marriageIf the government were to force Christian churches  to perform samesex marriages then yes we couldnt do that Moore said in a conference call with reporters That does not mean though that  we cant obey laws including bad laws that we dont agree withBishop Joe S Vasquez of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin the largest diocese in Texas counseled a similar messageThis causes confusion among those who are faithful to the Gospel and erodes rights of persons in each state he said adding that Jesus taught that from the beginning marriage is the lifelong union of one man and one womanRegardless of the courts decision he said the nature of the human person and marriage remains unchanged and unchangeable
