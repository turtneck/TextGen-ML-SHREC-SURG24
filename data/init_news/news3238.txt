On Monday morning millions of Sarah Palin fans woke up toan epic Facebook rantcomplaining that she and other Trump endorsers are being blacklisted by Washington insiders This was apparently based upon some Breitbart Newsreportingwhich quotes some members of the conservative movement compiling a list of Trumpish apostates who will be denied membership in their club This was somewhat ironic since the Trump campaign actuallyiskeepingan enemies listof reporters it will not allow into its events But such is the state of the conservative crackup And it perfectly signaled the beginning of a very busy day Donald Trump went into the belly of the beast Washington DC and once again dominated the news cycle on the entire day before an electionTrump started the morning with a trek to theWashington Post for an interview with theeditorial boardThe first question they asked was about his foreign policy team Up until now hes said that he watches the shows and would listen to himself because he hasa very good brainThis time he named some people who are not know to be on the Alist includinga conspiracy theorist and Islamophobeand a former general who was dismissed forcovering up Bush administration contracting corruption in Iraq and AfghanistanHe whined like a tired toddler about how unfairly theWashington Posttreats him and chattered excitedly about his new building project for some time He babbled incoherently about how the countrys debt was a bubble and said we need to charge foreign governments to protect them so we have money to rebuild at home He was asked about the issues of African Americans and the police and said that the problem was unemployment  he believes that black youth have a 58 percent unemployment rate When pressed about whether there areracial disparities in law enforcement he affirmed his very very strong support for the police and suggested they need to do whatever is necessary to prevent violenceHe promised to create economic zones and business incentives in the inner cities he seems to think he just thought of that concept but mostly hes convinced that the answer is to lift peoples spiritIm sure his policy of having the cops bring the hammer down as hard as possible will be a great spirit lifterThey asked him if he had any regrets about getting down in the dirt with all the hands business and he went on and onand onabout it This is just a short excerpt of what he had to say on the subjectBut this exchange with the publisher was downright chillingThat is not a typo or a garbled transcript You can listen to the whole interview here When Donald Trump was asked whether he would use nuclear weapons against ISIS he said didnt want to start the process of nuclear then explained that hes a counterpuncher reminding them how he vanquished his rivals in the presidential primary Then he noticed some attractive people in the roomThats how his mind works Its not normalBut that was just the beginning of Trumps big day in DC After his hands on interview with the Post he headed over to a private meeting with some current and former members of Congress including Senator Tom Cotton the audacious Arkansas freshman who wrote the embarrassing Iran letter Senator Jeff Sessions former Senator Jim DeMint disgraced former congressmen Newt Gingrich and Bob Livingston Calista Gingrich and a small number of backbench Representatives No one is quite sure what it was all about but Trump had a press conference afterwards and seemed to believe it was a very very impressive groupThat press conference rivaled his notorious Super Tuesday Trump brand infomercial He talked about the building hes building for what seemed like hours even discussing the bathroom fixtures at one point A woman in the audience asked a question he seemed to like and he brought her up to the podium and promised to hire her on the spot He said I looked at her gut instinct she asked a question and it was a positive question and she has a great look and she looks like a great person to me I have instincts about people This is the world famous business acumen he will bring to running the government He was asked about the violence at his rallies and he reiterated his claim that the protesters are very bad people and explained that the man who hit and punched a protester over the weekend had a wonderful family and was angry at a member of the Ku Klux Klan He actually beat a protester who was dressed in red white and blue A different protester was wearing a white hood to protest Trumps association with the Klan He downplayed any threats from the GOP establishment to his campaign saying I dont see threats I see people who are trying to go against me  I think theyre very misguided I think the people who go against me should embrace me and then I would embrace them very easily  If they dont embrace me then its a threat There has never been an event like what were going through in the history of politics  people are talking about this all over the world Hes right about that but one suspects he may not fully comprehend thehorrorwith which his campaign is being greeted here and around the globe With that bizarre public appearance under his belt Trump popped over to CNNs studios for an interview with Wolf Blitzer as part of their evening special with the Final Five candidates He said the usual stump speech nonsense and was typically unresponsive He did take the opportunity to thoroughly trash Fox Newss Megyn Kelly saying that he must let people know that shes a third rate talent But he assured the nation nobody respects women more than I do Nobody will take care of women better than I do so thats a relief And just hours away from delivering a big speech for which he used a teleprompterhe took a shot at Hillary Clintonfor using a teleprompter That big American Israel Public Affairs Committee speech was heavily anticipated among the political media mostly because everyone wondered if Trump could give a prepared speech And yes there was some curiosity about whether he would go before such a typically hawkish crowd and repeat his claim that he would stay neutral between the Israelis and Palestinians He did not do that Instead his Israel policy if you can call it that was pretty much GOP boilerplate And despite the fact that he delivered it via teleprompter it was just as puerile and selfcentered as any interview or stump speech hes ever given His most notable line after his bragging about taking the huge physical risk to be the Grand Marshall of New York Citys Israel Day parade in 2004 was this one My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran I have been in business a long time I know deal making And let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for America for Israel and for the whole middle east Weve rewarded the worlds leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return Ive studied this issue in great detail I would say actually greater by far than anybody else believe me Oh believe me The audience roared with laughter He may be able to convince some of the people at his rallies that he knows what hes talking about in foreign affairs but the AIPAC crowd isnt fooled about his knowledge of Israel and Iran Nonethelessthey gave him a polite reception He didnt challenge the status quo in any way so it was a successful speech for him But would it have really mattered if it wasnt All in all Donalds Big Washington Adventure succeeded in doing what what he set out to do He had the press corps following him all over town like a bunch of One Direction fanshanging on his every silly boast and ignorant rant Today he will probably win a bunch more delegates to the Republican convention thus proving once again that it doesnt matter what he says it only matters that he says it on TV
