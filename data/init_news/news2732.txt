For the second week in a row there was a temporary glitch in the Associated Presss election night data On Tuesday that glitch was to Hillary Clintons favor showing her with 2000 more votes in Vigo County Indiana than she actually had That gave Clinton a giant margin in early returns vastly at odds with what exit polls showed  and far bigger than the 7point margin she enjoyed in the final polling average from RealClearPoliticsWithin minutes the wrong numbers in Vigo County were erased and over the next hour or so Clintons remaining lead started to vanish It wasnt until about two hours after polls closed  at about the same time that Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican race all but handing the nomination to Donald Trump  that the Democratic race in Indiana was called for Bernie Sanders Hed beaten the polls as he did in nearby Michigan  and probably once all the votes are in by a wider marginAfter Sanders lost fiveof sixraces over the last two weeks and won only the small state of Rhode Island the Indiana win was no doubt a welcome psychological boost But why did Sanders win Michigan and Indiana while losing other Midwestern states such as Missouri narrowly Illinois and OhioUnlike in the Republican contests there have been pretty consistent patterns that have defined the Democratic matchups Bernie Sanders consistently does better with younger and more liberal voters Clinton does better with older more moderate and black votersIn Indiana preliminary exit poll data reported by CNN showed that the electorate in the state was more likely to identify as liberal than in other Midwestern states and less likely to identify as moderate Whats more the change since 2008 was much larger than in those other statesBut Sanders also won Michigan where there were relatively few voters who identified as liberalThe best predictor of outcomes to date is how many black voters came to the polls Theres been a correlation between how many black people live in a state and how well Hillary Clinton has done there an effect thats slightly stronger in states with closed primaries meaning that independents who strongly back Sanders cant vote Indianas population was right at the inflection point of those curves right at the point where youd expect a close raceOn Tuesday night the percentage of the electorate that was black was slightly lower than the average of all contests for which we have polling data so far but not dramatically so Black voters preferred Clinton by a 3to1 margin But white voters  nearly threequarters of the electorate  leaned heavily toward Sanders giving him nearly sixin 10 of their votes On average so far the two have been equally matched about 5050 Sanders also did better with the upper end of the youngvoter bracket a group that turned out more heavily than they did in 2008 Those two shifts made the differenceIt wasnt totally unexpected that Sanders would pull out a win in the state despite the polls being against him FiveThirtyEights model which looks at racial composition and the type of primary figured that Sanders would win by 7 points  slightly more than where it is right nowDespite Sanderss win and despite slightly narrowing the delegate gap with Clinton Sanderss position for winning the nomination actually got worse He needed by our estimates to win 649 percent of the delegates to stay on track to pass Hillary Clinton Hell end up getting somewhere around 53 percent of them if current figures hold Meaning that hell need even more of what remains in order to possibly pass Clintons pledged delegate total  demonstrating again why doing so is a nearly impossible feat The Indiana results also made it impossible for Sanders to clinch the nomination with pledged delegatesWhats particularly remarkable about the nights results is that Donald Trump was expected to win did and knocked Ted Cruz out of the race Hillary Clinton was expected to win and didnt and Bernie Sanders soldiers on despite underperforming on the delegates he needs in order to win and despite the fundamentals of the Democratic race having not changed in nearly two monthsPart of that loops back to the way the Democratic race is divisive in the way the Republican race isnt There are very passionate groups of supporters for Bernie Sanders that want him to keep fighting So hell keep fightingAnd as with Tuesday night occasionally winning
