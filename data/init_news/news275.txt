ProClinton PAC spends 1 million to fight online trolling  10point scoreTRUMP ADVISORS TRY TO PIVOT NOT FISHTAIL HOLLYWOOD FLA  Its a fine line between a general election shift and the dreaded Etch A SketchDonald Trumps supporters give him broad latitude on issues and even his promise of an attitudinal change For example his suggestion that the Republicans should become a prochoice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supportersThe idea that Trump would change his attitude and approach along with his opinions wouldnt trouble many who have faith in him as a man and a leader For those who believe the Trump is the only person who can make America great again putting on a new guise for the general election would be nothing troublingRemember these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since LincolnBut can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trumps surprising success in overtaking the GOPTrump had a very good day here Thursday Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that mightve helped Sen Ted Cruz win a floor fight at the convention delegates and other members of the establishment were very impressed by Trumps campaigns effort to start sucking up to themPromises of Trumps flexibility when served alongside seafood platters and open bars from his new K Street handlers went a long way toward convincing the GOP elite that Trump is ready to play ballLittle could be more comforting to them than the pledge from Trumps campaign boss that the wildness of the frontrunner to this point has been a put onConsultants and party elders are not uncomfortable with the idea of tricking rubes or profit and or patriotism And for those facing general election oblivion anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds goodBut even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy the current maneuvers do pose a riskThe most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give upThere are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do itWhen Trumps new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than RepublicanAll Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks When they wake up it will all be overBut if Trump starts fishtailing in his turn towards conventionality it will reinvigorate the NeverTrump movement   Its great to suck up to the party even belatedly but doing in such a transparent manner could be hazardous to Trumps nomination  GOP delegate countTrump845Cruz559 Kasich 147

public polling in Indiana however its not clear how large Cruzs advantage might be if he indeed has one One recent private poll not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns showed Cruz leading in two congressional districts Kasich in one and Trump dominating in two more Three other congressional districts meanwhile showed Cruz and Kasich essentially tiedAlthough there are just 57 delegates at stake in Indiana the contest is one of the few remaining wild cards on the primary map If Cruz or Kasich do not win the Republican race could quickly spiral out of their control If Trump does not win Indiana however his delegate math becomes exceedingly difficult to win the nomination before Cleveland  Unpacking Trumps health proposal  Health care policy expert James Capretta points
