What happened was less a debate among contenders and more a showdown between the candidates and the moderators Everyone attacked the moderators when they heard a question they didnt like and then made a show of their rebelliousness  this was great for antimedia conservatives but a distraction for everyone else The moderators had their moments but they were mostly awful Frivolous questions about Rubios absenteeism or Trumps moral character or fantasy football gave the candidates just enough fodder to avoid answering the hard questions whenever they were asked The result of all this was two and a half hours of political gasIts hard to say whether Trump did well or poorly His shtick almost defies analysis I expected him to come out swinging but he didnt do that despite being surrounded by lowenergy losersHe had a few moments though He reminded everyone of his plans to build a big beautiful wall on the Southern border but making sure to note that helladd a door right in the middle so Mexicans can walk in legally When John Harwood cited a few inconvenient facts about his tax plan he ignored them and boastedthat rightwing economist and CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow likes it  that settled the disputeAt some point Trump was asked about gunsI do carry occasionally he said Sometimes a lot I like to be unpredictable so people dont know Im carrying Also hed feel safer ifhis employees all of them carried guns at workBottom line Trump held his ground He was vulnerable tonight particularly after slipping in the national polls this week but he avoided any direct attacks As a frontrunner thats all he needed to doIm tempted to say Carson failed tonight but thats not really true Tonight was a win for Carson Hes now a legitimate frontrunner having overtaken Trump in the latest CBSNYT poll Hes also leading in Iowa by a wide margin I assumed the other candidates would go after him but they didnt with the exception of John Kasichs brief jibe at Carsons simplistic tithinginspired tax planBy and large Carsons rivalsallowed him to continue his nice guy routine He avoided specifics and he pivoted from question to platitude faster than anyone else on that stage He uttered phrases like I hate the concept of regulations because theyre in everything but no one pointed out how stupid that is I thought hed have to defend his recent gaffes ie equating women who have abortions to slaveholders but they werent even mentioned The most important thing for Carson He escaped another debate without explaining any of his policies or admitting that he doesnt understand half the questions  thats a victoryJeb was the big loser tonight He had the most at stake and he did nothing to help himself His campaign is collapsing his poll numbers are falling and his donors are panicking His only goal tonight was to plug the leak to convince his financiers that hes still a good investment He failed to do that In addition to fending off Trump Jeb had to damage Rubio who is quickly becoming the establishment guy But he couldnt do it because hes a terrible candidate and nothing he says or does works in this campaign He almost succeeded at demonstrating his regular guyness when he referencedhis fantasy football record hes 70 but even that felt unnatural and canned More than anyone else Jed needed a boost tonight He needed to be seen as strong and presidential None of that happened He was lowenergy basicallyTonight was an opportunity for Rubio Hes rising in the polls and he needed to capitalize on his momentum I thought he did that There were no obviously bad moments for him And he managed to avoid taking any direct hits including from Jeb and the two frontrunners Even his dumb answers were received well When asked about his greatest weakness he said he loves America too much When asked why he never shows up for work at the Senate he said its because America needs him And the audience loved it I suspect hell become the preferred establishment alternative to Bush if he isnt already Rubios young polished and reasonablesounding enough to be competitive in a general election He cant beat Hillary but he may be the best shot they haveI thought Fiorinas political star was fading before the debate Nothing tonight changed my opinion After rising to third in the polls after the first two debates Fiorina has dipped well below Rubio and Bush Her strategy so far has been to repeat lies over and over again until they become true She did that again tonight particularly on her record as CEO of HewlettPackard which is disastrous She said something about reforming the tax code by reducing it to three pages so that farmers could understand it  still not sure if thats a good thing She almost had one of her contrived moments when she attacked Hillary Clintons feminist credentials It is the height of hypocrisy for Hillary Clinton to talk about being the first woman president she said When every single policy she espouseshas been bad for women She didnt name a single one of those policies though and no one askedBottom line Fiorina said nothing tonight she hasnt said before Her window has closed Shell be out of the race in a few months Theres not much to say about Rand Paul He was a nonfactor before the debate and hell be a nonfactor after the debate Pauls only chance in this race was to excite the libertarian wing of the Republican Party He hasnt been able to do that though Im not sure why He did reasonably well tonight but no one will notice Paul just doesnt matter at this point He was mostly an afterthought until the end of the debate when he said something about liberty thriving when a government is so small that you cant see it I doubt that insight will resuscitate his campaign But hes got a big filibuster coming up so that ought to keep him in the headlines for a little longer Ted Cruz is impossible to ignore Hes creepy and awkward and deeply annoying but he just wont go away As expected he did welltonight At the beginning of the debate he confessed that his greatest weakness is his love of the constitution What else could it be He also said something about driving people drunk people I think home at the end of the night which wasnt weird at all All told tonight was a win for Cruz He pandered to his religious base and performed his rehearsed speeches with characteristic flair He even took a few jabs at the media which conservatives absolutely love I doubt he gets a boost in the polls but he definitely didnt hurt himself tonight So long as hes got the evangelical and Tea party demographics cornered Cruz has staying power There isnt much to say about Huckabee If he wasnt selling books or angling for a TV show I imagine he wouldve dropped out of the race a long time ago He said nothing new or interesting tonight In fact he barely spoke at all and when he did it was brief and immediately forgettable He was at the bottom of the polls before the debate and thats where hell be tomorrow Kasich continues to be one of the more interesting candidates in the race His strategy has been to remain the sensible moderate guy the one who can appeal to centrists and moderates in a general election Hes been more aggressive lately however I expected him to be in attack mode tonight because he needs to do something to break through but he was fairly cautious Tonight he tried to distinguish himself as the only candidate whos pragmatic enough to get things done in Washington But this has been his approach from the very beginning It hasnt worked so far and I doubt it will now Christie did well tonight but it wasnt enough His tough guy routine hasnt been as effective with Trump on the stage sohis strategy was to attack the moderators rather than his fellow candidates Basically every Christie statement was a variation of the phrase Were talking about X when we should be talking about Y Thats it He also said we have to be honest with old people and just tell them the truth which is that the government lied to you and stole your money and youll never see it again Im not sure what to make of that so Ill just leave it right there Something tells me Christie will hang around for a while but hes got no chance to win this thing VIDEO We took a look back at how often candidates mentioned Clinton at the previous three Republican presidential debates Can you guess how many times we counted
