WASHINGTON  Connecticut Gov Dan Malloy D will sign an executive order on Monday barring statefunded travel to Indiana because of the states new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasonsMalloys move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act which Gov Mike Pence R quietly signed into law last week The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian gay bisexual and transgender peopleTwo cities San Francisco and Seattle have imposed similar bans in response to the law Businesses have also retaliated Angies List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis and the CEO of Salesforce a 4 billion software corporation announced plans to dramatically reduce our investment in the state because of the lawTwenty states have RFRA laws but Indianas law is substantially different While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government Indianas law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens That means for example a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under lawThe Indiana law could result in employers landlords small business owners or corporations taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so reads their letter Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employers their landlords their local shopkeepers or a police officers private religious beliefsThats in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions not private establishments And unlike some other states Connecticut also doesnt permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institutionBefore signing the order he called the Indiana law disturbing and outright discriminatory and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state Those games are set to begin later this weekI think that would be a wise choice for them to do if thats possible said Malloy Ill leave it up to them to make those decisionsThe NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is surprised and disappointed by Indianas law and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law or an outright repeal before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the stateMalloy said his executive order allows for any of the states current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out but said he doesnt plan to enter into any new onesSomebodys got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and Im prepared to do it he said
