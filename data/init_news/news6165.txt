SaintDenis Reunion Island CNN When investigators get an inperson view of a wing component that likely came from a Boeing 777 theyll be looking for not only a serial number but clues as to why the part broke off the Boeing 777One group of independent observers said Thursday that the damage to the component  a right wing flaperon  should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the airThe group led by American Mobile Satellite Corp cofounder Mike Exner points to the small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and the ragged horizontal tear across the backThe rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean some members of Exners group wrote in a preliminary assessment after looking at photos and videos of the componentBut the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a highspeed steep spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off the group saidBoeing and Australian officials are confident the debris  found Wednesday off the coast of a remote island in the west Indian Ocean  came from a Boeing 777  and might be from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 a 777 that disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on boardExners group  an informal cadre of aviation experts  said that if the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached And the rear damage looks like it was caused by stress rather than being bent and broken off when the plane hit the waterBut an aircraft component specialist who spoke to CNN disagreedThe lack of damage to the front section tells me that the component could still have likely been back in its original position inside the wing itself said Michael Kenney senior vice president of Universal Asset Management which provides plane components to airlinesBoeing investigators are confident that debris found on a remote island in the Indian Ocean comes from a 777 aircraft according to a source close to the investigationWe are highly confident but it still needs confirmation that it is a part from a 777 aircraft he told CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront The only 777 aircraft that were aware of in the Indian Ocean that could have led to this part floating is MH370 But as I said we still need to confirm that through closer studyPeople cleaning a beach found the debris Wednesday on Reunion a French overseas territory in the western Indian OceanThe source said Boeing investigators feel confident the piece comes from a 777 because of photos that have been analyzed and a stenciled number that corresponds to a 777 component A component number is not the same as a part number which is generally much longerImages of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the right wing flaperon from a Boeing 777 A flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft It is lightweight and has sealed chambers making it buoyantDespite this confidence no one is saying the part definitely comes from a 777 much less MH370Finding the debris is a significant development in the search for MH370 Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss saidNew debris which washed ashore Thursday and appears to resemble remnants of a suitcase is also part of the investigation Reunion Island police officials confirmed to CNNA preliminary assessment by US intelligence agencies produced in the wake of the MH370 disaster suggested it was likely someone in the cockpit deliberately caused the aircrafts movements before the Malaysian airliner disappearedTwo US officials briefed on the matter told CNN that the assessment which was not intended for public release was prepared months ago and was solely based on available satellite and other evidenceThe US intelligence assessment was largely focused on the multiple course changes the aircraft made after it deviated from its scheduled Kuala Lumpur to Beijing route Analysts determined that absent any other evidence its most likely someone in the cockpit deliberately moved the aircraft to specific waypoints crossing Indonesian territory and eventually toward the south Indian OceanMalaysian investigators havent reported finding any evidence that casts suspicion on the pilotsIf it does turn out to be from Flight 370 the development would reassure Australian officials that they are looking for the rest of the plane in the right area Truss and Dolan saidIts credible that debris from MH370 could have reached the Reunion Islands by now Truss saidMalaysia Airlines is sending a team of investigators to Paris and a second team to SaintDenis Reunion on Friday an airline official in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia told CNNIts unclear how identification will be madeNormally identification would be aided by a small serial number plate attached to a flaperon but the part found on the beach appears to be missing the serial number plate according to photographsOther markings may be found on the part said Kenney the executive from Universal Asset ManagementAustralia is leading the underwater search for the remains of Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean some 2300 nautical miles 3700 kilometers east of Reunion But Truss said that French and Malaysian authorities will be responsible for establishing whether the debris found off the island came from the missing jetlinerAustralia has offered its help he said including asking marine experts to look at photos of the debris to determine whether barnacles on it are consistent with something that was floating in the oceans for 16 months or more
