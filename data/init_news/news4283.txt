It now appears a sudden complete explosion caused by a bomb brought down the Airbus over the Mediterraneanbut that doesnt mean it was ISISFlight tracking datashowing its altitude speed and direction ends instantaneously while the plane was at its cruise height of 37000 feet This can now be combined with reports that a military satellite using infrared technology detected a flash at the time and location where the airplane was last tracked according to NBC News US officials told Reuters a review of preliminary satellite imagery has produced no sign of an explosion so farIf the Airbus A320 was stricken by a mechanical failure it is highly unlikely that the effects would have been so sudden leaving the pilots at least some time to send a Mayday call No call was made officials sayReports that wreckage has been found floating in the eastern Mediterranean were later denied by Egyptian officials Once it is found as it will be and given the increasing indications that a bomb caused the disaster an urgent priority for investigators will be to look for evidence in the wreckage of blast and fireIf there is evidence of a bomb blast the next priority will be to establish where the bomb was placed on the airplane in the cabin or in the cargo holdEssential clues to that could be found both from physical wreckage from the airplane and from bodies of passengers even down to their seat locationsIn this situation the jets black boxesthe flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorderare of little value since their data would have been terminated with the sudden explosion leaving only a record of what was until then an absolutely normal flight Wreckage is where the story is to be toldThere has yet been no credible claim by any terrorist group that they were responsible If a bomb was successfully placed on the flight not only does this point to a weak point in security at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris the origin of the flight but it could mean that bomb makers have found a new way of eluding current bombdetecting technologyThe man credited with being the worlds mostingenious bomb designer is al Qaedas Ibrahim alAsiri Al Qaeda has recently been overshadowed by ISIS and some experts believe that it wants to reestablish its superiority in attacks on what it has always regarded as the most effective Western target commercial aviationIf the flight was brought down by a bomb the timing of the blast could be a part of the signature of the bomb maker Was it timed to detonate specifically at the only place on the EgyptAir jets route when it was over water The retrieval of wreckage and particularly of the flight data recorders is far more difficult with a plunge into the sea than when the airplane falls in plain sight over land On the other hand counterterrorism experts have always believed that bombers would rather bring down a jet over land and ideally over a city for the maximum effectas was the intention of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab the underpants bomber on Christmas Day 2009 aiming for DetroitThe jet was flying what has become one of the most densely trafficked airline routes in the world a crucial corridor in the sky for international flightsFollowing the downing by a missile of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014 that part of Eastern Europe wasbelatedlydefined as a war zone The main airline routes between Europe the Middle East and Asia were then diverted south to fly over Romania Greece Turkey and across the eastern Mediterranean into Egyptian airspaceThe corridor became even more crowded after the crash of the Russian Metrojet while flying over the Sinai Peninsula last October when the Sinai airspace was also ruled too dangerous for commercial flights This had the effect of pushing a lot more intercontinental flights further south flying eastbound and westbound across Cairo the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia and Dubai Dubai is now a major hub for flights between Europe Africa and Asia
