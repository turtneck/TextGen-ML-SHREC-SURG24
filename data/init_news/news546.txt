  In what amounts to the first pang of just how profound Americas Election Day screw up truly was Trumps campaign is reportedly already working on a plan to scrub that last eight years of progress out of existence on Trumps very first day in office  No Obama accomplishment will remain They even have a name for the plan The First Day Project Organized by the Heritage Foundation the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office Its a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way Trump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project Trump spends several hours signing papersand erases the Obama Presidency he said Stephen Moore an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation explained We want to identify maybe twentyfive executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office Thinking back over Obamas list of wins  from gay rights to healthcare to the economy  the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense And on a separate but equally terrifying front Trumps campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an enemies list an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him  and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office I would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want But let me just tell you Mr Trump has a long memory and were keeping a list Erase his predecessor punish his enemies In this way with pen and sword Trump plans to dismantle a democracy The oldest greatest one in the world  up until the point when it wasnt Featured image via Chip SomodevillaGetty Images Share this Article
