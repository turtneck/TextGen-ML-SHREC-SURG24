As Congresss vote on a resolution to disapprove the administrations nuclear deal draws ever nearer the math for President Obama is looking better and betterThe magic number of Senate supporters the president needs to ensure that the deal stands is 34 Currently he has 30 So he needs to pick up just four more to preserve the agreement  and there are still 14 remaining undecided Democrats in the chamber several of whom have already made positive comments about the deal So Obama has a lot of optionsAnd tellingly after a month of intense criticism of the deal from the right and from proIsrael groups only two Senate Democrats have been swayed to oppose the deal so far Sens Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey Theyll be joined by it appears every single Senate RepublicanBut that wouldnt be enough to sink the deal If opponents want to block the sanctions relief thats crucial to the agreement they need to assemble a twothirds majority in both the House and the Senate that can override a promised veto from Obama And thats impossible to reach without a lot of Democratic votes as I wrote in JulyDeal opponents once hoped that the agreement would become politically toxic leading to many Democratic defections But that hasnt happened Instead the key swing votes  including some of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate like Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly  have been won over by the administrationThe state of play in the House is tougher for outsiders to gauge but opponents appear to be well short of the 44 Democratic opponents they need there  just 14 Democrats have said theyll vote to kill the deal according to the Hill Again the deals opponents would need a vetoproof majority in both the Senate and the House to keep the sanctions in placeAccording to a Friday report from Eli Lake and Josh Rogin of Bloomberg View deal opponents have already resigned themselves to losing the vote eventually Furthermore they write Many Republicans now acknowledge in private that they were handed both a political and a policy defeat on the nuclear dealNow that the deal looks so likely to be upheld the new question is whether Democrats can save President Obama from having to veto it in the first placeThere wouldnt be any policy stakes here  achieving this would simply save the president from the embarrassment of Congress passing a resolution condemning his administrations foreign policyFor that to happen 41 Senate Democrats would have to vote to filibuster the GOPs planned disapproval resolution  meaning Obama would need to win over 11 of the remaining 14 undecided Democrats in the chamber Thats a tall order but given that only two Democratic senators have opposed the deal so far it doesnt seem completely out of the questionThe vote will likely take place in midSeptember But if you want to keep track yourself beforehand here are the remaining undecided Democratic senators Again the administration needs to win four of their votes to uphold the deal and 11 for a filibuster that would make a veto unnecessary
