Email Those of us who study how to end wars rather than find new ways to prosecute them must be stunned like many Colombians by a popular vote there on October 2 that rejected the peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC No one predicted that after over five decades of fighting and more than 200000 deaths a peace agreement that took six years to conclude would be rejected Its a lesson in how the power of emotionvengefulness specificallyand narrow selfinterest can overcome good sense The general perception of observers is that voters who suffered from the civil war wanted to see the FARC rebels punished rather than rewarded with the opportunity to reenter civil society and even hold a guaranteed number of seats in the national congress Most civil wars end in much the same way as Colombiaswith one side badly hurting and willing to disarm under a ceasefire provided the government promises assistance so that the rebellious soldiers can reintegrate in civil society Negotiations to reach such an agreement typically are arduous and often seem to be on the brink of failure Longheld grievances come to life again and again and it is a tribute to negotiators that they were able to come to any substantive agreement at all So it was with high expectations that an agreement was reached and the decision of Colombias president Juan Manuel Santos to put it to a popular vote showed his confidence that citizens weary of war would accept it Five days after the vote he was rewarded for his efforts with the Nobel Peace Prize That Colombians did not endorse the agreement evidently owes much to the politicians who campaigned for a no vote including former president lvaro Uribe whose father was killed by the FARC He argues that the peace agreement is too soft on FARC leaders allowing them to avoid prison merely by confessing their crimes and promising to make restitution to victims According to one observer who opposes the peace accord Essentially FARC members would have received the same legal power to prosecute Colombian government officials and vice versa The rejected deal would also have shielded an unknown number of FARC guerillas from jail for drug trafficking recruitment of child soldiers and other crimes The many thousands of people whose families were directly impacted by FARC killings and kidnappings obviously agreed The razorthin no vote 502 percent to 497 percent also may be attributed to the bizarre fact that only 38 percent of eligible voters voted  Perhaps this was a Brexitlike situation in which many people stayed away from the polls on the assumption a yes vote was fairly certain But the no voters were well entrenched including not only Uribes party but also the majority of the churches the ELN the National Liberation Army the secondlargest guerrilla force business sectors    and the majority of landowners who were all against the proposed changes The rightwing groups not only considered President Santos peace plan soft on FARC they also objected to his support of gay rights reforms of land policy and investment in rural development It was under Uribe not coincidentally that the US became a major participant in Colombias civil war Under Plan Colombia the US provided the Colombian military with advanced weapons such as Blackhawk helicopters and intelligence under a topsecret multibillion dollar CIA program that escalated the violence and decimated the FARCs ranks A FARC leader is quoted as saying that it faced an international intervention and it took a toll Civilian deaths and the displacement of about seven million people followed caused in no small part by officially sanctioned rightwing death squads Some US officials believe that intervention saved Colombia from endless civil war by forcing FARC to the bargaining table That is hardly an argument for peacemaking the no vote was actually a defeat for the US policy of peace through war Plan Colombia was to a great extent responsible for destroying either through deaths or displacements the lives of roughly 15 percent of the total population Now the US supports a negotiated settlement but still keeps FARC on the State Departments Foreign Terrorist Organizations List The Santos government and FARC have agreed to continue a ceasefire until December 31  We may hope the parties will be guided by the need for rehabilitation and reconstruction rather than vengeancefor peace rather than retributive justice As President Santos said  Making peace is much more difficult than making war because you need to change sentiments of people people who have suffered to try to persuade them to forgive
