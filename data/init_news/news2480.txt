President Obama is banning local police departments from receiving a range of militarystyle equipment from the federal government  from grenade launchers to bayonets to certain armored vehicles  as he implements the recommendations of a panel that examined the controversial gear giveaways in the wake of the Ferguson riotsThe White House announced Monday that Washington would no longer provide some militarystyle gear while putting stricter controls on other weapons and equipment distributed to law enforcement The details were released in advance of an Obama visit to Camden NJ Monday afternoon where he met with youth and law enforcementNine months earlier scenes of heavily armed police in riot gear dispelling racially charged protests in Ferguson touched off a debate about federal programs that let local law enforcement apply for such equipment The White House initially suggested Obama would maintain those programs but an interagency group found substantial risk of misusing or overusing items like tracked armored vehicles highpowered firearms and camouflage could undermine trust in policeSpeaking in Camden Obama said the use of militarized gear by police can give the public the feeling that law enforcement is like an occupying forceIn previewing the presidents trip the White House said that effective immediately the federal government will no longer fund or provide armored vehicles that run on a tracked system instead of wheels weaponized aircraft or vehicles firearms or ammunition of 50caliber or higher grenade launchers bayonets or camouflage uniforms The federal government also is exploring ways to recall prohibited equipment already distributedWith scrutiny on police only increasing in the ensuing months after a series of highly publicized deaths of black suspects nationwide Obama also is unveiling the final report of a task force he created to help build confidence between police and minority communities in particularIn addition to the new equipmenttransfer bans a longer list of equipment the federal government provides will come under tighter control including wheeled armored vehicles like Humvees manned aircraft drones specialized firearms explosives battering rams and riot batons helmets and shields Starting in October police will have to get approval from their city council mayor or some other local governing body to obtain it provide a persuasive explanation of why it is needed and have more training and data collection on the use of the equipmentThe issue of police militarization rose to prominence last year after a white police officer in Ferguson fatally shot unarmed black 18yearold Michael Brown sparking protests Critics questioned why police in full body armor with armored trucks responded to dispel demonstrators and Obama seemed to sympathize when ordering a review of the programs that provide the equipment There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement and we dont want those lines blurred Obama last in AugustBut he did not announce a ban in December with the publication of the review which showed five federal agencies spent 18 billion on programs that provided equipment including 92442 small arms 44275 nightvision devices 5235 Humvees 617 mineresistant vehicles and 616 aircraft At the time the White House defended the programs as proving to be useful in many cases such as the response to the Boston Marathon bombing Instead of repealing the programs Obama issued an executive order that required federal agencies that run the programs to consult with law enforcement and civil rights and civil liberties organizations to recommend changes that make sure they are accountable and transparentThat working group said in a report out Monday that it developed the list of newly banned equipment because the substantial risk of misusing or overusing these items which are seen as militaristic in nature could significantly undermine community trust and may encourage tactics and behaviors that are inconsistent with the premise of civilian law enforcement The Justice Department did not respond to an inquiry about how many pieces of equipment that are now banned had been previously distributed through federal programsThe separate report from the 21st Century Policing task force has a long list of recommendations to improve trust in police including encouraging more transparency about interactions with the public The White House said 21 police agencies nationwide including Camden and nearby Philadelphia have agreed to start putting out neverbefore released data on citizen interactions like use of force stops citations and officerinvolved shootings The administration also is launching an online toolkit to encourage the use of body cameras to record police interactions And the Justice Department is giving 163 million in grants to incentivize police departments to adopt the reports recommendationsRon Davis director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services at the Department of Justice told reporters he hoped the report could be a key transformational document in rebuilding trust that has been destroyed in recent years between police and minority communitiesWe are without a doubt sitting at a defining moment for American policing said Davis a 30year police veteran and former chief of the East Palo Alto California Police Department We have a unique opportunity to redefine policing in our democracy to ensure that public safety becomes more than the absence of crime that it must also include the presence of justiceThe Associated Press contributed to this report
