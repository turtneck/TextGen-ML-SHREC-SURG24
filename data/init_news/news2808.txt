This week Katharine Zaleski confessed her sins against motherhood onFortune and it went viralZaleski is now the cofounder and president of PowerToFly a firm that works to match women with flexible jobs But before that she was working in media at the Washington Post and Huffington PostHer column no doubt did well for the sheer shock value She recounts how she said nothing when an editor proposed firing someone before she got pregnant But another reason it resonates so strongly could be that the worst of Zaleskis actions line up with emerging research around the ways women  especially moms  are discriminated against in the workplace Women have felt this for years But the research and now the confessions are catching upZaleski recounts a few of her worst transgressions1 I secretly rolled my eyes at a mother who couldnt make it to last minute drinks with me and my team I questioned her commitment even though she arrived two hours earlier to work than me and my hungover colleagues the next day 2 I didnt disagree when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she got pregnant 3 I sat in a job interview where a male boss grilled a mother of three and asked her How in the world are you going to be able to commit to this job and all your kids at the same time I didnt give her any visual encouragement when the mother  who was a top cable news producer at the time  looked at him and said Believe it or not I like being away from my kids during the workday just like you 4 I scheduled last minute meetings at 430 pm all of the time It didnt dawn on me that parents might need to pick up their kids at daycare I was obsessed with the idea of showing my commitment to the job by staying in the office late even though I wouldnt start working until 1030 am while parents would come in at 830 amIts easy to see why the column went viral its not only enraging but its also a conversion story  once Zaleski had a baby herself the scales fell from her eyes and she realized the error of her wayswere very good at honoring motherhood but we seem to have trouble when moms need a paycheck or have career aspirationsShe also gets into some of the very issues researchers have begun uncoveringFor example many working moms know that opting out isnt always opting out Zaleskis story echoes an eyeopening December study of Harvard Business School alums Many of those highachieving women had stopped working not because they wanted to be stayathome moms but because the working world had started to shun themSome women get subtle messages as Harvards researchers writeand as Zaleski shows some women get interviewers asking them how theyll commit to a job and kids at the same timeA lack of flexibility for parents can also show up in womens paychecks For example Zaleski expected parents to conform to a nonparent schedule coming to 430 pm meetings That kind of rigidity can prevent women from keeping up with men Harvard economistClaudia Goldin found in a 2014 study that flexibility in hours plays a huge part in creating more pay equality between men and women As she wrote The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hoursIts true that Zaleski and Harvard Business School alums are breathing some rarefied air But even the most basic kind of flexibility is unavailable to many American workers According tothe White House only 39 percent of US workers report having access to paid family leave for the birth of a child Even more shockingly employers say only 11 percent of workers are covered meaning some employers may be offering informal arrangementsIts true that not all bias in the workplace is as deliberate as that in Zaleskis former world  indeed a lot of it may be subconscious But it reflects a twisted attitude  that our society values motherhood but not the mothers themselves In cards poems songs movies books even commercials we are very good at honoring mothers for being moms What we seem to have trouble with is when those moms need to earn money or want to advance their careers
