The presidential nomination contests are heating up and both parties 2016 fields have narrowed And since its also Presidents Day weekend its a good time to consider what voters want in a president regardless of which candidate they may supportPast experience is not necessarily required especially for RepublicansLast March more than a year before the first primaries more voters valued a hypothetical candidate with experience and a proven record 50 than one who had new ideas and a different approach 43 Just six months later those numbers had flipped  55 said it was more important for a candidate to have new ideas while 37 valued experience and a proven recordThis shift came entirely among Republican and Republicanleaning voters The share of Republicans saying it was more important for a candidate to have new ideas increased by nearly 30 percentage points over this period from 36 to 65 Opinions among Democratic voters remained far more stable In September 50 valued experience about the same as the 46 who said this in MarchPast experience as a Washington lawmaker also is viewed more negatively among the public overall than in prior presidential campaigns  again especially among Republicans In January 31 of the public  including 44 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents  said they would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who had been an elected official in Washington for many years In 2007 just 15 of the public and 20 of Republicans had a negative view of a candidate with longtime experience as a DC elected officialWhile the public continues to view military experience very positively it is a trait that none of the top remaining 2016 candidates possesses In a survey last month 50 of Americans saidthey would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate who has served in the military  the most positively viewed trait among 13 tested In the prior two presidential campaigns military experience also was viewed very positivelyThe 2012 election was the first in more than 80 years in which neither of the major party presidential candidates had served in the military But this may not be surprising given that military veterans make up steadily declining shares of both the public and members of CongressSupport is limited for a candidate who does not believe in GodIn our recent survey on faith and the 2016 campaign large majorities of Americans saidit would make no difference to them if a presidential candidate were Jewish 80 or Catholic 75 Being an evangelical Christian also is a neutral characteristic 55 of US adults saidit wouldnt matter if a candidate were an evangelical while similar shares saidit would make them more likely 22 or less likely 20 to vote for that personMembers of certain otherreligious groups however may have a harder time reaching the White House because of their religious beliefs While 69 of Americans saidit wouldnt matter if a candidate were a Mormon 23 saidthey would be less likely to vote for a Mormon Even more had a negative view of a hypothetical Muslim candidate 42 saidthey would be less likely to support such a candidate while 53 saidit would make no differenceNot believing in God remains an even greater potential liability for a candidate About half of Americans 51 saidthey would be less likely to vote for an atheist candidate though this share has fallen from 63 in 2007For most voters electability matters less than issue positionsPolitical pundits often focus on the electability of candidates  how they might fare in a general election contest But in September majorities of voters in both parties said it was more important for a candidate to share their positions on the issuesTwothirds of both Republican 67 and Democratic 65 registered voters said it was more important for a candidate to share their positions on issues than it was for a candidate to have the best chance of defeating the other partys nominee
