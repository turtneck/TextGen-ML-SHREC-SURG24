Negotiators hail nuclear deal reached after more than three years of talks as a winwin For Iran the deal to curb its nuclear program and greatly open it up to international scrutiny should pave a path to economic revival analysts sayFrom left to right Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier European Union High

Vienna Austria Tuesday After 18 days of intense and often fractious negotiation world powers and Iran struck a landmark deal Tuesday to curb Irans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from international sanctions on an agreement designed to avert the threat of a nucleararmed Iran and another US military intervention in the Muslim worldIrans president Hassan Rouhani addresses the nation in a televised speech minutes after a landmark nuclear agreement was announced in Vienna in Tehran Iran Tuesday July 14 2015 After long fractious negotiations world powers and Iran struck a historic deal Tuesday to curb Irans nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from international sanctions  an agreement aimed at averting the threat of a nucleararmed Iran and another US military intervention in the Middle EastIran and six world powers led by the United States have reached a historic agreement a victory of diplomacy over war that verifiably limits Irans nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctionsHailed by negotiators as striking a winwin balance amid significant compromises by both sides the complex and detailed agreement  running to 159 pages with annexes  caps a 13year dispute over Irans nuclear program that resulted in more than three years of talks including the last 20 months of intensive negotiations in Switzerland and AustriaThe final  sometimes angry and emotional  18day push in the Austrian capital Vienna blew through four selfimposed deadlines before a deal was reached early TuesdayAmerican officials say the agreement effectively cuts off four possible pathways to a nuclear weapon for more than a decade by strictly limiting Irans uranium enrichment capacity stockpiles of nuclear material and use of facilities and by adding far more intrusive inspectionsIranian officials say the deal will prove that Iran has no desire for nuclear weapons and that it can pave the way for cooperation on other issues afflicting the Middle EastToday could have been the end of hope on this issue but now we are starting a new chapter of hope and lets build on that said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif He said the deal was not perfect for anybody but could open new horizons for dealing with other serious problemsThe deal is a new chapter and shows that diplomacy can overcome decades of tensions and confrontations said Federica Mogherini the European foreign policy chief who has led the talks on behalf of the socalled P51 group  the five permanent members of the UN Security Council the US Russia China Britain and France and GermanyWith courage political will and mutual respect we delivered what the world was hoping for said Ms Mogherini A shared commitment to peace and to join hands in order to make our world saferThe deal which follows a diplomatic process often overshadowed by the risk of war is bound to have a profound effect on Iran and raises the question of how the Islamic Republics regional role might change if at allWill the Islamic Republic be empowered by a 100 billion postsanctions windfall as some of its rivals have warned to exert more influence in the region via proxy armed forces that threaten Israel Saudi Arabia or other US alliesOr will Iran  which faces regional challenges such as the Islamic State IS jihadists sectarian strife and the conflicts engulfing Syria Iraq and Yemen  look for areas of overlapping interests with the US and focus instead on its crippled economyThe short answer say analysts who know Iran is the pocketbook Tehrans top priority will be resuscitating the economy as sanctions ease to improve the daily lives of 80 million Iranians and ensure stability at home That issue helped elect President Hassan Rouhani in 2013The mood is really for renewal rather than expansion and to revive the economy and to keep the country going says Shahram Chubin an Iran analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in GenevaI dont think the nuclear deal will empower them to think that now they can run riot in the region at all he says After all the neglect that happened these last few years they really have a lot of catching up to do for the quality of life for their own peopleFor decades Iran has opposed the USdominated regional order and challenged Israel and US allies in the Gulf like Saudi Arabia notesMr ChubinNow  the regional order has collapsed nobodys in charge of it and in some places like Iraq and Afghanistan the interests of Iran and America overlap for the first time he says The result is the nuclear deal isnt the end rather its the beginning of a processIndeed both President Barack Obama and Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have hinted that a successful nuclear deal could be the basis of future negotiationsMoreover resolving the onceintractable nuclear issue is an example of what may be possible say Iran analysts with other hardtocrack problems like Syria where Irans policies and interventions are diametrically opposed to Western onesSo what are the key factors likely to shape Irans postdeal actions at home and abroadDespite warnings from some US and Israeli politicians that Iran would use the freedup revenues from the deal to spread regional mischief the talk inside Iran focuses on easing economic painThose who say sanctions are not important dont know what is happening in peoples pockets Mr Rouhani said at a provincial rally in late June He promised that with the deal we will enrich both uranium and the economySince Irans oil industry  the countrys main source of foreign currency  is still stateowned and revenue flows through the central bank the Rouhani administration will get first dibs and they have domestic priorities right now says Kevan Harris of the Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies at Princeton UniversityIranians have been stung by soaring inflation in recent years raising the cost of everything from tomatoes to medicine So Iranian politicians have been talking up the economic benefit of sanctions removal from foreign investments to more employmentIn April lawmaker Ahmad Tavakkoli said Irans human resources diverse climate and geopolitical situation have not been effectively used and that concentrating on foreign issues would waste such opportunities and keep us away from realityEstimates of Irans spending needs are vast according to data compiled by Bijan Khajehpour head of the Viennabased arm of the Iran analytical firm Atieh International Rouhanis top priority is the empowerment of domestic industry including for export and creating more value in the energy sector  all of which make jobs he said in a presentation June 29But the initial pricetag will be 122 billion with the banking sector alone requiring 25 billion to partly settle the previous governments debts estimates Mr Khajehpour Construction contracts with their multiplier effects on jobs and the economy will require a minimum of 30 billion and the petroleum industry will need an interim 40 billion  just over half of the 70 billion necessary to bring oil production levels back to 2012 levels Another 7 billion will be required for infrastructure projects from the Internet to telecomsLifting sanctions will be surely felt in peoples lives longterm said MP Abouzar Nadimi deputy chair of parliaments Economic Commission in April The nuclear deal will lead industry to fulfill its full capacityThe nuclear deal was achieved even as the Middle East lurches into its most volatile period in decadesWhile some Iranian officials hold fast to the rhetoric of resistance against US and Israeli influence  claiming that the ideals of Irans 1979 Islamic revolution are spreading  others recognize that Iran and the US are on the same side when it comes to fighting Sunni militantsBut will this deal enable a more antagonistic Iranian posture Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who tried to block it  said in March that Iran was gobbling up four countries right now and would control more if sanctions were liftedAnd Martin Indyk a former senior US official now at the Brookings Institution testified to the Senate in early June that a new regional security network must contain and rollback Irans nefarious hegemonic ambitionsBut as painful as they have been for Irans economy the sanctions have hardly been a deterrent to its military endeavors Iran has still rearmed Lebanese Hezbollah with tens of thousands of rockets for any future battle with Israel spent billions of dollars a year backing Syrias President Bashar alAssad in a war that has taken more than 220000 lives and resurrected Shiite militias in Iraq to fight IS ironically in concert with US airstrikesI dont think the release of funds which after all is going to be very gradual is going to change the pace or intensity of any of Irans significant involvements says Richard Dalton a former British ambassador to Iran now at the Chatham House think tank in LondonIts all very opaque so we dont know whether theres updating of a Hezbollah capability or they have a wish list from Assad that theyve been gagging to respond to and havent been able to he says There could be But  these will be incrementalFrom Beirut to Kabul Irans model now is defensive says Carnegies Chubin Syria especially has been costly in cash and dead Iranian generals and also has tarnished Hezbollah Iran is not madcap about doing more he saysThe narrative that Iran will plow its hardwon sanctions relief into regional adventurism  is powerful compelling and frightening It is also not true wrote Richard Nephew a former director for Iran at the US National Security Council and former member of the US nuclear negotiating team in a midJune column for ReutersSuch analysis defies history he argued because when Iran had 100 billion in restricted oil funds just over two years ago it was not plowing it all into Assad the Houthis in Yemen or troublemaking along the Gulf When Iran was making 88 billion a year from high oil prices in 2012 he wrote no one alleges that all of that money was going to terroristsWith the nuclear deal done the European Council on Foreign Relations is proposing engagement with Iran In a report this week the Londonbased think tank calls for highlevel and highintensity talks similar to the nuclear negotiations to focus on deescalation and conflict resolutionPrincetons Mr Harris argues for just such an approachThe places where Iran has influence tend to be the places where the region has collapsed he says If one truly believes that Iran is on the march then the best way to block it is to come up with a regionallyagreedupon pathway to a more stable Middle EastDespite the nuclear deal triumph and unprecedented face time between top diplomats USIran dtente is not around the cornerThe US last month declared that Irans state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide remained undiminished in 2014 And in Iran hardliners still chant Death to America even in parliamentThroughout the nuclear talks Khamenei often described his mistrust of the US and listed the reasons why If before the deal that level of suspicion scored 100 now Khameneis inherent distrust of the US is going to stay at 85 or 90 says Dalton of Chatham HouseHe expects ad hoc USIran consultations on overlapping interests to move things forward incrementally but no proIran tilt in Washington that disadvantages either Israel or Americas Gulf allies At least both the US and Iran now can pick up the phone and know who to talk toDiplomatic communication is going to be more effective says Dalton But whether it will be more influential That is a completely different question
