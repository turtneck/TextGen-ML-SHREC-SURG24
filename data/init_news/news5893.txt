Joseph Sohm  Shutterstockcom According to the mainstream media in a recent speech in West Palm Beach Donald Trump finally completely lost it Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner he spat out a series of undeniably hateful antiSemitic code words  like political establishment global elites and yes international banks He even went so far as to claim that corporations and their ahem lobbyists have millions of dollars at stake in this election and are trying to pass the TTP not to benefit the American people but simply to enrich themselves He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with the Clinton machine presumably to benefit these global elites and international banks and lobbyists Now a lot of folks didnt immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words and so mistakenly assumed that global elites referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes and that lobbyists referred to actual lobbyists and that banks meant  well  you know banks As it turned out this was completely wrong None of these words actually meant what they meant not in antiSemitic CodeSpeak So the mainstream media translated for us Political establishment meant the Jews Global elites also meant the Jews Banks meant Jews Lobbyists meant Jews Even corporate media meant Jews Apparently Trumps entire speech was a series of secret dogwhistle signals to his legions of neoNazi goons who immediately following Clintons victory are going to storm out of their hidey holes frontally attack the US military overthrow the US government and yes you guessed it  kill the Jews OK maybe Im exaggerating the mainstream medias reaction just a little bit Or maybe Trumps speech really was that fascistic Judge for yourself Read the transcript  NPR offers a complete version of it here  Then compare the reactions of The Wall Street Journal  The New York Times  Washington Post  The Inquirer  The Guardian  and other leading broadsheets and magazines and blogs like Mother Jones  Forward  Slate  Salon  Vox  Alternet  and a host of others most of which rely on Jonathan Greenblatt CEO of the AntiDefamation League and former Special Assistant to the President as their authoritative source on Trumpian cryptology Mr Greenblatt incidentally should know better given the treatment he has received from hardline Zionist publications for refusing to demonize Black Lives Matter and for taking sides against the State of Israel Look Im not defending Donald Trump who I consider a selfaggrandizing idiot and a soulless huckster of the lowest order and whose supporters include a lot of real antiSemites and racists and misogynists and other such creeps Im simply trying to point out how the corporate media have for months been playing the same hysterical tune like an enormous Goebbelsian keyboard instrument and how millions of Americans are singing along as they were before the invasion of Iraq which posed no threat to the USA  but which according to the media had WMDs and how terribly fucking disturbing that is In case you didnt instantly recognize it the name of the tune is This guy is Hitler and it isnt the short vulgarian fingers of Donald Trump that are tickling the ivories And no it isnt the Jews either Its the corporate media and the corporations that own them and the rest of the global capitalist ruling classes  in other words those global elites The thing I find particularly disturbing is how these rather mundane observations  ie a that a global ruling class exists b that its primarily corporate in character c that this class is pursuing its interests and not the interests of sovereign states  how such observations are being stigmatized as the ravings of unhinged antiSemites This stigmatization is not limited to Trumpists Anyone to the left of Clinton is now apparently an antiSemite For example Roger Cohen in The New York Times  riding the tsunami of condemnation of the insidious verbiage of Trumps West Palm speech executed an extended smearjob on Jeremy Corbyn and his Corbynistas theyre fond of coining these epithets the media denouncing their virulent antiAmericanism antiCapitalism antiglobalism and antiSemitic antiZionism Which let me hasten to add and stress and underscore and repeatedly emphasize is not to imply that the Labour Party or the British Left or the American Left or any other Left is antiSemitismfree Of course not There are antiSemites everywhere That isnt the point Or it isnt my point My point is that this stigmatization campaign is part of a much larger ideological project one that has little to do with Trump or Jeremy Corbyn or their respective parties Smearing ones political opponents is nothing new of course its as old as the hills But what were witnessing is more than smears As I proposed in these pages back in July  political dissent is being gradually pathologized ie stigmatized as aberrant or abnormal behavior as opposed to a position meriting discussion Consider the abnormalization of Sanders back when he was talking about banks global elites and other things that matter or the medias portrayal of British voters as racists in the wake of the Brexit referendum And yes the charges being leveled against Trump much as we might despise the man AntiSemitism inciting violence paranoid conspiracy theorizing insurrection treason et cetera  these are not legitimate arguments one needs to counter with superior arguments they are symptoms of deviations from a norm signs of criminality or pathology which is increasingly how the corporate ruling classes are dismissing anyone who attempts to challenge them A line is being drawn in the ideological sand On one side of it are the decent people the normal people in their business wear with their university degrees and prescriptions and debts On the other side are  well the deplorables the ignorant racist antiSemitic neonationalist populist extremists This line cuts through both the Left and the Right  supersedes both Left and Right making bedfellows of supposed adversaries like Obama Clinton Kagan Wolfowitz Scowcroft and their ilk on the Normal team and a motley crew of Trumpists Putinists European populists Corbynistas Sandernistas socialists anarchists Wikileakers antiZionists anticapitalists neoNazis Black Lives Matterers angry Greek pensioners environmental activists religious zealots the Klu Klux Klan David Graeber most of the contributors to CounterPunch and various other extremist types many of whom detest each other in the Deplorables current starting lineup The corporate media is sending a message  a message aimed at a much broader audience than undecided American voters assuming such creatures really exist The message is get with the fucking program or get stigmatized as an antiSemite or a racist or a Russian spy or whatever The message is drop the populist rhetoric shut the hell up about the Wall Street banks and the corporations and the one percent and  actually  forget about politics completely except for identity politics of course Go ahead and knock yourself out with that The message is youre either with us or against us  and it doesnt matter why youre against us or what it is you think youre for Right Left  who gives a shit Its one big Basket of Deplorables to us This message of course displays many of the hallmarks of the classic authoritarian mentality the need for nearly total conformity mindless allegiance to ones socalled superiors delegitimization of all opposing viewpoints and the infantile type of heroworship figures like Obama and Clinton inspire  not the oldfashioned authoritarianism that wouldbe despots like Trump represent but rather a more attractive version a hopey changey lovey version where there are no frightening Hitlerian leaders barking out antiSemitic code words and no one is exterminating thousands of people in faraway countries they want to destabilize in order to entirely dominate the region No this is the version where Obama sells the TPP on the Jimmy Fallon show and wars of aggression are not wars of aggression but humanitarian interventions Its also the version where universal healthcare is regrettably unrealistic but 38 billion for the State of Israel so it can operate its Apartheid State and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia so they can bomb the shit out of farmers in Yemen and cut off peoples heads for blasphemy is somehow in Americas vital interests But what do I know Im just a satirist I should probably leave all this complex stuff like what is and isnt in my interest and what words really mean and all that to the experts in the mainstream media Since they did so well decoding Trumps speech maybe they could translate some of these other code words Ive been having trouble with like the ones I put in scare quotes above or other such code words like enemy combatant free trade agreement security barrier indefinite detention targeted killing or troubled asset relief program I could go on but I probably shouldnt Odds are Im already on the list of Putinworshiping antiSemitic racist misogynist neonationalist nonstanding up for the National Anthem conspiracy theorizing Americahaters The last thing I need to do at this point is start jabbering about how the United States is an authoritarian corporatist dystopia ruled by a global capitalist elite that couldnt give less of a shit about Americans or any other actual people living in any other actual countries where the corporate media can whip up mass fanatical support for wars of aggression or corporate puppets by pointing their fingers at yet another bogeyman and shouting Hitler at the top of their lungs Next thing you know Id be writing about banks and global corporations and national sovereignty and we all know what thats about dont we C J Hopkins is an awardwinning American playwright and satirist based in Berlin His plays are published by Bloomsbury Publishing UK
