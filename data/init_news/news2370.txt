We Are Change Bill and Hillary Clinton have a long history of losing documents during various investigations and scandals over the years going all the way back to their time in ArkansasIts not just the current investigation into deleted emails in which the State Departments own internal probe found former Secretary of StatW Hillary Clinton violated federal record keeping laws  Its not just whitewater its several investigations where documents have turned up missing exonerating the Clintons and clearing them of guilt despite huge violations of obstruction of justiceHISTORY OF LOSING DOCUMENTS DURING INVESTIGATIONS In 1999 investigators looked into then First Lady Hillary and President Bill Clintons scandals which included Whitewater Travelgate Filegate and other scandals It was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed emails were mysteriously lost due to a glitch in a West Wing computer server  During the Project X email scandal career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White Houses automated email archiving system WHITEWATER The first notable case is the whitewater land scandal fiasco which started in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor The allegation is that the Clintons used the Rose Law Firm and the Arkansas Financial Department Authority as well as Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan owned by Susan and Jim McDougal  to scam Arkansas residents An investigation was started when the Clintons invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development CorporationAn entire article could be dedicated to the Whitewater scandal but what is important here is that documents for the whitewater investigation turned up missing were later discovered at the Clintons home Ben Shapiro of Breitbart noted in his own article on Hillarys long history of hiding documents In 1996 a special Senate Whitewater committee released a report from the FBI demonstrating that documents sought in the Whitewater investigation had been found in the personal Clinton quarters of the White House The First Ladys fingerprints were on them The documents had gone mysteriously missing for two years Mark Fabiani special White House counsel immediately stated that there was no problem according to the Times He added that she had testified under oath that she had nothing to do with the documents during the two years they were missing and did not know how they ended up in the family quarters Hillary remains the only First Lady in American history to be fingerprinted by the FBI Those werent the only missing Whitewater documents later found in the Clinton White House VINCE FOSTER The next notable case which is also connected to Whitewater is Vince Foster Foster worked alongside the Clintons as a top Rose Law firm attorney who had worked intimately with then First Lady Hillary Clinton throughout their career together After Fosters suicide documents went missing from his office  Secret Service officer Henry ONeill testified that he witnessed aides removing documentsSeveral years later more documents pertaining to Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster again vanished this time from the National Library including a document from Ken Stars investigation that proves that the suicide of Vince Foster was actually a murder  In those documents is the smoking gun that shows that Vince Foster sustained not one but two bullet wounds One to the neck and one to the head an impossible suicide scenarioIn addition to that experts have called Fosters suicide note a forgery One of my rules is once twice okay but three times is not a coincidenceits a criminal conspiracy Conspiracy as in the legal definition not a theory none of this is a theory when its well sourcedTRAVEL GATE In 1996 the day before the Whitewater documents were found at the White House a twoyearold memo emerged written by a former Presidential aide According to the New York Times it proved that Hillary Clinton had played a far greater role in the dismissal of employees of the White House travel office than the Administration has acknowledged PROJECT X EMAIL GATE According to Tom Fitton President of Judicial Watch Hillarys top lawyer and top aide Cheryl Mills helped orchestrate the coverup of another major scandal often referred to as Project X Emailgate Over the course of years the Clinton Administration allegedly withheld 18 million email communications from Judicial Watchs attorneys as well as federal investigators and Congress In addition Judicial Watch says that when a White House computer contractor attempted to reveal the emails White House officials instructed her to keep her mouth shut about the hidden email or face dismissal and jail time 20152016 EMAIL GATE Where do I start about the botched investigation of Hillarys private email server The obstruction of justice is so broad its insane She used bleach bit software the day after being subpoenaed smashed several BlackBerrys and iPads with hammers was tipped off by the DoJ and DoS into the investigation according to Wikileaks etcClintons close ally Terry McAulife gave a donation to the wife of the Deputy Director Of The FBI Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch towards the end of the investigation The list goes on2 TERABYTES OF DATA MISSING Two terrabyte drive with Clinton White House emails missing presumed stolen from National Archives httpstcop3eZqxKxke pictwittercom792rxje642  WikiLeaks wikileaks November 3 2016 Yet even with all of the evidence the current FBI directorwho has been revealed to be connected to the Clintonshas once again refused to acknowledge the corrupt career nature of the ClintonsDirector James Comey told Congress Sunday that the FBI does not recommend charges against Clinton even after an additional 650000 emails were discovered on the laptop of her aides estranged husband Anthony WeinerWhether its deleting emails or covering up documents to prevent prosecution it has always been the Clinton way Why is it that journalists can uncover this past historic information but the FBI investigators cant Something isnt right Drain the swamp and nominate AK for FBI Director 2017 and stay tuned to We Are Change This case is closed The Clintons are corrupt That or documents have somehow developed an artificial intelligence to stay away from the Clintons It must be a right wing conspiracy I would be willing to put my deplorable eggs into one basket and say its the latterThe post OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE The Clintons Long History Of Losing Documents appeared first
