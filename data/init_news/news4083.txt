2016 presidential campaign by Ann Garrison The justconcluded election revealed as much about the corporate media which has broken every rule of journalism to support Hillary Clinton and the fraudulence of much of the American Left which turns out to have no real problem with war or capitalism than it did about the candidates themselves Edward Herman is an exception a genuine man of the Left He says a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia Clinton Is the Most Dangerous Person Alive  An Interview with Edward S Herman by Ann Garrison  The election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory Ann Garrison Earlier this year you told me that you differ with Noam Chomsky your coauthor of Manufacturing Consent and other books in that you plan to vote for the Green Partys presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka in the swing state of Pennsylvania Are you still planning to do so Edward S Herman Yes AG Can you explain why ESH Because the two duopoly candidates are dangerous to societal and international welfare and even survival Hillary Clinton is a neoliberal and preeminent warmonger I think she is the most dangerous person living in the world today given her highly likely election victory and her likely performance as president She represents the corporate elite and militaryindustrial complex more clearly than Trump and she is a followon to Bush and Obama She will pursue similar policies except for her somewhat more aggressive bent Trump is a selfpromoting windbag racist and dangerous unpredictable phony We have a ghastly choice in these two Jill Stein offers a protest opportunity more so than not voting On the line that either voting for Stein or not voting would constitute a vote for Trump one might argue that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Syria and Russia and a vote for Netanyahu and hence for escalated violence in Palestine AG Hillary Clinton and John Podestas email has revealed that Hillary Clinton is well aware that the Saudi and Qatari rulers  not rogue elements  fund ISIS and the same Saudi and Qatari rulers fund the Clinton Foundation Throughout the last George Bushs presidency there were innumerable headlines that Saudi oil sheikhs met with George Bush on his Crawford Texas ranch What are your thoughts on that ESH Saudi Arabia is a US ally and an instrument of the warfare state Hillary Clinton has treated its leaders warmly and she will continue to do so as president The Clinton Foundations receipt of money from Saudi and Qatari leaders is a first class conflict of interest and outrage but the media have focused on the many less important abuses of Trump helping cover over the outrages of their preferred candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill Clinton AG What do you think of Clintons statement that she would make removing Bashar AlAssad her top priority And Trumps statement that he would not because that would recklessly risk confrontation with Russia ESH Hillary Clinton has essentially promised to escalate war in Syria and is therefore promising to go to war with Russia as well Diana Johnstone has made the case that Hillary Clinton plans to try to bring about regime change in Russia cite This is of course incredibly dangerous and would have aroused a really democratic media but the existing media are part of the war system hence Hillary Clintons commitment to wars is essentially suppressed Trump has made a number of statements along the lines of reducing US interventions and commitments abroad and trying to deal with Russia in a less confrontational manner but he has sometimes contradicted himself by urging expanded arms use of nuclear weapons etc But Hillary Clinton has said nothing that would offset her warmongering This difference from Trump may help explain the intensity of media hostility to Trump AG Jill Stein has said that wars for oil are blowing back at us wth a vengeance and that she would cut the military budget by half close most of the foreign bases and redirect resources into a Green New Deal that would fully employ Americans building sustainable energy and agricultural infrastructure I cant imagine you disagree but do you think its important for the Greens to articulate such a vision at the national and international level instead of focusing solely on local races that they might win ESH The Greens dont have the resources to compete in many local elections So she is wise to focus on the big national and international issues Furthermore the real gap in the political system is the lack of opposition to national neoliberal and militaristic policies It is said that she cant make a bigger mark given the hegemony of the duopoly but even Ralph Nader couldnt get 5 percent of the vote The system still works well for the 1 AG  Michael Moore has made a movie called Trumpland and warned that Trumps election would be the end of the United States  assuming that would be a bad thing David Swanson author of War Is a Lie has imagined the same but argued in  Secession Trump and the Avoidability of Civil War  that the breakup of the United States is not the worst possibility on the horizon Do you have any thoughts on this ESH Michael Moore is completely oblivious to the fact that the enlarging war that is likely to follow Hillary Clintons election threatens not only a nuclear exchange but also attacks on civil liberties and the march toward fascism In its own way the election of Hillary Clinton might threaten a democratic order as much as a Trump victory The antiTrump hysteria has tended to block out consideration of the Hillary Clinton menace AG Is there anything else youd like to say about why youre voting for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka ESH Ive always believed in the moral rule laid down in the categorical imperative Do that which you would wish generalized Ann Garrison an independent journalist based in Oakland USA
