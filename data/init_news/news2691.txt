Recall those heady days seven years ago when Presidentelect Obamas promise to unite the two parties to work for the common good was still an article of faith among the true believers The fact that he had managed to transcend Americas great original sin to become the first African American president was an amazing political feat but too many people including some in the administration and at times the president himself understood that to mean that he had pacified the Republicans During the transition the assumption was that there was a unique opportunity to solve all the big problems at once due to this unique historical momentOn January 15 2009 EJ Dionne of the Washington Post wrote a column calledAudacity without Ideologythat laid out the administrations thinkingThere are at least three keys to understanding Obamas approach to and avoidance of ideology There is first his simple joy in testing himself against those who disagree with him Someone who knows the presidentelect well says that he likes talking with philosophical adversaries more than with allies But Obamas antiideological turn is also a functional one for a progressive at least for now Since Ronald Reagan ideology has been the terrain of the right Many of the programs that conservatives have pushed have been based more on faith in their worldview than on empirical tests How else could conservatives claim that cutting taxes would actually increase government revenue or that trickledown economic approaches were working when the evidence of middleclass incomes said otherwiseThe second key was the quite obvious fact that the economy would require liberal solutions with which nobody on the right could possibly disagree so there was no need to even talk about ideology Obama could just subsume all objections under mountain of data and that would be thatThe third key was the telltale notions that would define his presidency sacrifice grand bargain and sustainability Sacrifice was the benefits people would have to give up in order that the president could reform the government from top to bottom This would entail figuring out a way to control health care costs cut the entitlements and get limits on carbon emissions And because this was all just simple common sense and so very pragmatic the political system could have no objections Dionne described it his wayThe economy was in freefall the election had been decisive and the new president came in with a congressional majority so it was reasonable for the Democrats to believe they had a mandate But despite the fact that there had been a bogus impeachment a stolen election and a war based upon lies the president didnt seem to have truly recognized what the Republican Party had become They were not on board with his plan to pragmatically solve problems and everyone should have been crystal clear on that when the Senate could only get three Republicans Collins Snow and Specter to vote for a stimulus package to deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great DepressionBy the time the Democrats started putting together a health care plan the Tea Party had been formed and a plan was in place SenatorJim DeMintwas declaring if were able to stop Obama on this it will be his Waterloo They did everything they could but they couldnt stop it Obamacare passed on a party line vote and a year laterSenator Mitch McConnell saidthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a oneterm president Republicans didnt even pretend to be dealing in good faith and decided that their midterm victory meant they had a mandate to control the government from one house of Congress The result was the debt ceiling crisis a government shutdown and sequestration The president proposed his Grand Bargain idea of cutting Social Security but the Tea Party would have none of it as long as the White House insisted on getting some revenue from the wealthy It was hopeless As former Obama administration staff member Dan PfeiffersaidHe had hopes of being able to change the polarization not just in the country but in Washington But they learned it was a lot harder than they thought Pfeiffer said it was President Obamas biggest regret that he had not been able to deliver on that promise But nobody could have delivered on that promise The polarization that exists today has always been with us Whats new is that the two parties are now divided ideologically when in the past the ideological divide existed within both of them Our system with all of its checks and balances doesnt work very efficiently under such conditions Thinking about this recent history inevitably makes you wonder what will happen with the next president Its logical to assume that if one of the Republicans wins next November this dynamic would change One of the most frightening political scenarios imaginable is one in which a President Trump or Cruz wins the presidency and has a congressional majority to help them enact their agenda But it pays to keep in mind that President Obama had that for an admittedly short period along with a major crisis which demanded government action We know how that turned out Theres no guarantee that this would happen under a Trump administration of course But he is soeccentricto put it politely that he would likely find himself at odds with his own party on much of his agenda Its very hard to see how such a person could even function A President Cruz is a much clearer proposition His party establishment has no love for him but he is smart and resourceful and would likely hit the ground running with a plan to enact his agenda But like President Obama he would likely have a very short window in which to do it Its fair to assume hes aware of that Whether any of the socalled establishment candidates get that is an unknown but both Bush and Kasich have been out of Washington for a long time and Rubio seems to be oblivious to its current dynamics But regardless of which one might win the first two years of a GOP administration with a GOP majority would be a very dangerous time One assumes the Democrats are all fully aware of what they are dealing with at this point With the Republicans still in full extremist mode unless the Democrats win an unprecedented landslide very unlikely in this polarized political environment a progressive agenda will probably only be fulfilled around the edges There are no more illusions of Grand Bargains and changing the polarized political system through pragmatic policies designed to give everyone a little of what they want Until these Republicans sober up the best we can hope for is that Democrats can keep the GOP from dismantling every bit of progress thats been madeover the past half century and stop them from starting World War III Theres nothing more important than that
