CNN President Barack Obama strongly pushed back against claims that he has used antiSemitic rhetoric in criticizing those opposed to the nuclear deal with IranThere is not a smidgen of evidence for it other than the fact that there have been times where Ive disagreed with a particular Israeli governments position on a particular issue Obama said in an interview published Monday with The Forward  a leading Jewish newspaper adding that such charges are hurtfulObamas comments come as the Obama administration is making a fullcourt press to sell the Iran deal to the American public and prevent Congress from blocking in a September vote the agreement brokered in July between Iran and world powerSecretary of State John Kerry will deliver a major speech on the deal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday as part of that push CNN has learned Kerry will use the speech to defend the merits of the agreement and respond to its critics as Obama has done in several

group picture at the United Nations building in Vienna on July 14The Obama administrations strongly worded defense of the nuclear deal and its attacks on those opposed to the deal has concerned some prominent members of the American Jewish community who have worried aloud that the administrations rhetoric could fuel antiSemitic stereotypesAt issue are Obama and his top surrogates claims that opponents of the deal are going to precipitate a war with Iran and that their opposition has come from a wellfunded lobbying campaign  a campaign rooted in the American Jewish community and other proIsrael circlesSome critics of the deal have gone even further in linking Obamas Iran deal to antiSemitism as 2016 GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson did while discussing the agreement in light of Irans threats to IsraelAnything is antiSemitic that is against the survival of a state that is surrounded by enemies and people who want to destroy them he told Fox News in midAugust To sort of ignore that and to act like everything is normal there and these people are paranoid I think thats antiSemiticObama has rejected that premise and insisted in his interview with The Forward that if you care deeply about Israel then you have an obligation to be honest about what you think the same way you would with any friendAnd we dont do anybody any friend a service by just rubberstamping whatever decisions they make even if we think that theyre damaging in some fashion Obama addedBeyond the heated rhetoric critics have recently homed in on elements of the deal that they say do not hold up to the test of scrutinyBut Kerry during an interview with CNN in Anchorage Alaska ahead of a conference of Arctic nations pushed back on the notion that the Iranians would be able to selfinspect at Parchin as Republicans in Congress have allegedWe are satisfied that we will be able to have a process which can get us the answers Kerry said If they are not accountable in the way that we expect them to be with appropriate access then they would be in material breach of the agreement and subject to any and all options available to the United StatesKerry flew to Anchorage to help deliver President Barack Obamas message on climate change to foreign ministers gathered in Alaska for this weeks GLACIER conferenceWe still have time to pull back from the total precipice of absolute catastrophe that threatens life itself on the planet providing that we do the things that the President and others are talking about Kerry saidThe Secretary of State added that global warming skeptics in the Republican Party like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz should travel to Alaska to see the impacts of climate change first handAsk any Alaskan I think people in Alaska will tell Donald Trump and tell Ted Cruz its happening And all they have to do is come here and open their minds and their eyes and their ears and listen look And they will see the impacts of what is happening Kerry saidKerry denied the administration is guilty of climate hypocrisy after its recent approval of Shells application to begin oil and natural gas drilling in the arcticHe also stated that he will not punt a decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline to the next administration but he declined to signal how soon a decision might come
