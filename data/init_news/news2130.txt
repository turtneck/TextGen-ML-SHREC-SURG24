Washington CNN The House Benghazi committee took its best swings at Hillary Clinton in a daylong hearing Thursday  but the former secretary of state remained mostly calm throughout the hearing save for a few animated moments in which she struggled to mask her contempt for her Republican inquisitorsThe panels seven Republicans tried to prove Clinton ignored US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens  requests for additional security before the September 11 2012 attacks during which Stevens and three other Americans were killedBut Clinton  seeking an October trifecta after delivering a strong performance in the first Democratic presidential debate last week and then watching Vice President Joe Biden decide to sit out the race bolstering her chances at the partys nomination  gave them little new fodderHere are 11 takeaways from the hearing one for every hour it lastedThere would be no moment of exasperation like the one Clinton had made at a Benghazi hearing two years ago when she asked of the attackers motives What difference at this point does it makeClinton spoke slowly in a measured tone  careful to keep any anger or frustration in check even as Republicans attacked herShe even tugged at the heartstrings of those who were watching the hearing on television saying that insinuations that she deliberately blocked requests for increased security are very personally painfulI would imagine Ive thought more about what happened than all of you put together Ive lost more sleep than all of you put together Clinton saidThe following morning one source told CNN that Clinton HQ was ecstaticThat was a president sitting there the source a Clinton campaign aide saidRep Jim Jordan ROhio pushed Clinton hard over her use of a private email server  mocking her as the most transparent person everHe demanded to know the search terms her attorneys used to sort through which emails were workrelated and therefore should be turned over to the State Department and which were personalYou might have made more mistakes  we dont know Jordan saidClinton appeared a bit thrown unable to answer questions about how specifically her lawyers combed through her emailsI have been releasing my emails to the public she said a reference to the State Departments courtordered release of her work emailsThe hearing started at 10 am and Jordans line of questioning didnt begin until 745 pm If Republicans were hoping Clinton would be worn down it didnt happen But they did manage to push the portion about Clintons private server into primetime television It was a risk as some news outlets  like Fox News  had already cut away from the hearingThe email questions did push Democratic Rep Elijah Cummings over the edge though as he lambasted Republicans for trying to badger you into a gotcha momentWere better than that We are so much better Were a better country an impassioned Cummings said to Clinton And we are so much better than using taxpayer dollars to try to destroy a campaignShe said she couldnt recallOne of the most compelling  and informative  moments of the day unfolded shortly after 7 pm during an exchange with Rep Susan Brooks RInd who repeatedly asked whether Clinton had spoken with Stevens after he was sworn in as the US ambassador to Libya in May 2012 and before his death on Sept 11 2012We dont know the answer Did you ever personally speak to him after you swore him in in May Brooks asked Clinton her voice raising with emotion Yes or no pleaseYes I believe I did Clinton replied I dont recallIt was a moment that will almost certainly be referred back to again and again particularly by critics who believe Clinton did not do enough to secure the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi It was reminiscent of those five words that still reverberate from her 2013 testimony What difference does it makeHer voice was calm She stood her ground But Clinton bluntly explained that there are many diplomatic personnel working in dangerous conditions  not just LibyaWe have diplomatic facilities in war zones Clinton said We have ambassadors that we send to places that have been bombed and attacked all the timeHad you talked to him in July he would have told you that he had asked to keep the security in Libya that he had Brooks said He was told no by your State DepartmentMuch of the focus in the leadup to the hearing hasnt been on Clinton at all but on the panels chairman Trey GowdyThe former prosecutors carefully laid plans for the hearing were thrown into a tailspin when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy put Gowdy on defense by claiming the committee was scoring political points by dragging Clintons poll numbers down Gowdy spent weeks trying to show that the work is only focused on getting the truth  not ClintonBut Gowdys lines of questioning  hitting Clinton about her friends and her emails  will do little to erase doubts about his committee especially as Democrats continue their threat to pull out altogetherIts unclear whether it sullies his future though Gowdy ultimately wants to leave Congress when the committee work concludes and become a federal judge which would require a Republican in the White HouseGowdy was unable to say what was different between Thursdays event and the last time she testifiedI dont know that she testified that much differently today than the previous times shes testified Gowdy told CNNThe biggest player in Thursdays hearing might not have been in the room at allThe committees chairman Gowdy made Blumenthal the focus of the first 10minute period in which he questioned Clinton He highlighted negative remarks Blumenthal had made about other members of President Barack Obamas administrationYou know Mr Chairman if you dont have any friends who say unkind things privately I congratulate you but from my perspective I dont know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of four deaths of Americans Clinton saidThe committee has already interviewed Blumenthal Democrats got frustrated enough with the GOPs comments about him that they moved to make public the transcript of that interview  but Republicans voted down that motionSaid Rep Adam Schiff DCalifornia I have to say I just dont understand the preoccupation with Sidney Blumenthal7 Schiff and the Democrats who had Clintons backClinton had a good ally on the panel in Schiff who is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee The closest member on the panel to classified intelligence he gave her a lot of cover on the fog that happens in unfolding situationsHe also was a bit of yin to Cummings yang in that his sharp attacks on his Republican colleagues have been overwhelmingly calmly delivered while Cummings opted for more flash and bangBoth have allowed Clinton to deliver pure emotionally powerful statements  staying above the fray while the panel members handle throwing barbsClinton had more friends in the audience Several Democrats made appearances in the hearing room throughout the day At one point Clinton turned and said to them Youve got my back  literally8 All about the emailsDespite Republicans assurances that Clintons use of a private email server wouldnt be a primary focus of the hearing the seven GOP members kept coming back to her emailsBrooks piled two stacks of Clintons emails on her desk  a taller set from 2011 and a shorter collection from 2012Rep Mike Pompeo RKansas asked Clinton why she had never given Stevens her personal email addressHe then pushed Clinton on whether Stevens had her home address fax number or cell phone number too  reminding her that her friend Blumenthal doesOthers pressed the same issue It was part of an attempt by Republicans to demonstrate that Stevens requests for additional security were ignored by Clinton because she didnt offer him enough accessHelp us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you Madam Secretary but the ambassador did not Gowdy saidThe problem for Republicans who appeared overly focused on what has become a political hot button is that most of the resources the committee has are in the form of emails thousands of documents theyve received from the State Department about what happened in Libya and Benghazi That limits their ability to press Clinton on records obtained otherwiseWhat about Thursdays marathon hearing will give the GOP new ammunition in the fight against Clinton and her performance on Benghazi The revelations that she told both a top Egyptian official and her own family that the attack was premeditated and respectively carried out by an known terror group will likely be used against herJordan read out a conversation she had with thenEgyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil the day after the Benghazi attack in which she told him We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film It was a planned attack not a protest And he also read from an email to her family right after the attack in which she wrote Two officers were killed today in Benghazi by an al Qaedalike groupClinton explained the discrepancy between those sentiments and the administrations repeated statements in the days after the attacks that the attacks were spontaneous as largely due to fastmoving intelligence assessments in a chaotic periodBut to Republicans they are likely to be seized on as evidence that the administration was not upfront about the nature of the attacks Many in the GOP have long maintained that the Obama administration wanted to conceal the attacks ties to terrorists out of fear that would undermine a central argument in President Barack Obamas reelection campaign  then in its closing weeks  that he had been effective in fighting terrorJordan submitted the former secretary of state to a dramatic period of questioning when he alleged that she and other Obama administration staff tried to blame the attack on the consulate on an antiMuslim YouTube video to avoid undercutting Obamas claims that he had crushed al QaedaYou could live with a protest about a video that wont hurt you but a terror attack would Jordan said saying that Americans could accept reluctantly compatriots being killed abroad but what they cant live with is when their government is not square with themClinton rejected the claim saying in the desperate hours after the attack that information on the true nature of the assault on the compound by a mob was unclearI am sorry that it doesnt fit your narrative congressman Clinton said I can only tell you what the facts are11 I really dont care what you say about meAt the end of the 11th hour  and after a brief coughing fit  Clinton could no longer hide her contempt for the Republicanled committee and particularly GowdyI really dont care what you say about me It doesnt bother me a bit she said while defending Admiral Michael Mullen who helmed a previous Benghazi investigationShe added I cant help Mr Chairman that you all dont like the findings of previous reviews
