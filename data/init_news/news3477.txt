Hanging in the balance is Obamas vision of Americas place in the world and the kind of leadership it can best wield in the 21st century some foreignpolicy analysts sayPresident Obama is not battling to save his AsianPacific trade agenda simply because he suddenly believes in free tradeFor Mr Obama the fight in Congress over granting him Trade Promotion Authority TPA is about something much biggerHanging in the balance is nothing less than Obamas vision of Americas place in the world and the kind of leadership it can best wield in the 21st century some foreignpolicy analysts sayWinning or losing TPA will make or break Obamas foreign policy vision of the United States  no longer the goitalone superpower  leading a multipolar world where associations of likeminded nations build regional security and economic prosperity these analysts say With the Obama administration pursuing not only the AsianPacific trade deal but also a transformational trade pact with the European Union the moment they add could not be more criticalWithout the trade deals America does not get to set the global economic rules for the new era using trade to bind its allies around the globe to the US and to one another says John Hulsman a US foreign policy analyst based in Germany It is not too much to say he adds that without TPA there simply is no grand strategy for the new era in Americas relations with the worldThe TransPacific Partnership or TPP that Obama had hoped to conclude by the end of the year with 11 other Pacific Basin countries  most critically Japan  is currently at the top of Obamas agenda because of what it means for his Asia strategyWithout TPA  the ability to negotiate trade deals with the assurance that Congress will only be allowed a simple yes or no nonamendable vote on a concluded trade accord  Obama has virtually no chance of securing a TPP deal And without TPP the Asia pivot in US strategic interests that Obama has been pushing since taking office in 2009 will be halted in its still tentative tracks  reduced largely to the aspirational rhetoric that critics claim it has been all alongFor Obama administration officials the Asia pivot  or what they prefer to call a rebalancing of US interests towards a dynamic and fastgrowing Asia  is not just about the number of US forces stationed in the region Two pieces of the rebalancing so far have been accords to rotate troops into Australia and the PhilippinesPerhaps even more important is the economic dimension of the turn to Asia Not only does Obama underscore at every turn possible the importance of securing Americas stake in the booming Asian economy he also notes that some power is going to determine the rules of the road for the worlds most dynamic trading region The insinuation being that its much better that it be the US and not China the regions other dominant powerThe challenge to Obamas Asia policy  and the death blow that failure to move ahead on TPP would deliver to it  is not lost on the regions leadersIf you dont do this deal what are your levers of power Singapores foreign minister K Shanmugam said in a warning issued in a Washington speech Monday The choice is a very stark one he said in remarks delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington Do you want to be part of the region or do you want to be out of the regionSingapores top diplomat  his tiny but booming island country is one of the 12 TPP countries  noted that without the economic dimension to its Asia policy the US is reduced to primarily a military power in the region But in a part of the globe where trade and economic prosperity are the focus he added thats not the lever you want to useNoting that the 40percent share of global GDP that the region represents is only expected to grow Mr Shanmugam said In all of this where is the United StatesThe Asian diplomat sounded almost like he could have been speaking from White House talking points suggesting that if the US chooses not to lead that Asian countries will have no choice but to look elsewhereThat argument may not sway Congress however which some see as too inwardly focused to grasp the changes going on in the world We are shifting into a more multipolar world but its not clear Washington realizes that says Mr Hulsman who is president of John C Hulsman Enterprises a global political risk firmOn Tuesday it looked like the next test in Congress for TPA  and thus for Obamas Asia pivot and his grand global strategy  might not come until late July But if the president hasnt been able to sell his vision over years of promoting it it seems at least uncertain hell be able to save it now
