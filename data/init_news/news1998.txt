Rep Mark Meadows RNC has been able to count on his Facebook page for stalwart support during his longrunning battle with the House Republican leadership including a successful effort to oust House Speaker John A Boehner ROhioKeep up the great work read a comment posted last week We the people thank you for ridding us of John BoehnerBut in recent days the tone of the comments on Meadowss page and those of the other members of the hardright House Freedom Caucus have changed significantlyYou truly should be ashamed one commenter wrote Thursday The people in the caucus will be held responsible come election dayYou should all be replaced a critic told Rep Barry Loudermilk RGa Another called Rep Ral R Labrador RIdaho one of the most persistent thorns in Boehners side a RINO establishment lap dog and another goalong to get along phony who will GLADLY step on the throats of the Conservative electorateThings may never be the same for the Freedom Caucus after most of its members moved last week to support Rep Paul Ryan RWis as the next House speaker Suddenly they may not be conservative enough for some in the partyThe groundswell of support from hardcore conservative voters that emboldened the group as it battled Boehner and the GOP establishment seemed to subside for the first time in months That has put its members in the unfamiliar position of defending their right flankLook I imagine that theres theoretically a chance that we all went from being radical extremist crazies to Washington sellouts in 12 hours said Rep Mick Mulvaney RSC a Freedom Caucus leader But maybe a more likely narrative is that we really think that this is a good step for the conservative movement And its up to us to try to explain that to people and thats what weve been doingThey would seem to have a lot of explaining to doThe anger over Ryans ascent has been fueled by voices across the conservative media landscape On the Internet sites such as Breitbartcom and the Drudge Report have pumped out a steady stream of antiRyan stories casting doubt on his record while such prominent commentators as Erick Erickson Ann Coulter and Mickey Kaus have sharpened their teeth and urged conservatives to contact lawmakers and tell them to spurn RyanParticularly brutal have been the syndicated talkradio hosts who have helped foment the antiestablishment outrage that has kept Donald Trump atop the GOP presidential race and forced Jeb Bush a wellfinanced mainstream conservative to undertake a campaign shakeupLaura Ingraham last week called Ryan basically John Boehner with better abs and featured segment after segment attacking Ryans positions on trade and immigration She also mocked his desire to spend his weekends with his familyAnother influential host Mark Levin lambasted Ryan as a creature of the establishment elite I think its time ladies and gentlemen to choose a speaker from outside the House of Representatives he told his audience Wednesday This is the best the Republican establishment can do its just not good enoughAnd the biggest conservative talker of them all Rush Limbaugh on Thursday called Ryan a favorite of the Republican donor class and the new Cantor  a reference to former House majority leader Eric Cantor who was ousted last year in a GOP primaryMeanwhile the man who did the ousting  Rep Dave Brat RVa  counts himself among the roughly 70 percent of Freedom Caucus members who say they are willing to support RyanWhen they make decisions its not in haste Brat said of the caucus And so I would ask the American people Hold your fire Wait till you see exactly what our group is doing and I think youll see that its coherent it makes senseOne problem for Brat and his Freedom Caucus colleagues is that Ryan has remained mum for the most part on his intentions When he spoke to the House Republican Conference on Tuesday Ryan set out conditions for agreeing to serve as speaker including an end to the House rule allowing a speaker to be ousted by a simple majorityRyan appeared to soften on that point in meetings with lawmakers later in the week and Freedom Caucus members say Ryan privately discussed other concessions including a restructuring of the House Republican steering committee and adherence to the Hastert rule requiring a majority of Republicans to support any measure put on the floorBut Ryan mentioned none of those items in the letter he sent to colleagues Thursday agreeing to serve He opted instead for gauzy generalities We can make the House a more open and inclusive body  one where every member can contribute to the legislative process We can rally House Republicans around a bold agenda that will tackle the countrys problems head on And we can show the country what a commonsense conservative agenda looks likeThat has left a cadre of tea party insurgents most elected no more than five years ago in the position of defending their willingness to trust implicitly a 17year incumbent with a long record of negotiating spending deals with Democrats and backing immigration reform measures that are deeply unpopular on the rightThe latter has proved to be especially toxic for Ryan in conservative circles to the point that his chief partner in pushing reform legislation Rep Luis V Gutierrez DIll said he had Republican members who are friends of mine saying Dont say anything good about Paul Ryan Dont say anything at all about Paul RyanTheres a small group that wields an inordinate influence and power over the group Gutierrez added They are slaves and captives to Laura IngrahamMeadows said Thursday that he and likeminded members were more concerned that Ryan might have made contradictory pledges to different groups while courting support last week And he suggested that Ryan might be at risk of fraying the House GOP anew if he didnt make a clearer statement before Thursdays speaker voteIts important that a down payment be made in order to keep that supermajority intact he saidA handful of House hardliners perhaps 10 to 15 remain proudly outside the proRyan camp most continue to back Rep Daniel Webster RFla a backbencher who has emphasized procedural reformsI dont know what theyre thinking really Rep Thomas Massie RKy a Webster backer said of the Freedom CaucusIf youve got problems with a man today and the man tells you Tomorrow Ill be a different person  it doesnt happen said Rep Walter B Jones RNC who said he has received more than 100 calls over two days from constituents opposing RyanBut others say they are willing to take the heat from the base Commentators and activists might be exercised about Ryans immigration positions they say but lawmakers are more focused on how hell run the HouseRep Matt Salmon RAriz noted that Webster whom the Freedom Caucus had previously endorsed for speaker is not considered to be particularly conservativeIt never was about the most perfect guy with the most perfect voting record its about the person thats willing to govern in a way that allows conservative ideas to at least come to the forefront which he has said he is willing to do Salmon said I think conservatives all over the country ought to be doing cartwheels  Weve been dealing with eating crumbs off the table Now weve got an opportunity to sit at the table and actually partake in the mealSome simply say they are confident that their constituents will trust them to make the right decision Rep Ken Buck RColo said calls to his office were running 2 to 1 against Ryan but he said passions were at a much lower level than after he voted for Boehner in JanuaryAsked Thursday if he expects pitchforks back home Buck said he did not Im the guy with the pitchfork
