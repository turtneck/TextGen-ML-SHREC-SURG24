Top US intelligence officials are running out of patience with the State Departments reluctance to turn over emails from Hillary Clintons private email server which have already been shown to have included top secret communications Fox News has learnedThe Intelligence Communitys Inspector General has requested some 30000 emails from Clintons tenure as Secretary of State in order to conduct its own review Those emails are in possession of the State Department which has been gradually releasing them to the publicClinton has agreed to turn over a similarsized batch of emails as well as the highly unusual private server she had installed in her Chappaqua NY home to the Department of Justice which is conducting a separate investigationAn intelligence source told Fox News the State Department has pushed back on the government intelligence watchdogs request and that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is considering intervening The source said the inspector general wants to check the controls on the redaction process and ensure that the office can get a handle on all of the potentially sensitive information that was contained in the Clinton emailsThe flurry of activity came after Charles McCullough the inspector general notified senior members of Congress that two of four retroactively classified emails found on Clintons server were deemed Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information  a rating that is the governments highest classificationsClinton the former first lady senator from New York and top diplomat now running for the Democratic presidential nomination announced Tuesday that she had told aides to turn over the actual server to the Justice Department giving in to months of demands that she relinquish the device she used to store her correspondence while secretary of stateSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley RIowa said McCullough had reported the new details about the higher classification to Congress on TuesdayThe State Department disputes McCulloughs determination that the emails were classified at the time they were sent McCullough had previously told Congress that potentially hundreds of classified emails are among the cache that Clinton provided to the State DepartmentA State Department spokesman said Wednesday that the agency is still processing the emails Clinton initially turned over and took a veiled swipe at Grassley for disclosing what McCullough had saidThe emails that have been discussed have not been released to public said Deputy Press Secretary Mark Toner We are working to resolve if it is indeed classified and we are taking steps to make sure the information is protected and stored properlyThese emails were not marked classified when they were sent he addedA source familiar with the investigation told Fox News late Tuesday that the two emails in question contained operational and geospatial intelligence from the CIA and the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency NGA which produces satellite imagesThe FBI is investigating whether classified information was improperly sent via and stored on the socalled homebrew email server she ran from her home in the New York City suburb after concerns were raised by McCullough Investigators have said that the probe is not criminal in nature and have denied that Clinton is a target of their inquiriesClinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said she has pledged to cooperate with the governments security inquiry and if there are more questions we will continue to address themIts not clear if the device will yield any information  Clintons attorney said in March that no emails from the main personal address she used while secretary of state still reside on the server or on backup systems associated with the serverAn intelligence source familiar with the matter told Fox News that the campaigns statement of cooperation was overblown as the FBI had previously taken possession of a thumb drive containing sensitive emails that had been held by Clintons personal attorney David Kendall The Associated Press reported that Kendall gave three thumb drives containing copies of roughly 30000 workrelated emails sent to and from Clintons personal email address to the FBI after the agency determined he could not remain in possession of the classified information contained in some of the emailsThe APs report cited a US official briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly The State Department previously had said it was comfortable with Kendall keeping the emails at his Washington law officeClinton had to this point refused demands from Republican critics to turn over the server to a third party with Kendall telling the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi Libya that there is no basis to support the proposed thirdparty review of the server Clinton has also defended her use of the server saying she used it as a matter of convenience to limit the number of electronic devices she had to carryIts about time House Speaker John Boehner ROhio said in a statement Secretary Clintons previous statements that she possessed no classified information were patently untrue Her mishandling of classified information must be fully investigatedSecretary Clinton said she created this unusual email arrangement with herself for convenience It may have been convenient for her but it has been troubling at multiple levels for the rest of the country said Rep Trey Gowdy RSC the chairman of the Benghazi select committee Secretary Clintons decision to prioritize her own convenience  and desire for control  over the security of our countrys intelligence should concern all people of good conscienceThere is no evidence Clinton used encryption to shield the emails or her personal server from foreign intelligence services or other potentially prying eyes Kendall has said that Clinton is actively cooperating with the FBI inquiryIn March Clinton said she exchanged about 60000 emails in her four years in the Obama administration about half of which were personal and were discarded She turned over the other half to the State Department in last DecemberThe department is reviewing those emails and has begun the process of releasing them to the publicAs she has said it is her hope that State and the other agencies involved in the review process will sort out as quickly as possible which emails are appropriate to release to the public and that the release will be as timely and transparent as possible Merrill said TuesdayEarlier this week Clinton said in a sworn statement submitted to a federal judge that she has turned over to the State Department all emails from the server that were or potentially were federal records The statement which carries her signature and was signed under penalty of perjury echoed months of Clintons past public statements about the matterFox News Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed
