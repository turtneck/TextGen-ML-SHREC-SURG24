Tuesdays firstoftheseason Democratic debate is unlikely to be what Bernie Sanders thinks it should be a highminded and nuanced discussion about the policies and prescriptions that would help Americans But thats because the media are running the debateand the medias chief goal he believes is to create a nation of morons Its not exactly a new complaint of his In fact his complaints about the media predate the birth of most of the reporters wholl be covering the Las Vegas boutSanders possesses the consistency of a piston as my colleague Michael Kruse recently put it In his four decades of politicking Sanders has remained faithful to his original views on labor Wall Street and the banks poverty socialism education the environment womens rights income disparities foreign policy and the woes of the middle classNor have Sanders ideas about mediaespecially what he calls the corporate mediawavered since he entered Vermont politics in the 1970s In his view the media tend to trivialize the important issues if they cover them at all They want to cover campaign fights not campaign debates They overrely on entertaining soundbites Their news agenda is about generating profits not producing quality journalism that will educate the voters And as powerful as the corporate media are they seek even more concentrated power through acquisition and consolidationPoliticians have been tying the press to the whipping post for centuries so Sanders hasnt discovered anything new In this campaign cycle hardly a day goes by without Donald Trump calling reporters clowns or dishonest sometimes singling out by name those he considers the worst offenders Hillary Clintons disdain for the scorps in the press is legendary When not playing duck and run she marginalizes press inquiries with dismissive or evasive answers or by calling the questions distractions But no presidential contender in memory has confronted the media quite the way Sanders hasand no candidates media criticism is as central to his or her core beliefs as Sanders complaints He calls into question not only the product but also the capitalist structure upon which Big Media subsistsSanders never shrinks from speaking what he considers to be truth to media power During an August campaign swing through Iowa Sanders once again confronted reporters over the content of his questions coming across as a press criticThe corporate media talks about all kinds of issues except the more important issues Sanders said hitting the trivialization checkbox And time after time Im being asked to criticize Hillary Clinton Thats the sport that you guys like he continuedAs one press critic to another I can inform Sanders that asking a politician to criticize another politicians views or actions is not necessarily sport The conflict he seeks to avoid helps voters decide which candidate better represents their views and interests But I know Sanders is too dug in on this point to ever surrender The public he continued in his hallway reprimand had tired of gotcha questions from the press and the effort of reporters to make conflict between the candidates rather than talking about the real issues impacting the American people And with this flourish he filled the confrontation and entertainment checkboxes to overflowingThe media have never been Sanders highest prioritythey dont for instance rate a mention on his Bernie for president issue page But the topic has never been far from his lips at any time during his career Sometimes he criticizes the press as in the Iowa example to fend off questions he thinks are beneath him that dont advance his campaign or that he regards as too personal In a perfectly Sandersian world hed be allowed to both ask and answer all the questions Other times the Sanders media critique verges into Noam Chomsky territory denouncing the press for adhering to its corporatist agendaSanders expressed his early viewslargely unchanged to this dayon media in a 1979 piece for Vermonts Vanguard Press Social Control and the Tube The goal of the corporate TV masters was to intentionally brainwash people into submission and helplessness making them easier marks for salesmen of underarm spray deodorants automobiles beer cat food politicians or whatever The deodorant menace is a recurrent Sanders theme too Sanders continuedWith considerable forethought TV capitalists are attempting to create a nation of morons who will faithfully go out and buy this or that product vote for this or that candidate and faithfully work for their employers for as low a wage as possibleAsserting that the controllers of that medium have far more power than almost any politician Sanders called for a democratically owned and controlled TV system populated with dozens of channels of commercialfree broadcasting to replace the existing order Im sure that Sanders finds little consolation in the fact that half of his wish came true Dozens of commercialfree channels such as the Disney Channel HDNET porn channels the various flavors of HBO Starz and Showtime and more have been established since his Vanguard Press manifesto While commercialfree the channels are still corporately ownedA politician can ignore the press coopt it take the lumps as theyre distributed or as many conservative politicians dofight it like a punching bag to their advantage Following the conservative example Sanders fought the press for all these decades and it has done much to burnish his image as a rebel and an independent In every one of his political campaignsfrom his hopeless thirdparty candidacies in the 1970s through his current run for presidentSanders has cast himself as David fighting the Goliaths of the major parties He extends this underdog persona by relating to the media as if they were another Goliath making it easier for him to deflect the press corps criticisms as unfair corporate manipulationBut whereas Clinton or Trump might parry with the press for sport as Trump in fact did Thursday night devoting much of his speech in Las Vegas to media complaints the Sanders press critique doesnt stand separate from his critique of capitalism In fact his complaints about the media are part of the central animating principle of his entire political career We live in a nation in which a handful of very very wealthy people have extraordinary power over our economy and our political life and the media he said in an August speech reducing the corporate media to a mouthpiece for the rich And we know how he feels about the rich
