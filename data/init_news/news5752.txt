Heres an interesting factoid about contemporary policing In 2014 for the first time ever law enforcement officers took more property from American citizens than burglars did Martin Armstrong pointed this out at his blog Armstrong Economics last weekOfficers can take cash and property from people without convicting or even charging them with a crime yes really through the highly controversial practice known as civil asset forfeiture Last year according to the Institute for Justice the Treasury and Justice departments deposited more than5 billion into their respective asset forfeiture funds That same year the FBI reports that burglary losses topped out at 35 billionArmstrong claims thatthe police are now taking more assets than the criminals but this isnt exactly right The FBI also tracks property losses from larceny and theft in addition to plain ol burglary If you add up all the property stolen in 2014 from burglary theft motor vehicle theft and other means you arrive at roughly 123 billion according to the FBI Thats more than double the federal asset forfeiture haulOne other point Those asset forfeiture deposit amounts are not necessarily the best indicator of arise in the use of forfeiture In a given year one or two highdollar cases may produce unusually large amounts of money  with a portion going back to victims  thereby telling a noisy story of yeartoyear activity levels the Institute for Justice explains A big chunk of that 2014 deposit for instance was the 17 billion Bernie Madoff judgment most of which flowed back to the victimsFor that reason the net assets of the funds areusually seen as a more stable indicator those numbers show how much money is left over in the funds each yearafterthe federal government takes care of various obligations like payments to victims Since this number can reflect monies taken over multiple calendar years its less comparable to the annual burglary statisticsStill even this more stable indicator hit 45 billion in 2014 according to the Institute for Justice higher again than the burglary losses that yearOne final caveat is that these are only the federal totals and dont reflect how much property is seized by state and local police each year Reliable data for all 50 states is unavailable but the Institute of Justicefound that the total asset forfeiture haul for 14 states topped 250 million in 2013 The grand 50state total would probably be much higherStill boil down all the numbers and caveats above and you arrive at a simple fact In the United States in 2014 more cash and property transferred hands via civil asset forfeiture than via burglary The total value of asset forfeitures wasmore thanonethird of the total value of property stolen by criminals in 2014 That represents something of a sea change in the way police do business and its prompting plenty of scrutiny ofthe practiceThe surprising reason more police dogs are dying in the line of dutyMost Americans dont realize its this easy for police to take your cashPolice chases kill more people each year than floods tornadoes hurricanes and lightning  combined
