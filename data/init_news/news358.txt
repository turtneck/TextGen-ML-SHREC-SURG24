The Disappearing Middle Electorate Way Less Moderate Than Past PrimariesOne of the biggest stories of the election cycle is turnout as weve reported a few times now Republican turnout has spiked far beyond 2012 levels and Democratic turnout has fallen off after the partys mammoth 2008The tone and the turnout are vastly different between Republicans and Democrats this year but oddly enough both sides have something crucial in common their voters are far less moderate than they were in their last primariesLets start with the Republican numbers The below chart shows the ideological difference between the Republican electorate this year and in 2012 Each dot represents one state  so for example 33 percent of Vermont Republican primary voters in 2016 said they considered themselves moderate or liberal compared to 53 percent in 2012 That puts Vermont at negative20 for somewhat conservative  the most extreme result we found among the 15 GOP states for which there was sufficient exitpoll dataIts true exit polls can have a margin of error but theres no mistaking a pattern here In no state did the share of moderate and liberal GOP primary voters grow from 2012 to 2016 The exit polls lumped moderate and liberal together in 2012 so theyre not separated out hereAltogether an NPR analysis finds that the share of somewhat conservative voters on the GOP side climbed by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over 2012s primaries That is among the states with exit polling data for both years The share who were moderate or liberal meanwhile fell by around 9 percentage points and the share who were very conservative held relatively steadySomething similar is at work on the Democratic side as wellThe share of moderate and conservative Democratic voters was down  sometimes dramatically so  in most states that have voted thus far Meanwhile the share of people who are somewhat or very liberal is way upThis year around 60 percent of Democratic primary voters said they considered themselves somewhat or very liberal up from around 45 percent in 2008 once again among states with sufficient exit polling data for both yearsSo interestingly though voters on both sides are less moderate than in the last contests Democrats this year have more decidedly moved toward the very liberal end of the spectrum Republican voters meanwhile are way more somewhat conservative than in 2012 but dont appear to be more very conservativeOne thing to keep in mind Republican turnout across the board is higher this year That means there are still a few more moderate and liberal Republican primary and caucus voters this cycle than there were in the 2012 primaries  its just that the number of somewhat conservative Republicans shot up way moreLikewise Democratic turnout is down almost entirely across the board Interestingly even with the sharp drop off in turnout multiplying the exit poll data by the turnout numbers suggests that the raw number of very liberal Democratic voters is in fact up slightly from 2008 However the number of moderate and conservative voters dropped off steeply And even though the share of somewhat liberal voters is up the raw number is also downBut anyway all of this could mean that a bunch of moderate and conservative Democrats who voted in 2008 stayed home this year while a lot of those somewhat and very liberal Democrats from 2008 came out again Likewise it could mean that the Republican wave of turnout is driven largely by a bunch of somewhat conservative voters who werent there in 2012And looking at the results so far there are simple explanations to why this might be happening The veryliberal Bernie Sanders is probably driving some of the turnout among veryliberal voters Its likewise possible that the somewhatconservative Trump is behind the bump in somewhat conservative voters in Republican primaries while Ted Cruz does better among very conservative voters and John Kasich gets more votes among moderatesBut then it might not just be candidatedriven its possible that lots of people have simply become more conservative or liberal than they were four or eight years ago This is also to some degree plausible as there is evidence that Americans are getting more polarizedIn other words theres a chickenegg question here with no clear answer  chances are theyre both right To the degree that voters are more polarized theyre gravitating toward more extreme candidates And Sanders and Trump also both happen to be very good at energizing people to turn out and vote for them
