  America Is The Loneliest Country In The World  Is It Because Weve Abandoned The Traditional Family Structure   13th 2013 Of all the nations on the entire planet the United States is the most lonely place to be We have the highest percentage of one person households on the entire globe and the average size of our households has been steadily decreasing Studies have shown that the number of close friends that Americans have is falling and we have the highest divorce rate in the world by a wide margin So why is this happening Does this have anything to do with the fact that America is abandoning the traditional family structure Back in the 1960s the sexual revolution fundamentally changed the way that millions of Americans viewed sex and love By throwing out all of the old boundaries many Americans believed that they would ultimately be able to have more sex and more love Today this manifests itself in a hookup culture that is constantly being promoted as healthy in our popular music in our television shows and in our movies But instead of this hookup culture resulting in more sex and more love most Americans are discovering that it leads to just the opposite We have become a nation of desperately lonely people that have very few real ties to others Never in the history of our nation have Americans been so isolated from one another Most people get up in the morning drive to work or school perhaps do a little shopping afterwards and then drive home again The rest of the evening is typically spent in front of the television or on some sort of electronic device In addition most Americans spend precious little time attending social gatherings of any sort these days Church attendance is at historic lows  and most people dont take the time or the effort to get involved in other types of social groups And even when Americans do go out and try to meet people the relationships that are formed are very much on the surface at best The truth is that most Americans have very few close friends Just take a moment and consider how many people outside your immediate family actually love you and would be there for you no matter what For most Americans that number is depressingly low In a desperate attempt for human love and interaction an increasing number of Americans have turned to social networking websites such as Facebook to fill that void For the desperately lonely some human contact is better than none In fact a growing number of people are so desperate for people to talk with them that they will pretend to be someone else online Many will even use an attractive picture of someone else in an attempt to try to lure others This has become so common that this phenomenon has even been given a name It is known as  catfishing  and it has grown to epidemic levels Other Americans deal with their loneliness by recklessly indulging in food drugs gambling shopping or other addictions We are a fundamentally unhappy nation and this is reflected in the fact that we lead the world in antidepressant use In fact the total number of Americans taking antidepressants doubled between 1996 and 2005 Could a lot of this have been avoided if we would have just fully embraced the traditional family structure as a nation Wouldnt most of us be doing a lot better if we lived in homes that were filled with happy healthy families Just consider what the consequences of free love and the hookup culture have been for America At 26 percent America has the highest percentage of one person households on the entire planet 100 years ago 452 were living in the average US household but now the average US household only consists of 259 people  Back in 1950 78 percent of all households in the United States contained a married couple Today that number has declined to 48 percent  The marriage rate in the United States has fallen to an alltime low Right now it is sitting at a yearly rate of 68 marriages per 1000 people  Today an alltime low 442 percent of Americans in the 25 to 34 year old age bracket are married According to the Pew Research Center only 51 percent of all Americans that are at least 18 years old are currently married Back in 1960 72 percent of all US adults were married In the United States today more than half of all couples move in together before they get married The divorce rate for couples that live together first is significantly higher than for those that do not America has the highest divorce rate on the globe by a wide margin In 1970 the average woman had her first child when she was 214 years old  Now the average woman has her first child when she is 256 years old  The birth rate for American women in the 20 to 24 year old age bracket has fallen to 853 births per 1000 women  That is a new alltime record low Approximately one out of every three children in the United States lives in a home without a father For women under the age of 30 living in the United States today more than half of all babies are being born out of wedlock For most Americans marriage has come to be viewed as a temporary agreement that can be abandoned the moment that it no longer makes them happy any longer This mecentered approach to love and marriage has had a whole host of negative consequences for us as a nation As the National Marriage Project puts it a marriage in America now depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses Over the last four decades many Americans have moved away from identifying with an institutional model of marriage which seeks to integrate sex parenthood economic cooperation and emotional intimacy in a permanent union This model has been overwritten by the soul mate model which sees marriage as primarily a couplecentered vehicle for personal growth emotional intimacy and shared consumption that depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses Thus where marriage used to serve as the gateway to responsible adulthood it has come to be increasingly seen as a capstone of sorts that signals couples have arrived both financially and emotionallyor are on the cusp of arriving And our young people are no longer taught to value marriage Instead they are told to put off marriage and to go out and have some fun This message is constantly being reinforced by popular culture For example posted below is an actual proObamacare ad  Yes I know that this ad is almost too bizarre to be true but it is actually a real ad And as you can see the messages that it is sending to our young people are not very subtle at all We have become a nation where anything goes and most Americans seem to like it that way So what do you think Is America the loneliest country in the world because weve abandoned the traditional family structure Please feel free to share your opinion by posting a comment below What Are The OffWhite Boxes That Are Going Up On Utility Poles All Over Seattle  K The lack of family structure is part of it But there is something far more basic that has died in this Country The dog eat dog business attitude the money is the most important thing attitudeand the I come before everyone else attitude All these things killed this precious concept What is it Trust You can not have a good marriage or friendship without it Ask yourself how many people you know would you trust with your life For most it is a rather small number Sadly for some the number is 0 ISA o here I dont trust nor really care for most any of you I learned this in childhood by watching the true nature of adults Adult Humans are the virus of the World of rotting flesh that is a parasite This can be proven empirically Aston Martin Adult humans except  Godschosenones because saying that all humans are viruses inclusing the shoes is  antisemitic I see where you are going rbolo29  Its because of the apathy of realizing there is no God so the children play and do what they want Kim Probably why so many people attach themselves to their animals I know people that treat their dog like their child Its because its all they have ISA Some dont treat their animals that way out of loneliness but a dog just makes a better friend than Humans Thats the truth Take it or leave it Humans are rather crappy things Kim Some humans not all of them Dont get me wrong I love my pet as much as anybody But some people go overboard A Dodgy Bloke I think a number of components go into this A big one is the sexual revolution I have seen personally how its a great thing for guys but a disaster for women The tragic part is most women dont see it the want the same sexual freedom as men but ignore the damage done The damage is kids with no father and a woman who has several children by different guys The woman wakes up forty alone has no control over her life dependent on welfare but has ultimate responsibility for what happens under her roof Everybody wants to be loved in one form or another I think the culture produces high expectations in what people want or expect in a spouse Men want somebody young good looking with no issues Woman are looking foe the same but some have a attraction to bad boys who they find exciting People dont get to and know each other before they wind up in bed They get caught up in the newness get married and wake up one morning look at their spouse and wonder What did I see in you But I have hope that the coming hard times will reverse this because people will have to adapt or not survive rbolo29  It really doesnt matter because we all die in the end and if there is no God to save us then its a total lost cause to even try to be moral and good Some Dude fix yourself and become the change you seek in others for those others are all the reflections of the changes you made from within granting them the permission to let their own light shine only then will humanity rise above the din of the dark ages that still reigns with a rationale leading it only to extinction Dedalius Stanton About to graduate from college within a short timeframe this fearsome yet truthful article details some chilling events experienced in my academic career Up unto this point many of students within my campus follow a selfcentered selfish attitude unaware that their destructive attitudes harm only but themselves The idea of STFU and leave me alone concept continues to be pushed forth by faculty peers and the social environment Having lived in the dorms Ive been through numerous roommates who refuse to talk to anyone especially to me stating that Im too weird or someone who should just drop dead yet later claim they have no friends and spend most of their time wasting it away allowing their academic careers reach at a stag point The same applies to my classes I know about 70 students by name who will graduate this semester but how many do I personally know and trust Sadly that number is zero This is not because I dont engage in conversations but its rather the experiences that others around me only care only for themselves while ignoring those that may be able to provide lasting friendships and improving the overall quality of life rbolo29  Its ok because they will graduate and find there are no jobs waiting for them except being a manager at McDonalds Jim Davis Asst Manager at best Aston Martin The gullible femaleist women from colelge will probably go on dating websites to find elderly rich and wealthy men who are desperate enough to date goods which were expired a long time ago I agree I had similar experiences Most people had their own little groups of friends and never really mingled with others I think the problem is too many people dont know HOW to make friends Everyone is so selfabsorbed MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse I am sorry to hear that you had such negative experiences with roommates Finding a good roommate these days can be a real challenge I am glad that I dont have to worry about that anymore Michael John Doe 71 percent of young men between the ages

watching TV or surfing the web No time or money for anything else MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse You probably burn up a lot of gas money too I certainly dont miss the days when I had very long commutes to work Michael ISA Cant afford it and who would want to be married today Even the boomer generation is throwing in the towel If Americans can evolve which they cant then its over with soon You all are still stuck in the model of 60 years ago if not more and are dying on the inside Good riddance Lars Lonte I totally agree with you  just compare Women from Eastern Europa or even Asia with the average Women from the East Coast or Europe especially West Germany and Great Britain as most US like states and culturesthere is a reason why Eastern European men usually do not want to marry women from western Germany King Mercury Because American women have literally priced themselves out of the dating market American women show that they want only guys with big wide luxury sports Ferraris with all of the latest technology gigantic mc mansions at least 5 times the size of the Home Alone house three quarter million dollar or higher incomes a growing number of them are even going for gangsters and thugs that get that kind of luxury through violent crime and illegal drugs Jonathan Women are uncooperative dont care too busy incompetent at love and domestic life and think its cool to emotionally psychologically financially and in every way abuse men and never receive any reciprocation for their bad behavior nor offer any reciprocation for mens gifts The egomania in women

this state because it has turned to sin rather than YAHWEHS HOLY LAW Only in our LORD JESUSYESHUA do we find fulfillment peace and joy When people are filled with joy they share truth and lovewhen

way and then and only then will people know joy america depends on itself to create its own happiness and youre seeing the negative effects Back in the 1950s Biblical values were held strongly in the homes Thats why you see your grandparents who were married during that time either still alive and married and buried next to each other What youll see in the coming years are old ladies and men wondering around alone who are not married and who will be buried in single graves while the children carry on the negative tradition of their failed ways Way to go america youre doing just fine David McElroy Sad but true PF If it werent for hope in Jesus thered be no hope at all MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse Michael David McElroy As the oldest of 12 children from an Irish father who stayed married to our mother I can testify as to the merciless bombardments of antifamily messages delivered to us My mother was urged to abort many of my siblings Teachers and other counselors urged us not to spend so much time together as we were clannish I fell for the encouragement to go to college and make something of myself and get ahead before marriage and children Even our church was discouraging openly saying we took too much pew space and gave too little money Even though we physically labored to help build the building I went to college became a journalist and after a disasterous cohabitation I thought would lead to marriage eventually a chaplain But I also ended up an old bachelor who thought he would have a wife and grandkids by now My computer is my companion CollGen2 You are a wonderful person Your parents stuck together That is the way Gods original design was Your writing touched my heart today thank you All things will work out for good to those who LOVE God and are called according to HIS purpose HE created each one of us and He also beckons us He put an end to sin by being the perfect sacrifice on that cross He beckoned me and I did it my waytil trouble hit I have a husband 3 children and 4 grandchildren I am alone most of the time at home answering the phone for my small business But most of the time I am immersing myself in the King James Bible and fellowshipping with my Father He is the only one who will never leave me nor forsake me How do I know that I was in a coma many years ago when He beckoned me I have tried to do things the me way but every road was a disaster until I surrendered my life to Him The suffering I go through here is nothing compared to the GLORY that awaits me Tim There are good faithful men out there who want a family David McElroy Im with Tim I was one of those guys who wanted to be a faithful husband and father But I made the mistake of being smitten with a conniving woman who had no maternal domestic interests being the modern sort Jenn Im sorry that happened to you Not all of us women are that way but many of them seem to be these days  Aston Martin Modern westernized women are victims

depending on the item wombleranger I dont like to be the one to say this butif you remove spirituality and morals from a society you end up with the western world America isnt the only western power suffering this condition come to Canada where anyone with a problem gets a Prozac prescription and its free We would be wise to remember the former Soviet Union and its devastation of the churches and religions Now we must ask ourselves are we staring to become a communist nation To quote William Penn  Those who will not be governed by God will be ruled by tyrantscertainly is food for thought A lonely mind is a dangerous mind Eileen Kuch Very well put wombleranger Indeed if you remove spirituality and morals from a society that society starts to fragment Just look at America today Its barely recognizable as the Godfearing nation it used to be I dont know about your Prime Minister Stephen Harper but Barack Obama is the worst Presidents we ever had Hes hellbent on destroying the old America and turning it into a USSA a near image of the early 20th Century USSR where Orthodox Christian Churches were devastated and the religion driven underground Those who will not be governed by God will be ruled by tyrants  William Penn Great quote too wombleranger Thanks Eileen Its comforting to see there are still moral people in this world now we just need to wakeup the good souls from the deep sleep Its an uphill battle to be sure but as long as i breath i will never forsake my dignity morals and most of all my God nilro Too many nut cases out there Animals are a better bet Truman Golden
