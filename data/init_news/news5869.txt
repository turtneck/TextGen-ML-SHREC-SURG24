With less than five weeks before voters begin weighing in on the 2016 GOP presidential nomination the establishment contenders  who until now have been relatively restrained  have begun aiming their fire at each otherThe tactical shift on the part of the candidates and their allies reflects a longstanding assumption as to how this crowded nomination battle is likely to play outMany believe the race will come down to a oneonone contest between an outsider who channels the angry Republican base and a candidate more in line with the wishes of the party hierarchy The establishment pick has almost always prevailed in the past though it is far from certain that will be the case in 2016The insurgent faction of the party appears likely to rally around either frontrunner Donald Trump or the ascendant Sen Ted Cruz RTex The leading possibilities on the establishment side include three sitting or former governors and a Florida senator  all of whom are running far behind Trump But before any of them can get a shot at taking him on they must deal with one anotherTrumps latest targets New Hampshires largest paper and its favorite candidate ChristieSen Marco Rubio RFla on Tuesday found his record of Senate absences under attack from two directions a blistering ad in Iowa by a super PAC supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and a taunt by New Jersey Gov Chris ChristieDude show up to work Christie said during a townhall meeting in Muscatine IowaRubio was making his own swing through Iowa which is set to hold the first contest of the primary season on Feb 1 He responded at a news conference hours later in the town of ClintonYou know Chris has been missing in New Jersey for half the time Rubio said But candidates I think as we get down the stretch here some of them get a little desperate and a little nasty in their attacks and thats fineHe dismissed the attack ad by the proBush super PAC Right to Rise USA as par for the course I mean obviously youve seen that as we get closer to Election Day and millions of dollars of spending have not changed Bushs fortunes hes become increasingly negative in his attacksMeanwhile Right to Rise USA also launched a spot in New Hampshire contending that the gubernatorial records of Christie and Ohio Gov John Kasich do not stack up against that of Bush The ad was gentler in tone than the super PACs assault on Rubio but it attempted to draw a contrast on the experience that all three of the candidates consider to be their greatest assetNew Day in America a super PAC supporting Kasich responded What Team Jeb has failed to address is the political baggage dragging behind Bush and Christie The country doesnt have an appetite for another Bush or another Clinton for that matter As for Governor Christie his mishandling of his state budget and the Bridgegate scandal have earned him a 60 percent unfavorable rating from those who know him best  the people of New JerseyThe crossfire said GOP political consultant Alex Castellanos is beginning to look like a Fistful of Dollars gunfight referring to the 1964 spaghetti western that launched Clint Eastwood to stardomIts now down to the last five weeks here Christie told reporters in Muscatine We need to make distinctions between candidates not just on issues but on experience so Ill be talking about it I think its an important distinction to makeThe young and charismatic Rubio is regarded by many as potentially the strongest contender running in the establishment lane  if he can find an openingIts pretty clear in this race that Marco Rubio is the candidate of the future If he ever breaks through the line hes got a lot of running room said Castellanos who is not working for any of the 2016 candidates The only one who everyone fears for his explosive potential is RubioWill Rubio work hard enough to become president Some backers are worriedRight to Rise USA said it plans to spend 14 million on the new ad in Iowa in which an announcer says Over the last three years Rubio has missed important national security hearings and missed more total votes than any other senator Politics first  thats the Rubio wayChristie sounded a similar theme during a town hall in Muscatine where he noted that Rubio had announced his opposition to a 18trillion yearend spending bill and tax package but then failed to show up to vote against it It passed the Senate 65 to 33Just show up to work and vote no Christie said And if you dont want to then quitRubio spokesman Alex Conant said his campaign is unfazed noting that Rubios skill at dealing with barbs during the candidates debates has only increased his statureObviously we feel very good about our campaign and where were at With success comes scrutiny Conant said Weve been taking some incoming for several months now and were not worse for the wearRubio does have the worst attendance record of all the senators including the five who have run for president this year  a fact he does not dispute A CSPAN analysis released last week found that Rubio cast votes for just 219 of the 339 recorded Senate rollcall votes in 2015  a 65 percent attendance record He spoke on the Senate floor eight times  just 5 percent of the days that the Senate was in session CSPAN saidIm running for president because I want to change the direction of this country and it will require me for the time being to miss some votes in the US Senate because I want those votes to matter again Rubio saidBefore Tuesdays exchanges the most highprofile attack on Rubios attendance record had been launched by Bush during an October Republican presidential debate Rubio shot back with a response that threw Bush off balanceSomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you Rubio told Bush and then recounted how other senators who ran for president had equally bad attendance records that had not drawn much commentIn his own appearances recently Bush has been focusing most of his attacks on Trump and Hillary ClintonBy law candidates are not allowed to coordinate with the super PACs that support them however Right to Rise USA is run by political consultant Mike Murphy who has been one of Bushs closest political advisers for most of his political career
