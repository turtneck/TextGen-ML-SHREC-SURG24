Farms that once generated wealth for entire communities are now creating a new class of superfarms which are concentrating wealth and income at the topPeanut farmer Gary Dawson fills a water tank just outside Hawkinsville Ga Dawson has reduced his permanent crew of workers from dozens in the 1970s to about nine todayThe rows of lowslung plants under the hot Georgia sun are deceptive Its what grows underground that countsI love this dirt more than anything  except my son says farmhand Franklin Spanky Laidler jumping off his red tractor onto a field where peanuts burrow in the groundFor many that love of this sandy Southern soil is more than just a way of life its a wealth generator Mr Laidler says he works so much that if he was paid hourly instead of salaried Id be a millionaire Instead its his boss who has grown wealthy on these 9000 acres He could quit farming now and hed have nothing to worry aboutA different harvest takes place at the Pulaski County dump just outside Hawkinsville At night men with headlamps like monster fireflies pick through the days detritus looking for valuable scraps to sellThese are two pictures of income inequality in rural AmericaThe widening gulf between the haves and have nots is not limited to the Rust Belts castoff manufacturing workers working class suburbanites or innercity poor working on a stagnant minimum wage The same trends have taken hold in farm country though in different forms The farms that once generated wealth for entire communities are now creating a new class of superfarmersThe trend is not unprecedented When the South was more agrarian the divide was worse  land ownership was the ultimate unequalizerBut after a period of more equal wealth the trend is clearly back toward greater inequality with more money in the hands of the few Automation has made farm jobs disappear and at the bottom of the income ladder many rural residents are still struggling to recover from the Great RecessionFor places like Hawkinsville these trends represent a deepening challenge for how to sow hope And yet rural America retains some advantages for addressing those broken hopes It begins experts say with a willingness to reject the tendency toward insularity and open arms and minds to new ideasCommunities that are waiting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to come into office and solve all their issues are being unrealistic says David Peters a rural sociologist who studies heartland inequality at Iowa State University in Ames Residents and community leaders do however have this power to build up trust in the community  in order to marshal investment and resources Yes its difficult But its within their power to changeThe most striking thing about rural Americas inequality is what you dont see Wealth is not marked by gated communities or mansions Fashion plates do not strut along Commerce Street in downtown Hawkinsville Indeed theres a ramshackle air to the place broken only occasionally by the one sign of ostentation brandnew Ford F350s growling down the highwaysYet wealth has been growing here until recently  in part because of a shortterm turn in the farming cycle in part because of longterm consolidationA run of high prices in the aftermath of the Great Recession meant farmers like Gary Dawson were able to slash their debts and pay cash for tractors and more land He could expand because bigger machinery and improved soilconditioning techniques allowed him to farm more land more efficientlyWe started with a fourrow harvester and now were running a 12row one he saysThe farming cycle is now turning against farmers Net cash farm income is expected to fall for the fourth year in a row this year Midwestern farmland prices have fallen sharply from record highs Nevertheless by expanding and becoming more efficient Mr Dawson is joining the ranks of superfarmers  a longterm trend that is putting farm production and wealth into fewer and fewer handsThe level of concentration varies by crop and by regionA quartercentury ago the Souths big cotton farmers with at least 1000 acres planted were already producing 30 percent of the nations crop by 2007 it was half according to the United States Department of Agriculture Midwestern corn and soybean farmers  once the backbone of a rural middle class  are moving in the same direction By 2007 big farmers produced nearly a third of the corn crop up from 9 percent in 1992What most people think of as family farms dont exist in large numbers anymore but what exists are large family businesses  in the 3 to 5 million range says Mr Peters the Iowa State sociologistAnd the bigger the farm the bigger its average profit margin By 2011 as crop prices were rising the average midsize family farm was worth 26 million and earned 156000 a year  twothirds of that from farming Large family farms were worth 48 million and earning 413000 very large farms just under 10 million and earning 17 millionAs this wealth accumulates it is being spread to fewer and fewer people The midsize to very large operations represent less than 8 percent of the 21 million farm households in the United States most of which rely on income outside agriculture for their livelihood And as the big operations become more mechanized and efficient theyre not hiring droves of new farmhands Mr Dawson has reduced his permanent crew from dozens in the 1970s to about nine todayA typical large farmer is not going to admit that theyre making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in part because nowadays  those who have traditionally performed jobs on the farm are left out of any sort of share in the wealth thats being produced says Jonathan Bryant a history professor at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro who studies smalltown life in the South Thats become a difficult situation for a lot of folks and many just leave Those that dont are the people you see in those clustered groups of rotting trailer houses Theyre stuck as much as some person in a Central American country is stuckIn Hawkinsville over half of its high school graduates leave for college or someplace else every year and dont come back Despite his success in farming Dawsons children have gone on to professional work elsewhere His daughter is an architect his son works at Robins Air Force Base just up the road as a software technicianFor those who havent shared in the farm boom the disparity looks exactly like despairCount Rex Milner and his wife Leeanne among them As a justweaned kitten attacks a rock in their front yard they describe what seems a far cry from a rural paradise in middle Georgia Yes they can float down the lazy Ocmulgee River in inner tubes  the local goto entertainment But as with hundreds here the Milners rely not on a paycheck but on a federal disability check which they pad with what amounts to a permanent yard sale Youve got to scrounge for every dollar you get says Mr Milner a junk dealer who combs the countryside and flea markets for items he can mark up and sell Its never been this bad the economyTheyd love to move to another place and start over But cashpoor and burdened with highinterest debt he says Were stuckFor the most part locals like the Milners dont blame big farmers After all its hard to criticize those whose hard work has been bolstered by good fortune even though they may have been born into a landrich family Instead its Hillary Clinton or President Obama who are the main targets of bitter complaintsInequality works both ways Its not just concentration of wealth but its also what happens at the bottom says Peters the rural sociologist The upshot is that the trend of the withering middle class has occurred in rural areas much further and quicker than in urban and metro communities in generalThe current rural inequality is not unheard of at least in the SouthWe have seen this kind of inequality before and its when we were highly agriculturally dependent in the nation says Linda Lobao a rural sociologist at Ohio State University in ColumbusIts always the case with land in rural communities land makes power And power often doesnt want changeFarmers in the 1970s also saw several good years backtoback and bid up land prices only to see the farm economy collapse in the 1980s When land prices crashed many indebted operators lost their farms Another price downturn could happen squeezing farm incomes again Net cash income is projected to fall by a third this year versus the 2012 peak And land prices have already begun to ease downwardHawkinsville is not thriving A restaurant featuring best burgers in town is not open at the supper hour Town fathers have been working for 30 years to renovate an old opera house But its still not done An old firehouse shows cracks in its foundation waiting year after year for renovationSociologists say reforms may have to run deeper than opera house grants for many divided farm towns grappling for survival in the new economyAccording to Peters and Professor Lobao rural communities that have managed to thrive despite the dour employment dynamics exhibit similar values an openness to change and outsiders In many parts of the country rural towns that have welcomed immigrants especially have seen their downtowns if not thrive at least manage a slower population decline than more insular communitiesLast year the White House Rural Council launched Rural Impact which is helping 10 rural and tribal communities fight income inequality primarily by giving children more educational options Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack calls it a wholefamily framework for addressing child povertyMore broadly the key is to try to organize people in some manner to put more claims on local government to gain more political power says Lobao In many incomedivided towns she adds theres a sense that those who dont farm are subject to forces that are beyond their control which leads to a more fatalistic approachBut in a recent survey of 99 struggling farm towns adds Peters we find that communities that have higher levels of social capital  the level to which people trust one another and whether theyre tolerant of different opinions and allow newcomers to be involved in decisionmaking and power structures  those tend to have better economic and demographic outcomesEditors note The cutline for the photo of
