Heres something interesting from The Unz Review Recipient Name Recipient Email  Donald Trumps startling and explosive victory has not only shaken Americas oligarchy to its core its also sending shock waves across Europe and scaring the top hats off plutocrats and their tame politicians The great Mark Twain wrote early in the 20th century if you dont read newspapers you are uninformed But if you do read them you are misinformed Amen As with the 2003 war against Iraq the US media totally dropped its mask of phony impartiality and became a cheerleader for the Clintons and their financial backers Media was clearly revealed as a propaganda organ for the ruling elite No wonder its disgusted clients are decamping to online sources or just ignoring the biased media Amazingly working class men and women rose up and overthrew the oligarchy led by the corporate media and the selfenriching warpromoting Clinton dynasty and its Davos friends There was plenty of anguish among leftist groups and weepy young women but America breathed a gigantic sigh of relief So did the stock market So did ordinary white Americans royally fed up with the elites promotion of diversity which they believe is a euphemism for mixing races pushing junk popular culture and advocating homosexuality lesbianism and bisexuality Across the Atlantic political nerves were just as tense Three major votes will be held in the coming 10 months in France Germany and Italy Europes economic political and cultural core The old order is scared to death by Trumps crashing victory France holds a presidential primary in a month in which sitting president Franois Hollande is expected to be thrashed Hollandes public support now is struggling to reach 4 Former prime minister Nicholas Sarkozy has risen from the political dead and is preaching a farrago of populism nationalism and Islamophobia Many French dont trust or like Sarko He may shortly face charges for accepting illegal campaign money from Libyas late Mummar Khadffi in whose murder Sarko may be deeply implicated Dead Libyans tell no tales Sarkos rivals are former foreign minister Alain Jupp a moderate conservative and ally of the ailing former president Jacques Chirac who remains Frances most liked politician Jupp dignified sensible and moderate is just what France needs after the disastrous socialist president Franois Hollande But adding a wild card to the primary is the youthful exbanker and rightwing socialist Emmanuel Macron a former economy minister under Hollande He used to work for the French Rothschilds arousing suspicions on the left and far right Macron is expected to shortly announce his candidacy for president Add in former prime minister Franois Fillon a solid moderate with a reputation for strong ethics who may be able to stand up to Frances thuggish unions Fillon Jupp and Macron are all considered leftwing conservatives who can restore Frances staggering economy and fight the bureaucracy teachers and of course the unions who can quickly shut down all key sectors of Frances economy Lurking in the background is the nemesis of Frances current political system Madame Marine LePen leader of the hard right National Front AntiEU antiglobalization and antiMuslim she is a modern day version of Frances WWII Vichy Catholic far right Le Pen like her aged father JeanMarie is very popular and can articulate like Trump the anger and dismay of working whites She may knock the hapless Hollande out in the first round of voting in 2017 But Le Pen would then have to go on to defeat the moderate candidate  Sarkozy Fillon Macron or Jupp This will be very tough because as in previous elections leftist and centrist voters will gang up to defeat her Such is conventional logic But after Trump nothing is certain Good Our stagnant western economies and corrupt political systems badly need shaking up and refreshing I say vive Monsieur Trump On Dec 4 Italy holds a very important referendum to modernize its rickety political structure If voters reject it Italys young reformist prime minister Matteo Renzi has vowed to resign This would likely plunge Italy into political confusion and encourage a looming banking crisis Finally in Germany Angela Merkels coalition government looks increasingly fragile Many Germans are tired of the ultramoderate Merkel and her cautious government which is often accused of being an American vassal If Germany ever wakens from its post1945 stupor all Europe will shake So enter Donald Trump just at a time when Europe may be coming to a boil Reprinted from EricMargoliscom
