In March we wrote Reading About Zika May Hurt Your Brain  We listed 35 sensational news headlines about potential catastrophes related to a Zika epidemic The common factor of those panic creating media wave  all those headlines included the miraculous little word may  The pieces were pure speculations with some quoting this or that expert who was hunting for research funds or lobbying for some pharmaceutical or pesticide conglomerate In June we added Zika Virus Does Not Cause Birth Defects  Fighting It Probably Does  New serious research found what some people in Brazil had suspected from the very start of the small and strictly locally limited jump in microencephaly cases in Brazil Doctors in the Zika affected areas in Brazil pointed out that the real cause of somewhat increased microcephaly in the region was probably the insecticide pyriproxyfen used to kill mosquito larvae in drinking water The Brazilian doctors noted that the areas of northeast Brazil that had witnessed the greatest number of microcephaly cases match with areas where pyriproxyfen is added to drinking water in an effort to combat Zikacarrying mosquitoes  Pyriproxyfen is reported to cause malformations in mosquito larvae and has been added to drinking water in the region for the past 18 months Pyriproxyfen is produced by a Sumitomo Chemical  an important Japanese poison giant It was therefore unsurprising that the New York Times and others called the Brazilian doctors report a conspiracy theory and trotted out some experts to debunk it  But scientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute also researched the pyriproxyfen thesis They found  Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid a vitamin A metabolite with which it has crossreactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly   Tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity actually found some evidence for such an effect  including low brain mass and arhinencephalyincomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheresin rat pups Finally the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedentedit has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale  Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation Today the Washington Post finally admits that the Zika virus does not cause birth defects To the great bewilderment of scientists the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil Instead Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas According to the latest UN figures of the 2175 babies born in the past year with undersize heads or other congenital neurological damage linked to Zika more than 75 percent have been clustered in a single region northeastern Brazil The wide areas where the flue virus occurred outside of the small area in Brazil saw no increase in birth defect numbers The number of naturally occurring microcephality cases stayed constant despite a very large increase in harmless Zika virus infections The numbers in Brazil also turned out to be partially inflated because of a lack of standard diagnosis criteria and unreliable statistics A factor we had pointed to in our very first piece The WaPo piece today muses about several possible causes for the local increase in cases in northeastern Brazil that indeed happened It quotes some of the very experts like from the pharmaceutical industry influenced CDC that were wrong on the issue since the very first panic headline It strenuously avoids to even mention the most likely cause  the excessive local use of an insecticide that is supposed to cause birth defects  in developing mosquitoes Thus the reporting is still void of journalistic ethics and irresponsible in its conclusions It did not take much effort to get this right An hour or two of skimming through publicly available sources of good standing some basic higher education and sound reasoning was enough But instead of doing such basic inquiries journalists and media served panic and speculations by biased experts Keep this story in mind for the next sensationalist onslaught of panic headline There surely will be some interests behind those just dont expect unbiased facts and basic logic reasoning Comment And Zika  like Ebola SARS bird flu West Nile etc  will fall down the memory holeuntil the next scare comes along
