The flag at Desert Hot Springs Condor Gun Shop flew at halfstaff on Friday morning Less than two days had passed since two shooters armed with four guns killed 14 people and wounded 21 more at an office holiday party in San BernardinoThe shooting which the FBI is investigating as an act of terrorism forced the nations attention to the city 40 miles west of Desert Hot Springs It also prompted a flood of calls to Condor Gun Shop an unheated cabin across from a swath of open desert at the edge of the citySince Wednesday my phone has been ringing off the hook said Torrey Harris whose family has owned the shop since 1971 It didnt stop ringing until 1130 at nightHarris said that after most mass shootings longtime gun owners seek to stock up on weapons and ammunition that they think California will try to ban in reaction to the incidents of violence The state legislature often passes a slew of gun control laws in the months after these tragediesBut Harris said the response she saw after San Bernardino was differentI would say a good 40 of my calls Wednesday were people who have never owned a firearm in their life Harris saidGun control activists already say Wednesdays shooting demonstrates the need for background checks for ammunition sales But even Californias gun control laws among the strictest in the nation havent prevented seven mass shootings using legally purchased guns since 2006Gun rights advocates maintain that laws dont affect criminals and only make it more difficult for people to protect themselvesHarris believes some of those people calling her shop have adopted a similar positionThey looked at San Bernardino and said You know what we have to be able to fight back and Im not going to be the person cowering in the corner of a room waiting to be shot she saidData on mass shootings is sparse and even the definition of mass shooting varies widely The FBI for instance defines the events as incidents where at least four people are killed while a popular online shooting tracker states that a mass shooting occurs when at least four people including the shooter are injured by gunshotsBy the FBIs definition as counted by USA TODAY there have been 22 mass shootings this year by the Shooting Trackers analysis San Bernardino was number 353 and one of two mass shootings that dayDespite this variance experts dont believe mass shootings are happening more often than they did in past decades In California and across the country violent crimes with firearms have declined significantly since the 1980sAt the same time however weve become more afraidIt was Sandy Hook that really got peoples attention and started this intense focus on shootings said James Alan Fox a Northeastern University criminologist whos written several books on mass murder referring to the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown ConnSince then he said Even though the incidence hasnt increased fear hasA 2015 Congressional Research Service report on mass public shootings found that 2012 was a particularly brutal year  seven mass public shootings compared to an average of four per year  and suggested that the horrific year had a lasting impact on public opinionSeveral such mass murders in 2012 seven incidents by most counts compounded a fear among many people that this could happen to me the authors of the report wroteAfter the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook support for controls on gun ownership spiked to 51 of the US population its highest level in five years according to the Pew Research Center Support for laws protecting the right to own guns fell from 49 to 42Polls showed a return to preSandy Hook opinion levels about six months later But in comparison a shooting that killed six people at a 2011 rally for Ariz Rep Gabrielle Giffords didnt significantly impact public opinion on gun control according to a poll conducted in the following days by the Pew Research Center Neither did a 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that killed 32 peopleFor some that fear has resulted in a new desire to bear arms Pew data suggests that in 1999 nearly half of gun owners bought them for hunting compared to 26 for personal protection By Feb 2013 those positions had almost reversed nearly half of gun owners wanted weapons for personal protection compared to 32 for huntingCondor Gun Shop owner Harris said in the last five years shes begun selling firearms to more women and firsttime buyers During the last 10 years the National Shooting Sports Foundation the trade group for firearms manufacturers has also seen a steady increase in firsttime and female gun ownersAbout 25 to 30 of customers are firsttime gun buyers who often purchase a gun for protection More than 30 of customers are women NSSF spokesman Mike Bazinet saidHarris said shes started asking firsttime gun owners what changed their minds about purchasing a firearm More and more people tell her that they want to be responsible for their own safetyJust like buying car insurance you go out and you buy it and you hope you never have to use it but youre really thankful if you ever get into an accident And a lot of people who buy these firearms do the same thing Harris said It really has changed the whole mindset of a lot of people who are buying guns nowBut according to San Bernardino police Syed Rizwan Farook  one of the San Bernardino shooters  purchased his two guns legally from a federal licensed firearms dealer Another person bought two 223caliber rifles a DPMS A15 and Smith  Wesson MP15  legally Only the shooters modification attempts to the assault weapons to make one rifle accept 30round magazines and one rifle fully automatic made them illegal to possessSo for gun control advocates mass shootings are sirens calling for further limits on access to gunsIn the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting for example the California state legislature passed at least 14 bills tightening restrictions on gun ownership  more gun laws than it had passed in the previous six years combined Gov Jerry Brown signed laws banning conversion kits for ammunition magazines toughening mental health reporting requirements and closing a loophole that allowed singleshot handguns to bypass safety requirementsIn 2014 a bill cited a shooting in Isla Vista when a gunman shot and killed three people and fatally stabbed three others near the University of California Santa Barbara campus as the reason for its necessity That measure now a law allows judges to temporarily keep people from purchasing or possessing guns if family members or law enforcement think they might harm themselves or othersWhile nearly 40 states have relaxed gun rules in the last two decades California has enacted more than 50 major gun bills since 1994 The progun control Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence based in San Francisco gave Californias laws an A in 2014 the highest grade given to any state Guns  Ammo Magazine with a progun rights stance ranked the state fourthworst in the country for gun ownershipAlready in the wake of the San Bernardino tragedy gun control advocates are touting a 2016 ballot initiative that Lt Gov Gavin Newsom proposed in October The measure proposes background checks for ammunition purchases and bans possession of high capacity magazinesAmmunition is what makes a firearm into a deadly weapon and we should have background checks on firearms and ammunition Law Center staff attorney Ari Freilich said These individuals it looks like they stockpiled 3000 to 4000 rounds of ammunition They did it without having to show ID without having to pass a background checkPrior to San Bernardino California had seen seven public shootings since 2006 that claimed four or more lives not counting those police believe were gangrelated according to USA TODAYs Behind the Bloodshed tracker In four of those shootings the weapons shooters used were purchased legally and registered to the shooters In two other incidents the guns were purchased legally but registered to other peopleIn only one incident the 2013 rampage near Santa Monica College did law enforcement say that the weapons used were illegal in CaliforniaHere in California as pretty much everywhere in the country anybody who isnt disqualified by virtue of them having a felony conviction can get a gun and can get a bunch of guns and can get guns that are quite deadly because guns are deadly said Eugene Volokh a professor of constitutional law at UCLA and writer for The Volokh Conspiracy a legal blog hosted by The Washington PostFreilich believes mass shootings with guns that have been purchased legally like Wednesdays in San Bernardino emphasize the need for more stringent gun controlI do think San Bernardino highlights to legislators and to the California public that despite all that weve done  California has the toughest gun laws in the nation  more clearly needs to be done Freilich saidSince the late 1980s the crime rate has dropped in California and nationally by about 50 according to the California Attorney Generals Office and the FBIGun control advocates attribute that drop in California in part to gun control laws However some researchers including Volokh doubt that conclusion pointing out that violence has dropped nationwide even though most states have loosened gun control laws and California is widely known to have the strictest laws in the nation The percentage of homicide victims killed by firearms has remained steady in California since 1990 according to the California Attorney Generals Homicide ReportRealistically the battle to prevent mass tragedies with legislation may be futile Volokh saidLets look at somebody who is a wouldbe mass shooter This person has essentially decided to have the defining event of his life and possibly the concluding event of his life be mass murder Volokh said This is somebody who is very motivated to commit the crime and again we know he is motivated because hes willing to give up his life to do thatWednesdays shooting was perpetrated by people determined to kill Volokh saidThe shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik have been identified as husband and wife and investigators found a dozen pipe bombs and more than 4500 rounds of ammunition in the home they were renting in RedlandsThe FBI is investigating the mass shooting as an act of terrorismWhile gun control may help reduce violence in general criminologist James Alan Fox doesnt think legislation will help prevent mass shootings like theseGun control can do a lot in terms of impacting the kind of gun crime you see every day Will it avert mass killings Not really Fox said Theyll find a way to get a gun If they cant get one legally which most of them can theyll borrow one steal one  but theyll get oneFor Torrey Harris of Condor Gun Shop this tragic conversation is becoming routineIve gone through this so many times now I know how the cycle goes Harris said There are going to be people who are yelling and screaming for more gun laws and people who are going to be yelling and screaming for less and unfortunately probably nothing is going to happen which I think frustrates both sidesOn Friday it was business as usual at Harris gun shop A customer walked in the door hoping to buy a handgun Harris began the legal steps of selling a gun in California asking the
