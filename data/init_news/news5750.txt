Lots Of Candidates Want To Simplify Tax Code Heres What They Get WrongTheres something almost Name That Tuneish about the way the GOP candidates are talking about tax brackets these days Currently there are seven Donald Trump wants four Jeb Bush says he can get them down to three Chris Christie and Marco Rubio want two Ben Carson does them one better  one 10 percent rate inspired by the BibleTheyre not alone  President Obama has advocated fewer brackets as wellWhy do this One of the most common reasons they give is that it would make the tax code simplerAs Rubios tax plan puts it The tax code is in desperate need of simplification and bracket consolidation is an important first stepHes right on the first part The Internal Revenue Code is impenetrably unfathomably complicatedBut heres the reality Cutting brackets wont really help that muchIts a very mild form of simplification said William Gale codirector of the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution a leftleaning Washington think tank The real complication in the system is in the tax base not in the rate structure Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether youre eligible for the earned income tax credit for lowerincome Americans given the child rules  once youve got that then you just plug in the ratesThink about your own taxes  it can be complicated to figure out how much you owe when you have things like investment income wages from selfemployment or lots of deductions But once you fill in the boxes and subtract all that out figuring out your rate is easy and if youre using a program like TurboTax the computer does it for youCutting taxes as a whole tends to be the real goal behind ratecutting said Ed Kleinbard professor of law and business at the University of Southern California After all no one ever tries to simplify tax brackets upwardThe number of brackets has an almost imperceptible effect on the complexity of tax law as it is lived by the individual taxpayer Kleinbard said Taxpayers are not left to their own devices engaged in highlevel mathematicsWhat does simplicity look likeSo reducing the number of brackets isnt the clearest path to simplification What is Making the rest of your tax preparation experience easier says one expertSimplification does not necessarily mean that taxes are a simple mathematical function of income said Matthew Weinzierl a Harvard University assistant professor who studies what optimal tax systems look like After all with TurboTax its easy to have a computer do a complex calculation for you Instead what economists typically have in mind is that a tax system should be easy to understand transparent and hard to gameA lot of these bracketcutting ideas come alongside proposals to limit deductions And that in its own right is a great step toward simplification Bush for example wants to cap the amount of total deductions most people can take not counting the charitable deductionMost economists think a tax base with fewer such loopholes is less subject to evasion and less distortionary to economic activity Weinzierl saidThe idea is that these loophole closures offset the tax revenue lost from cutting brackets But thats not how it always worksThe call for fewer tax brackets in every case has as its real motive lowering the tax burden on the highestincome Americans not making life simpler for the middle class Kleinbard argued Consider Bushs tax proposal as an example While it limits deductions it also would overwhelmingly benefit the highest earners and grow the national debt  unless there is unprecedented growth in the economyCutting deductions and loopholes makes for a great sound bite but its far tougher than it sounds The politically popular mortgageinterest deduction is a great example of this It tends to benefit higher earners more but despite constant calls to simplify the tax code its so politically popular that it has proved impossible to eliminateCutting deductions isnt the only way candidates could fight for simpler taxes They could also pledge to combat efforts of tax preparers to keep tax preparation itself complicated Voxs Dylan Matthews and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Robert Greenstein have reported that HR Block pushed for changes that would have quadrupled the earned income tax credit forms length making it harder for lowincome families to get the credit that is without HR Blocks help The company has defended itself hereThere are also unsexy opportunities to make the code less complicated For example Kleinbard argues that some long hyperspecific definitions could be trimmed downIf you really care about complexity the place to look for example is the definition of whos a dependent Kleinbard said People fight over whether a child is a dependent of one parent or another It turns out to be an incredibly complicated topic and nonsensically so If you look for simplicity youd actually want to look at things like a consistent and simple definition of dependent So theres plenty of room for simplification and politicians often point to the socalled 70000 page tax code as proof of that However railing against the page count may be a misguided line of attackOne nitpicky reason is that the tax code itself is not in fact 70000 pages long as Slate pointed out last year That distinction belongs to a compilation of court decisions surrounding the tax code according to the Tax Foundation The statutes themselves are about 2700 pages longBut far more important Kleinbard said some complexity is inherent to a tax code that tries to govern a complicated economyThe tax code is thousands of pages long for a very simple reason It is a model in the economic sense of all of economic activity he said Most Americans dont spend a lot of time worrying about the taxation of cutting timber or of being crew on a tuna boat But there are rules for that and you may find the rules irrelevant to you but the rules are complex for a reasonOK so how many brackets should there beAmericans want a tax code thats simpler to some degree And brackets arent really going to simplify the code all that much But that still doesnt answer one key question Is there a right number of bracketsTheres an entire branch of economics dedicated to this kind of question Its called optimal tax theory and Google Scholarsearching it will dump you into an afternoonlong intellectual rabbit hole Weinzierl who studies this said theres no magic numberThe number of brackets is generally considered unimportant Weinzierl said Any desired level of progressivity can be obtained with a number of different bracket structures so the specific number isnt that importantBut some experts believe that our current sevenbracket system could use some tweaking Thomas Piketty author of last years bestselling Capital in the 21st Century and University of California Berkeleys Emmanuel Saez for example have argued that a higher top marginal rate would be bestGiven the growth of uberhighearners Weinzierl said that idea is popular among economistsMany economists would argue that the lack of such a bracket is odd since it means that a family earning 750000 is likely to pay the same marginal tax rate as a family earning 10 times as much he said The basic idea here he adds is that if were going to have more than one bracket and thus allow ourselves something other than a flat tax its quite limiting not to have a bracket for the highest earnersAnd heres another compelling complication The US may have already stumbled onto a pretty good system Earlier this year economists at the Minneapolis Fed found that the current US system warts and all is in fact nearly optimal beating out other optimal options like a flattaxplustransfer systemTrying to understand all of these taxpolicy contradictions at once might understandably make your eyes glaze over But the ultimate takeaway is simple When a politician advocates simplifying the tax system theres usually a good reason to be skeptical
