A deeply divided Supreme Court on Friday delivered a historic victory for gay rights ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution requires that samesex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they liveThe courts action rewarded years of legal work by samesex marriage advocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nations jurisprudenceMarriages began Friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts of samesex couples to wed while some states continued to resist what they said was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of marriage and sent the country into uncharted territory As of the courts decision Friday morning there were 14 states where samesex couples were not allowed to marryJustice Anthony M Kennedy who has written all of the courts decisions recognizing and expanding gay rights said the decision was based on the fundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay AmericansUnder the Constitution samesex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as oppositesex couples and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right Kennedy wrote He was joined in the ruling by the courts liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen G Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena KaganAll four of the courts most conservative members  Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr  dissented and each wrote a separate opinionThe common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part of five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the peopleIf you are among the many Americans  of whatever sexual orientation  who favor expanding samesex marriage by all means celebrate todays decision wrote Roberts who for the first time in his tenure marked his disagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the benchCelebrate the achievement of a desired goal Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner Celebrate the availability of new benefits But do not celebrate the Constitution It had nothing to do with it he wroteScalia called the decision a threat to American democracy saying it robs citizens of the freedom to govern themselvesIts the first time Roberts has had such a bold statement from the benchIn a statement in the White House Rose Garden President Obama hailed the decision This ruling is a victory for America This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts When all Americans are truly treated as equal we are more freeIt wasnt until 2012 that Obama declared that samesex couples should be able to marry and it was only last year that he said he thought the Constitution provided such a right But by Friday evening the rainbow colors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north face of the White House With the Supreme Courts ruling Obama said Today we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a little more perfectThere were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court Samesex marriage supporters had arrived early armed with signs and rainbow flags They cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right for gay marriage which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until the turn of this century The first legally recognized samesex marriages in the United States took place just 11years ago the result of a Massachusetts state supreme court decisionJim Obergefell who became the face of the case Obergefell v Hodges when he sought to put his name on his husbands Ohio death certificate as the surviving spouse said Todays ruling from the Supreme Court affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in our hearts that our love is equalIt is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past that from this day forward it will be simply marriage he saidBut Austin R Nimocks senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom a group that supports traditional marriage said Today five lawyers took away the voices of more than 300million Americans to continue to debate the most important social institution in the history of the world  Nobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is irrelevant There are differences that should be celebratedOpponents of gay marriage are divided on whether to resist the rulingThe Supreme Court used cases from Michigan Ohio Kentucky and Tennessee where restrictions against samesex marriage were upheld by an appeals court last year to find that the Constitution does not allow such prohibitionsKennedy over the past 20 years has written the Supreme Courts most important gay rights cases overturning criminal laws on homosexual conduct protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal government could not refuse to recognize samesex marriages performed where they were legalHe often employs a lofty writingforhistory tone and Fridays decision was no differentReferring to the couples who brought the cases before the court Kennedy wrote It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage Their plea is that they do respect it respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutionsKennedy did not respond directly to the courts dissenters but he addressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right The right to marriage is fundamental he said The difference is societys evolving view of gay people and their rights he saidThe limitation of marriage to oppositesex couples may long have seemed natural and just but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest he wrote With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding samesex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charterAs in previous decisions Kennedy did not spell out how courts should scrutinize laws that treated gays differently But Mary Bonauto who argued the case for gay plaintiffs at the Supreme Court said that message from Kennedys combined opinions is one of inclusion Stop making rules for gay peopleScalia was a sharp critic of Kennedys style saying it was as pretentious as its content is egotisticThe Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie Scalia wroteRoberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a pointbypoint takedown of the majority opinion Gay activists had wondered whether the 60yearold justice might take note of the increasing public support for samesex marriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the right side of historyBut he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether samesex marriage was a good idea but who should decideThe court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese the Carthaginians and the Aztecs Roberts wrote Just who do we think we areRoberts rejected a comparison to Loving v Virginia in which the court struck down bans on interracial marriage That did not change the ageold definition of marriage as between a man and a woman he said He raised concerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages  he mentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a throupleHe noted that voters and legislators in only 11 states had authorized samesex marriages and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted through the democratic process than by judicial order He said religious leaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their beliefs would be respectedThat theme was picked up by Alito in his dissent He said there could be bitter and lasting wounds from the decision and warned that the decision will be exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissentThe questions raised in the cases decided Friday were left unanswered in 2013 when the justices last confronted the issue of samesex marriage A slim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act  withholding the federal governments recognition of samesex marriages  was unconstitutional In a separate case that year the court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional question in a case from California but allowed samesex marriages to resume in that stateSince then courts across the nation  with the notable exception of the Cincinnatibased federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in the four states at issue  have struck down a string of state prohibitions on samesex marriage many of them passed by voters in referendumsJerry Markon David Nakamura and Sandhya Somashekhar contributed to
