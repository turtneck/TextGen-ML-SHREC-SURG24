President Obama campaigns Tuesday with Mrs Clinton for the first time Hesmore popular than she is and can excite the Democratic base But Obama also faces risksPresident Barack Obama and thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived at Yangon International Airport in Yangon Myanmar in 2012 The last time they traveled together was to the country which had recently adopted democratic reforms Theyve been bitter rivals allies and colleagues When they take the stage at their first joint campaign appearance on July 5 2016 Obama and Clinton will show off a new phase in their storied relationship codependentsPresident Obama is set to hit the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton for the first time the next step in what Democrats hope is a march to four more years in the White HouseMr Obama has been itching to campaign for Mrs Clinton for a while But there was this little thing called the primaries that had to play out first Then there was the Orlando massacre on June 12 which forced the cancellation of their first joint appearance which was to take place a few days laterObama too has been mindful of Bernie Sanders who still hasnt endorsed Clinton and of Senator Sanderss supporters Still polls show that most Democrats and Democraticleaning voters are ready to vote for Clintonso the big question is turnout Thats where Obama comes in beginning Tuesday when he joins Clinton on stage in Charlotte NC Hes more popular than Clinton and can Democrats hope rally the troops But Obama also faces risks as a surrogateHeres a list of the ways Obama can both help and hurt Clintons candidacy First the positivesHes better at campaigning Theres a reason he beat Clinton in 2008 when she was the heavy favorite going in to win the Democratic nomination Hes the master at soaring rhetoric and she is all about 10point plansHe has higher approval ratings Obama is more popular than Clinton His job approval rating is hovering around 50 percent which is pretty good considering that he was under water for much of the last three years  that is more voters disapproved of his job performance than approved Clinton in contrast is deeply underwater seen favorably by only 40 percent of Americans and 56 percent unfavorably Maybe Obama can offer her some coattailsAs president Obama still commands the bully pulpit Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump is a master at attracting media attention but Obama is pretty good at it too Wherever Obama goes so do the media  and thats good for Clinton when hes campaigning for her Attracting free media which amplifies her message at no cost saves campaign cash for other purposes such as getoutthevote effortsObama can troll Mr Trump in a way Clinton cant Obama clearly loves to make fun of Trump Remember the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011 when Obama mocked him mercilessly as the real estate mogul sat stonefaced in the audience Trump had harangued Obama on his place of birth to the point where Obama released his longform birth certificate just to end the distraction and at that dinner Obama got his paybackObama has a deeper connection to key constituencies Obama won the presidency twice in part by winning big among minorities young voters and single women Clinton is beating Trump handily among all three constituencies but Democrats are concerned about getting those groups excited about turning out Obama is expected to play an important role in inspiring those groups especially minorities and Millennials to show up at the pollsObama is sharing his campaign data The presidents vaunted datadriven machine the operation that elected him twice is now at Clintons disposal  including Obamas massive email list That explains all the emails showing up in supporters inboxes offering a chance to go see the Broadway musical Hamilton with ClintonFundraising Obama is still a major rainmaker for his party and that benefits everyone up and down the Democratic ticketObama is no longer the change candidate Eight years ago Obama was the candidate of hope and change Now an older grayer Obama represents the status quo which for some Americans isnt good and Trump is the candidate of change So it will be harder to jazz up crowdsIts the Republicans turn After two terms of the Democratic Obama voters would usually be ready for a swing of the pendulum toward the GOP So Obama and Clinton are trying to buck history Trumps inflammatory rhetoric and unorthodox policies give the Democrats hope But Obama has to be mindful that in theory this shouldnt be a Democratic yearObama cant campaign everywhereHell avoid solidly red states Even in battleground states the president has to pick his spots and that probably means avoiding heavily bluecollar areas Pennsylvania is one example Its shaping up to be animportant state for Trump if hes going to have a shot at winning But after Obamas secretly recorded comments during the 2008 campaign about voters in smalltown Pennsylvania who cling to guns or religion he should probably steer clear of rural western Pennsylvania and similar areas in the old rust beltObama and Clinton differ on some important policies Under pressure from Sanderss unexpectedly strong campaign Clinton has moved to Obamas left on issues relevant to working Americans such as trade and the minimum wage And she remains more hawkish on military intervention abroadIn a way these policy differences help refute the idea that a Clinton presidency would be just a third Obama term But if voters bring them up during campaign appearances it could be awkward for both the president and ClintonObama has to beware the Trump trap Too much trolling could drag the president downBottom line Obama can do a lot of good for Clinton over the next four months as he works to convince American voters that they should warm up to her just as he did But theres only so much a lameduck president can do for his hopedfor successor
