Lincoln Applegate Hahn November 4 2016  630 pm Weve seen your French Values and they are the problem  comme ci comme ca like this and that  Etti November 4 2016  609 pm What a foolish man He believes that accepting migrants and teaching them to learn French will see them in the French Parliament Of course you will and they will be forcing sharia law on to the French population not making the country more civilised Lisa November 4 2016  603 pm Because rightly or wrongly people project their view of the world onto othersWe live according to the golden rule and dont do to others that which we do not want them todo to us Many cannot fathom or conceive just how vile the followers of the murderous paedophile can be Its incomprehensible Even animals that have been traumatised and abused dont behave like that when rescued Europeans have mostly been peaceful for the last 70 years because they made a concerted effort to live in peace and to uphold dignity of life and human rights That came at a price Followers of the paedophile savage are socialised differently They are pathetic and emotionally infantile In the West we are taught to take personal responsibility for our actions They are taught to blame everyone but themselves often turning victims into the guilty in the case of raped women In the West violent displays of anger are frowned upon and we are taught to apologise for our wrong doIngs Muslims have a warped and messed up sense of honour An honour they will gladly kill their families to restore In short they accept everything that is a crime in our countries as somehow permissible Incompatible In the West they are given human rights they dont deserve and freedoms they cant handle Proven recipe for disaster You have to be very very naive to believe that people who are fed a steady diet of intolerance opression and hatred since birth will miraculously change just because they cross a border from hell hole to civilsed country It should be obvious by now that Muslims born in europe cannot be integrated so what hope do we have integrating the rest Nicolai sennels wrote a great paper on why islam is prone to creating monsters Puts it all into perspective and is a must read in my opinion
