By Beln Fernndez  FAIR PHOTO ABOVE Hillary Clinton told Goldman Sachs that a nofly zone is going to kill a lot of Syrians cc photo Gage Skidmore A s she marches toward the US presidency Hillary Clinton has stepped up her promotion of the idea that a nofly zone in Syria could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict that has devastated that country since 2011 It has now been revealed of course that Clinton hasnt always expressed the same optimism about the nofly zone in private The Intercept 101016  reported on Clintons recently leaked remarks in a closeddoor speech to Goldman Sachs in 2013 To have a nofly zone you have to take out all of the air defense many of which are located in populated areas So our missiles even if they are standoff missiles so were not putting our pilots at riskyoure going to kill a lot of Syrians Other relevant characters such as US Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Joseph Dunford  Daily Caller  92616  have warned that a nofly zone in Syria would simply intensify the conflictwhich presumably isnt the best way to hasten its end L uckily for those who prefer to rally around illogic however plenty of media have already rolled out the welcome mat for peddlers of the humanitarian vision of increased Western military interference in Syria The New York Times  Nicholas Kristof  10616  argues against Obamas paralysis and for more robust strategies advocated by Hillary Clinton The New York Times  selfappointed savior of women  Nicholas Kristof  10616  invoked the plight of a young Syrian girl in Aleppo to conclude that Obamas alleged paralysis on Syria has been linked to the loss of perhaps half a million lives in the country as well as to the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State among other unpleasant outcomes We have no excuse were told for failing to respond to mass atrocities Never mind that the rise of ISIS has much to do with that mass atrocity known as the US invasion of Iraq thanks to which many young Iraqi girls and other human beings have suffered rape mutilation and death Its convenient for certain industries at least when US weapons are deemed the solution for problems US weapons helped to create in the first place Furthermore plenty of US weapons continue to flow to countries known for arming and funding ISIS and similar outfitsan arrangement unlikely to be rectified by a nofly zone targeting the Syrian government and the Russians USA Today  10816  meanwhile ran an opinion piece by an American doctor who worked briefly at a nowdestroyed hospital in Aleppo arguing that the US should lead the way in establishing real nofly zones either under United Nations auspices or with the British and the Frenchbecause otherwise our inaction will continue to be an embarrassment and stand as an example of our spineless irresponsibility But considering that there has already been plenty of US action in Syriaincluding the mistaken pulverization of whole families with childrenit would seem weve already exhibited a fair amount of lethal irresponsibility Beyond the opinion pages media figures are pushing the humanitarian approach with varying degrees of subtlety Meet the Press host Chuck Todd  101616  recently pressed Vice President Joe Biden on the lack of a nofly zone over Aleppo suggesting that the Obama administration will look back and wonder what if What if What if What if Of course no campaign for saving lives with bombs would be complete without everyones favorite examples of feelgood destruction from the former Yugoslavia The Washington Post  9916  hosted an opinion by Bosnia and Herzegovinas first ambassador to the UN Muhamed Sacirbey straightforwardly headlined Western Military Intervention Saved Lives in Bosnia It Can Work in Syria Too Sacirbey warns that Syrias largest city is on the brink of starvation Bombed from the skies and besieged on the ground Aleppos 2 million residents may soon be exterminated Gone apparently are the days of factchecking when someone at the Post might have alerted the author to the reality that the vast majority of Aleppos residents live in governmentcontrolled areas and are thus not under attack by said government Comparing Aleppo to besieged Sarajevo Sacirbey determines that Sarajevans ultimately escaped many of the horrors now awaiting Aleppos residents because NATO opted albeit belatedly and too often inadequately to uphold its responsibility to protect Bosnian civilians After lauding Bosnias nofly zone Sacirbey pulls this prediction out of a hat Limited   Syria would save civilian lives perhaps as many as 200 a week In their indispensable essay for Monthly Review  1007  The Dismantling of Yugoslavia A Study in In humanitarian Intervention and a Western LiberalLeft Intellectual and Moral Collapse Edward S Herman and David Peterson make it unavoidably clear that the Wests business in Bosnia   saving livesand much to do with the contrary The Bill Clinton administration they note actively sabotaged agreements to end the war at an earlier date while helping arm the Bosnian Muslims and Croatians and helping bring thousands of Mujahedin to fight in Bosnia Americas support in this case for jihadistsa secret alliance also discussed by scholar Tariq Ali  Guardian  9906 further complicates the assumption that the US is somehow capable of fixing the current jihad problem In predictable fashion US media led the charge to the Bosnian intervention  Extra  101192  dutifully painting the Serbs as demonic aggressors parroting inflated Bosnian casualty estimates and otherwise behaving as the official PR arm of the establishment A similar performance was repeated shortly thereafter with Kosovo where minimal regard was given to actual facts on the ground and the specter of Serbianwaged genocide was instead hysterically invoked Noam Chomsky  Monthly Review  908  cited various reports including from the British government that the USbacked Kosovo Liberation Army was actually responsible for more killings than the Serbs in the runup to NATOs bombing campaigna project that naturally also managed to kill several thousand people While Yugoslavia has now been fully dismantled the myth of Western humanitarian intervention there has emerged unscathed in his recent dispatch on Syria Kristof brought up Kosovo as an example of how the military toolbox has saved lives To be sure saving lives is a much nobler goal than say endowing NATO with a new lease on life or clearing the way for total neoliberal assault two outcomes of the Wests Yugoslav ventures Hence the utility as Herman and Peterson write of the edifice of lies that serves and protects the Western interventions in the former Yugoslaviaand which laid the ideological foundations for the US role in Iraq and for future socalled humanitarian interventions In Syrias brutal war meanwhile humanitarian motives will presumably be utilized as a veneer for pursuing more fundamental goals like neutralizing resistance to USIsraeli regional designs and promoting that profitable sort of chaos that produces massive arms sales And just as those in the West who failed to leap onto the bandwagon in Yugoslavia were denounced as  apologists for genocide  and the like opponents of increased Western military action in Syria will be increasingly assailed as proAssad fanatics with Syrian blood on their hands One strong candidate for fanatichood is Greg Shupak who in a recent Jacobin magazine dispatch  102016  dared to argue that a nofly zone would actually represent an escalation of war that is guaranteed to harm civilians in the name of protecting them Emphasizing that opposition to said zone is not meant in any way to minimize or rationalize the torture mass killings or severe sieges enacted by the Syrian state and its allies Shupak continues The imminent question however is not Is the Syrian government good its Should America drop more bombs on Syria Because at the end of the day humanitarian war just isnt humanly
