tries to get a rally going  The bull is backHILLARYS FABERGE EGG CANDIDACY New Hampshire is a happy place for Hillary Clinton It was there in 1992 that her husband saved his candidacy with her help from the sex scandal that was about to consume it Bill Clintons secondplace finish was enough to keep his campaign on track Sixteen years later a tearful plea to New Hampshire votershelped her win there and break the momentum of upstart Barack Obama setting up an arduous sixmonth battle for the nomination On this visit Clinton needs no comeback There is no contest among Democrats so far But there is danger With independent and moderate voters likely to be drawn to the highoctane wideopen GOP nominating contest the Democratic primary electorate will likely be more liberal than it was in 2012 If Clinton is going to be again denied the presidency New Hampshire would be a good place for the revolution to begin But so far Democrats are falling in line  Clinton tours Whitney Brothers Inc a familyowned small business today in Keene New Hampshire She will participate in a roundtable discussion with employees and company leadership  As Clinton tries to have it both ways on issues like free trade she is counting on Democrats to indulge her Clintons strategy appears to be based on an expectation that her party will continue to treat her candidacy as something rare fragile and valuable  the Faberge egg candidate But the handling keeps getting rougher As the NYT reports today a bombshell book is due out soon that makes the case that the Clintons massive fortune was amassed in part with the help of overseas patrons some very unsavory The book a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times asserts that foreign entities who made payments to the Clinton Foundation and to Mr Clinton through high speaking fees received favors from Mrs Clintons State Department in return The scandals around Clinton continue to remind Democrats what they dont like about their presumptive nominee  WashEx Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is drawing a populist bead on lavish Wall Street pay packages as she revs up her march to the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but in some respects the fatperspeech fee she can charge puts her far ahead of the top 10 highestpaid American CEOs  If at any time Democrats start taking her challengers seriously Clinton could find herself in serious trouble But that is a very big if None so far look plausible though former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley is hovering closer to that space Even so she remains a prohibitive favorite The chances though of Clinton having to defend her record and explain her ethical lapses in the context of a primary campaign seem to be growing steadily Can Clinton baggageladen and with so many unanswered questions really avoid participating in debates A candidate who still hasnt answered a single tough question or spoken to any reporter a full week after declaring would appear to be living in some denial  Watch Fox Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry reports live from New Hampshire  OMALLEY CONTRASTS WILL BECOME APPARENT NPR Martin OMalley former governor of Maryland says hell decide by late May if hes running for president  OMalley is positioning himself to Clintons left and even President Obamas left Hes for a much higher minimum wage and against a major trade deal

addressed a crowd in Iowa while standing on a chair Last week he gave a speech at Harvard And this week hes in the early primary state of South Carolina Ive been an executive and a progressive executive with a record of accomplishments the former Baltimore mayor said of the difference between him and Clinton I think contrasts will become apparent  CBS I believe that if you have the executive experience the ideas that can serve our nation well and the ability to govern you should offer your candidacy and then let the people decide If we do that then we can be the party that leads our country into the future OMalley said in an interview with CBS Face the Nation Sunday But we wont do it unless we offer ideas for the future and break with things like bad trade deals the systematic deregulation of Wall Street that many Democrats were complicit in and helped get us into this mess  Webb bashes Iran deal  WashEx Former Sen Jim Webb DVa on Sunday criticized the White Houses proposed nuclear deal with Iran saying that the administrations negotiators had given away too much and that would create further problems in the Middle East We dont want to be sending signals into this region that we are acquiescing to the situation where Iran might become more dominant Webb a potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate and former secretary of the US Navy said in an appearance on the CNN program State Of The Union  Chaffee stays on Hillarys Iraq war support  The Hill Former Rhode Island Gov Lincoln Chafees way of making a name for himself against his newly adopted partys frontrunner is to hit the former secretary of State particularly hard on the issue that was a liability in her failed 2008 run She needs to be asked hard questions about her Iraq war vote and her tenure as Secretary of State and where she wants to take this country he told The Hill in an interview I think shes tone deaf on some of these issues Clinton and Chafee both served in the Senate during the runup to the war but while Clinton ultimately cast her vote in favor of authorizing troops Chafee voted no  2016 Democratic Power Index 1Hillary Clinton 2Martin OMalley3Jim Webb 1

significance of evangelicals in the Republican Party It may even seem that their influence is waning as the country rapidly becomes more liberal on cultural issues and as some Republican candidates
