The big gray Air Force plane carrying the presidents limousines flew low slow and loud over this small farming city shaking buildings and barnsThe noise from its engines rattled the doors at the Cattlemans Casino where the owner was hanging an American flag that she had bought that morning and the windows at the Midwest Bible Camp where the pastor and his wife hadnt voted for the president but still put up a sign asking God to bless himIt stopped farmers on their tractors and the sisters at the Mother of God Monastery who dashed up to the roof to watch it pass It surprised the mayor who was in the middle of an interview with a radio station 100 miles away in Sioux FallsCheck that out he said last Thursday when he spotted the plane through his office window although no one listening to his voice on the radio was close enough to know what he was talking aboutHundreds of Watertown residents were rushing to the airport so they could see it up close and on the ground In 36 hours the president would be coming to this city only the fifthlargest in South Dakota to deliver the commencement address at the local community college If all went as planned he would be on the ground for only two hoursTheres hardly a state in America thats more hostile to Obama than South Dakota where the presidents disapproval rating hovers around 70percent and the local Republican Party last summer passed a resolution calling for his impeachmentBut even in an era of almost unprecedented political polarization people still want to see their president That was especially true in Watertown which had never hosted a sitting commander in chief The cargo plane landed and rolled to a stop Inside the tiny commuter airport terminal there were three empty couches and a television playing Fox News Outside a light rain was falling and about 300 people were standing along the airport fence line A teacher had brought her nursery school class Farther down the metal fence line were locals who had skipped out of work for the morning and retirees balanced on wooden canesThis is definitely not his president said Laurie Brandriet Keller gesturing to her husband Im amazed how excited hes been these last few daysPeople in the crowd shot video with their cellphones and wondered how the monstrous airplane even stayed in the air It looked like it was dragging just about ready to fall said Vernard Cordell 71 who thought the thunderous noise was some sort of farm equipment rolling past his house Then he realized it was coming from the sky and he sped to the airportA ramp dropped and out of the plane came bombsniffing dogs trucks and vans There were Secret Service agents with guns Last off were the two presidential limousines shiny and black each bearing flags with the presidential sealThe crowd edged closer hands gripped the fence The vehicles including the limousines formed up into a loose motorcade and drove to a local gas station just outside of the airport where they filled up with fuel Most of the crowd followedHarley Waterman who had shut down his pawn shop to race out the airfield lingered by the fence line still staring at the plane a raw expression of American power The actual presidential visit Friday was still more than a day awayJust look at the size of that thing he said A onceinalifetime dealFor the vast majority of Watertowns 21000 residents the only chance to see the president would come as his motorcade sped past them on the way to his Lake Area Technical Institute commencement addressThe motorcade route was less than four miles and not likely to last much longer than 10minutes It was also supposed to be secret known only to local police the presidents security detail and the mayorJerry Elshere 70 a retired middle school assistant principal stood along 10th Avenue about a mile from the community college In the 1920s his parents had driven 400miles to see Calvin Coolidge who had gone trout fishing one summer in the Black Hills of South DakotaNow he and his three grandchildren were hoping to catch a glimpse of Obama Hed picked the spot based on a tip from a neighbor and the presence of a local policemanThe motorcade wouldnt pass for at least another hour but already a small crowd was forming on the sidewalk They huddled under blankets carried signs and set up lawn chairsI know but I cant say said the lone policeman a smile slipping across his faceMost in the crowd which was now three or four people deep were diehard Republicans and had little love for this president I wonder if hes a Christian sometimes said Kristi Maas 47 who owns a small hair salon in town Just the thought was scary to her she said He wants to take prayer out of everything  Isnt this country supposed to be based on religion Heads nodded around herThe presidents plane landed about 30minutes late Someone tuned a radio to a local station where the DJ who usually announces the Watertown High School basketball games was doing a playbyplay of Obamas arrival The president was coming down the Air Force One steps the announcer said He was shaking hands with the mayor and climbing into one of the motorcades two black limousinesNow the motorcade was rollingIs the president coming down this road Elsheres granddaughter asked himA few minutes passed and the policemans walkietalkie which had been quiet started to buzz Everyone needs to back up the officer saidThe crowd took three steps from the road and then surged forward again at the sight of the two black limousines shining in the afternoon sun Just before the presidents car slowed to make the turn by the cluster of scraggly pine trees on 10th Avenue they raised their cellphones and started to recordFrom where Maas was standing the light was just perfect She could see Obama smiling and waving through the tinted window for three or maybe four full seconds  and then he was goneOh my gosh he waved at me Maas said That was so coolHer cellphone rang with a call from her daughterI just got waved at by the president Maas said Yeah he waved at us He didnt roll down the window but I could see him smiling as plain as day He was waving at meThe crowd drifted slowly away As she walked back to her car with her sister Maas was already reconsidering her opinion of the man who minutes earlier she had believed maybe wasnt a Christian  the man she worried was ruining the countryI believe in respecting our president her sister saidYou only hear some of the stories about him not all of them Maas agreed Hes a husband and a father He has the same feelings we doThe presidents commencement address aired live on all of Watertowns major television and radio stationsAt the Cattlemans Casino a tworoom bar on the north side of town all six TVs were tuned to the speech The smell of cigarettes stale beer and cow manure from the auction barn across the street hung heavy in air About 30people were clustered around the big flatscreen at the front of the barFor the first and probably only time in their lives they were listening to a president talk about their town their friends and their relatives Stephanie Burchatz who runs a small construction company with her dad and brother was sipping a 250 Bud Light Her eyes were trained on the presidentShe had spent most of the day laying new sidewalks curbs and gutters for the city Now she was listening as the president talked about the girlfriend of one of her employees a single mom who had gone back to Lake Area Tech to get an associates degree By age20 she was working as a waitress supporting two beautiful baby girls Lizzie and Farah on her own the president was sayingThis is good she was saying This is really really goodThe president was reading the speech  his seventh public address of the week  off of a teleprompter But to the people in the bar it seemed as if he were telling their stories from memoryWhen Obama was done the bar erupted in applause A woman sitting in the smoking room by the video poker machines had begun cryingMost of the time I could care less what hes talking about said Jason Hollatz 37yearold farmer Are all Obamas speeches like thatHer brother glanced back at the television where Obama his speech finished was accepting a Lake Area Tech jacket from one of the new graduates Suddenly his mouth fell open Thats the kid who ran over my mailbox last week he yelledOne last lookObamas motorcade raced back through town to the airport where a crowd of about 200 was gathering near the southern end of the runway to catch one last glimpse of the presidential planeThere were lawyers farmers construction workers and the custodian from the nearby elementary school and his family An elderly woman balanced on her walkerThe temperature had started to drop and the wind was kicking up A youth baseball team cut short its practice and wandered over The runway at the Watertown airport was too small to accommodate the presidents normal plane so the White House had switched to a smaller 757 which taxied to the far end of the runway and gunned its enginesIts going to get loud a mother warned her son who plugged his earsThe blueandwhite 757 with the presidential seal and United States of America began tearing down the runway kicking up a cloud of dust and sand in its wake All eyes turned skyward as the plane lifted off the ground Some filmed the takeoff with their cellphone cameras Others waved goodbye They kept waving long after there was any chance that the president or anyone inside the plane could still see them standing in the field below
