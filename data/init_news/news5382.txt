Yeah yeah with the rise of Der Trumper and the ascendance of Ted Cruz to serious candidacy the Libertarian Moment is deader than Nancy Reagans dream of a drugfree America RightIn fact as Catos David Boaz has pointed outrecently the libertarian electorate is on the rise according to Gallups annual Governance survey from last fall Gallup uses two questions to separate respondents into one of four categories conservative liberal libertarian and populist The two questions areGallup finds that libertarian voters those who think the government is doing too much and should NOT favor any particular set of values account for 27 percent of respondents followed by conservatives 26 percent liberals 23 percent and populists 15 percentBoaz notes that 27 percent is the highest percentage recorded for libertarian sensibilities In 2000 for instance the figure was just 18 percent So if libertarian sentiments are on the rise then why are characters such as Trump Cruz and even Bernie Sanders doing so well Boaz runs through various reasons many of which involve the simple fact that neither the Republican nor Democratic Party does a decent job of representing libertarian values If you take the two questions above equally serious for instance you couldnt in good conscience vote for any of the candidates running for president And so we find ourselves in a situation where across many policy questions that define libertarianismincreasing immigration say or legalizing pot and gay marriage deregulating business and liberalizing gun lawsthe country is becoming more and more libertarianeven as the major political parties get more and more reactionary in their viewsAs the Republican Party begins its great implosion thank you for that at least Donald Trump the question in front of us isnt why hasnt the GOP ever been as libertarian as its rhetoric 40 years ago for gods sake Ronald Reagan famously told Reason I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism Its whether the Republican Party will reconstitute itself along libertarian lines If the party elders are serious about taking the party into the future or even dragging it in the nearpresent they should be breaking toward what Reason founded in 1968 was calling Free Minds and Free Markets back when Reagan was still in his first term as governor of California
