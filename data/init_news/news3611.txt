As the unfolding Clinton email story plays out I have some simple counsel for my friends in Congress the conservative movement and rightleaning opinion media Stop talking unless and until you have a plan Better to go dark than play this game by the Clinton RulesHillary really put a wrench in the medias plans this week After eagerly cheerleading Barack Obama for eight years they stood ready to help break the ultimate glass ceiling and play their role as part of the uncritical chorus of Hillary Clintons coronation first as the Democratic nominee then as president Its why they hate this story It brings alive the memories of 30 years of the slimy predatory Clinton enterprise and how its venal sleazy onestepaheadofthelaw hillbilly hustle stains everything it touchesCursed with both arrogance and inertia the Bill and Hillary machine is stumbling toward political peril as the story of her possibly illegal and certainly dodgy and illadvised use of private email servers consumes a Washington and New York press corps that for once cant easily look away The Clintons know were only at the end of the beginning of this story and the national security legal and political implications for Hillary will get worse The Clintons are depending on their old skills at manipulating the press and hoping the GOP and conservatives will save her by mishandling their response as badly as shes mishandling hersWhile the medias passive attention span excuse du jour is real many in the press are possessed of a boundless ideological desire to change the subject right now Thats why the press is waiting breathlessly for and in some cases actively trolling for Republicans to blow it An intemperate remark from Congressman Jackass would fit the bill perfectly Dont be the squirrel Dont give them a shiny object Dont give them an excuse to turn this into Krazee Republicans Sure Hate Hillary Because Shes a Woman For Gods sake candidates take a deep breath and skip talking about your favorite social issue for just a few days The media is desperate for another riff on evolution or vaccines or gay marriage or prison sex from a GOP contender so they can turn their undivided attention to the RepublicansLets try something new maintain message discipline hold focus and keep an eye on a bigger objective than your daily press release social media hits or email fundraising drops This is about her not us so unless GOP elected and opinion leaders are smart and subtle and execute with the right timing and tone she wins Try for once to play the long game and help Hillary Clinton take on waterYou can sense the Clintons are on the back foot her nowinfamous tweet and promises of transparency last week were nothing more than rehashed Clinton stalling tactics from the 1990s when there were only a handful of media outlets and a relatively hermetic press culture It was as stale as a faxed statement three days late in the era of alwayson social media That wont work today if were smart Shes blowing this lets helpIts vital to have a plan to execute it with discipline and proceed against Clinton with a measured pace and tone Speak more in sorrow than in anger Dont make it all about Benghazi theyre expecting that or the recordkeeping laws boring Touch on those selectively but focus instead on the grave national security risks that her amateurhour email server shenanigan posed and more broadly what this says about the Clinton culture Her team can yammer on about the legality of it all her motivations or the traffic content but the moment this becomes about the Chinese Iranians Russians or even just random hackers reading the email classified or not of the secretary of state its a new ballgameI encourage you to use the smarmy DC construction of I just want to work in a bipartisan way for good transparent government and to protect national security secrets from the Chinese Russians and other threats that the Acela Media claims to worship Republicans have heard the hard ideologues on the left use it a million times while grinding their teeth in frustration Avoid making wild claims about either the substance or political outcomes of investigations Reduce expectations rather than raise them Dont let one single member of Congress or leader be the only face in the room the Clintons love to demonize a single target so vary your portfolio Be persistent Be serious Be smart
