 The Path to Total Dictatorship Americas Shadow Government and Its Silent CoupBy John W Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the US can be laid by strictly legal means unseen and unheard by Congress the President or the people  Outwardly we have a Constitutional government We have operating within our government and political system a wellorganized politicalaction group in this country determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a oneparty state  The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly silently continuously to transform our Government  This group is answerable neither to the President the Congress nor the courts It is practically irremovable Senator William Jenner 1954 speech Unaffected by elections Unaltered by populist movements Beyond the reach of the lawSay hello to Americas shadow governmentA corporatized militarized entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are in essence running the country this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenryNo matter which candidate wins the presidential election this shadow government is here to stay Indeed as recent documents by the FBI reveal this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group may well have played a part in who will win the White House this yearTo be precise however the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governmentsThe first shadow government referred to as COG or Continuity of Government is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstancesa terrorist attack a natural disaster an economic meltdownto bring it out of the shadows where it operates even now When and if COG takes over the police state will transition to martial lawYet it is the second shadow government also referred to as the Deep Statethat poses the greater threat to freedom right now Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats corporations contractors paperpushers and buttonpushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our governmentThe Deep State which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative governmentSo who or what is the Deep StateIts the militarized police which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation Its the private sector with its 854000 contract personnel with topsecret clearances a number greater than that of topsecretcleared civilian employees of the government Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies  the Department of Defense the State Department Homeland Security the CIA the Justice Department the Treasury the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court a handful of vital federal trial courts and members of the defense and intelligence committeesIts every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs corruption and abusive tacticsThese are the key players that drive the shadow governmentThis is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election DayJust consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval OfficeDomestic surveillanceNo matter who wins the presidential popularity contest the National Security Agency NSA with its 108 billion black ops annual budget will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone Thus on any given day whether youre walking through a store driving your car checking email or talking to friends and family on the phone you can be sure that some government agency whether the NSA or some other entity is listening in and tracking your behavior Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets purses briefcases etc Fullbody scanners which perform virtual stripsearches of Americans traveling by plane have gone mobile with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alikeincluding homes Coupled with the nations growing network of realtime surveillance cameras and facial recognition software soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hideGlobal spyingThe NSAs massive surveillance network what the Washington Post refers to as a 500 billion  espionage empire  will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call fax and email message sent anywhere in the world In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International Greenpeace and several religious groups Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage Roving TSA searchesThe American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration TSA with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport fullbody Xray scanners punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables Considered essential to national security TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the countryUSA Patriot Act NDAAAmericas socalled war on terror which it has relentlessly pursued since 911 will continue to chip away at our freedoms unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens In so doing they reorient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law rather than the US Constitution is the map by which we navigate life in the United States These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets electedMilitarized police stateThanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military complete with jackboots helmets shields batons pepperspray stun guns assault rifles body armor miniature tanks and weaponized drones Having been given the green light to probe poke pinch taser search seize strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance all with the general blessing of the courts Americas law enforcement officials no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace will continue to keep the masses corralled controlled and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizensSWAT team raidsWith more than 80000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise Nationwide SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs domestic disputes improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer and misdemeanor marijuana possessionDomestic drones The domestic use of drones will continue unabated As mandated by Congress there will be 30000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020 all part of an industry that could be worth as much as 30 billion per year These machines which will be equipped with weapons will be able to record all activities using video feeds heat sensors and radar An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept of Justice has already spent nearly 4 million on drones domestically largely for use by the FBI  with grants for another 126 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own dronesSchooltoprison pipelineThe paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools through school lockdowns where police and drugsniffing dogs enter the classroom and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment suspension or expulsion from school accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile courtOvercriminalizationThe government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws statutes codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies rendering the rest of us petty criminals The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal Consequently small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raidedPrivatized PrisonsStates will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations resulting in a cash cow whereby megacorporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states the states have to agree to maintain a 90 occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 yearsEndless warsAmericas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than 15 billion a month or 20 million an hour The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health education welfare and safety Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expenseAre you getting the message yetThe next president much like the current president and his predecessors will be little more than a figurehead a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going onAs Lofgren reveals this state within a state concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue  is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out connected to but only intermittently controlled by the visible state whose leaders we chooseThe Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall but it also controls Wall Street which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater and Silicon ValleyThis is fascism in its most covert form hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deedsIt is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat catsAs Lofgren concludesThe Deep State is so heavily entrenched so well protected by surveillance firepower money and its ability to coopt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agendaIn other words as I point out in my book Battlefield America The War on the American People  as long as government officialselected and unelected alikeare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution the courts and the citizenry the threat to our freedoms remains undiminishedSo the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by Americas shadow governmentConstitutional attorney and author John W Whitehead is founder and president of The
