Washington CNN The faction of the GOP that is unhappy with Donald Trump as the partys presumptive nominee has one last plan to stop the mogul staging an allout delegate revolt at the Republican National ConventionThe farfetched idea is the latest reflection of a campaign cycle that has been anything but ordinary and stems from a continuing dissatisfaction among some conservative stalwarts with how Trump is behaving and running his campaign But two longtime GOP veterans says they wouldnt bet on the effort workingThe effort comes at a rough time for the GOP As the Democratic Partys heaviest hitters including President Barack Obama Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren line up behind Hillary Clinton and against Trump Republicans have been forced to criticize their own nominee Recent comments from Trump about a federal judges Mexican heritage have drawn widespread rebuke and put GOP leaders in a corner as they defend their endorsement of Trump while disavowing his commentsOne of the vocal advocates for a delegate revolt is conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who has also been actively seeking a candidate to mount an independent bid against Trump thus far to no availKristol tweeted late Thursday that the idea of a conscience convention where delegates are free to vote for whomever they want to is also appealingIve been focused on independent candidacy  still am But struck by sudden level of interest in possible delegate revolt at convention Kristol tweeted He added A Convention of Conscience in Cleveland would be quite something Made easier by fact Trump only won minority of total primary votes anywayBob Vander Plaats the head of The Family Leader an influential social conservative group in Iowa told CNNs Kate Bolduan Friday morning that everything does need to be on the table at the convention though he stopped short of calling for a revolt on the convention floorWe want a principled conservative and disciplined candidate who is the standardbearer of this party said Vander Plaats who backed Texas Sen Ted Cruz during the primaries He said Trump has time before the convention to have the concerns laid to restAll Im doing is adapting to the circumstances Kendal Unruh told ABC I certainly believe Trumps demagogic racist comments are hurting himThe rules enacted by the previous convention which govern in 2016 until delegates pass a new set of rules state that even if a delegate casts a ballot for a candidate other than one they are bound to the convention secretary will record their bound voteIn order to change that rule the 112 delegates two from each state and territory on the Rules Committee would have to pass different rules and bring those to the floor of the convention where a majority of delegates present would have to approve themRules expert and RNC veteran Jim Bopp an Indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the RNC Rules Committee said he has spoken with people who want to keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny Trump the nomination but he said he wouldnt bet on any changesI would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process Bopp told CNN I think its highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nominationBopp said theres also a counter movement within Rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the conventionRules Committee and Oregon RNC member Solomon Yue is behind that effort and has been pushing the RNC this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates He tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the conventionYue says with roughly 80 of the convention delegates being either Trump or Cruz backers the antiTrump forces dont have much strengthThe common denominator of the delegates is antiestablishment antiWashington Yue said And if you think about Never Trump people they are representing Washington and the establishmentPart of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime RNC veteran Curly Haugland from North Dakota and a book he cowrote with public policy consultant Sean Parnell Unbound uses the history of the RNC to make the case that RNC rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscienceWhat Curly and I are contending is that because of RNC rules there is no such thing as binding Parnell told CNN saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern preconvention during the delegate selection processBut Parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floorIt would be messy Good television though Parnell said I would not call it likely My hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote and its going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that But I think unless Donald Trump actually does go shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue I dont think this is going to cost him the nominationNeither the Trump campaign nor Republican National Committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revoltThere has been intense focus on the Rules Committee for months going back to when there was a possibility of no Republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright With the prospect of a contested convention the Cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the Rules Committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support Rules that would benefit Cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballotsBut after Cruz lost Indiana soundly and suspended his campaign the prospect of a contested convention vanished and Trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nominationMeanwhile the Cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the conventionThough some in the party have never warmed to Trump the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after Trumps comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own partyTrump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture Trump University saying the Indianaborn judges Mexican ancestry could bias him against Trump The mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico in making the commentsThough the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan who called the remarks the textbook definition of a racist commentStill only a small handful of Republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of Trump Vulnerable Illinois Sen Mark Kirk disavowed Trump this week and said he could not endorse the partys nominee after all but Ryan McConnell and others have stood by their endorsements saying Clinton would be a worse choice
