War on the Streets of Paris Armed Migrants Fight Running Battles in the French Capital Nick Gutteridge Express November 2 2016 A migrant turf war erupted into violence on the streets of one of Paris trendiest neighbourhoods early this morning as asylum seekers beat each other to a pulp with wooden clubs The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on The bloodcurdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais And despite the horrific brawl a promigrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight The once peaceful neighbourhood in Paris 10th Arrondissement used to be a popular area with tourists boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp which has brought squalor and violence Thousands of migrantsmostly from Sudan Libya Afghanistan and Eritreahave pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it There are now nore than 2500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a living hell Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous with increased reports of muggings Faisal a shopkeeper told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear threatening the future of his business He said The stench of urine faeces and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live The place is dead  noone wants to come here anymore People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in Im making less than 60 53 a day A few more weeks like this and Ill go bust French people have been kind to them I know theyre desperate but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society Jeanne another Stalingrad resident told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals She said Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passersbytheyre even stealing bread Ive seen them beat people up too Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year and on Monday French president Franois Hollande vowed to close the camp for good But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all describing how they have heard bloodcurdling noises coming from it in the middle of the night Marie who lives right next to the makeshift camp told Le Figaro Life here has become unbearable More than 2500 squatters were evacuated in September and now less than two months later theyre back And now that the Jungle camp has been closed things are about to get even worse Another local Monique said that she was at a loss for words and utterly distraught over the situation She said The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces We can hear bloodcurdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night
