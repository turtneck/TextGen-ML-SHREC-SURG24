November 7 2016 805 pm A  a Warning   Writing at the Federalist  libertarian NeverTrumper Cathy Young   makes a convincing case that the election of Donald Trump the supposed antiPC candidate could actually lead to an intensification of PC culture Youngs basic thesis is that if someone as umm lets say immoderate as Trump could get elected President in part as an antiPC champion no less it would validate the PC belief that crude xenophobia and toxic masculinity really are pervasive problems  Why Electing Donald Trump Could Make Political Correctness Worse  November 7 2016 And so the PC crowd would doubledown even further I think this is a good analysis Of course Youngs implicit assumption is that increasing political polarization is a problem that can be solved that a centerRight classical liberal consensus is the goal But the time for that has passed So kudos to Young for identifying the problem but we need a new solutionsuch as Michael Harts proposal for the peaceful secession of Red State America
