Sgt Bowe Bergdahl has already spent five years in Taliban captivity but charging him with desertion would likely lead to no jail time and would send a message to soldiersSouth Korea voted to impeach its president What happens nextSgt Bowe Bergdahl r stands with a Taliban fighter in eastern Afghanistan reports say Sergeant Bergdahl who was freed in a swap in which the US freed five Taliban detainees will be charged with desertion AP Photo FileSgt Bowe Bergdahl will be charged with desertion after a monthslong review of his disappearance from his Afghanistan outpost that led to his five yearlong captivityThat at least is the speculation from Fox News and reportedly confirmed by NBC The Army denies that any decision has been madeThe reporting is patently false Maj Gen Ronald Lewis chief of public affairs for the US Army said in a statement provided to the Monitor Tuesday afternoon To be clear there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt Bergdahl investigationInstead the investigation is still with the commanding general of US Army Forces Command Mark Milley who will determine appropriate action  which ranges from no further action to convening a courtmartial Major General Lewis added We understand the public interest in this case and once a decision has been made the Army will be open and transparent in this matterJudging from the Pentagon hallway chatter that has come in the wake of the reports however the notion that the Army would charge Sergeant Bergdahl with desertion makes a great deal of sense to many senior military officialsSo what would the US military hope to gain by charging Bergdahl with desertion After all wasnt his confinement at the hands of the Taliban punishment enoughI guess it doesnt surprise me that the Army would be going this route says a former military official who served as a top judge advocate general JAG and spoke on condition of anonymity because he continues to sit on a panel that hears military casesI hate to say it like this but its a winwin for everyone he addsIts a win for the Pentagon because it sends a strong message desertion is unacceptableBut there is also a compassionate nod to the hardships Bergdahl endured while in captivity The government really isnt interested in putting him in jail the former JAG saysIndeed if the Army does decide to charge Bergdahl with desertion he will most likely have the option of requesting a dischargeWith a possible courtmartial looming this discharge would not be honorable but rather a lessthanhonorable dischargeThe Army could refuse Bergdahls request for discharge but this would be highly unlikely the former senior JAG saysId be very surprised if they did that What they want is to have him out of the Army he saysnot the public outcry that would likely come if Bergdahl faced jail time after five years as a Taliban captiveI think they just want to get rid of them and to send a strong signal that this type of behavior will not be toleratedThis behavior includes reportedly leaving his combat outpost MestLalak in Paktika Province in dangerous eastern Afghanistan in June 2009Bergdahl was returned to the United States after a prisoner swap that was arranged earlier this yearIt is remains unclear whether Bergdahl intended to return to his outpost or not
