The fate of the Affordable Care Act the presidents signature domestic policy achievement is once again in the hands of the Supreme Court on Wednesday The justices heard oral arguments in King v Burwell a challenge to the financial assistance that millions of Americans are receiving to purchase health insurance The case is considered the greatest threat to Obamacares future since the court considered a challenge to the laws individual mandate three years agoWhats the lawsuit all aboutThe ACA created marketplaces or exchanges where people can shop for individual and family health insurance if they dont have another source of coverage The law directs the federal government to set up exchanges in states that didnt build their own which was the case for about twothirds of the country The law also provides subsidies through the exchanges to people who meet income requirementsThe King challengers say the law only authorizes subsidies through exchanges established by the state They argue that the law was intentionally designed this way to pressure states to set up their own insurance marketplaces They contend the IRS illegally issued a rule in 2012 providing subsidies through the federal exchanges when it became clear that most states wouldnt set up their own exchanges by 2014 when the marketplaces openedThe Obama administration however argues the challenge is politically motivated and wrongly focuseson just a few words in the ACA The administration says a reading of the entire law makes clear that subsidies are available in all exchanges regardless of whos running them The law was intended to extend health insurance to as many Americans as possible the administration argues so the laws drafters would have no reason to withhold subsidies to so many peopleThe plaintiffs are four Virginians who do not want to buy health insurance as mandated by the ACA They argue the IRS illegally interpreted the ACA to authorize subsidies through federalrun exchange and that without those subsidies they would be exempt from the requirement to purchase insurance because they dont earn enough The challenge is funded by the Competitive Enterprise Institute a libertarian think tank opposed to the ACA Federal courts have also heard three other cases challenging the subsidies but the Supreme Court is only considering KingWhy do people think this case is so important to the future of ACAThe subsidies are a critical part of the law working with two other major ACA pieces  the guaranteed availability of health insurance and the individual mandate The law prevents health insurers from denying coverage or charging people more because of their medical condition To help offset the costs of sicker customers the law requires most people to have insurance or pay an annual penalty for not having coverage To make that coverage affordable the law provides subsidies to low and middleincome familiesThe subsidies are paid directly to insurers who then apply the discount to their customers monthly premiums On average the subsidies knock down the price of monthly premiums by nearly 75 percentA ruling overturning the subsidies would cause more than 8 million people across the country to lose health insurance as a result of a ruling against the government according to recent estimates And it could wreak havoc on the insurance marketWithout the aid its expected that the lowerincome and healthier enrollees would quickly drop coverage leaving just the sickest patients who need coverage the most Insurers would look to raise their rates to cover the costs pricing even more people out of coverage and causing problems for the individual insurance market outside of just the exchangesOne note however Most people who would lose their subsidies in such a ruling wouldbe spared from the penalty for not having health insurance since they dont earn enoughWould there be a fixThe immediate question is whether subsidies could be restored to those whod suddenly lose them if the Supreme Court rules against the government The easiest fix would be for Congress to pass a law that says federal exchanges can provide subsidies  but Republicans opposing the ACA would never go for that A handful of Republican lawmakers in two separate proposals this week raised the idea that they would offer temporary financial relief to those losing subsidies However they havent provided detailed plans and its unclear how much support they have within the party for their proposals The Obama administration for its part insists it wont be able to fix anything  perhaps an effort to avoid signaling to the justices that a ruling against subsidies wouldbe easy to rectifyThe federal exchange states many of which are deeply opposed to the law are in a precarious position too Republican governors and state lawmakers could find themselves taking the blame if millions of their citizens are suddenly cut off from coverage States could still establish their own exchanges ensuring that their citizens receive subsidies but that could be a lengthy expensive and politically difficult process So that means states may look to possible workarounds to establishan exchange in minimal time and cost The statelevel response will depend though on the details of the courts decision and whatever direction comes from Congress or the Obama administrationWhich states would be affectedThe challenge is only to the subsidies in states that didnt set up their own marketplaces so residents of 16 states and the District of Columbia wouldnt see their financial assistance taken away if the government loses In the following map from the Kaiser Family Foundation residents of states with Federallyfacilitated Marketplaces and StatePartnership Marketplaces as labeled below could lose the subsidiesThis case marks the third time the ACA has been before the Supreme Court since it was enacted five years ago In 2012 the court narrowly upheld the individual mandate the requirement for most Americans to have health insurance while also ruling that the federal government couldnt force states to expand their Medicaid programs And last year the court ruled that the government couldnt require closely held businesses to offer their employees contraceptive coverage against their religious objectionsHow will the court rule this timeThats always hard to predict Four justices from the courts conservative wing were ready to throw out the entire law three years ago but Chief Justice John Roberts found a backdoor way to uphold the individual mandate It only takes four Supreme Court judges to accept a case though we dont know which ones opted to pick up King v Burwell and some observers were surprised that the court accepted this challenge as quickly as it did Either way its thought that Roberts or Justice Anthony Kennedy could provide the swing votes this timeOral arguments beganWednesday at 10 am and have now ended Within days of the argument the justices will likely meet privately to discuss and vote on the case However the court isnt expected to release its decision until late June before the justices break for the summer And no dont expect a decision to leak before the justices announce it from the bench
