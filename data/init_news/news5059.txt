Employers hired more workers in March even as the number of job openings fell slightly the Labor Department said TuesdayThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey points to a stronger labor market two months ago than another government report suggested FridayLabor said last week that employers added a net 85000 jobs in March including hiring and layoffs as payroll growth sputtered amid frigid weather and a pullback in drilling by oil producers among other factors That was the lowest total since June 2012 Job gains rebounded to 223000 in AprilTuesdays JOLTS report provides a more granular view of employee movements and shows a more encouraging picture The number of hires for example increased by 56000 to about 51 millionHiring increased in retail professional and business services and leisure and hospitality It declined in construction manufacturing and education and health servicesPart of the reason net job gains were weak is that layoffs and discharges also picked up rising by 105000 or 62 to 18 million At least some of those job cuts were in the oil industry which continues to shed workers in response to low crude pricesMeanwhile about 28 million Americans quit their jobs  the most since April 2008  up from 27 million in February A large number of quits is a sign of a dynamic labor market in which workers feel confident enough to leave one job for anotherOverall the report helps ease concerns that the weak 85000 job gain total for March was the start of a new trend says Barclays Capital economist Jesse Hurwitz Confidence remains intactLess encouraging is that job openings fell by 150000 to 5 million after hitting a 14year high in February But economist Daniel Silver of JPMorgan Chase notes that openings were still up about 18 from the yearago periodAnother measure of the labor markets progress is that there were 17 unemployed workers for each job opening in March down sharply from a high of 67 in 2009That shows the labor market is continuing to tighten aiding job seekers though at a slower pace than last year Hurwitz says He expects job gains to pick up to a solid monthly average of 200000 to 225000 for the rest of 2015 That would mark an uptick from the 184000 monthly pace in the first quarter but a slowdown from last years brisk clip of 260000Last week Labor said that employers added 223000 jobs in April
