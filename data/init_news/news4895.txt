Trumps campaign for celebrity Like junk food will Trump leave us empty and wanting more By Neal Gabler Posted on November 1 2016 by Neal Gabler It is a clich by now that Donald Trump has run a reality show campaigna series of gaffes surprises outrages weirdnesses explosions revelations and just every other ingredient that comprise the popular TV genre of faux authenticity On reality TV the subjects are seldom artists or entertainers or high achievers in any field They are personalities Their roles are their lives which creates a Mbius strip What do the Kardashians actually do besides being on their show which has of course generated all sorts of commercial opportunities that almost make it seem as if they are doing something What is their talent other than the talent for selfpromotion All of this was anticipated 54 years ago by historian Daniel Boorstin in The Image  in which he defined a celebrity as someone who is known for being wellknown In a previous post  I discussed how this applied to Trump who seems a hollow man except for his fame But I am not sure that Boorstins tautology clever as it is is really accurate I would submit that celebrity isnt a status nor is it a media anointment I think celebrity is actually a narrative form played out in the medium of life and then broadcast by the traditional and now social media One earns celebrityto the extent that you can call it earnedby keeping ones narrative going You lose your celebrity not when you lose fame or attention your wellknownness but when you lose your narrative which is what got you the attention in the first place Donald Trump is the first celebrity candidate in both Boorstins sense and mineBoorstins because Trump is less a builder of edifices than a slapperofhisnameonotherpeoples edifices He is literally known for being wellknown And in mine because Trump has spent the better part of his life providing narratives to the press to feed its insatiable appetite for gossip and his desire for attention There are many ways in which Trump is a unique presidential aspirant but chief among them may be this He is the first candidate who ran for president to feed his celebrity The entire campaign is a plot pointa means to a larger end which is not the presidency but keeping his celebrity afloat Relevance is an issue for all of us but especially for a 70yearold man who is accustomed to the spotlight I thought of this when The New York Times ran two pieces this week One was the first of a series based on interviews with Trump conducted by biographer Michael DAntonio and given to The Times by him What the interviews reveal is that Trumps primary obsession is a fear of losing his fame In the interviews Trump reviles Arsenio Hall  a former talk show host and onetime Celebrity Apprentice contestant  Dead as a doornail Dead as dog meat Trump eulogized The other article that struck me was one about how Trump used appearances on TV shows and in films As the Times piece about Trumps Hollywood connections tells it he began talking about running for president as early as 1988 Why Trump didnt have any overriding sense of national mission He doesnt have one even now Clearly his ongoing threedecadeslong flirtation with the presidency was just a plot twista way of juicing the narrative when it was flagging In that sense it was no different than his affair with Marla Maples his feud with Rosie ODonnell his nonstop lawsuits and everything else The presidency was a publicity stunt It still is Viewed that way nearly everything Trump does Politics as I have written many times has long been integrated with entertainment The devices of the latter serve the ends of the former and this has especially served conservatives The XFiles fed conservative paranoia 24 This post was first published on BillMoyerscom Neal Gabler is an author of five books and the recipient of two LA Times Book Prizes Time magazines nonfiction book of the year USA Today
