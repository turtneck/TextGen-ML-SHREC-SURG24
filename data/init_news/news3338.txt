The GOP presidential race seems to have come down to just two men Donald Trump and Sen Ted Cruz RTexasBut polling shows the candidate with the best chance of beating Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is Ohio Gov John KasichEven after his loss in Wisconsin to Cruz Trump remains the leader for the GOP nomination Barring something unexpected Trump should be the delegate leader going to the GOP conventionMeanwhile both men want Ohio Gov John Kasich to drop out because they believe they can win his delegatesTrump for his part argues that Kasich has lost every race so far except his home state of OhioHeres the problem with Kasich First of all I think he happens to take votes away from me I dont think he should be staying the real estate mogul saidBut even though hes a very distant third in delegates Kasich is still polling the best against Clinton the likely Democratic nomineeTrumps weakness is not only a high unfavorable rating  above 60 percent  but that polls have shown he has trailed Clinton in 11 of 12 target states that will determine the outcome in NovemberAccording to RealClearPolitics Poll Averages Trump does the worst against Clinton with the former state secretary leading him by an average of nearly 11 The thirdplace GOP candidate Kasich does best leading Clinton by six while Cruz trails her by threeMeanwhile Kasich has shown no sign hes ready to roll overDonald Trump said I need to get out of the race because I am getting his voters Well Ive got news for him  I am going to get a heck of a lot of his voters the Ohio governor told supportersBut how accurate is the polling that shows Kasich would do the best against ClintonKarlyn Bowman a public opinion analyst at the American Enterprise Institute cautions that these polls arent necessarily accurate because its still a long way until the November electionPolls have very little predictive value about national contests at this early stage she said They usually arent very reliable until about 100 days out from a campaignBut none of that is stopping the feisty Kasich He may be way down in the delegate numbers but hes still spoiling for a fightIm not a marshmallow or a pin cushion You wanna take a whack at me Lets get it on he saidSources say Kasichs strategy is to remain alive until a contested convention hoping for 500 delegates or more and then win over the other convention delegates with a positive messageAs crazy as it sounds some Republican insiders have said Kasich just might be able to pull it off
