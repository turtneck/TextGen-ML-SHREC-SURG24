Trumps Camp Manager DESTROYS Hillary By Pointing Out 1 Thing We All Missed Posted on October 30 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Fox News Host left Trumps Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway right From the moment the FBI announced theyre investigating Hillary Clinton again her ship of supporters quickly became lighter with people bailing out to protect themselves from being associated with her as a criminal Donald Trumps campaign couldnt have asked for better vindication that the witch could soon be incarcerated but the Republican candidates campaign manager just put the final nail in Clintons coffin In the wake of this latest development that could save Western civilization Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News to discuss it but she delivered more than viewers were expecting In a statement that didnt just decimate Hillarys campaign she brought the entire Clinton family down with it in one perfectly stated sentence When the FBI cracks a case back open that they had previously closed theres a legitimate reason to be terrified for the outcome of that investigation and its almost guaranteed to end in incarceration Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom validated this when he said after the announcement that the final bomb is about to drop on Hillary within the next ten days Adding to everything coming back to haunt Hillary since Friday is what Conway said on Fox News What we are reminded of is this cloud of corruption that always follows Hillary Clinton and we are having this entire conversation about a renewed FBU investigation because Hillary Clinton did what she always does put Hillary firstwe can never get the stench and the stain of the Clintons off if us it turns out Call it karma or the combined forces of WikiLeaks James OKeefe and now the FBI who are all working together to bleach this stain from the White House but things just arent looking good for Hillary who had it coming Hopefully the FBI who failed the American people after the first investigation that ended with her still being able to run for president make good on that mistake by actually arresting her after round two The investigation now is entirely different than the first considering the fact that it was reopened For that reason alone Hillary shouldnt feel comfortable about the outcome
