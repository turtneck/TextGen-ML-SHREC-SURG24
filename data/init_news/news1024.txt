On Thursday night Donald Trump finally acknowledged an obvious proven fact President Obama was born in the United States Or rather Trumps campaign said that he acknowledged it in a statement that was itself riddled with falsehoodsHillary Clintons campaign first raised this issue to smear thencandidate Barack Obama in her very nasty failed 2008 campaign for President the statement begins Thatsuntrue  and its been factchecked any number of times In 2011 Politico outlined the origins in May our fact checkers dubbed it ridiculousThis type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook As usual however Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer the statement continues Again Clinton wasnt looking for an answer to the nonquestion of where Barack Obama was born because her campaign wasnt pressing the issue Even before the release of Obamas longform birth certificate an announcement of Obamas birth was found in a Honolulu newspaper His 2008 campaign had released a statement of live birth demonstrating where he was born Anyone who asked the question for whatever reason had the answer in front of them if they chose to see itEven the MSNBC show Morning Joe admits that it was Clintons henchmen who first raised this issue not Donald J Trump the statement goes on Whether or not someone on Morning Joe said it  a show we will note that has spent an awful lot of time of late disparaging Trump  that doesnt make it trueIn 2011 Mr Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate it reads Mr Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised This is a remarkable pair of sentences Terming the incident ugly and saying hes resolved it is a bit like a person intentionally running someone over dumping them outside a hospital and then asking for a letter of commendation for wrapping things up so neatly The incident was fostered and nurtured by Trump in the spring of 2011 who used his position of celebrity to draw attention to it  as part of his first exploration of running for president It was only when Obama first released his full birth certificate and then mocked Trump at the White House Correspondents Association dinner that year that Trump seemed to drop the issueThe Trump team tries to spin that as a win Inarguably Donald J Trump is a closer Having successfully obtained President Obamas birth certificate when others could not Mr Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States the statement continuesThis compresses an awful lot of time As I wrote last week Trump continued to raise questions about Obamas birthplace for years after the release of the birth certificate At a news conference immediately afterward Trump said that hopefully the issue was resolved He then encouraged Sheriff Joe Arpaios quixotic attempt to prove the birth certificate a forgery which was of course unsuccessfulIn 2015 he said I dont know when challenged on the subject In January when the subject came up he told CNNs Wolf Blitzer Who knows That was eight months agoThe statement then moves into a campaign sales pitch Mr Trump is now totally focused on bringing jobs back to America defeating radical Islamic terrorism taking care of our veterans introducing school choice opportunities and rebuilding and making our inner cities safe again That last point is important Its part of Trumps sales pitch to black voters And lest you think that Trumps outreach to black voters didnt play a role in this the campaign made clear to BusinessWeeks Joshua Green that it didIt seems hard to believe that this statement will do much to assuage those voters concerns After all this isnt an apology for Trumps birtherism its a rationalization for it  and not a very good oneWhats more a critical part of the Trump campaigns statement is the signature it bears Jason Miller Senior Communications Advisor Clearly we can take Mr Millers word as the word of the candidate right
