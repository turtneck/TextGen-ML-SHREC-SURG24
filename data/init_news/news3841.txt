Posted on August 16 2013 by Dr Eowyn  143 Comments Jonathan Foster l Mona Nelson r Would the media report this if Foster wore a hoodie We couldnt escape the medias 247 coverage of the death of 17yearold 5 11 black teen Trayvon Martin and the trial of his shooter halfHispanic George Zimmerman But have you heard or seen news about a 44yearold black woman named Mona Nelson who is on trial for the murderbyblowtorch of a 12yearold white Texas boy Jonathan Foster Even worse Nelson committed the murder more than 2 years ago on Christmas Eve 2010  but wed heardseen NOTHING about this Thats because in Obamas America blacks now enjoy black skin privilege and Big Media simply turn a blind eye to black crimes especially blackonwhite crimes As recounted by the UKs Daily Mail  12yearold Foster was reported missing from his home on Christmas Eve 2010 after his mother Angela Davis said she had received a strange call at her workplace from a gruffsounding woman Davis initially told police her boy was with a babysitter But she later admitted that he was home alone The boys burned body was discovered on December 28 in a roadside ditch in Houston Texas  not far from where he lived Mona Nelson told local KTRK TV that a member of Jonathans family had given her 20 to dump a plastic container on Christmas Eve She said she was drunk on vodka and didnt know what was inside the container But police revealed that Jonathans burned body had not been discovered in a plastic container but in a ditch Police also say Nelsons truck was spotted on surveillance footage dumping something in the ditch where the boys body was found In addition investigators discovered evidence at Nelsons apartment that allegedly links her to the crime including burned carpet and twine similar to that used to bind Jonathans hands While denying she had killed Jonathan insisting Im not a monster I have five grandkids and I love kids Nelson admitted having a cutting torch that she claims she used in her job as a welder But police say she used the torch to burn the boys body Jonathans home in Houston Texas Cynthia Cisneros reports for KTRK on December 30 2010 that police revealed more about Jonathans abduction and murder at a news conference Police believe the boy was home alone on Christmas Eve and was killed and his body dumped on that very same day Nelson admitted to dumping Jonathans badly burned body in northeast Houston off of East Hardy but she denied killing the child But surveillance cameras near where Jonathans body was found showed Nelson to have lied HPD Captain David Gott said around 6pm Christmas Eve surveillance video showed a silver truck pull up to a ditch outside of a building on East Hardy A person whom neighbors and family identified as Nelson can be seen getting out of the truck taking a body out of the bed of the truck and placing it in on the ground Nelson also drives a similar truck Mona Nelsons apartment When authorities searched Nelsons apartment in northwest Houston they found a wealth of evidence that showed Jonathans body was burned at Nelsons residence as well as the tools torches and welding tools used to burn the boy Authorities say Nelson is a maintenance worker who works with tools and torches Authorities believe Jonathan was taken there killed and burned beyond recognition the same day within hours Twine used to tie Jonathan was also found inside Nelsons home Jonathans burnt body was identified by his dental records A next door neighbor Rita Jackson said Nelson was there while Jonathans family was looking for him on Christmas Eve Yeah she was just sitting there looking at what was going on Police also said they believe Nelson is a a predator who has done this before and that they dont believe her brutality begins with Jonathan The horrible details of Jonathans murder were too much for several detectives who struggled to keep from crying There are few cases that impact homicide detectives  this is one of them said HPD Homicide Detective Mike Miller  whod interviewed Nelson and held back tears as he described her She is a cold soulless murderer who showed an absolute lack of remorse in taking the life of Jonathan Foster She decided when the time was right and she swooped down and took him when she saw the time was right and she saw an opportune moment Ive worked in Homicide Division 14 years and this is the worst case Ive been a part of  an innocent 12 year old who everybody says was happy outgoing and wellliked by everyone in the neighborhood Its an absolute tragedy Mona Nelson l Jonathan Foster r KTRK reports that on August 12 2013 the trial of Mona Nelson for the murder of Jonathan Foster finally began in a courtroom in Houston Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty Nelson has asked for a judge instead of a jury to decide the verdict According to Donald Joy of ClashDailycom   Nancy Grace dropped the story as soon as she realized it was a black woman murdering a little white boy The media have avoided the story like the plague never once looking into whether it was a hate crime The original local news report has been removed Suspect has sought and received legal counsel from local leadership of the New Black Panther Party No story here folks Move along  See also  Nancy Grace makes racist slur about Zimmerman  Ht FOTMs TPR and joworth
