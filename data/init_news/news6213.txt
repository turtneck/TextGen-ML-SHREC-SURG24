Two of the countrys most powerful and politically influential labor unions are backing President Obama in the recent court challenge to his 2014 executive action on illegal immigration saying they support the presidents effort because undocumented workers need more workplace protection and their participation helps the US economyThe AFLCIO and the National Education Association on Monday each filed socalled amicus briefs in a federal appeals court case in which Texas and 26 other states are challenges the presidents 2014 memorandum on illegal immigrationThe memorandum essentially expands work authorization and delayeddeportation programs for illegal immigrants And it provides similar opportunities for the parents of US citizens or legal permanent residentsThe AFLCIOs 36page brief essentially argues that Texas lacks the socalled legal standing to challenge the memorandum and that the administration didnt violate procedural requirements in issuing the orderHowever the union also makes very clear its interest in the outcome of the proceedingsFirst through existing collective bargaining relationships AFLCIO affiliates represent many undocumented workers in workplaces throughout the country according to the brief by the AFLCIO the countrys bigger union collective with 56 unions representing roughly 12 million workers and retired workersUnion lawyers argue such workers have substantive protection under labor and employment law but not to a full range of remedies when such laws are violatedSuch workers are not entitled to back pay under the National Labor Relations Act and are vulnerable to employer retaliation if they complain about violations the lawyers argueSecondly this lack of legal remedies and vulnerability to retaliation creates an incentive for some unscrupulous employers to employ large numbers of undocumented workers at substandard wages and working conditions they continue in the brief Lawabiding employers must compete with these employers making it more difficult for AFLCIO affiliate unions to raise wages and improve working conditionsMany critics of Obamas plans to reform federal immigration law without a vote in Congress say he is providing amnesty to those who have entered the US illegally They also say his plans  backed by Americans companies and labor unions  take away jobs from US citizensThe labor unions like Democratic politicians have decided to rely on importing the citizens of other nations to gain power in this one Of course this cancels out jobs and votes for Americans a GOP congressional aide told FoxNewscom on SaturdayIn 2004 the AFLCIO spent 51 million in lobbying and gave 87 million in politicalrelated contributions with no money going to Republicans according to OpenSecretsorgThe entire case Texas et al v USA started in February when a federal judge granted the states a preliminary injunction which temporarily stops Obamas 2014 plan from going into effectThe US government wants the injunction lifted so Obamas actions can proceed but meanwhile has appealed the Texas court ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans in which the amicus briefs have been filedObamas actions would prevent as many as 5 million people who are in the US illegally from being deportedThe 27 states also argue that the 2014 action is unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement health care and educationThe injunction is intended to stall Obamas actions while the lawsuit progresses through the courtsObamas orders to expand a program that protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the US illegally as children was set to take effect Feb 18 The part that would extend deportation protections to the parents of US citizens and permanent residents was slated to begin on May 19The 44page amicus brief from the American Federation of Teachers includes seven other groups including ASPIRA  the largest national Latino organization in the countryThe document largely makes the case that all children in the US should have access to education for their psychological emotional and physical wellbeing and that children in families in which at least one member is an illegal immigrant should not be forced to live apart from their parentsA coalition of groups including the Service Employees International Union the secondlargest public service union and a big supporter of Democratic political candidates and organizations filed an amicus brief in the original caseThe November 20 2014 executive action on immigration would have beneficial effects on the US economy and US workers the brief states in part Temporary work authorization for those immigrants who are eligible for deferred action will raise not only their wages but the wages of all Americans which will in turn increase government tax revenue and create new jobsThe Associated Press contributed to this report
