CNN The Democratic candidates for president gathered in New Hampshire Thursday for their fifth debate and CNNs Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the testThe team of reporters researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate selecting key statements and rating them either true mostly true true but misleading false or its complicatedAs in past debates Hillary Clinton took on Bernie Sanders voting record on gun control legislation Thursday night it came up regarding a debate over who is the true progressive candidateClinton said If were going to get into labels I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity referring to Sanders voting recordSo regarding the Brady Bill what is Sanders recordThere were several votes in that bills evolution the first vote coming in 1991 Sanders voted against a draft that required a sevenday waiting period for background checks A subsequent version of the bill returned to the House and Sanders voted against it Then in 1993 two more drafts returned to the House and Sanders voted against those Finally later in 1993 the Brady Bill finally passed but without Sanders voteSanders has defended his votes saying that it constituted federal overreachSanders also added I am absolutely willing as Ive said for many many weeks if not months to take another look at that piece of legislationThough Sanders may have his reasons for voting against the Brady Bill Clintons claim that he voted against it five times is trueThe topic of big money influencing American politics was raised by Sanders who said it was undermining American democracyClinton attempted to distance herself from perceptions her campaign is influenced by Wall Street interests saying I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primaryIt was a refrain she used in Wednesday nights town hall too Everybody that I know who looks at whats happening in this campaign sees the same thing The Wall Street interests the money interests the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat meWall Street interests may be spending a lot in support of her opponents but of all the candidates Clinton is the leading recipient of donations from individuals in the securities and investments industryClinton implies that Wall Street has no fondness for her But given that her campaign received 29 million from securities and investment donors the most of all the candidates Republican or Democrat our verdict is falseClinton accused Sanders of not telling voters the truth about his proposals particularly his Medicareforall planI am not going to talk about big ideas like singlepayer and then not level with people about how much it will cost A respected health economist said these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year Im not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes and not mean it Clinton saidActually according to that health economist Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Sanders universal health care plan would cost nearly 14 trillion a yearBut Sanders has recently been upfront about how much it will cost He released Friedmans assessment alongside his plan for Medicareforall last monthAlso Sanders has acknowledged that the plan calls for a new 22 income tax on all Americans and a 62 levy on employers as well as additional taxes on the wealthy The Vermont senator however argues that ultimately middle class Americans will save money under his health plan because they will no longer pay premiums to private insurersReality Check Clinton on classified information in her emailsClinton claimed she never sent or received any classified material when she was secretary of state and the State Department is retroactively classifying information in her emailsIt is true that all the classifications weve seen in emails released by the State Department have been retroactive meaning the State Department determined there was a need to classify the information as they were preparing the emails for release and so they upgraded it to classifiedThe State Department also maintains that none of Clintons official emails of the 85 reviewed and released so far contained information that was marked as classified when it was sentAll of the classified redactions the public has seen so far have been the result of retroactive classifications but the investigation into whether the information was classified during her time in office is ongoing For that reason our verdict is its complicatedDuring a backandforth about health care Sanders pointed to his role in Congress during the creation of the Affordable Care ActI am on the Health Education Labor Committee That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act The idea that I would dismantle health care in America while were waiting to pass a Medicareforall is just not accurate Sanders said adding later I helped write that bill but by moving forward rallying the American people I do believe we should have health care for allSanders did indeed sit on the Senate panel that helped craft the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare and used his post to advocate loudly for a singlepayer system in which insurance is provided by the government to all citizensSanders wasnt alone many liberal Democrats pushed for such a provision when crafting comprehensive health care reform But the singlepayer option proved to be divisive and opposed by most RepublicansThat led to the development of alternative mechanisms to get more Americans insured the establishment of marketplaces for Americans to purchase health insurance and an individual mandate requiring all Americans obtain coverageWhen Sanders preferred version of the bill failed to come up for a vote he diverted his focus instead to securing the inclusion of billions of dollars in funding to community health centersBut he remained skeptical of a bill that didnt include a singlepayer plan Indeed in the months leading up to a final vote on the bill Sanders voiced doubt that he could support the version that lacked such a system ultimately he did vote for the Affordable Care ActWhile Sanders played a major role in the debate over health care reform and helped craft an 11 billion inclusion into the final measure his claim to have helped write the measure misrepresents his part in creating the central pillars of ObamacareReality Check Sanders as the longest serving independent in the history of CongressSanders a Vermont independent stressed his longevity and independence on Thursday when he said I am the longest serving independent in the history of the United States CongressSanders was first elected to the House of Representatives as an independent from Vermont in 1990 and assumed office in January 1991 He won his Vermont Senate seat in 2006 As a result although he caucuses with the Democratic Party Sanders has been an independent in Congress for 25 yearsThis 25year tenure is indeed the longest of an independent member of CongressByrd was first elected to the House in 1932 as a Democrat He entered the Senate in 1965 and switched parties to become an independent in 1970 after a clash with the Democratic Party leadership in the runup to the 1972 presidential election He left office in 1983 giving him 13 years as an independentUnlike Byrd Davis who had been an associate justice of the Supreme Court and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln initially assumed office as an independent in 1877 and left office in 1883 giving him six years in Congress as an independentSanders 25 years in Congress is easily the longest span as an independentSanders threw an elbow at some of the countrys largest financial institutionsSix financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly 10 trillion equivalent to 58 of the gross domestic product of the United States of America That is a lot of money Sanders saidThe six largest financial institutions are JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as of September 2015 according to the Federal Reserve BankSo doing the math 9845804000000 assets  18128200000000 GDP 5431Accordingly the assets of the six largest institutions equal roughly 54 of the GDPReality Check Sanders endorsed by New Hampshire newspaperAsked by MSNBCs Rachel Maddow why his campaign put up an ad insinuating that he was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph Sanders said that his campaign was careful never to say he was endorsed by a newspaperAs I understand it we did not suggest we had the endorsement of the newspaper Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did So we never said never said that somebody a newspaper endorsed us that did not What we did say is Blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper Sanders saidHowever in the next clip the ad said that The Valley News of Lebanon New Hampshire endorsed Sanders That paper did not endorse SandersThe Clinton campaign and factcheckers hit him throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday for the spot and the Sanders campaign eventually revised the ad to remove the endorsed languageDiscussing the need for reforms improving access to care at the Department of Veterans Affairs Sanders said that a group funded by the Koch brothers is promoting the privatization of the agency An organization called Concerned Veterans for America is sanctioned by the influential conservative siblings Sanders saidWayne Gable CVAs chief executive and trustee is also a board member of a Kochbacked organization called Freedom Partners according to a 2013 tax filing That filing lists CVA as the business name of an affiliated organization called Vets for Economic Freedom Trust The filing states the tax exempt group had 3 million in contributions and a nearly equal amount of expenditures money allegedly spent advocating for policies that will preserve the freedom and liberty that veterans and their families so proudly fought and sacrificed to defendThe group produced an antiObamacare web video in 2013 Government Health Care Equals Disaster suggesting that the scandal at the VA was a prelude to a looming disaster prompted by the passage of the Affordable Care ActUnfortunately the CVA has a glossy yet glitchy website and there is not much documentation of the groups financials and its staff post2013 According to the Guidestar charity finder the organization has not yet filed its IRS 990 form for 2014 Furthermore its affiliated group Vets for Economic Freedom Trust is not a verified exempt organization according to the IRS exempt check search toolSanders is correct in describing the groups Koch lineage and its intent Our verdict is true
