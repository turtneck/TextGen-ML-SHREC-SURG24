25 Views November 10 2016 GOLD  KWN King World News For people who are worried about Druckenmiller selling his gold Before we get to Druckenmiller selling his gold look at the collapse in the 30year bond market as interest rates continue to surge A picture is worth a thousand words 30Year US Treasuries Continue To Plunge Today Hitting New Lows By Bill Fleckenstein President Of Fleckenstein Capital November 10  King World News   I am going to stick with yesterdays format and try to make sense of the market motion then turn to the action lower in the column and Im doing this in response to all the questions Ive been getting about how various markets can possibly do what theyre doing ie why are they behaving as they are IMPORTANT To find out which company Doug Casey Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 181 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world  CLICK HERE OR BELOW Sponsored Great Again Well That Didnt Take Long In the first place lets be clear this is all guesswork and a lot of the motion is noise and the overlapping of extremely shortterm time horizons with longer ones Be that as it may I will give it my best shot What we have seen over the last 48 to 72 hours is a massive psychological seachange  albeit almost certainly temporary  from overwhelming pessimism to overwhelming optimism regarding the prospects for the US economy and all things American That has collided with fumes from QE here and actual QE from other counties Said differently a massive change in psychology has collided with free money to spark euphoria something that can generally only last a short time As that begins to take place people begin to factor in all the things that can go right and very few of the things that can go wrong though they dont handicap the amount of time it takes to accomplish said things nor the degree of difficulty in accomplishing them For instance if Congress magically passed a 1 trillion infrastructure project it would take quite a good deal of time to get the permits and design what needs to happen before the first shovels hit the dirt so to speak Not to say that the consequences of doing the project wouldnt be economically positive but there is quite a long lag between planning to do it and actually starting it That matters because at the moment the multiple on the stock market is very high north of 20 and it is where it is because of zeropercent rates and the ridiculous TINA rationale As rates rise that tends to put pressure on valuations while it potentially causes some TINAdriven buyers to think twice especially if they start to lose money Given my belief that the bond bull market is finished and that a Trump administration would likely be very unfriendly to bonds interest rates are headed higher something that could really be exacerbated if peoples perceptions about inflation change Buy and Hold On The bottom line is given the valuation of the stock market and the likely decline in bonds it will be rather difficult for the stock market to trade on the potential for good news long enough for the good news to hit Therefore it is quite likely this could be the final equity market blowoff however far it may go sort of matching the bond blowoff of last summer There is some precedent for just this sort of stock market action as something similar occurred right after Ronald Reagan was elected I touched on this yesterday and please dont send me any emails telling me Trump is not Reagan I totally understand that ie that we have a potential seachange in psychology from a very negative macro outlook for the US economy to one that is expected to be better Again that doesnt necessarily translate to higher equity prices due to the impact of rising rates on the current level of valuations to consider Nonetheless after Reagan was elected there was about a twoweek 10 rally in the SP which then reversed and a substantial decline ensued I believe if and when the stock market rally finally is perceived to have ended we could see a lot of destruction very fast given the brittle structure that I have talked about ad nauseam And of course a reversal in the stock market would probably impact the dollar and metals and we might even get a kneejerk reaction in bonds Taking Some You Time Nearly all markets are currently in motion so it is best to step back try to figure out what is really going on think about what you are looking for that would cause you to change any positions you have but avoid taking any action unless you are fairly certain about what is happening and why Beneath the surface of the stock market one can see that tech is being sold that sector especially FANG has the highest multiples and therefore is the most vulnerable to a change in the bond market plus a strong dollar hurts them while Trump plays are being purchased I dont see how the market can readjust itself and really hold together because I dont think there will be enough buyers of tech to accommodate the sellers and thus the market overall could easily come under pressure fairly soon but we will just have to see how that plays out WallStreetcom Basically while were in this period of quasi euphoria the market for the moment is a concept stock like biotech and concept stocks dont generally bother having fundamentals nor do people worry about them until they do and then they decline drastically as a consequence of basically being binary With all of that out of the way I will turn to the action Overnight the SPOOs were about 075 higher and the market itself was higher in the early going We then got a quick reversal both lower then back higher at least for the Dow the SP was up fractionally The Nasdaq however kept leaking By days end the former added over 1 while the latter lost 075 Away from stocks the euphoria playbook was in use and all the outside markets were very volatile with green paper quite strong while oil lost 1 and bonds were initially strong then were beat up again The 10year lost another 8 basis points as yields have now risen from 150 to 212 in five weeks Precious metals gave up an overnight rally and were lower Part of that was exacerbated by Stan Druckenmiller who said hed sold his gold into the electionnight rally I have covered that all in Ask Fleck After going negative silver climbed back into positive territory gaining 03 while gold lost 15 Included below are six questions and answers from the QAs with Bill Fleckenstein Bonus QA Question Hi Fleck  Hope all is well and you are enjoying the interesting times we live in now Forget Trump  lets talk about the Indian PM who has overnight banned large currency notes and is forcing people to deposit them in lieu of newer notes I feel that this will help to thwart black money nearly 2 Trillion and terrorist activities fake notes etc and will also curb real estate prices But this could change how people view Gold even more I suspect many Indians now are conducting transactions in Gold or Crypto currencies such as Bitcoin which could elevate Gold demand Import of gold in the form of coins and medallions is prohibited Ah well another interesting bit of info in the ever changing times we live in Narendra Modi Bans Indias Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption Enjoy Answer from Fleck  I suspect this will boost gold demand after the initial shakeout in a scramble for cash by real estate guys How can anyone trust the government at all after this Question Fleck I find it odd that SLV has not broken its Tuesday low 11816 while GLD has Makes me believe that the down move in GLD is just noise unless or until SLV closes below the Nov 8th low Is this how you analyze price movement in the precious metals complex that is waiting for all assets to show a confirmation in movement Thanks Answer from Fleck  Silver is benefitting from being an industrial metal too That is part of the concept that is working right now Question Hey Bill 1 In theory Trump should be good for main street and I am wondering if this will cause inflation to tick higher My inclination is that it will 2 In the overnight Gold futures market it seems to be trading strong and then loses that strength when the US opens My guess is that more spec longs are unwinding and this should bring open interest down to a more normal level I know you dont regard the COT data as too meaningful but if Gold holds above 1200 while spec long open interest declines would this be a good set up for the next leg higher Thanks Answer from Fleck  1 Yes plus psychology is changing 2 There are many scenarios that could be positive not just yours Druckenmiller Sells His Gold Question As far as I know Soros does trade his positions whereas Druckenmiller keeps his positions for some time What do you make of Stan selling all his gold Speaking to CNBC this morning fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller  who had been pessimistic about the US economy said that he is now quite quite optimistic on the US economy following the election of Presidentelect Donald Trump Its as hopeful as Ive been in a long time I sold all my gold on the night of the election Why All the reasons I owned it for the last couple of years seem to be ending namely expectations that inflation is now set to spike forcing money out of safe assets  like gold and Treasurys  and into the dollar Answer from Fleck  Druck is a trader and investor Please see the other post on this topic Question In India the gold prices have doubled in few cities due to the currency note issue Wall Street and the moron Drunkenmiller does not have a clue Chinese demand will also accelerate due to yuan fall Gold demand is spiking up in Asia all over Out of touch Wall Street can control the gold prices only for few days If this continues I will load up gold bars here in America to sell in India and rest of the Asia There are enough rich people in India who want gold Maybe Stan should sell any coins left over to me Answer from Fleck  You make worthwhile points about demand but in the short run they can be trumped by the herd for a little while Question InterestingI dont recall gold miners caring a hoot when Druckenmiller declared that he was long gold Now that he says hes out of gold they obediently pay attention Answer from Fleck  LOL for this five minutes  To subscribe to Bill Fleckensteins fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE KWN has now released the
