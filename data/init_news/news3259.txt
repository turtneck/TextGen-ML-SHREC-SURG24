Like his thirdparty forefathers Gary Johnson gets irate when you call him a spoiler Were giving people a chance to vote for something as opposed to the lesser of two evils the Libertarian presidential nomineeshouted last week at a Bloomberg Politics reporter who asked about his invisible path to victoryIn truth there are only two reasonable outcomes for Johnsons longshot campaign neither of which ends with him in the White House In one scenario he is no more than a nuisance for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump an afterthought to either major partys march to victory In the other Johnsons campaign alters the contours of the presidential race drawing votes that would have otherwise gone to Trump or ClintonHis own view notwithstanding the Johnsonasspoiler scenario is highly plausible this yearIn both traditional battlegrounds and in states that would be safe terrain in a normal election year thirdparty protest votes have the chance offlipping resultsand electoral votesFor months the assumption has been that onetime Republican presidential candidate Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld both former Republican governors mightbe an attractive option for members of Trumps party resistant to their nominee and that remains true But this years spoiler threat is not justa oneparty worry Close to a month before Election Day Clinton and her campaign are anxious that Johnson along with Green Party nominee Jill Stein may look just as desirable to disenchanted members of her Democratic coalitionparticularly young votersas they do to RepublicansJohnson will be on the ballot in all 50 states this November Stein will be on it in all but six The name of an independent candidate antiTrump conservative Evan McMullin will be seen in a dozen states though others allow people to write it in All three candidates fell short of the polling criteria that would have put them on the stage at the first presidential debateand thus in living rooms of 84 million people But that doesnt change the number of voters who are unenthusedabout their majorparty choices this November No matter who wins next month Clinton and Trump have already made history as the most disliked nominees everBoth have comparably high unfavorable ratings nearing 60 percent and thatexplains why Johnson has been able to maintain solid poll numbers deep into the fall And the Clinton campaign has reason to be concernedNationwide polls show that Johnson supporters are a mixed bunch who tend to skew younger and more suburban with an equal representation from conservatives and liberalsa jumbled demographic profile that suggests the group may contain just as many Clinton doubters as Trump deserters For this reason Clintons highestprofile surrogates have hit the campaign trail with a new line of persuasion urging disaffectedlefties not to waste their ballot Last week President Barack Obama used a radio interview with Steve Harvey to brand thirdparty votes as a boon for Trump The same day it aired first lady Michelle Obama warned voters at a Clinton rally in Philadelphia that they will help swing an entire precinct for Hillarys opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustrationFor Clinton potential supporters most susceptible to the thirdparty lure are those most weakly bonded to the partythose members of the Obama coalition without much of a record voting in nonObama elections Among the Trump cohort thirdparty voters are more likely to be gleaned from base Republicans who reject their partys unconventional standardbearerJohnson has received endorsements from several conservative newspaper editorial boards includingtheDetroit News the New Hampshire Union Leader and the Chicago Tribune which dubbed this election a moment to rebuke the Republican and Democratic parties USA Today which normally abstains from presidential endorsements chose to disendorse Trump but refused to throw support behind Clinton tacitly opening a door for JohnsonNot all thirdparty pressures are equal in the Electoral College Some states have long histories of strong independent leaningsamong them are Alaska Utah and Johnsons home of state of New Mexico Johnson is polling strongly in all three And while Alaska and Utah are liable to stay their usual colorNew Mexico traditionally blue is surprisingly close at this point the result of Johnson siphoning votes from ClintonBut the bigger questions are inswing states and stateson the cusp of becoming competitive battlegrounds Thirdparty candidates essentially take votes out of circulation lowering the win number The spoiler problem arises when those votes come disproportionately from one sideQuantifyingthe Democrats nightmare scenario in which support for Johnson and Stein grows to a significant enough level by say drawing a quarter of Clintons getoutthevote targets and an eighth of her base Clinton could lose strongholds such as Washington and PennsylvaniaPlaces like Florida Ohio North Carolina and Nevada would become safely RepublicanIf conversely the third parties garner enough votes mostly by flipping a quarter ofRepublicansbase and an eighth of theirgetoutthevote targets it would flip the most competitive battlegrounds back to blue while putting Montana Arkansas Indiana and even Oklahoma within Clintons reachIn 1992 Ross Perot scooped up nearly a third of the votes in Maine and Utah pushing majorparty candidates into third place while getting closer to 19 percent of the nationwide popular vote This year there is no indication that even Johnson and Stein combined could reach that level of support anywhere Independent candidates typically see support drop as Election Day nears because many voters appear to come around and settle for one of the major party candidates Still the unpopularity of both Clinton and Trump has helped Johnson poll as high as 13 percent in states such asColoradoJohnsons strength means that a significant part of these last several weekswill be spent playing a threesided persuasion game in which the goalis to scare wary voters into voting for the lesser of two evils rather than casting a protest vote On a macro level thats exactly why the Obamasand Bernie Sanders have all been out warning voters that a vote for a thirdparty candidate is a vote for Trump But communicating with these disaffected voters on a more granular level isdifficult because there is little targeting information available to help strategists pick out potential protest votes buried among their base and mobilization targets Even if campaigns could precisely identify these voters its hard to know if theywill turn to a third party or just stay homeBelow is an analysis of three states where third parties could make a big differenceDemocrats insist that theyre not worried about losing Colorado this November Loyal Democrats make up threefourths of the votes needed to win the state and a recent influx of Hispanics and millennials has broadened Clintons getoutthevote optionsTrumps low standing with Latino communities may alienate him from more than onefifth of Colorados population Additionally his campaign message which feeds on pessimism about the trajectory of American society may beless potent to those living theRocky Mountain lifestyleColorados cities are often listed amongthe nations happiest places to live Trumps appeals to economic insecurity are also probably better directed elsewhere as unemployment in the state is under 4 percent the lowest of any 2016 battleground state besides New Hampshire Religious unease with Trump presents him yet another source of worry in Colorado onefifth of the Republican base lives in the Colorado Springs area home to Focus on the Family and a hotbed for politically active ChristiansBut that doesnt make the thirdparty threat any less real Libertarianism has always been most prevalent out West and the growing number of young voters on Colorados voter rollsnearly a third of the states voters are under 35represent a large chunk of the electorate with little historical loyalty to either partyFor any campaign the key to a Colorado victory is its universe of persuadable voters which is more than four times larger than in Nevada the nearest battleground Among these persuadable group campaigns will find middleaged and educated residents of the Denver area theyllalso find voters who are promarijuana andprochoice Its with these groups that Johnson who may benefit from name recognition from his time as governor of neighboring New Mexico is polling best A recent CNNORC survey of Colorado shows the Libertarian with 13 percent support statewide most of it coming from selfidentified independentsAs Johnson works to expand that support his likeliest targets will be the nearly half of unreliable Democrats who are under the age of 35 Six out of 10 of the partys getoutthevote targets are likely to have college degrees and statistical models project 97 percent support among them for legal marijuana which was enacted four years agoClintons campaign will start worrying if thirdparty candidates start to attract more disenfranchised Democrats than irritated Republicans If say thirdparty candidates were drawing a combined 16 percent of the total vote by siphoning off a quarter of Clintons mobilization targets and oneeighth of her base Colorado would flip giving Trump anapproximate fourpointedgeThis year will be the first presidentialelection in which Colorado conducts its voting entirely by mail Nearly twothirds of the electorate is expected to cast ballots before Election Day one of the highest rates in the nation with six out of 10persuadable voters likely to commit to a candidate before November If Clinton is worried about dissension within her coalition she may want to delay her GOTV tacticsthe socalled chase programs that nudge voters to return their mail ballotsuntil shes had more time to sway themDuringa decade in which President Obama has significantly expanded the Democratic map into the South and West Missouri is the largest onetime battleground state to have moved safely into the Republican column Bill Clinton won there twice but population decline in urban areashas kept Missouri out of Democratic reach since Obama came within 3600 votes of winning in 2008 but did not even compete for Missouri four years later losing the state by 9 percentage points toMitt RomneyIn a twoway race Hillary Clinton would likely face a similar fate Her Democratic base is roughly 60 percentthe size of the one Missouris Republicans count on She could presumably turn out her entire mobilization list while swinging every single persuadable voter her way and still fall shortKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics Your guide to the

incursions on his right flank Trump barely eked out a victory in Missouris March 15 primary losing the states most educated and wealthy Republicans to Ted Cruz The 380000 Cruz votersamounting to onesixth of the general electoratemay represent Johnsons best chance to eat into the Republican coalitionMissouri evangelicals whom Trump lost in the primary by 16 percentage points makeapromising if unlikely audience for the Libertarian despite his partys traditional disdain for the politics of morality Johnson might be able topackage some of his smallgovernment positions like a ban on federal spending for abortions to exploit existing doubts about Trumps commitment to religious prioritiesRecent polls have Trump up by a comfortable nine points and Johnson in single digits But if Johnson were able to pull at least a quarter from Trumps GOP base and an eighth from his GOTV targetspushing him to 14 percent of the vote overallMissouri would become one of the nations tightest racesUnder normal circumstances New Mexico would be a pipe dream for Trump Democrats begin with a 145000voter head start over the Republican coalition in the state and New Mexicos small number of persuadable voters leaves the Trump campaign with few options to outmaneuver Clintons groundgame forces Thirdparty support could reach as high as almost a fifth of likely voters and Trump would still find the state difficult to winBut an early October poll by the Albuquerque Journal found that Clintons 10point lead in a headtohead with Trump in New Mexico shrinks to a slight 4point edge when thirdparty candidates are considered The reason Johnson the former twoterm Republican governor of the state is hauling in a massive 24 percent of likely voters That support is primarily made up of independent voters and appears to be evenly split among men and women while also pulling equally from both Republican and Democratic coalitionsClinton could possibly head off a Johnson challenge by locking up support among the Hispanic voters that make up 45 percent of her getoutthevote targets Trump on the other hand should probably worry mostabout losing votes to Johnson from within the majority of his base that is likely to have college degreesFor New Mexico to slip from Clintons grasp Johnson would have to winclose to a quarter of voters and pull a majority of them from theDemocraticranksTo do that hed need to tap more than a quarter of Clintons lessreliable mobilization targets as well as the equivalent of at least an eighth of her base voters without dipping too much into Trumps
