What do you think the response would be if a bunch of black people filled with rage and armed to the teeth took over a federal government installation and defied officials to kick them out Im pretty sure it wouldnt be waitandseeProbably more like pointandshootOr what if the occupiers were Mexican American They wouldnt be described with the semilegitimizing term militia harking to the days of the patriots And if the guntoting citizens happened to be Muslim heaven forbid there would be walltowall cable news coverage of the terrorist assault I can hear Donald Trump braying for bloodNot to worry however because the extremists who seized the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon on Saturday are white As such they are permitted to engage in a standoff with authorities who keep their distance lest there be needless loss of lifeSuch courtesy was not extended to Tamir Rice the 12yearold Cleveland boy who was playing with a toy gun in a park on Nov 22 2014 Within seconds of arriving on the scene police officer Timothy Loehmann shot the boy who died the next day Prosecutors led a grand jury investigation and announced last month that Loehmann would face no charges A perfect storm of human error was blamed and apparently storms cannot be held accountableSuch courtesy in fact is routinely denied to unarmed black men and boys who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time You know the litany of names  Michael Brown Eric Garner Freddie Gray And you know how these stories end Just weeks ago a Baltimore jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of the first of six officers charged with Grays death Another perfect storm I guessI probably sound cynical but in truth Im just weary And worriedJustice is supposed to be blind Race ethnicity and religion are not supposed to matter Yet were constantly reminded that these factors can make the difference between justifiable and unjustifiable killing  and between life and deathThe yahoos in Oregon are protesting the Bureau of Land Managements policies hardly a redbutton issue for most Americans The federal building they seized is in a wildlife refuge which means that by definition its in the middle of nowhere the nearest sizable city is Boise Idaho about 200 miles away The protesters guns pose more of a threat to bears than peopleSo no I dont think authorities have any immediate reason to blast their way into the woods with a column of armored vehicles But I would argue there was no good reason to do so on the streets of Ferguson Mo either Is the salient difference that the Oregon protesters are believed to be heavily armed If so what message does that send Does somebody need to found a Minority Rifle Association so that communities of color are given similar deferenceThe organizations name would have to be changed in a few decades anyway when whites in the United States cease to constitute a racial majority This inexorable demographic shift I believe helps explain why the world of politics seems to have gone insane of lateWhat I want is that African Americans Latino Americans Muslim Americans and other outsiders be seen as the Americans we are What I want is acknowledgment that we too have a stake in our democracy and its future course What I want is the recognition that no one can take back the country  which happens to be led by its first African American president  because it belongs to me as much as to youThese are not the sentiments were hearing in the presidential campaign though  at least not on the Republican side Following Trumps lead candidates are competing to sound angrier and more embittered Thats why I am so worriedYoud think there might be at least a few prominent voices on the right expressing horror and outrage at the wrongful killing of a 12yearold boy Youd think that Republicans running for president might find the time to condemn the armed takeover of federal property by zealots Yet all we hear is crickets chirpingThe GOP candidates have apparently concluded that voicing hope embracing change and broadening our concept of the American mainstream constitute a losing strategy They see Trumps success and mimic him in fostering a sense of beleaguered us vs menacing them This may be an effective way to pursue the nomination but its a terrible disservice to the countryRead more from Eugene Robinsons archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook You can also join him Tuesdays at 1 pm for a live QA
