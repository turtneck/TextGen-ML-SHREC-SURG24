Share This The Clinton Foundation and its foreign donors have been an area of concern should Hillary Clinton become president due to accusations of paytoplay scandals Knowing this Hillary gave her word that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign donations should she be elected president However a new leak just exposed her real plan for foreign donors and its not looking good Hillary Clinton Once again Hillary has landed herself in the middle of more scandalous activity With the FBI reopening her email and private server investigation and WikiLeaks continuously exposing her corruption she cant seem to catch a break  and she shouldnt Her long list of scandals continues to grow as should her nose after being busted lying to the American people yet again to manipulate her way into our White House According to a leaked memo Hillarys words mean nothing Although she promised that the Clinton Foundation would cease accepting foreign donations if she were to be elected president a leaked memo has exposed her real plans and proven that she didnt mean what she said Twofaced Hillary told the public one thing while her secret plan was for something much different Thanks to WikiLeaks the truth is again being revealed after the organization published an email that was sent to John Podesta the Clinton Campaign chair The email contained the leaked memo which appears to have been crafted by Cheryl Mills a Clinton aide who wrote I connected with HRC this am regarding the steps she will take with regard to the Foundation should she announce a decision to explore a run for the Presidency just days before Hillary announced her run for president Although shes said otherwise throughout her campaign Hillarys personal preference as indicated by the leaked memo dated April 7 2015 is for the foundation to continue accepting money from foreign governments The Daily Caller reports and this could mean bad news for Hillary as five FBI field offices are currently investigating her nonprofit foundation due to paytoplay allegations although the Department of Justice did their best to suppress investigations into the corrupt Clinton Foundation The leaked memo clearly shows that Hillary indicated to staffers that her personal preference is for the foundation to continue to accept money from foreign governments even if she is elected president  Whats worse the corrupt Clintons were hesitant to limit the foundations financial operations in any way as the memo says Hillary does not want to limit the Foundations ability to operate programs now or in the future adding  we dont want to close the door to unexpected opportunities  The memo goes on to mention a compromise option where it says they could say that the Foundation will not accept contributions from foreign governments unless that funding is part of an ongoing program or a disbursement for a completed negotiation However under that option the foundation would continue to accept money from Qatar despite Hillarys own admission that the country is financially supporting ISIS  The final option mentioned would mirror the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding agreement whereby the Foundation submits new foreign government contributions and those of a substantial size increase to an independent body eg White House State Department for review The obvious challenge with this is that there is no independent body to make that review However as The Daily Caller notes Hillary did not uphold her end of the 2008 Memorandum of Understanding MOU and even liberalleaning PolitiFact ruled the claim that Hillary acted in accordance with the 2008 MOU mostly false When is enough enough The Clinton crime family will never change their ways and their fake foundation is only a front for their shady deals The Clintons greed for money and power is endless and nothing  not even our laws  will stand in the way of Hillary and Bill as they grab as much of both as they can Theres only one place Hillary belongs while on this earth and thats not the Oval Office its a cinderblock cell After her time there is done she has a oneway ticket to hell where she probably hopes to overthrow the devil That is how evil corrupt and power hungry she is Her deceit and depravity know no bounds and she would even give the devil a run for his money Do you really want that kind of person to be our next president
