As the Clinton campaign turns its attention to South Carolina its drubbing in New Hampshire suggests Hillary Clintons feminist credentials simply dont appeal to young womenExplaining Hillary Clinton has long been a thriving subculture in American punditry After New Hampshire theres a new wrinkle Why are young women abandoning herAs a Wellesley College student in the late 1960s Hillary Rodham exemplified a brash new model of the young woman activist Her unscripted graduation speech blasting the commencement speaker  her former mentor and lone black United States senator Edward Brooke  drew national attentionBut this week Clinton lost most of the womens vote in her 22point defeat to Sen Bernie Sanders a rival she once led by 40 points in the polls and the losses cut deepest among young womenShe just doesnt seem as extremely truthful says Tayla Schipilliti a bridal consultant and student at Nashua Community College after voting in Merrimack NHEvidence for this view includes the whole email thing the videos circulating on social media sites that challenge Clintons claim to have landed in Bosnia in 1996 under sniper fire and stories Ms Schipillitis parents told her about how the Clintons treated people she says Like many in the firstinthenation primary she tried to follow the race including attending candidate events at her college and watching campaign videos on linePersonally I obviously support equal pay for woman and all that but just because thats her main stance and shes a woman I dont feel that I have to vote for her So I ended up voting for Bernie she saysNew Hampshire exit polls show Clinton coming up short in virtually every demographic group except for voters over the age of 65 or with incomes over 200000 Its important to note also that there are too few nonwhite voters in New Hampshire to register in the exit polls  a demographic that will be much more a factor in the next primary votes in South Carolina Nevada and March 1 super primary states across the SouthShe is also on the losing slope of a 35point gender gap with men and a 10 percent gap with women in Tuesdays returns On Primary Day 55 percent of women voted for Sanders including 69 percent of women under 45Voters give Clinton high marks on leadership qualities 54 percent experience 84 percent and electability 79 percent but few think that she cares about people like them 17 percent While nearly 9 in 10 who voted in the Democratic primary say that Sanders is honest and trustworthy less than half say the same for Clinton Twothirds of voters said they preferred Sanderss positions on the issues to hersPolling on the eve of the vote shows an even stronger disaffection for Clinton among the youngest voters Among women age 18 to 34 Sanders led Clinton 87 to 9 percent according to final tracking pollsThat antipathy fed by social media may extend to girls below the voting age as well if this encounter is any indication Commenting on the election results Vana Rizos a waitress in Brookline NH pulls out her cell phone to replay a video of her mother Rika walking into a voting booth on Tuesday In the video her daughter Krysele  who is 14 and holding the camera  calls out to ask who she will vote for At the answer Hillary Clinton of course  the girl groans and stops recordingSo why the groanShe thinks that Bernie is authentic and Hillary is fake because she always travels with a big entourage said Vana Rizos her motherBoth the Clinton campaign and many commentators were slow to appreciate how faintly Clintons persona as a champion of womens rights would register with younger votersOne reason is that the electorate has changed since Clinton won the New Hampshire presidential primary in 2008 and young women dont have the same points of reference as Clintons generationNew Hampshire is a different state that it was in 2008 says Andrew Smith director of the Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire in Durham Younger voters have a very different set of experiences that affect their political world than we haveWomen under 35 probably have had women professors and bosses he adds They havent had the experiences that their mothers and grandmothers did Thats why feminist messages just dont resonate with younger votersBy contrast Sanders is talking about issues that resonate such as not having a job or not making the money you wanted to or living in your parents basement he saysA similar assumption that doesnt pass generational muster is that Americans couldnt possibly vote for a socialist Those that are my age know its a political death knell he adds But there is a significant part of the electorate who werent born when the Berlin Wall came down Younger voters see socialism as their trip to Denmark or Sweden or ParisFeminist icon Gloria Steinem had to walk back a comment on HBOs Real Time with Bill Maherthat young women back Sanders over Clinton because thats where the boys are A comment by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a rally with Clinton on Saturday that theres a special place in hell for women who dont support women also fell flat among young women voters drawn to the promise of a social movement They were not only annoyed at being scolded but affronted by the idea they have to vote for Clinton just because shes a womanDuring the Democratic debate on PBS Thursday night Clinton shrugged off Ms Albrights comment saying Shes been saying that for as long as Ive known her Clinton said she has no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support I just hope by the end of this campaign a lot more are supporting me I am not asking people to support me because Im a woman but because I think Im the most qualified experienced and ready person to be the president and commanderinchiefIn an essay in Slateafter the New Hampshire vote cultural critic Camille Paglia maintains that one thing thats driving young women to Sanders is Clintons overuse of I in the current campaign in contrast to Bernie Sanderss egotranscending focus on sparking a populist movement of political reformLost in the New Hampshire outcome is the fact that Clinton still has a core of supporters especially among nonwhite voters who credit her record as an activistA getoutthevote rally for Clinton at Nashua Community College last week was packed with supporters waving NEA Democrats for Hillary a reference to the largest national teachers union which has long done much of the legwork in Democratic campaignsShes been secretary of State How could you think someone like that wouldnt be a good president says Faith Little an online instructor of social work at Boston University Commenting on all the support for Sanders among students she adds Shes being realistic about what she can deliverClinton also has the support of much of the party establishment She has been campaigning in New Hampshire primaries since 1991 not only in the four Clinton presidential races 1992 1996 2008 2016 but also to help other Democrats In the process she earned the gratitude of many Democrats here including US Sen Jeanne Shaheen and New Hampshire Gov Maggie Hassanwho is running in a tight race to oust Sen Kelly Ayotte RCritics say that establishment support doesnt count for much in what is an election defined by anger against the establishment The support of a governor and US senator did little to avert a Clinton defeat in New Hampshire but it is firing up controversy in the wake of that voteHeres the issue Governor Hassan Senator Shaheen and four other superdelegates are now pledged to support Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July Despite her blowout loss to Sanders Clinton could wind up with as many or more New Hampshire delegates than Sanders in PhiladelphiaIf social networking buzz is any indication the issue is opening a new intergenerational fracture between Clinton and younger voters who see the move as part of a rigged political system  a leading Sanders talking pointIn a statement after the vote Hassan reached out to Sanders voters No matter what the ultimate outcome of the nominating process Senator Sanders has importantly voiced the frustration of many Granite Staters who know corporate special interests in Washington are holding our families and small businesses back she said in a statement
