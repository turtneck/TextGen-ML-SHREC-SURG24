President Obama is appearing on Foxs Sunday politics show to push Republicans to support Merrick Garlandbut he will make bigger news talking about Hillarys email scandalI think where he makes the most news is about Hillary Clinton Wallace saidan assessment that is likely to be greeted with apprehension at Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn He hasnt been asked about it in awhile Back in October on 60 Minutes he said she had not jeopardized national security with her private email server Since then weve found out that 2000 of her emails were classified and 22 were top secret So could he say flatly that she didnt give away Americas secretsI think Fox News is more critical of this President than most other news organizations Wallace answered in an email to The Daily BeastThe White House sometimes doesnt like that But I think we are doing our jobtelling all sides of the story I also think the White House doesnt distinguish between our hard news operation and the opinion showsHe has nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and theyre very frustrated with the fact that the Republican Senate refuses to even hold confirmation hearings let alone to give him an up or down vote Wallace said in a phone interview adding that he pushed particularly hard in his pitch to the White House that his program was wellpositioned to serve their interests They saw Fox News Sunday as an opportunity to reach out to Republicans or Independents or conservative Democrats to try to put pressure on Republican senators to give a full vetting a normal vetting to Judge GarlandObama told Wallace that even if Clinton is elected in seven months and the Senate goes into a lameduck session he plans to stick by Garland as his preferred nominee instead of pulling the nomination to let Clinton fill the seat vacated by the death last month of Associate Justice Antonin ScaliaWallace meanwhile declined to wade into the intrigue surrounding Fox News star and frequent Donald Trump target Megyn Kelly who has been critical of her colleague Bill OReilly for not defending her more robustly and recently confided to Variety that while shes grateful for Fox News Chairman Roger Ailess staunch support she must keep her options open on whether to reup with Fox when her next contract talks come up after the November electionI think any time that the president is doing an interview with a television program that he hasnt done an interview with for a whilein this case not since Obamas sole Fox News Sunday appearance in 2008 when he was a mere candidate for presidentits an opportunity to reach a new audience or at least an audience that may not have heard from the president directly in a whileCertainly while they personally exempt Wallace a registered Democrat Obama and his aides havent been shy about expressing their disdain for the toprated cable channel founded by former Republican strategist Ailes at the behest of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 around the same time that Obama was launching his political career back in ChicagoObama has frequently made Fox News the butt of his comedy routine at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner and in April 2011 at the height of Trumps birther antics showed the audience what he termed my official birth video which turned out to be the nativity scene from the Disney animation The Lion KingI asked him about all the anger among Americans both Democrats and Republicans whether its Bernie Sanders supporters or Donald Trumps supporterspeople who feel dealt out of the game in Washington and on Wall Streetand does he take any responsibility for the fact that after eight years people still feel the game is riggedWallace said he also asked the president why he appeared to be so disengaged and emotionally contained when reacting to acts of terrorism that made many Americans angrycheerfully golfing in Martha Vineyard after commenting on the beheading by ISIS of journalist James Foley and enjoying a baseball game in Cuba after the horrific attacks in BrusselsWe also had a very interesting conversation when we did a walkandtalk where I asked him what is best day and worst day at the White House was Wallace saidWe were in the law library where he wrote the book Dreams from My FatherThere couldnt be a sharper contrast with the Oval Office
