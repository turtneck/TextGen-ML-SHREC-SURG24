Des Moines Iowa CNN In the socalled Invisible Primary of 2016 Jeb Bush is the invisible man  and he prefers it that wayAfter taking the political world by surprise in early January with the formation of a shiny new political committee Bush has largely receded from public view instead putting an acute focus on raising money and building what his growing team of aides describe as a shock and awe campaign operationAside from some previouslybooked paid speeches a series of banal postings on Instagram and Twitter and a few random runins with scraphungry reporters the former Florida governor seems determined to avoid the traps of the horse racedriven daily news cycle and the expectations game that comes with itBushs mission in these early days of the cycle is to keep his head down and raise as much money as possible in an effort to muscle out his closest Republican rivals hire a talented staff and build a highoctane campaign apparatus that can go the distance against Hillary Clinton in 2016There is a lot going on under the surface said one Bushaligned strategist who like most allies interviewed for this story refused to talk on the record about any campaign plans He is still in the process of considering whether to run but we are building and organizing Its a pretty muscular financial and political organizationHis staffers meanwhile are fiercely tightlipped about his plans and calendar including a forthcoming book rollout offering only the blandest of comments to reportersI like to ski I cant comment Bush told one reporterWhen big issues have surfaced  like President Barack Obamas dramatic changes to the countrys decadesold Cuba policy  Bush has played it safe opting to make his opinions known on Facebook rather than on television newsBushs decision to shun the limelight in January 2015 makes sense to veterans of the presidential process Though the 2016 race would be his first presidential bid Bush seems determined to avoid the flame wars and Twitter spats that other firsttime candidates are dabbling in attentionsucking moments that can distract a candidates and staffers from their daytoday goalsThere is still plenty of time said Iowa Gov Terry Branstad The caucuses are more than a year awayBushs most highprofile appearance came last Friday during a paid speech to the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in San Francisco Closepolitical watchers mined his appearance for clues about a possible message but he revealed little new about his thinking beyond nowfamiliar calls for immigration reform and a more adult political tone in WashingtonBush advisers are promising a splashier showing on Feb 4 when Bush is set to address the Detroit Economic Club a frequent stopover for ambitious RepublicansIn the meantime Bush has been flying around the country courting big Republicans donors and asking them to contribute to his political action committee Right to Rise PAC and an affiliated super PACIts a smart strategy because you have got to have a lot of money to run said Iowa Sen Charles Grassley who said Republicans will have a better chance in 2016 if they nominate a governor or exgovernor not associated with the unpopularity of CongressAccording to some Republicans the Bush committees together are raking in daily sums in the midtohigh six figures an intake that should guarantee an impressive showing once the first fundraising quarter concludes in MarchOther candidates arent doing that said one unaffiliated Republican in Washington who had been recently briefed on the fundraisingStill Bush backers vigorously deny a report from earlier this month that they are planning to haul in 100 million in the first quarter a near impossible goalMuch of the news about Bushs financial activities is emerging from supportive donors leaking tidbits to reporters On the staff side its nocomment all the timeIts the Jeb Bush culture said one Florida Republican who knows the likely candidate Its consistent with how he ran previous campaigns Consistent with how he governed Focus is execution getting things done and lack of turmoil Thats the goal anyway You always fall short from time to timeThe nononsense posture of Bushworld makes for a striking contrast when compared to the daily palace intrigue swirling around Romney Bushs closest competitor for establishment Republican supportEver since Romney told a room full of New York donors  many of them already committed to Bush  that he was seriously considering a 2016 bid seemingly every Romney meeting lunch phone call and private meeting has surfaced in the pressThe readallaboutit Romney drama is fueled in part by a circle of advisers that forged chatty relationships with the national press over eight years of campaigning and are happy to puff up their boss in the media But despite Romneys bold moves in recent weeks even some of his most devoted aides remain uncertain about his 2016 chances Some believe hes bestpositioned in a wideopen field while others are more torn about his reemergence but remain loyal to him nonethelessRomneys willheorwonthe act has a short shelf life a range of top Republicans and donors groused to CNNI think there is a clear connection between endless leaks about highlevel staff meetings and tremendous campaign insecurity said one senior Republican sympathetic to Bush who has spoken with people in both the Bush and Romney orbits Jebland seems too busy organizing to worry about leaking triviaRomney is expected to make a decision about the race in the next two weeks according to people who have spoken with him in recent daysBut Bushs quick start might have already boxed out Romney on the fundraising front In Republican financial circles talk over the last week has centered on how Bush has already secured commitments from a large swath of Romneys biggest bundlers and contributors raising the former Massachusetts governors barrier to entryBush is also ahead of Romney in the race for campaign talent though the hiring process is moving at a somewhat slower pace than the money chaseSince before the holidays Bushs two closest political advisers  Sally Bradshaw and Mike Murphy  have been recruiting staffers and consultants with a blizzard of phone calls and a cascade of meetings in Washington and elsewhere They have focused heavily on staff talent from party committees in Washington and consultancies with ties to the Republican establishment Already Bush has tapped US Chamber of Commerce political director Rob Engstrom who helped engineer the Republican establishments national drubbing of the tea party in 2014 as a top adviserIt remains unclear who will run the campaign Bradshaw several Republicans said is likely to remain in a senior adviser role Sara Taylor Fagen an Iowa native and former political director for George W Bush has been frequently mentioned as a likely campaign manager Fagen did not respond to a request for commentSeveral Republicans familiar with the moves said Bushs high command has been very aggressive on the digital side promising to build a stateoftheart data and digital operation Bush team has had conversations with a variety of top digital firms in Washington and Chris Georgia a former digital staffer for the National Republican Congressional Committee now working for Bush has already tried to hire away staffers from a handful of leading digital firmsIn the pivotal early caucus and primary states of Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina Bush has been careful to manage expectations moving slower than most of his rivals Bush has called the Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufman and Grassley said he has made arrangements to speak with Bush on Tuesday He has also dialed some party leaders in New Hampshire and South Carolina but for now appears to be relying on goodwill from early state veterans of his fathers and brothers political orbitsBush is also keeping an eye on Michigan which has yet to move its primary date from a February slot to later in the year despite the threat of penalties from the Republican National Committee Former Michigan governor John Engler is keeping tabs on on the states primary for Bush and his teamBushs organizational strength fundraising prowess and blooming establishment support have impressed Washington insiders But his strengths have yet to be tested in the wilds of the campaign trail where goodwill for Romney still lingers among rankandfile Republicans Bush will have to introduce himself to Republican voters hold steady throughout the upsanddowns primary grindhouse and explain thorny positions to a GOP electorate that has drifted right since Bush last held office almost a decade agoAt some point in the coming months Bush will have to show some more leg to the publicIn Iowa Branstad said he spoke to Bush about coming to an Agriculture Summit for presidential candidate in March Bush he said has some real interest in thatMy advice to all the candidates is come early and come often Branstad said I hope he does
