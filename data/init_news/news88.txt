President Obamas supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of 2008 has gone The answer is to the White House Obamas presidency is about smaller less inspiring questions than his 2008 campaignObamas presidency is bounded by the limits of the office and the demands of the moment It is about what America needs to do right now  the next budget the next bill next years taxes the last war Candidates can muse Presidents must governObamas 2008 campaign was about what kind of country America is how to read its past to best guide its future His speech in Selma  which is reallyworth reading in its entirety  was among the best of his presidency precisely because it had almost nothing to do with his presidency it was a return to the central topic of his campaignHistorians who want to understand Obama will find few better summations than the two paragraphs at the core of this speechWe do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable or that racial division is inherent to America If you think nothings changed in the past fifty years ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or LA of the Fifties Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothings changed Ask your gay friend if its easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago To deny this progress  our progress  would be to rob us of our own agency our responsibility to do what we can to make America better Of course a more common mistake is to suggest that racism is banished that the work that drew men and women to Selma is complete and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes We dont need the Ferguson report to know thats not true We just need to open our eyes and ears and hearts to know that this nations racial history still casts its long shadow upon us We know the march is not yet over the race is not yet won and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as muchThose 230 words are a precise distillation of Obamas view of America and the role politics must play in itThe first paragraph is Obamas case for hope America is improving it has always been improving and to deny that improvement is to steal from Americans a belief in their country that they have more than earned To deny this progress  our progress  would be to rob us of our own agency he saidThe second paragraph is Obamas case for change Americas sins are not vanquished its hatreds remain real its racism still breathes We know the march is not yet over Obama said the race is not yet won and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as muchHope and change These are the two ideas that form the steady core of Obamas politics But more than that they are the two ideas that define for Obama what kind of country America is  and what it means to serve itObamas critics question his love for the country he governs I do not believe  and I know this is a horrible thing to say  but I do not believe that the president loves America former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February They look at Obamas steady belief that America is not yet good enough not yet pure enough not yet perfect enough and they see a skeptic not a patriotIn this speech Obamas answer to this criticism was directFellow marchers so much has changed in fifty years Weve endured war and fashioned peace Weve seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives and take for granted convenience our parents might scarcely imagine But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship that willingness of a 26 yearold deacon or a Unitarian minister or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that theyd risk everything to realize its promise Thats what it means to love America Thats what it means to believe in America Thats what it means when we say America is exceptionalThere is an implicit radicalism in what Obama is saying hereTo believe America is good enough is to abandon the tradition of criticism and activism that has made America greatObamas answer to Giuliani is that Giuliani has mistaken uncritical adoration for the hard work required of true love Patriotism is active not passive Those who love America prove it by working to perfect America They continue marching
