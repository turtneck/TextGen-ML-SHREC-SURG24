For a brief happyand misguidedmoment most Americans stopped thinking about Iraq After withdrawing the last US troops in 2011 President Barack Obama declared the country sovereign stable and selfreliant No such luck Iraq plunged back into chaos as the Islamic State stormed the region last year and the fall of Ramadi in May revived questions about how and whether the country can be salvagedAs Americans try to understand what 2 trillion and nearly 4500 American lives really accomplished partisans are battling over how much blame falls on Obama who left Iraq and on President George W Bush who took us there If you fought in Iraq it worked 2016 presidential candidate Lindsey Graham recently said Its not your fault its going to hell Its Obamas fault Naturally Democrats see it differently This represents the failed policies that took us down this path 10 years ago House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has saidWhos right Could Iraq have remained stable if Obama had left behind a small troop contingent Did Bushs surge really stabilize the country In June Politico Magazine assembled a dozen expertsincluding veterans of both administrations from the State Department White House Pentagon and the CIAand asked a simple question Who lost Iraq Michael CrowleyMichael Crowley Ambassador Khalilzad you were in Iraq from 2005 to 2007 Describe the trajectory Iraq was on when you left and the Iraq that Obama inherited when he was inaugurated in January 2009Zalmay Khalilzad It was a very difficult period Especially in the aftermath of the alAskari Mosque bombing in 2006 the sectarian violence became front and centera very large number of fatalities and causalities both Shia and Sunniand the rise of Al Qaeda in Iraq We began a more concerted effort training Iraqi troops which resulted in significant growth in their size and capabilities The new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki showed more willingness to use force against the Shia militias in Basra and Baghdads Sadr City Additionally the excesses committed by Al Qaeda in Iraq against the Sunni community was beginning to turn some Sunnis against them With increased outreach to the Sunnis we began to have significant numbers of them work with usThere were still some issues unresolvedthere was no oil law for the distribution of resources there still was no reform of deBaathification These were selfinflicted wounds if you likemistakes we made in my judgment at the very beginning But I think the Iraqis were heading in the right direction You had a government that acquired greater national legitimacy There was a greater Sunni participation in government compared to an earlier period The level of violence by the end of the Bush administration was significantly down compared to 2006 early 2007Were still talking about Iraq but relatively speaking I would say it was on a positive trajectory with some big issues still unresolvedMC Kim tell us more about the security situation when President Obama arrivedKim Kagan The security situation in Iraq was dramatically improved by operations conducted by surge troopsviolence in Baghdad and in Iraq fell dramatically over the course of 2007 And in 2008 US forces partnered with the Iraqi security forces pushed AQI out of Baghdad out of Diyala and all the way to Mosul where the Al Qaeda elements were greatly reduced over time by followon operations and special forces operations The Shia militias which posed a threat to the sovereignty of the Iraqi government had been greatly diminished by the operations that Prime Minister Maliki and US forces undertook in 2008 and were no longer militarily viable within IraqThe two main threats to Iraqi state security had been significantly diminished by 2008 and over the course of 2009 Our US forces were handing over security to Iraqi security forces such that US forces came out of the major cities of Iraq and handed responsibility for those cities back to the Iraqi security forces One of the principles behind the way that the US had constructed its surge operations was that the US had special tiein capabilities that the Iraqi security forces did not have because they were still growing still developing skills So clearing cities was something the US did with Iraqi security forces supportAs those cities became more peaceful as the population returned as AQI left the Iraqi security forces could handle the security environment in the urban centers But AQI was not destroyed It had not lost the will to fight It was potentially reduced from an organization that had highend terrorist capabilities that could threaten the state to an insurgency a group that had very limited capacity to act as a terrorist organization but still had some will to fight and still had some organization some command and control left over primarily in the Mosul areaMC John what did the threat to the US or western interests in the region emanating from Iraq look like at the time Obama took officeJohn McLaughlinIf you go all the way back to 2008 the Arab Spring or Awakening was still years away In 2008 Al Qaeda central was on the run but not defeated We were still very much on guard against attacks on the United States we were just two years after detecting the attempt by Al Qaedarelated people to put together an operation over the Atlantic out of Londonthe planes plot So Al Qaeda in that period is still very dangerous but not particularly noteworthy insofar as its capability in Iraq was seenMC Ambassador Hill you get to Iraq at the start of Obamas first term What does that Iraq look likeis it on a trajectory to a place where it can stand on its ownChris HillThere was perhaps more optimism than the facts might have justified For example there was a view that somehow Maliki had gotten in the saddle that he understood the need for outreach to the various groups and was prepared to continue the payments to the socalled Sons of Iraq There was an overall kind of optimistic mood but I must say in talking to the Sunni leaders who were part of his cabinet you certainly didnt get the sense there was any reason to be optimistic You certainly got the impression when you talked to people that it wasnt going well Going out to Anbar for example and talking to Sunni sheiks out there they were all prepared to work together in a kind of allin Sunni party but you certainly didnt get the impression they were cutting Baghdad any slack or cutting Maliki any slack
