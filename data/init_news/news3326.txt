License DMCA In an explosive interview Newt Gingrich became completely unhinged verbally attacking Fox News Megyn Kelly for referring to Trump as a sexual predator Throughout the interview Newt Gingrich seemed to live in an alternate state of reality He continued to discount polls that show Trump losing badly He refused to acknowledge that all the tossup states are moving towards Clinton The interview was already contentious when a couple of words from Megyn Kelly turned it explosive Video here  You want to know why Trump has had a rough time Newt Gingrich asked If Trump is a sexual predator Megyn Kelly said That is   Advertisement  He is not a sexual predator Newt Gingrich shouted Thats your opinion Kelly said I am not taking a position on it You could not defend that statement an unhinged Gingrich shouted Now I am sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true Excuse me Mr Speaker Kelly interjected You have no idea whether it is true or not What we know is that at least  Neither do you Gingrich shouted  Advertisement  Thats right Kelly replied And I am not taking a position on it unlike you So what I said is incorrect Yes you are Gingrich replied When you use the words you took a position And that is very unfair of you Megyn I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes sir Kelly replied What I said is if  no no no  let me make my point and then I will give you the floor What I said is if Trump is a sexual predator then it is a big story And what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will Thats what we saw Then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at the debate to say that was untrue He did it to me He did it to me We saw reporters We saw people who had worked with him people from Apprentice and so on and so forth He denies it all which is his right We dont know what the truth is My point to you is as a media story we dont get to say the ten women are lying We have to cover that story sir Gingrich then went into full spin mode He attempted to characterize the media as biased for covering more about the growing Trump sexual predator scandal than Clinton speeches to banks a false equivalency He then unleashed his anger and abuse again
