positions The dirt tracks to the front lines were jammed with vehicles full of fightersOn the western side of the mountain Kurdish special forces tentatively advanced on foot into Islamic Stateheld territory followed by a snaking convoy of armored vehicles By nightfall they had succeeded in cutting the highway next to the city which runs from Raqqa in Syria to Mosul in Iraq splitting the Islamic States territory apartPeshmerga forces had entered a former Iraqi military base and cleared a string of villages Kurdish officials saidThe drive to retake Sinjar is the largest offensive launched by Iraqi Kurds against the Islamic State and a key test of their military capabilities It comes as the militants face attacks on multiple fronts from Raqqa the groups de facto capital in Syria to Ramadi in western IraqThe loss of Sinjar would deal the Islamic State a severe setback cutting its supply lines between Iraq and Syria But it is also a particularly emotive fightThe sudden fall of Sinjar to Islamic State militants in August 2014 devastated the Yazidi community Hundreds of thousands fled Sinjar and the surrounding area  many straight into the hands of the extremists who consider Yazidis

Cook said that advisers from the United States and other countries were taking part in the Sinjar operation but declined to provide the number of foreign forces involvedMost of those folks  are behind

tunnels and hideaways in the city Weve had suicide bombers we are expecting more when we go inside he saidIf the offensive bogs down rivalries between various factions fighting the Islamic State will be to blame Zebari saidThe longplanned operation had stalled for weeks because of bad weather and political wrangling between factions of Kurdish soldiers Fighters affiliated with the Turkishbased Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK have held positions in the city but Kurdish peshmerga forces launching the offensive said they are not directly coordinating with themIf the liberation takes too long it will be because of having troops from different parties each of them flying their own flag said ZebariThe Kurdishled efforts also have significance in the wider efforts to cripple the Islamic State In
