B y Danny Haiphong S yria is the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history The author regrets that left analyst Eric Draitser has contributed to the confusion Draitser criticizes leftists who firmly support the Syrian government Danny Haiphong counters that the left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of selfdetermination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neocolonial plunder PHOTO ABOVE Western supported Takfiri primes field gun supplied via Turkey To claim that the left in the US should fight for peace and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war Imperialisms war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression Syria is currently the battleground of imperialisms last gasp of life In nearly six years Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialisms forces of reaction It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria Nowhere is this confusion greater than in the United States and it appears someone I deeply respect has been overtaken by it Imperialisms war on Syria may be the most important question on the order of the day for those fighting for a world free of exploitation and oppression Syria is currently the battleground of imperialisms last gasp of life In nearly six years Syria has been turned into a site of intense struggle between the forces of resistance and imperialisms forces of reaction It has also been the target of one of the greatest misinformation campaigns in recent history In a recent issue of CounterPunch Eric Draitser dives head deep into the confusion 3  He criticizes what he deems as two critical problems with the lefts stance Draitser first criticizes the proimperialist left for their decision to align themselves with the foreignsponsored terror groups in Syria which have been labeled revolutionaries or rebels by the imperialist countries He then goes on to criticize leftists who have positioned themselves firmly in support of the Syrian government ERIC DRAITSER Usually solid analysis but suddenly a plunge into rank political collaboration with the forces of imperialism which he supposedly opposes The question is why act like a liberaloid Given his record we refuse to believe he is that dumb It is his criticism of the proAssad left that needs further examination Draitser reveals his deep confusion when he asks Will you continue to delude yourselves by refusing to accept the plainly obvious truth that no state or group has the best interests of Syrians at heart Draitsers question assumes that the Syrian and Russian governments are equally to blame for the chaos in Syria Their bombs are assumed to be prolonging the war and committing atrocities against the Syrian people at the same rate of the imperialists If this is not the case he doesnt state otherwise in the piece In fact Draitser sets out to prove true what has already been proven false by a wide range of independent and corporate media sources The imperialist countries and their media lackeys have sewed deep confusion about the true character of the war being waged on Syria First Draitser claims that the war on Syria began as a genuine protest against neoliberal reforms instituted by the Syrian government This narrative is popular among the liberalleft media as well as the white left generally However those who make this claim rarely specify what neoliberal reforms were made or how the confrontation all of a sudden became violent Stephen Gowans reviews numerous reports from the corporate media 4 that describe the uprising in March of 2011 as immediately violent illsupported and ultimately insignificant in the midst of reforms from the Syrian government that were broadly supported by the Syrian people At the same time as the violent uprisings thousands of Syrians were protesting in the streets 5 in support of President Assad USSaudi supported Takfiri fanatics operating in Syria and depicted by the media as moderates Furthermore reports from the city of Daraa during the 2011 uprisings confirmed the presence of armed rebels who had freshly arrived from their USNATO backed destruction of Libya 6  These rebels have since infested the country through various channels of the Syrian border Each group possesses a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and receives varying degrees of assistance from the Gulf monarchies Israel Turkey NATO and of course the US This is confirmed in Draitsers article Yet he still reinforces the claim that a popular uprising started the war even though Assad possessed broad support in 2011 7  The truth is that the war on Syria has little to do with neoliberalism or popular discontent It has been acknowledged by UN sources that despite reforms the Syrian economy remains highly regulated and socialist in character 8  Syrias own form of socialism has brought many benefits to the Syrian people Healthcare and education are rights guaranteed to all citizens 9  Syria also possesses a secular government where Muslims Christians and all religious and ethnic groups lived peacefully prior to the war Syria is thus a poor example of neoliberalism What economic struggles that do exist in Syria have largely stemmed from the harsh sanctions imposed by the US 10 in 2004 The war on Syria has little to do with neoliberalism or popular discontent Furthermore Draitser cites numerous sources that support regime change to smear the Syrian government and by extension the Syrian people One of the sources receives much of its information from the White Helmets The White Helmets have long been exposed as an NGO that works directly in service of imperialisms regime change operation in Syria The organization receives approximately 33 million in funds 11 directly from the US and UK governments Eva Bartlett recently visited Aleppo and witnessed many White Helmet workers sporting arms and fighting among the terror groups 12  Draister also cites a source from the New York Post  The Post article relies heavily on documents collected by the dubious Center for International Justice and Accountability This purported international law NGO 13 is run by a consortium of corporate lawyers former or current Amnesty International staffers and various other servants of empire The organization specializes in transitional justice In other words the Center for International Justice and Accountability CIJA provides a legal framework for regime change on behalf of its imperial funders Draitser claims no group involved in the war has the interests of the Syrian people at heart yet cites directly from an organization dedicated to the promotion of war in Syria The NGOs and their partners in the corporate media have worked together to distort the reality on the ground Aleppo is case and point A ceasefire was brokered by all parties in late October that was supposed to allow Syrians to escape safely from East to West Aleppo However the humanitarian corridors were repeatedly shelled by the Nusra Front 14  the USbacked Al Qaeda affiliate  The media decided to ignore this and report instead that the ceasefires failure was due to the withholding of aid by Russia and Syria 15  This is but one example of many where the Syrian government has been blamed for the rebelsponsored terror inflicted on Syrian people His analysis uses an abstract moral argument to violate Syrias selfdetermination After five years of war on Syria it is a wonder how anyone could believe a word that comes from the mouths of the imperialist countries They lied about the origins of the conflict They have continuously blamed the Syrian government for events that have all been traced back to the armed proxies they support This includes the Houla Massacre 16  the sarin gas attack 17 in Ghouta and the socalled starvation of Madaya 18  Aleppo is no different The Syrian city has been under constant siege from NATObacked terrorists The terrorists are holding nearly 250000 Syrians hostage in the Eastern side of wartorn Aleppo This has been verified by journalists on the ground such as Vanessa Beeley 19  These facts seem not to matter in Draitsers newfound assessment of Syria His analysis uses an abstract moral argument to violate Syrias selfdetermination Calling those who unequivocally support the Syrian government fetishists assumes that the US left should take a position different from that of the Syrian people Actual Syrians supported Bashar AlAssad and thus the Syrian Army with 887 percent of the vote 20 in the 2014 elections To claim that the left in the US should fight for peace and at the same time oppose the Syrian government is an intentional attempt to remain neutral in a time of war As Howard Zinn brilliantly stated one cannot be neutral on a moving train And the imperialist war against Syria is moving dangerously toward a World War III scenario Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States and has repeatedly expressed that she will pursue a nofly zone 20 once in office A nofly zone would place Russian and Syrian military assets at risk of USsponsored bombs and thus the world at risk of a global military confrontation not seen since World War II How convenient it is then that Draitser should rebuke his former antiimperialist stance in place of a stealth form of regime change The world is on fire yet Draitser has interpreted the situation as a chance to distort an already highly misunderstood situation  Draisters conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight Positions such as Draitsers are ultimately shaped by the material conditions of an imperialist empire in crisis and decline White supremacy has been a principal condition of US imperialism since its inception The war machine and white supremacy are deeply connected The peoples and nations on imperialisms hitlist are routinely depicted in a manner that justifies the need for US and Western military medicine This notion has trickled down to the daytoday actions of ordinary people including what currently passes as the antiwar movement in the US today Draisters conclusions ultimately reinforce the Western assumption that the left must come to the rescue and save the Syrian people from their plight Indeed the Syrian people need allies and the left must be organizing toward an end to the war But an end to the war cannot be achieved unless the left supports the will of the Syrian people At the moment this means the US left must align itself with the Syrian government and its allies The left must act with uncompromising dedication to the principle of selfdetermination in every case where US and Western imperialism wages wars of neocolonial plunder Syria should be no exception Of course this critique should not be seen as a personal attack on Draitser himself His body of work reflects a deep commitment to the struggle against war and Empire He has often taken positions on international questions that are deeply unpopular with the US imperialist order However when mistakes are made the left has a responsibility to correct them There is too much at stake Failure to step up in defense of Syria means another regime change scenario similar to what happened in Yugoslavia Iraq and Libya Draitsers piece is a study into the path that all genuine antiimperialists should avoid But what is the correct path forward Imperialism is the unquestionable cause of the war in Syria so imperialism must be the primary target of an antiimperialist movement The US and its allies are risking world war over Syrias destruction On the other side the Syrian and Russian governments along with Iran and China are doing as much as they can to find a peaceful solution to the conflict that also respects Syrias national sovereignty It is without question that this is the side where the left ought to be in the continued struggle to end the war once and for
