told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State UniversitySen Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOPs establishment He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23These are all of our stories Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia These are who we are as Americans And yet for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distantBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White HouseSo ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again Trump told the crowd at his announcementHere are six takeaways from the town hall which aired on CNN and was moderated by Anderson CooperBacking away from the pledgeInitially designed to stymie the threat of a Trump independent run the realestate moguls Republican foes have been hamstrung by the signed pledge they all gave to the Republican National Committee in September to back the winner of the partys nominating contest for monthsIm not in the habit of supporting someone who attacked my wife and attacked my family I think that is going beyond the line he said Im not an easy person to tick off but when you go after my wife when you go after my daughters that does itCruz however didnt explicitly say he would oppose Trumps nominationSo Trump let him off the hookHe said Cruz looked tormented trying to answer Coopers very simple questionI dont want his support I dont need his support I want him to be comfortable Trump saidKasich too backed off his pledge  saying he shouldnt have raised his hand when the entire Republican field was asked at the first debate last year whether theyd back the eventual nominee Probably shouldnt have even answered that question but it was the first debate and what the heck he saidHe said hes been disturbed by some of the things I have seen without placing blame on any candidate by nameIf the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the country and dividing the country I cant stand behind them Kasich saidAsked whether Trump fit the bill as someone who is hurting the country Kasich said thats up to voters and wouldnt answer for himself Thats too much below the belt he saidHe came prepared for questionsIn his pocket he carried printouts of Fields initial description Shed said Lewandowski grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down I almost fell to the ground but was able to maintain my balanceHe mocked Fields description saying Lewandowski had really just brushed past her and that she didnt come anywhere close to stumbling to the ground She says Ohh look at my arm Trump saidTrump said Fields had grabbed his arm as well in an effort to get his attention and ask a question after his news conference had already endedAsked if hed press charges against her Trump said I dont know Maybe I should right Cause you know what she was grabbing meEach time he defended Lewandowski  saying he wouldnt fire his campaign manager  Trump also pivoted to a theme LoyaltyIm a loyal person Im going to be loyal for the country Im going to be loyal for Wisconsin Trump saidTrump also refused to back down from a fight when Cooper asked him about the fight with Cruz that involves both of their wivesNo its not Trump responded Exactly that thinking is the problem of this country I didnt start thisFor that Trump blamed Cruz On Twitter he warned Cruz to be careful or hed spill the beans on his wife Then Trump retweeted an unflattering image of Heidi Cruz alongside a more flattering photo of Melania TrumpTheres no evidence the super PAC headed by Republican strategist Liz Mair coordinated with Cruz Doing so would have been illegal But Trump said the two were in cahoots all the same saying that he would be willing to bet Cruz wrote the adSo Trump had to respond in kindI dont let things go so easily Trump saidAll eyes were on Kasich heading into the town hall to see whether he would go after CruzKasichs top strategist John Weaver had hit back hard on Twitter saying Cruz  with 0 friends 0 record 0 vision 0 chance  decides to lie about johnkasich Desperate Trump right on 1 thing lying TedBut when Kasich got on the debate stage his typical easygoing demeanor was on display In contrast to Trumps performance earlier in the night Kasich didnt hesitate to criticize his staffs hardball tacticsOf Weavers tweet he said Sometimes he gets a little tweethappy and I dont like that OK And I will have a word with him about itAs for the criticism from Cruz Kasich said Thats OK I can take itIn a moment that got one of the loudest cheers from the audience all night Kasich argued that the campaigns bitter personal moments have set a bad example for childrenIf namecalling bringing in spouses ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics we all need to stand against it Our children are watching This is America he said Im not going to go down there  I could screw up but I hope notCruzs goto option to win over women his motherI have grown up surrounded by strong women My mom is someone that I admire immensely he said when a questioner asked what he was going to do to convince women to support himIt was a rare revealing personal moment for a candidate who focuses more on demonstrating his rockribbed conservatism and policy prowessHe said his mothers father was a drunk and he didnt think women should be educated Nonetheless she made her way to Rice University and worked for Shell  on the way refusing to learn how to type so that she wouldnt have some man stop her and say Sweetheart would you type this for meHe said she wanted to be able to answer with a clean conscience Look I would love to help you out but I dont know how to type I guess youre going to have to use me as a computer programmer insteadCruz also pointed to his wife Heidi a Goldman Sachs executive and said hes been surrounded by strong women his entire life and that he believes every issue is a womens issueThe Texas senator wrapped up his answer by pointing to his two daughtersI want to make sure that they have a world that they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything he saidIt took Trump some time to answer when he was asked about the last time he apologized for anythingOh wow he said as the audience laughedHe finally came up with a response I apologized to my mother years ago for using foul language I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion Shes always saying Darling be more presidentialTrump joked about the constant controversies surrounding his decisions to amplify the remarks of his supporters Dismissing the Cruz remark he said that it was just a repeat but that didnt work out too wellMy biggest problems are repeats and retweets I dont get in a problem with what I say  its when I repeat something I think Im gonna be careful he saidCooper suggested that Trump could learn from behavior and not retweet thingsLaughing Trump said I know That I agree That I agree
