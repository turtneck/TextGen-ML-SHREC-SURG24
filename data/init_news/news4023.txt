The SPLCs Libelous New Report on AntiMuslim Extremists Equating counterjihadists with jihadists Robert Spencer The objective of this libelous new report from the hardLeft moneymaking and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center SPLC is made plain within it Before you book a spokesperson from an antiMuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to 15 of the most visible antiMuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform They wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in Islamophobia If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of Omar Mateen Syed Rizwan Farook Tashfeen Malik Nidal Malik Hasan Mohammed Abdulazeez Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings The SPLC doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop Islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of Islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC Thats what this is really all about In constructing this illusory edifice the SPLC labels me and fourteen others antiMuslim extremists We are of course no more antiMuslim than foes of the Nazis were antiGerman but note the word extremists Thats the mainstream media and Obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists In what way are we extremists Has anyone on the SPLCs hit list and given the SPLCs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up Beheaded anyone Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people No all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonMuslim bin Ladens and Awlakis Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the SPLCs libel is only that a libel Its also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as Islamophobes But their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings The report as a whole stands as an example of the Lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts The SPLCs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false For example it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the SPLC doesnt bother to try disproving It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism has claimed that the Obama administration extensively collaborates with the Muslim Brotherhood That he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them As Andrew C McCarthy has noted  Barack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States The SPLC also hits Emerison for having asserted that Europe is riddled with nogo zones Regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks Germany Police sick of citizens nogo zone fears The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah  who goes to mosque and prays every Friday who prays five times a day  this practicing Muslim who believes in the teachings of the Koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States Yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the Quran that contradict American Constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more How to reconcile these teachings with US citizenship the SPLC did not bother to explain The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying There are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the Democratic Party even those who are antiterrorist Here again no refutation is offered  yet the Lefts dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall antiAmericanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitzs assertion Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within The SPLC doesnt bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America  the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and Gods religion is made victorious over all other religions In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative the SPLC descended to outright fabrications Notes Geller  Their claim that I insist that Obama is the love child of Malcolm X is patently untrue The SPLC also states that I have spoken to a neofascist group in Germany when in fact I have never even been to Germany It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolos claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a US asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca which is impossible for a nonMuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King Even more strangely the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims is under death threats from Muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims Instead of trying to discredit her the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression But the SPLC has other priorities Of me the SPLC concedes that I am a real intellectual but complains that I am entirely selftaught in the study of Islam An odd objection One cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual In any case its false I am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of Islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct Nonetheless the fact is that I did first read the Quran and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina My claims says the SPLC are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them It even says that I have referred to Barack Obama as the first Muslim president This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into our first Muslim president the way Bill Clinton was called our first black president After eight years of Obama Id say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion The SPLC finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC George Soros funded a report on Islamophobia on Twitter and gave 200000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged Islamophobes He also spent 600000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal  and bought Islamophobia propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre But what need does the SPLC have of facts It knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant Left Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect
