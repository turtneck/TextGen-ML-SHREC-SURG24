  The statesmen will invent cheap lies putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked and every man will be glad of those consciencesoothing falsities and will diligently study them and refuse to examine any refutations of them and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque selfdeception  Mark Twain  source    Award winning journalist Ben Swann shares a number of facts regarding the origin and creation of ISIS the supposed terrorist group that seems to have replaced AlQaeda and according to former FBI translator and founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition NSWBC Sibel Edmunds has revived the terror war industry When it comes to supposed terrorist attacks its no secret that the government or the powers that be are involved in some way shape or form Weve seen this with AlQaeda and various documents that have tied them to US intelligence agencies like the CIA Weve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks that occurred on 911 the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job  a simple Google search of the polls will show you that and for the evidence we are referring to you can access our articles on that topic here  All three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned orchestrated and executed controlled demolition  Professor Lynn Margulis Department of Geosciences University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 911  source   source  All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be protected from such attacks The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses Its about time Most terrorists are false flag terrorists or are created by our own security services In the United States every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI In fact we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism Weve become a lunatic asylum  David Steele a 20year Marine Corps intelligence officer and the secondhighestranking civilian in the US Marine Corps Intelligence  source    The terrorists we are pointing our fingers at or so I believe along with many others after having done careful research are a creation of Western intelligence used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives Those who usually do not believe that almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research or examined the information for themselves This is the power mainstream media has over us  if something is depicted on television its instantly believed without question Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet like CNN for example or fit the framework of accepted knowledge seems to be met with harsh resistance This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos documents and whistleblowers yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves or again believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them The truth is there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called AlQaeda and any informed intelligence officer knows this But there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the devil only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism The country behind this propaganda is the United States  Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
