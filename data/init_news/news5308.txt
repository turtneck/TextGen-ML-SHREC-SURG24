time for Huckabee in Iowa  Good dog indeedHILLARYS LEFTWARD SPRINT CHEERS DEMS Why do politicians pander Because it works Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has been continually buffeted by scandal since March 2 and faces concerns among primary voters about her coming coronation The response to the allegations against the candidate and her organization  payola for official favors as secretary of state and destruction of tens of thousands of emails from her time in office  has been a botch Clintons husband and daughter are trying to defend the familys buckracking but theyre trying to do it whilst on a luxury African tour that highlights the familys unsavory connections So whats the candidate  especially one who was upended as a frontrunner eight years ago  to do Go left And she is sprinting that way  Shred may not have been the word you were looking for  Bill Clinton in an interview with CNN reportedly said suggestions of improper funding to the Clinton Foundation wont fly not a shred of evidence  The latest and most aggressive flip is Clintons move on illegal immigration in which she vowed to go beyond the temporary executive amnesty from President Obama thats currently being blocked by the courts Thats a big veer But shes benefitting from such tactics A new poll from NYTCBS News found that while 81 percent of Democrats found Clinton honest and trustworthy

Clinton previously misled voters And there is the larger issue The Clinton brand is based on pragmatic centrism not ideology As Mitt Romney found out candidates who start with a trust deficit do not in fact get to shake their Etch A Sketches Even a candidate who gets away with ducking the press for months at a time will eventually have to answer reporters questions about the scandals and her congressional testimony about the emails is coming up later this month As the scandal stuff bumps and bruises its way forward it seems unlikely that general election voters will be of a mind to take her word on questions of pinwheeling policy stances  The 1 percent likes one of their own  A CNBC survey found 53 percent of millionaires would vote for Hillary Clinton while 47 percent would vote for

 Lis Smith spokeswoman for former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley  Poll NH lead gets a trim  Support for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has dropped and her lead over potential Democratic rivals has slipped according to a new WMUR poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters Clinton is the favorite of 51 percent to Sen Elizabeth Warrens 20 percent and Sen Bernie Sanders at 13 percent In WMURs February poll 58 percent backed Clinton to Warrens 14 percent and Sanders 6 percent Hillary Clinton is still the frontrunner survey center director Andrew Smith told WMUR She is the frontrunner largely because Democrats think she is the most electable in November 2016 But there is evidence that a significant bloc of progressive Democratic primary voters are not happy with the Clinton candidacy  Power Play Dem debates will draw out challengers  The Democratic Party is sanctioning six presidential debates Thats sounds like quite a few for a field currently consisting of presumptive
