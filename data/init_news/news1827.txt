For months if not years now various activists and journalists have been dreaming of an Elizabeth Warren presidential campaignIdeological media bias is greatly overstated by partisans but bias in favor of interesting stories and against dull outcomes is massive and quite real Barack Obamas 20072008 upset of Hillary Clinton was one of the best political stories of my lifetime while Clintons utter domination of the 20142015 invisible primary is one of the least fascinating Whats more as Voxs Ezra Klein has argued a ClintonWarren race wouldgive Democrats an interesting clash of ideas around the role of finance in the 21st century economyUnfortunately for the clickcounters and cable news ratings the ClintonWarren race isnt going to happen But if its the ideas youre interested in its worth paying attention to former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley who is officially launching his campaign today and actually running on the issues people want to hear about from WarrenIn a March 20 oped for the Des Moines Register OMalleyoutlined an aggressive plan for financial reform that would go well beyond the provisions of theexisting DoddFrank legislationThese ideas would if implemented radically alter the role of finance in American society Large financial institutions would have to act in an extremely riskaverse and notsolucrative manner and likely become substantially smaller besides The Obama administration  and mostly likely Clinton  would argue that this is unnecessary for financial stability and risky for the economy as a wholeBut to populists thats precisely the point These ideas would move beyond a narrow focus on the stability of the financial system to a broader attack on finances role as one of the commanding heights of the American economyIn my experience it is a lot easier to get people to click on articles about bank regulation if you can put Elizabeth Warren in the headline OMalley is not the same kind of drawIf theres anything worth talking about regarding the 2016 Democratic nomination OMalleys critique of the ClintonObamaClinton record on financial regulation is the thing to talk about In an era of more polarized politics and more unified parties this is the biggest cleavage in Democratic Party politics The establishment view is that banks should be regulated for stability and bankers should be taxed for redistributive purposes But many activists and intellectuals want a furtherreaching attack on the financialization of the economy and the political system  an attack that could be pursued in part through new legislation but largely through more vigorous use of the existing regulatory and prosecutorial channelsIt would be more convenient for many of us if Warren were serving as standardbearer for this alternative view But the fact is that she isnt running and OMalley is Covering the actual controversy makes more sense than pining for Warren
