Written by Peter Van Buren   venerable New York Times ran a story saying Donald Trump lies about the height of his buildingsFor no apparent reason the Times resurrected some information from 1979 saying Trump insisted on counting the basement levels of his signature Trump Tower in the overall count of how many floors the building has The Times compares this lie to reports that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expectedYou have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same countthebasements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller There is absolutely no news The Russians Head over to Slate  which published an investigative piece alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the RussiansAt Mother Jones  another article alleged that an anonymous former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidencyTheres no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spys memos the story said But a Russian intelligence attempt to coopt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hackingOne more example from Vox  which wrote without even bothering to source it at all There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clintons campaign There is strong evidence linking Trumps foreign policy advisers to Russia and Trumps stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests Journalism Much Ive chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting and because these stories were run as news not opinion columns where the standards go right through the floor Even Mother Jones which clearly works leftofcenter used to do so with some solid journalismNot any moreThese places never find fringe publications are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of well nothing such as a factoid from 1979 or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single anonymous source or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all And Clinton On the other side reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poopooing away anything unfavorable Emails Who cares Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were If you ask you hate women PayforPlay with the Clinton Foundation Hah everybody does it it doesnt matter The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale or a criminal conviction nothing matters Next So be it The media has fully sht the bed this election Thats where we find ourselvesBut whats next Will the media reset itself after November 8 or will they run President Trump is Putins dog stories for the full term Will President Clinton be given a pass on well everything for four years with apologists and explainers on the front page of the Times never mind in editorialsAt what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again Reprinted with permission from WeMeantWellcom  Related
