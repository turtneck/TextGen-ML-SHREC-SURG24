Faced with a growing uproar over the United Nations handling of allegations of child sexual abuse by nonUN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon has suddenly scrambled to announce an external independent review panel to examine that issue along with a broad range of systemic issues related to how the UN responds to serious information of this kindBan who declared himself deeply disturbed by the situation said on Wednesday his intent was to ensure that the United Nations does not fail the victims of sexual abuse especially when committed by those who are meant to protect themIn fact Fox News has learned Bans action was also urged on him two days earlier by US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power as UN member states dickered in committee over a resolution that criticized Ban for the perceived lack of timely information he had provided on the abuse issue and the lack of protection of whistleblower associated with the CAR incidentsAt the time of Bans announcement US and European diplomats were still offering up alternative wordings in committee to temper the harsher languageBans spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News that the need to set up such a review has been in discussion for a long time but the specific terms of reference of the inquiry and its membership were not revealed in Bans announcement though he did specify it would look into the treatment of the specific report of abuse in the Central African RepublicAccording to Dujarric both the terms of reference and the membership of the probe will be revealed as soon as possible a fairly clear indication that Bans sparse announcement was intended more as an initial firefighting gesture than a fullyplanned response to the sexabuse crisisAnother way to look at it is that the UNs top bureaucrat was trying to keep the explosive sex abuse issue from spinning further out of control amid a gout of document leaks fingerpointing and UN investigations criticized as focused on hushing up leakers than on protecting additional young and starving children in the wartorn CAR from rape sodomy and other predatory offensesMoreover the CAR controversy is only the latest crest in a swelling critique of the UNs ability to protect the innocent from sex abuse where its blueandwhite flag is flyinga critique that includes a longsuppressed report of UNappointed experts who have decried a culture of impunity in UN peacekeeping missions when it comes to such crimesThe latest controversy has been further fueled by UN document leaks that raised the possibility of retaliatory collusion by the organizations independent Ethics Officer the head of its main independent internal watchdog the Office of Internal Oversight Services OIOS the UNs High Commissioner for Human Rights and Bans top deputy against Anders Kompass a senior UN human rights official who first brought the Central African Republic scandal into the daylightThat interpretation was strenuously denied by one senior UN official who requested anonymity while for her part the UN Ethics Officer Joan Dubinsky declined comment saying I dont believe it is appropriate to comment on leaked documentsUN spokesman Dujarric told Fox News that an investigation of Kompass by OIOS for possible staff misconduct initiated in March would nonetheless continue in parallel with the stillunformed inquiry panel Any relevant information of a broad systemic nature that will come out of that investigation will be considered by the review he declaredKompass has already been asked to resign at the behest of the UNs High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein He refusedKompass was then briefly suspended from his workuntil a UN tribunal reversed the action in conjunction with his investigation by OIOS for passing on transcripts by UNcollected testimony from children who described their sexual abuse and exploitation by French and African peacekeepers in the chaosshattered CAR in 2013 and 2014 The children were aged from 9 to 13The troops were from a multinational contingent that preceded the current UN peacekeeping mission in CARthe UN forces took over in September 2015 but were operating with UN Security Council approvalKompass got the UN report on the childrens testimony on July 15 2014 He told a French diplomat about it roughly a week later and in a written declaration has said he told his immediate superior in the UNs Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR about his disclosure shortly thereafterKompass has subsequently made no secret of the fact that he passed on the raw testimony to French military authorities by the end of that month bypassing his own superiors who said they discovered the action when French investigators approached the UN It was more than eight months later that he was asked to resignIn a wave of claims and counterclaims UN and French officials have each blamed the other for delays in investigating the allegations but while the UN has claimed that it has cooperated fully its interviewers only answered written questions from the French military probersThe investigative waters were roiled even further with the publication of internal emails and documents that showed top UN officials including Ethics Office head Dubinsky along with OIOS head Carman LaPointe Zaid and Bans chef de cabinet Susana Malcorra grappling with how to cope with the Kompass actionsThe documents were published by a nongovernment organization named AIDSFree World as part of a campaign called Code Blue The campaign calls for an entirely independent external Commission of Inquiry with full access to the UN as well as subpoena power to examine every facet of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations and an automatic end to diplomatic immunity for any UN official or peacekeeper accused of such abuseAmong the documents were emails that summarized a meeting among the officials on the periphery of a March 1920 Ban Kimoon retreat in Turin Italy where they agreed to ask Kompass to document the sequence of events that he believed supported a claim to whistleblower statusa designation that ultimately is made by the Ethics Officer independently of other UN branchesOther emails document a dispute within OIOS over who would authorize Kompass investigationa responsibility claimed by Lapointe personallyThe documents also underline a profound confusion among the officials about what they were even supposed to be discussingfor much of the conversation at least some of them believed they were discussing malfeasance in MaliCLICK HERE FOR THE CODE BLUE DOCUMENTSAccording to a senior UN official the internal discussions about Kompass and his case were no more than a routine sortingout of the responsibilities involved in dealing with an employee who had already admitted his actions while simultaneously claiming protected whistleblower status for themIn the UNs case establishing that status often involves notification of the established chain of command of perceived wrongdoing before going elsewhere with the information which Kompass did not doAt the same time the official noted OIOS investigations division is a mess that is rife with dissention and backbiting which made its proper functioning nearly impossibleFor critics however the same documentation is proof that the ostensible independence of OIOS and the UN Ethics Office in investigating wrongdoing and protecting whistleblowers is only a shamThe Code Blue documents show that Malcorra and others at the most senior levels of the UN were entirely indifferent to the welfare of little boys as young as nine years old being subjected to the most egregious sexual abuse argues Peter Gallo a former OIOS investigator who left the organization in MarchThe very essence of whistleblower protection is to protect staff members from retaliatory actions by management but in the UN it is now clear that the Ethics Office and management are on the same sideThere should be a solid wall between these people Paula Donovan cofounder of AIDSFree World told Fox News The regulations are very clear They are supposed to be impartial And when they were joined by ZaidKompass bossand his deputy that was completely against the rulesInstead she argued the evidence points to the conclusion that they were investigating the best way to get rid of himThe propriety of the meetings and emails concerning Kompass was also criticized by Robert Appleton the former head of investigations for the UN Procurement Task Force a special anticorruption unit within OIOS that existed between 2006 and 2009The communications are deeply troubling Appleton a highlyregarded former US prosecutor told Fox News Their priorities appear to be quite skewedAmong other things he said during his tenure at OIOS we did not coordinate with the Ethics Office  other than to recommend that they pursue whistleblower retaliation claimsIn addition OIOS is independent for a reason Appleton asserted in part so that the process not only is but appears to be fair objective and free of bias and influenceInvestigations are conducted in confidence so as not to prejudice the process  prejudice the subject or the outcome and so as not to create a conflict with the administration that potentially needs to carry on with disciplinary processes following the investigationThe same questions of confidence are going to surround SecretaryGeneral Bans newly announced external independent reviewA spokesman for the Code Blue campaigners for example welcomed the announcement and then added provisos starting with No member of existing UN staff should be appointed to investigate nor to act as the investigators secretariat and the notion that the broader the inquiry the betterTo be credible the spokesman added the inquiry should include an examination of top members of the SecretaryGenerals own staff singling out by title Dubinsky LaPointe and MalcorraBut there should also be plenty of other grist for the panelists work including a report that OIOS itself has promised to make public by midJune entitled an Evaluation of protection against sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operationsBased on recent UN experience the news it brings is unlikely to be goodGeorge Russell is editoratlarge of Fox News and can be found on Twitter GeorgeRussell or on
