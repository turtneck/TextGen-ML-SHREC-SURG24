There was a remarkable  and telling  exchange Sunday morning between NBCs Chuck Todd and Donald Trump over the Republican presidential frontrunners muchdebunked claims about thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating in the immediate aftermath of the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacksHere it is  in close to its entiretyTRUMP Chuck I saw it on television So did many other people And many                                       DONALD TRUMPmany people I said hundreds In the area I CHUCK TODDyou saw during Jersey City Okay DONALD TRUMPheard Patterson Excuse me Ive heard Jersey City Ive heard Patterson It was 14 years ago But I saw it on television I saw clips And so did many other people And many people saw it in person Ive had hundreds of phone calls to the Trump Organization saying We saw it It was dancing in the streets Now he tried to pull back but the Washington Post reported tailgate parties and reports of tailgate parties Tailgate parties means like for a football game where you have hundreds and hundreds and maybe even thousands of people having tailgate parties I saw it at the time I stick by it Hundreds of people have confirmed it You look at realdonaldtrump where I have millions and millions of people on there between Facebook and Twitter I have 10 million people between the two of them You look at that And Im getting unbelievable response of people that said they saw it Now DONALD TRUMPyou know just go a step further All over at the world at the time it was reported that Muslims were celebrating the downing All over the world forget about New Jersey for a second All over the world it was reported that Muslims were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center Two days ago three days ago there was a soccer game and there was a minute of silence in honor of the people that were slain horribly viciously slain in Paris France And a huge amount of people a tremendous number of people started screaming out Muslim phrases And all of the players on the field didnt know exactly what to do That was well reported I suppose nobody saw that either Im sure you reported it and you saw it     DONALD TRUMPSo there is a problem here Chuck of hatred that is unbelievable CHUCK TODDBut Mr Trump this didnt happen in New Jersey There were plenty of reports And youre feeding that stereotype DONALD TRUMPChuck it did happen in New Jersey I have hundreds of people that agree with me CHUCK TODDBut they want to agree with youIt goes on and on but you get the ideaTrumps argument boils down to this I dont care what published factchecks say I have heard from people on Twitter who tell me they saw the same thing I didTrump uses the social media response he gets to the outrageous claims he makes as justification that those claims are correct That is of course ridiculous As Chuck rightly notes many of the people who follow Trump simply want to see the world as he sees it and function and yesmen for himAnd even if they arent simply looking to agree with Trump the idea that anecdotal evidence offered by unvetted sources via Twitter can or should be used to directly rebut stories written by reporters who went to these alleged parties after Sept 11 and found little or nothing makes no sense Yes I am well aware of the story that Serge Kovaleski wrote in the Post following 911 go read our FactChecker on the story and get the um facts about itTrump is far from the first presidential candidate to use anecdotal evidence as fact During the 2012 campaign then Minnesota Rep Michele Bachmann repeatedly told the story of a woman who approached her on the campaign trail and insisted that the HPV vaccine caused mental retardation in her daughter Bachmann used the story as evidence that the HPV vaccine was in fact broadly dangerous despite scads of scientific evidence that it wasntTrump appears to not grasp the difference between being a wealthy businessman and a leading contender to be the Republican nominee for president In the former role popping off based on limited information or wrong information or a story someone told you that they heard from their uncle has a limited impact In the latter role popping off is far more dangerousYoure running for president of the United States Chuck who gets the difference told Trump on Sunday Your words matter Truthfulness mattersDonald Trump has created a perfect circle of illogical logic Facts are fungible The tweet from someone he has never met and never will meet about something heshe allegedly saw on 911 carries the same weight as actual information gathered by reporters hewing to journalistic standardsI dont have to tell you that down that path lies real dangerUpdate 727 am Monday Also appearing on TV on Sunday Trump spokeswoman Katrina Piersonaddressed her bosss many inflated claims and his apparent mocking of a New York Times reporters physical disability which Trump has denied doingHeres the thing if you dont like Mr Trump then yes youre going to side with that part of the story Pierson told CNNPierson also argued that denying thousands of Muslims celebrated on 911 is essentially tantamount to denying there are radical Muslims in the United States
