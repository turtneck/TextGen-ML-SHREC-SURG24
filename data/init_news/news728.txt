In 1982 during one of many visits to Israel I had the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Menachem Begin who told me Israel needs friends He added that in the end his nation could not trust any nation with its fate and security The protection of Israel he said was ultimately the responsibility of IsraelisBegins comment was prophetic given the petulance of our current president who behaves like an enemy of Israel when he attempts to impose a Palestinian state on Israel and negotiate a deal with Iran that can only lead to new threats against the Jewish state and further destabilize the chaotic Middle EastIn his determination to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program which Iran has denied exists so what is the US negotiating President Obama has traded history facts and reality for a potential deal with a regime that promotes terrorism around the world and is busy attaching Iraq to its vision of a greater Persian EmpireLast Saturday Irans Supreme leader Ali Khamenei again called for Death to America just one day after President Obama appealed to Iranians in a video message to seize a historic opportunity for a nuclear deal and a better future The leader of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas also continues to use inflammatory rhetoric about the ultimate destruction of Israel What should this tell usThe president is cozying up to a nation that oppresses women has an apocalyptic view of the world and believes that if it starts a nuclear war the 12th Imam  the Islamic messiah  will emerge from a well and bring peace on Earth and good will at least to Shia Muslim men Women will remain subject to male domination and have only the few rights given to them by menIsrael which embraces Western values of free elections religious tolerance and pluralism a free press and equal rights for women is treated by President Obama and his administration as Iran should be treated Do these people suffer from diplomatic dyslexia or antiSemitismThe coming nuclear deal with Iran if it occurs will be a sham from the start Agreements between nations require at least some trust but Iran has as much credibility as a doubleyourmoney promise from Bernie MadoffWhy should Israel be forced to surrender more land to an enemy that has sworn to destroy it A Palestinian state would likely be used as a launching pad for an attack Gaza is a perfect example It has been used by Hamas to attack Israel which unilaterally and foolishly gave it up in hopes of promoting peaceSuicide is not in Israels interests or that of the United States but suicide is what President Obama seems to want Israel to commit by pressuring it to return to indefensible 1967 borders and accept a nuclear deal with IranThat two states is not what Israels enemies want was made clear enough when President Clinton brought thenIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO leader Yasser Arafat to Camp David in 2000 Barak offered Arafat virtually everything he asked for  95 percent by some estimates  and Arafat rejected the offer Arafat his contemporaries and those who have come after him desire only one state headed by themselves with no Jewish state and no Jewish presence as evidenced by the wars and terrorist attacks they have launched and continue to wage against IsraelIn Deuteronomy 177 God instructs the ancient Israelites You must purge the evil from among youIn his dangerous pursuit of a problematic nuclear weapons deal with Iran and his attempt to marry a cancerous Palestinian state to the land of Israel President Obama is not purging evil hes inviting it to spread History will judge him for this as it has every other nation that has harmed the apple of His eye Zechariah 28Cal Thomas is Americas most widely syndicated oped columnist He joined Fox News Channel in 1997 as a political contributorHis latest book is What Works Common Sense Solutions for a Stronger America is available in bookstores now Readers may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditorstribunecom
