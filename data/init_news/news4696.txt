  US Economy Clinton Foundation  new world order  Trump admin Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the Government but illegal for the citizenry  Thomas Jefferson The mainstream media tried its hardest to persuade the public that Hillary was a lock to win the election Even the nefarious George Soros asserted confidently that Trump might win the popular election but Hillary would win the Electoral College But apparently the voters just werent ready for a tyrannical President yet The perception of the two candidates shaped by the mainstream media led the unsuspecting  if not comatose  public to believe that Hillary Clinton was some liberal angel who would save the country from reality and that Trump is some kind of fascist monster who is going to force everyone with slightly tinted skin to leave the country Of course nothing could be farther from the truth Lost in the shuffle is the fact that the Dragon Lady reincarnated hid behind the veil of the taxfree status of the Clinton Foundation to steal 100s of millions from the taxpayers and the Saudi royal family the Huma Abedin connection which is why she is Hillarys Igor and move it into the bank accounts of the Clinton family and friends of the Clinton family The taxpayers got nothing in return  the Saudi family got use of the US military to attack Syria Phony polls are just another form of insidious propaganda  its a tool designed to persuade the masses to go the direction of the poll and discourage the other side from voting It worked for Hitlery and the DNC against Bernie in California But the people woke up enough to see through the ruse in the big election The election results on Tuesday were not about giving Trump or the Republican Party a political and economic policy mandate The only mandate issued on Tuesday  quite loud and clear  was this Someone please stop Washington DC and Wall Street from dateraping us in the bodily area where waste exits That was it Obama had the same mandate in 2008 and completely betrayed his supporters Judging from the early indications from the Trump camp regarding Trumps likely cabinet and advisor appointments its going to be out with the old and in with the old Currently it appears as if the new Attorney General will be Rudy Guiliani who is a blatant Establishment hack Larry Kudlow as an advisor who is the worst economist in modern era and Jamie Dimon CEO JP MorganChase  who should be in jail  and Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary More of the same Neocon elitists Establishment apologists and Wall Street thieves The Shadow of Truth hosted special guest Eric Dubin of The News Doctors to review and dissect what happened on Tuesday evening Unfortunately its not difficult to conclude that not much will change when Obama hands the Oval Office wand to Trump Share this
