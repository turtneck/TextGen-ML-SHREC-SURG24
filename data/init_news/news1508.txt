 Reply 328 on August 24 2015 073518 PM  Didnt really think Putin was falsely fagging Oh well The Assassination of Russia  FSB false flag bombings of 1999 httpsyoutubey9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999 a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities killing 293 people and causing widespread panic Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year httpwwwhistorycommonsorgcontextjspitema092299ryazanbomba092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22 1999 several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow observe three strangers at the entrance of their building The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement The residents notice that the cars plate has been partially covered with paper although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath They decide to call the local police After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month see September 9 1999 and September 13 1999 their vigilance is understandable When the police arrive around 900 pm they uncover what appears to be huge bomb three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 530 am The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material it appears to be hexagen the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks The residents are evacuated Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB In an apparent oversight the FSB fails to collect the detonator which is photographed by the local police The following morning September 23 the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police Police comb the city and find the suspects car A telephone operator for longdistance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told Split up and each of you make your own way out To the polices astonishment the number called belongs to the FSB Later this day the massive manhunt succeeds the suspects are arrested But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials On Moscows orders they are quietly released On September 24 the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger Ryazan residents thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors are outraged local authorities protest that they were not informed However the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta reignites the controversy see February 20 2000 and Fall 1999 The governments explanations will fail to convince skeptics see March 23 2000 The Ryazan incident later becomes the

worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked sugar see Fall 1999 The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev but the Novaya Gazeta reporter
