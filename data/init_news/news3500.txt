willing to take a risk on someone who is outside the system and who could be disruptive to the system And could he and Donald Trump be any more different said J Ann Selzer president of the Iowa polling firm that conducted the Iowa poll about Carsons surge in the polls Part of what Carson has going for him is that he started coming to Iowa last year People have already gotten a feel for who is and what he stands forCarson has a dedicated cadre of volunteers helping with the campaign and his super PAC and a huge presence on social media with 26 million Facebook followers who get daily video updates from the campaign leadership Followers also get the chance to have three questions answered each evening by the campaignWe have a very aggressive approach to Facebook said Doug Watts communications director for the campaignSo when the campaign had a recent event in Phoenix to talk about border issues they were able to tap into their social media network and donor list and draw a crowd of 12000 Watts said Carson has attracted 2000 to 3000 people at recent events in Iowa and ColoradoWere looking at an event in Orange County next week We drew a 40mile radius around the event site and came up with 50000 people who had donated to the campaign he saidRita Davenport of Boone Iowa may not have donated money to Carsons campaign but shes putting in three to four hours every night to help out bymaking phone calls walking in parades and setting up events for Carson in IowaEven after working her fulltime job as an instructor and counselor at Des Moines Area Community College shes ready to organize another forum with black ministers for Carson in Des MoinesI talked with people in the ministry and well be doing more of those types of forums because hes really the kind of person who wants to keep reaching out she said Every waking moment that Im not in my office Im trying to do stuff to help get Dr Carson electedAs an African American Davenport said shes been aware of Carson for years calling him a living legend who sparked her interest even more when he challenged the policies of President Obama during a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 while the president sat nearby It was that speaking truth to power that got her pumped about the prospect of a Carson candidacy and its an attribute that she continues to see at campaign events in IowaI see people who are really prayerful and very family friendly at these events she said And he proves that he can get his point across without yelling and calling people namesIndeed Mary Buerger 88 of Hillsdale Mich said shes already tired of Donald Trump who she calls a foghorn whos way too off the cuffBuerger is one of more than 275000 unique donors who have given to Carsons campaign pitching in 325 for the retired neurosurgeon who grew up in poverty on the rough and tumble southwest side of Detroit The campaign raised 9 million in July and August and 20 million overall since Carson entered the race in MayWhile there are things she likes about Florida Sen Marco Rubio Kentucky Sen Rand Paul Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker Carson remains her focus When she gets polling information in the mail asking her to rank her top three candidates she only has one name to shareHe has a method of speaking which is not confrontational but hes very clear in his positions He doesnt turn people off with the first few words that he says she said Weve gotten to be so very confrontational and so badly divided that we need himIt doesnt matter that he doesnt have political experience In fact thats a plus for BuergerHe isnt beholden like the people who have made their mark in government I think its hard for people to have that independence she addedSelzer said policy positions and political experience are not essential for Iowa voters yetThe majority of the people are saying I trust them to figure it out when they get to the White House which says a lot about the mood of the voters she said
