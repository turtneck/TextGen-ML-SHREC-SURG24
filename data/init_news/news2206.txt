Knoxville Tennessee CNN President Barack Obamas ambitious proposal to give millions of Americans more affordable access to a community college education and what he called a ticket to the middle class is unlikely to become law any time soonHis plan is to partner with states and fund the first two years of community college for Americans willing to work for it The White House will work to push this plan through Congress in the next few weeks Obama promisedBut with a roughly 60 billion price tag over the next 10 years the proposal may have little chance of getting through the wall of Republican deficit hawks that now control both houses of CongressLamar Alexander and Bob Corker both Republican senators from Tennessee joined Obama on Air Force One and at the community college during Obamas speech but neither want Obamas plan to become federal lawThats despite the fact that Obama called his proposal bipartisan noting that similar policies have been implemented by Tennessees Republican governor and Chicagos Democratic Mayor Rahm EmanuelAsked whether he would support Obamas proposal Corker said Oh no no no no no instead urging other states to take the presidents initiative and do something similar themselves rather than create a whole new bureaucratic federal programSen Alexander chairman of the Senates education committee and the former education secretary echoed that in a statement on Friday saying states should follow Tennessees leadObamas proposal dubbed Americas College Promise wouldnt be the first broadsweeping proposition that didnt get far in Washington but aided by a presidential push  could still make inroads throughout the country by way of state and local initiativesIts not necessarily all about bills and funding said Maines Sen Angus King who serves on the Senate Budget Committee Sometimes its about the bully pulpit and raising the profile of an issueKing an independent who caucuses with Democrats pointed to the Presidents previous ambitious proposal for universal early childhood education in 2013 It hasnt produced results on Capitol Hill but has spurred attempts to provide PreK education in Kings state of MaineAnd while Congress hasnt raised the federal minimum wage since Obama called for an increase during last years State of the Union dozens of states and municipalities have since passed laws to create a higher minimum wage on their ownSetting the national agenda is an important part of what the presidency is King saidKing said Obama is definitely in the target zone with his proposal but said there would be a challenge to find the 60 billion which he called a big number While he supports Obamas idea King said he wouldnt endorse the proposal outright until he reviews the plans funding mechanism which remains a massive question markAnd King was thrilled to learn that Obama committed in his speech to working with Alexander on a bill King cosponsored that would shrink the size of the federal student aid application form which has more than a hundred questions  something college affordability advocates have pushed for in recent yearsObamas proposal would give states a huge break  with the federal government picking up threequarters of the cost of waiving community college tuition for the first two years and leaving states to fund the restStates would have to do their part too For those willing to do the work and for states and local communities who want to be a part of it it could be a game changer Obama saidEmphasizing that there are no free rides in America free tuition would be contingent on students getting good grades enrolling at parttime and following through on earning their degreeDeputy White House Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters on Air Force One recognized that the 60 billion plan was a significant investmentBut its one the president believes is worthwhile because we need to make sure that Americas young people are getting the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy Schultz saidObama modeled the proposal on a Tennessee program started under Republican Gov Bill Haslam a year agoWhy not just build on something that works Obama said at Pellissippi State Community College on FridayHaslam launched the Tennessee Promise a program that covers the cost of tuition and fees of a certificate or degree at any of the states community colleges after students already kick in whatever financial aid they can getBut higher education experts stress that the Tennessee program doesnt make a community college education free since students incur many other costs to attend college  from living expenses to lost wagesLauren Asher President of The Institute for College Access  Success said Obamas plan is different and she said better since it would waive tuition costs and let students use federal aid like Pell Grants for the neediest students go toward expenses other than tuitionAnd Obamas focus on community colleges was also a welcome message just one of the many steps the administration has taken to address college access and affordability Asher saidThe President is rightly calling attention to the importance and value of community colleges and of education and training after high school Asher said What the President is proposing has the potential to help lowincome studentsNicholas Wyman CEO of the Institute for Workplace Skills and Innovation a consulting firm called Obamas focus on community colleges and skillsdriven vocational training a muchneeded step to boost the US economyThe number of job openings could halve the unemployment rate but a massive gap between the skills of prospective employees and those in demand is holding the economy back And by elevating community colleges Obama is helping to destigmatize what many view as bottomrung institutionsCompanies want to employ people with strong academics but they also want to employ people with strong workplace skills A lot of the community colleges offer that and unfortunately a lot of the four year colleges dont Wyman said This is an opportunity to move the community college system into the 21st centuryObama also hit on a note that is a focus of Wymans consulting firm addressing the need to connect community colleges and employers who could benefit from the neatlytailored skills of a community college graduateAnd even if Obamas proposal flops in Washington Wyman who has travelled around the country asserted that states are hungry for reformsTheres a lot of states who would look at this and often as you know states dont like being told what to do Wyman said and maybe theyll now take the initiative themselves
