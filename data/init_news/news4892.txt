Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination Thursday when a ragtag group of unbound delegates announced they were going to support him All the networks ran with breaking news and trained their cameras on an empty podium for hours waiting for Trump to appear before the press and bak in his glory It was a magical moment True everyone had known for weeks now that Trump was going to be the nomineesince all of his rivals have dropped out of the racebut why let that stand in the way of an opportunity to obsess over his every incoherent insult and rant As they waited the big topic of conversation among the TV chatterers wasan interview by Howard Fineman with Trumps campaign chairman and chief strategist Paul Manafort And it was admittedly a doozyWhen I wrote about Manafort earlierI concentrated on his long history of working with slash and burn political consultants and foreign tyrants He is uniquely qualified to head up Trumps operation But its been a while since hes been involved in American politics and it was unclear if he had lost his touch The interview with Fineman raises more questions about that than it answersFineman quotes Manafort saying that he thinks this election will be a cakewalkThats the kind of confidence one would expect of a Trump adviser But its a little bit weird considering he also says you dont change Donald Trump You dont manage him That sounds like a contradiction in terms  if they cant manage Trump then its hard to see how this race isnt going to be a challenge since the man is a walking time bombManafort made some policy news by saying that Trump was likely going to soften his policy on banning Muslims explaining that this was just a negotiating stance The truth is thatTrump himself has said that before But at this point he has been on so many sides of every issue nobody can keep track so it means something when his chief strategist validates one of themIts also the case that if theres one issue which the GOP establishment particularly wants Trump to back away from its the Muslim ban There are good reasons for this of course Its UnAmerican for one thing although that would not normally bother Republican officials More likely its that they actually recognize that Trumps idiotic unworkable proposal is so inflammatory that its going to get people killed Unfortunately once they are back home campaigning theyre going to hear from their Trumploving constituents thatthis is one of their favorite policiesIf these officials have any integrity which is unlikely they will try to educate their voters about how dangerous it is but I wouldnt hold my breathAccording to Manafort Trumps other big crowd pleaser the wall will be built come what may and he will not soften his stance on immigration He was spinning like a top  or he really is out of touch  because he told Fineman that its only in places like New York and California where the American Latinos are all radicals who care about such things In Ohio and Florida theyll be happy to vote for TrumpThat is delusional According torecent national polling by Latino decisions he has an 87 unfavorable rating In Floridahe does better than he does nationally Only 84 of Latinos view him unfavorablyIn Nevada a state which he dishonestly claims voted for him in huge numbers in the primary and uses a proof of his tremendous appeal among Latinos he also has an 87 unfavorable rating Manafort thinks they will be able to turn that round by talking to them about jobs national security terrorism and education because their concerns are the same as white families Of course white families arent concerned about having their friends and relatives rounded up and dumped in the Sonoran desertwhich Trump has indicated he thinks is a terrific ideaLatinos are certainly concerned about terrorism But they may define it just a little bit differently than Trump doesManafort said that Trump was unlikely to choose a woman or a racial or ethnic minority for VP because that would be pandering That would be very wrong needless to say Unlike Trump tweeting out a picture of himself eating a taco bowl from the Trump Tower grill on Cinco de Mayo saying he loves Hispanics But then the job of Vice President is going to be very very important in a Trump administration according to Manafort so they arent going to take any chances He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesnt want to do He seems himself more as the chairman of the board than even the CEO let alone the COO I guess nobodys told Trump that you dont get to write the job description yourself Im pretty sure the job of president is to be the one who makes all the big decisions Its not the person who just calls Fox and Friends negotiates the trade deals and bombs the shit out of ISIS You dont get to pick what presidential duties you want to do and delegate the rest to your peons Sure some presidents like Reagan and George W Bush were less handson than others but they didnt redefine the presidency as a Chairman of the board who picks and chooses the duties he spends his time on In the end it probably doesnt matter what Manafort says anyway The campaign is all over the place with infighting and jockeying for position among the various players This week Rick Wiley the highly experienced political operative Manafort brought on board just six weeks ago was let go in a power struggle with a Florida campaign staffer and friend of Manafort rival campaign manager Corey LewandowskiAccording to Politico For weeks Wiley made appointments and had discussions with Florida Republicans and appeared to be building a new campaign from scratch sources say They say he refused at times to return Giornos calls or take them Giorno then began calling other Trump campaign officials to ask them whether Wiley had it out for her or for everyone On Thursday word leaked back to Trump He phoned Giorno concerned sources said Tell me whats wrong Trump asked her according to one person familiar with the call Karen unloaded on Wiley the source said Mr Trump is loyal He believed her  Rick picked a fight with the wrong person At that point Trump ordered Wiley to stay away from Giorno and to neither call nor email her Donald is loyal And shes loyal a source said Donald Trump is running his presidential campaign like a junior high school cheerleading squad And this is the man who claims his business savvy is what qualifies him for the presidency Paul Manafort assured Fineman however that we could all rest easy about Trump being ready for the big job Does he know enough Yes because he knows he has more to learn And he is constantly doing that Trump doesnt read briefing papers but he is a magnet for information Manafort said He reads the newspapers and he talks on the phone and to office visitors in a neverending stream Youre sitting there in his office and you realize that he is constantly picking up stuff as he goes We have all this survey research but he does his own soundings all the time all day every day And hes more accurate Manafort said He watches all the shows and obsessively reads his Twitter feed too It should be obvious by this time that Trump has absolutely no idea what hes doing and is making it up as he goes along Paul Manafort is experienced at dealing with this sort of character and seems quite comfortable doing it But the campaign is a mess and thats because the candidate is a vainglorious buffoon who has no clue what hes doing and thinks hes a genius I wouldnt bet on Manafort lasting through the duration
