Representatives since 2011 making him second in line for the presidency behind the vice president On September 25 Boehner told colleagues hes stepping down as speaker and will leave Congress at the end of October Look back at his career in politics so farThe move came without warning as House Republicans were in a closeddoor meeting to select their nominee for speaker with McCarthys wife and kids in the room Boehner subsequently postponed the voteI think I shocked some of you huh McCarthy told reporters following the decisionIf were going to unite and be strong we need a new face to do that McCarthy said adding that he did not want to win the race on the House floor with only enough votes to squeak byA source close to McCarthy told CNN the decision to drop out came down to numbers pure and simple adding that he had the votes to win the conference vote but there just wasnt a path to 218  the number of votes needed to lock down the speakership on the House floorThe uncertain future of House GOP leadership comes less than a month before Congress must take action to raise the debt ceiling to keep the US from defaulting on its debt obligations  a critical vote conservatives have in the past sought to stall in order to pull concessions from DemocratsAsked if that affected his decision McCarthy acknowledged Well that wasnt helpfulRep Dana Rohrabacher RCalifornia described McCarthys move as courageous saying this is exciting for the party because there is now a wide open race for speakerBecause of his verbal blunder last week there were some of us that were very apprehensive and this going to create great unity among Republicans Rohrabacher saidMeanwhile not one to miss an opportunity GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested he was partly responsible for McCarthys failed bid days after he suggested McCarthy wasnt tough enough for the jobTheyre giving me a lot of credit for that because I said you really need someone very very tough and very smart Ya know smart goes with tough I know tough people that arent smart thats the worst We need smart we need tough we need the whole package Trump said at a campaign stop Thursday in Las VegasThe announcement immediately set off a round of speculation about who could win the job Perennial candidates floated included Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and South Carolina Rep Trey Gowdy  both of whom ruled it out explicitly Several House Republicans said Georgia Rep Lynn Westmoreland was considering it and others suggested Oregon Rep Greg Walden the chairman of the National Republican Congressional CommitteeI would consider it Walden said when asked by CNN about members floating his name for speaker But he said hes not actively campaigning and noted that some are pushing the idea of an interim speaker Several candidates have suggested a senior or retiring member should serve as speaker for the next 14 months and pledge to not run again Rohrabacher suggested Texas Rep Joe Barton or Kentucky Rep Hal RogersBoehner said in a statement he will remain in his post until a new speaker is elected though he has yet to announce the date for the new voteIm confident we will elect a new speaker in the coming weeks Our conference will work together to ensure we have the strongest team possible as we continue to focus on the American peoples priorities he said in a written statementBoehner also canceled a scheduled appearance Thursday night on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon an NBC spokeswoman saidRepublican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores twice dodged reporters questions about whether he would rule out his own run but also spoke against the idea of a caretakerAn interim will not give us the opportunity to cast that big bold vision that we need Interims are caretakers caretakers tend to do safe things Flores said The electorate put us here in November of 2014 to take big steps and we need to find the leader that will help us take those big steps  The other thing that happens with interim is you have people trying to run for the permanent position and so you have all the distractions weve gone through the last two weeks We dont need thatRep Jason Chaffetz who late last week jumped into the speakers race called an impromptu news conference less than an hour after Republicans began pouring out of the GOP conference meeting The Utah Republican said he was also absolutely stunned surprised and shockedChaffetz said he would continue to campaign for the top House post and said we need to find somebody that our whole body can unite behind and do what were elected to doI do believe it is time for a fresh start That was the whole genesis for my campaign but we need to have a lot more family discussion he said I think we have a lot of internal fracturing thats happening And we need to figure out a way to unite the partyWestmoreland joked said he is thinking about it joking that Id like to talk to my wife firstAsked why he thought he could get 218 votes he said I dont know that I can but all I can say is Im willing to tryRyan the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and someone who had been viewed as a contender for the job immediately said he is not interestedWhile I am grateful for the encouragement Ive received I will not be a candidate I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Ryan said in a statementWith conservatives again floating his name Gowdy said he will not run for speaker Asked if he would reconsider and join the race if his GOP colleagues urged him to get in he replied NoRep Tim Huelskamp a Kansas Republican and member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus that opposed McCarthys bid said the decision creates a brand new race for speakerI am not the one McCarthy told the stunned Republicans in the meeting according to HuelskampHuelskamp also took shots at McCarthy saying the majority leader was campaigning for the top post until three hours ago and said the lack of advance notice was characteristic of the stunts that have defined Boehners leadership as speaker  including his surprise resignation the day after Pope Francis addressed a joint meeting of CongressAnd just as McCarthy got a brief heads up moments before that announcement McCarthy also gave Boehner notice shortly before Thursdays conference meeting a Boehner aide told CNNMembers had no indication the move was coming Totally stunned Rep Peter King RNew York said on CNNWestmoreland met with McCarthy in his office this afternoon and said he didnt expect him to endorse anyoneWhat Kevin has done is extremely selfless and I think hes done a brave and courageous thing said Rep Louie Gohmert RTexas He was close to being right there and he chose to unite the conference rather than waging battles Speaking on CNN Rep Walter Jones said the current unrest reminds him of the late 1990s Newt Gingrich stepped down as speaker and Rep Bob Livingston was selected to take over but quickly removed himself from consideration after it was revealed he had an extramarital affairJones told CNN that he was looking out for the institution and not pointing fingers at anyone in particularI think when a person has been a member of the Congress  which is a very sacred duty quite frankly in my opinion  and they are elevated to become a leader of a party  could be either party Republican or Democrat  that those in leadership must be above reproach Jones saidAnd all I was doing not trying to single anybody out but was to say in this makeup of office  the majority office and the speakers office  all the members should be made to say I have nothing in my background that could be of embarrassment to the Republican conference the House of Representatives or the American people he added Thats all this was about
