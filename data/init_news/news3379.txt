The far left is up in arms again this time over a hacked tape of Hillary Clinton at a fundraiser in a wealthy Virginia suburbThere I was watching college football and the Ryder Cup as my daughter sat next to me on the couch drawing Rapunzel and Ariel Halftime of the game I was watching came so I moseyed over to my office to look in on the political world expecting not much new at 5 oclock on a Saturday Didnt see much at first And then oh whats this Something about basement dwellers And Hillary Making fun of people living in basements What Oh Christ Here we go againBackstory The Intercept the I think its fair to say antiClintonthoughbynomeansproTrump web site got a tapeof a talk Clinton gave at a private fundraiser in McLean Virginia back in February No check that It looks like the Washington Free Beacon got it first and posted it Tuesday But the conservative Beacon reflecting house priorities led with the fact that Clinton evidently said on the tape that she wouldnt upgrade the nuclear arsenal which for the Beacon indicates of course that she wants America to loseAfter that Im not certain what happened but it seems as if after the Beacon published the audio a couple Intercept reporters were the first people on the left who got around to listening to it The Intercept account as you might guess didnt give a rats pooper about the nuclear arsenal but led with the fact that Clinton said somewhat unfortunatelybut in context only somewhat for reasons Ill explainthat she occupies the centerleft to the centerrightThat was a responsible and for the Intercept predictable and understandable way to play the story But then by the time it got to the Twittersphere Clinton was somehow making fun of Sanderistas mocking them for being such losers that theyre living in their parents basements The hashtag basementdwellers was trending like mad when I checked in and Id imagine itll be going strong all night I read a few of them which boiled down to fuck you Hillary you corporate hack this is why we need the revolution and youre going to be the first to face the firing squad although I thought I smelled a lot of trolling from the deplorable caucus tooOf all the arrant bullshit Ive seen on Twitter this election this is easily the bullshittiest She insulted no one In fact quite the oppositefor someone speaking behind closed doors to ardent supporters she was not only restrained but she openly and directly asked her supporters to be patient with the impatient that is to understand the views and motivations of the younger people who wanted more radical changeIt is important to recognize whats going on in this election Everybody whos ever been in an election that Im aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of on the one hand the kind of populist nationalist xenophobic discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates And on the other side theres just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college free healthcare that what weve done hasnt gone far enough and that we just need to you know go as far as you know Scandinavia whatever that means and half the people dont know what that means but its something that they deeply feel So as a friend of mine said the other day I am occupying from the centerleft to the centerright And I dont have much company there Because it is difficult when youre running to be president and you understand how hard the job isI dont want to overpromise I dont want to tell people things that I know we cannot doSome are new to politics completely Theyre children of the Great Recession And they are living in their parents basement They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves And they dont see much of a future I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said You know none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college And we dont believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics And so ifyoure feeling like youre consigned to you know being a barista or you know some other job that doesnt pay a lot and doesnt have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it then the idea that maybe just maybe you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be you know a wet blanket on idealism We want people to be idealistic We want them to set big goals But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goalsAll right Lets parse them In the first quote the first sentence is just an opener and the second critiques the Trump movement The third sentence critiques the Sanders people but theres nothing condescending in it Maybe that whatever that means after the mention of Scandinavia is a little dismissive But really Now were at the point where were not permitting people speaking in private the occasional verbal tic of the sort we all employThen comes centerleft and centerright Its the mention of centerright that the Intercept meant to rub in her face and in a perfect world Id rather shed not said it But its quite obvious that she is contrasting herself with the movements to her left and to her rightthe very two movements she had just described So she was really just saying Im in between those two And who knowsthere were probably Republicans in the room It was McLean She may have been trying to reassure them and get them to tell their friends You know we can live with her No thats not pandering Its politics If she werent chasing responsible Republican votes shed be an idiotNow the second and offending graf How in the world these words can offend anyone is just absurd OK baristas But Im sure even most baristas have higher aspirations in life But the main thing is that when she says they are living in their parents basement shes obviously not making fun of them Shes just describing them Indeed she is explaining to these rich people in one of Americas richest towns hey take a minute to understand where these folks are coming from And shes doing so the week after Sanders throttled her in New Hampshirea point in time when if anything shed have been prone to lash out at themTheres nothing patronizing about any of this I also saw a bunch of people on Twitter saying in effect for the life of me I dont see what the big deal is here I retweeted a guy who said the basementdwellers controversy is proof enough of the reason why she didnt release her speech transcripts Amen to that
