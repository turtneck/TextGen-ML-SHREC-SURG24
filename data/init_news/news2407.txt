infrastructure according to WarrenWarren said the strikes going on today in eastern Syria against the oil refineries require replacement parts that ISIS doesnt have and parts that if ordered could be tracked by the coalitionWe wanted them broken longer said Warren when asked why the strikes did not occur earlier Warren said strikes in the past year produced damage to infrastructure that was easy to replaceA senior military source told Fox News Emwazi was being tracked by the drone for most of the day Thursday while he met with other people The source said the strike took place shortly after Emwazi came out of a building in Raqqa when he was IDd and engagedSky News citing sources inside Raqqa reported that Emwazi was badly hurt in the air strike but still alive when he was brought to the

enjoyed threatening Western hostages Spanish journalist Javier Espinosa who had been held in Syria for more than six months after his abduction in September 2013 said Emwazi would explain precisely how the militants would carry out a beheadingThose being held by three Britishsounding captors nicknamed them the Beatles with Jihadi John a reference to Beatles member John Lennon Espinosa said in

of the gruesome videos with a political rant and a kneeling hostage before him then ended it holding an oversize knife in his hand with the headless victim lying before him in the sandA counterterror analyst told Fox News that Emwazi became so soughtafter following his appearances in the beheading videos that he was shunned by ISIS leadership The analyst said Emwazi had become the Typhoid Mary of the terror group noting that his presence had prompted airstrikes on meetings buildings and other commandersBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday the drone action was a strike at the heart of ISIS as well as an act of selfdefense and the right thing to doCameron said Britain has been working with the United States literally around the clock to track him downThis was a combined effort he said And the contribution of both our countries was essentialSecretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Tunisia Friday that extremists need to know this Your days are numbered and you will be defeatedSotloffs parents Art and Shirley Sotloff responding to the reports that Emwazi was killed issued a statement that said This development doesnt change anything for us its too little too late

they might be alive today  Haines daughter Bethany Haines told Sky News Friday that she felt an instant sense of relief when she heard Emwazi may have been killed She said her feeling was because of knowing he wouldnt appear in any more horrific videosEmwazi was identified as Jihadi John last February although a lawyer who once represented Emwazis father told reporters that there was no evidence supporting the accusation Experts and others later confirmed the identificationEmwazi was born in Kuwait and spent part of his childhood in the poor Taima area of Jahra before moving to Britain while still a boy according to news reports quoting Syrian activists who knew the family He attended state schools in London then studied computer science at the University of Westminster before leaving for Syria in 2013 The woman who had been the principal at Londons Quintin Kynaston Academy told the BBC earlier this year that Emwazi had been quiet and reasonably hardworkingOfficials said Britains intelligence community had Emwazi on its list of potential terror suspects for years but was unable to prevent him from traveling to Syria He had been known to the nations intelligence services since at least 2009 when he was connected with investigations into terrorism in SomaliaThe beheading of Foley 40 of Rochester New Hampshire was deemed by IS to be its response to US airstrikes The release
