fingers Clinton is reported to have told Tim ONeill formerly of SJU Wall Street Trading Room and Credit Suisse following a paid speechClinton apparently then went on to recommend that the financial sector take a leading role in setting out regulations for their own troubled industry The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry Theres nothing magic about regulations too much is bad too little is badLess than one year earlier Democratic media adviser Mandy Grunwald suggested to Podesta in another communication leaked Monday that Clinton should take a conciliatory tone with regard to Wall StreetI would include something from the Maggie Haberman piece on HRCs Goldman Sachs speech writes GrunwaldSomething like When HRC recently spoke to bankers at Goldman Sachs instead of holding them accountable for their activities that crashed the economy she told them that banker bashing was foolish and had to stop She said soothing that we all got into our economic problems togetherIllegal ivory as leverage on China Hillary Clinton directed her nowcampaign chair Podesta to use reports of illegal elephant tusk smuggling by Chinese government

how Chinese delegates reportedly smuggled home poached ivory from TanzaniaA message from Clintons hrod17clintonemailcom opens by praising Podestas teasing of reporters and flashes of a smile at a

to stop the trade in illegal wildlife products is also mentionedClinton totally blew crime question New York Mayor Bill de Blasio thought Clinton totally blew a debate question about her support for a controversial federal crime bill passed by her husbandIn a March 2016 email  de Blasio was less than impressed with Clintons attempt to pass off a question on mass incarceration to her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders back in MarchHillary was fantastic on the gun control answer then totally blew the mass incarceration question de Blasio wrote to PodestaThe question was posed during a live CNN debate by anchor Don Lemon who asked Clinton why black people should trust her to end a pattern of mass incarceration when she supported a 1994 law which many blame for locking up a generation of black menClinton began her answer by reminding people that Sanders also supported the bill a tactic which appears to have irked Mayor de BlasioWhy on Earth did she say Are you going to ask Senator Sanders that question instead of just addressing the issue de Blasio wroteWhen she makes it about her she loses the high ground Stating the obvious I know but she keeps doing itPodesta brothers plan to influence India on NGO clampdown Podesta sought to enlist the help of his lobbyist brother to influence an Indian Intelligence Bureau crackdown on Greenpeace and a key donor the Ford Foundation Mondays leaked emails revealCorrespondence between John and Tony Podesta from May 2015 show the pair planned a lunch with the Indian ambassador to discuss a very serious situation facing Greenpeace in which the Indian government accused the group of financial irregularities The claims eventually led to the cancellation of its license to operate thereThe bid to influence Indias decisionmaking came at the request of Karen Sack managing director of conservation group Ocean Unite who asked if John Podesta could get in touch with his brother at The Podesta GroupApparently The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in the US but Kumi Naidoo Greenpeace executive director has no way to reach Tony or another principal Sack writesJohn Podesta forwarded the small request to his brother highlighting Kumi Naidoos large following globallyWant to talk to the head of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo is a very well known South African with a big international following but I think the GOI Government of India likely to stick it to themHe also explained he was trying to use his influence to help the Ford Foundation charity which had similarly got on the wrong side of GOI However he expressed a belief that their issue can be more easily resolvedA reply from Tony Podesta proposes a lunch with an Indian ambassador as well as confirmation he would be happy to talk to GreenpeaceA leaked July 2015 email about funding shows Podesta describing global charity the Ford Foundation as a  mainstay  for the Center for American Progress thinktank which he founded in 2003Clintons emails could either win 49 states or lose 49 states As previously reported  in March of 2015 Clintons camp were debating whether Hillary should make a joke about her email situationStaffers were nervous about the potentially nuts move and in freshly leaked correspondence sought advice from Philippe Reines  a former senior adviser from Clintons days as Secretary of State and someone who was likely privy to the contents of said emailsTrust me most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with Read in total by America she would either win 49 states or lose 49 states I go back and forth said ReinesBut I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke because email retention  Benghazi he warnedWe cant jam State to release them at this point but if Dan Schwerin Clintons speech writer can think of a light way to say I am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read whats in them as a way to better understand that work Reines suggestedBernie Sanders is a Jerk We have previously reported about the agreement between Bernie Sanders and Clinton Campaign We have also previously reported about Hillarys others insults
