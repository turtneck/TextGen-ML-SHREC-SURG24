One of the themes of this election cycle in America is clarity God is showing us what weve become Clearly With each passing political curveball and October surprise painful and embarrassing clarity abounds Weve learned and are continuing to learn a lot about our Christian leaders Same goes for our concepts of freedom liberty justice peace and security none of which do we dare understand much less pursue in an explicitly biblical manner anymore We have quite thoroughly rejected Christ as King We claim him often as Savior but have no intent on serving Him as King in practicepolitical practice legal practice educational practice economic practice or pretty much any other kind of practices Hes our favorite trinket and little more Thats the brutally ugly bottom line being emphasized and highlighted and pointed out again and again by God right now in America The grace God is showing in the provision of this clarity is something thats easy to miss and easy to want to miss  since said clarity serves as just the sort of detailed inescapable and unassailable indictment that wed prefer didnt exist But it does exist And Hes waving it in front of our eyes Hes giving us detail upon pathetic detail and revelation after ugly revelation Hes stacking them high and giving us chance after chance after undeserved chance to acknowledge and repent of that which is being made excruciatingly and redundantly plain All we need do is take off our blinders and look at the whole picture plainly presented before us in its crystal clear wideopen totality as it actually exists rather than focusing on distractions and little snippets out of context while ignoring the building mountains of truths that deep down we know are fatal to the narratives we prefer over reality If we simply look at the whole picture through the lens of a basic biblical worldview well have no trouble at all seeing why were circling the drain as a culture and why we deserve to do so Just look at what were into Hope and changeapart from submission to Christ as King  Making America great againapart from submission to Christ as King  Supporting public schoolseven though Staterun childrens education is inherently antiChrist is literally designed to promote an increasingly antiChrist population and is based upon an approach to the pursuit of knowledge aka education lifted directly from the serpents tongue in Genesis 3  Preserving Social Securityeven though the flagrantly socialistMarxist construct encourages the State to claim yet another role assigned to family and church thus growing the power of the State and making the masses more dependent upon the State  Maintainingexpanding a gigantic globespanning militaryeven though we are supposedly broke and are open proud champions of socialism Marxism Satanism homosexuality and any number of fundamentally antiChrist concepts  Maintaining our imagined freedom and liberty to produce market and consume porneven though the God who defines and sustains all true liberty and freedom despises these things and promises to crush those who defend them  Maintaining our imagined right to murder our own children for convenience or for no reason at alleven though the God who authored and sustains human life despises child sacrifice and has promised to crush civilizations that embrace it  Maintaining our imagined right to marry someone of the same gendereven though the God who sustains all true rights and defines marriage calls such relationships abominations and routinely destroys cultures that promote them  Being ever ready to pledge on cue our personal allegiance to the indivisible political power ruling over us all in the name of a love for America which has been made into our ruling idoleven though no such pledge would even be considered by an actual American Founding Father The mere fact of their Founding Father status confirms that they did not believe in the indivisible political power of the state and the fact that we now pledge our allegiance to such power on command by reciting an oath written by a Socialist in the 1800s for the purpose of selling American flags to public schools says a whole lot about how profoundly confused and easily manipulated weve become since the time of the Founding Fathers  Believing that We the People must submit to the systems placed above usno matter how wildly antiChristian they become This has been promoted through a Hitlerian approach to Romans 13 and other passages from Scripture as embraced by the vast majority of even the most conservative Bible believing church leaders in the land  We must support the lesser of two evils offered to us by the system under which we are told we must live as good Americansno matter how vile sinister vulgar corrupt and overtly antiChrist those options may be See Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Obviously this is a list that could go on for a while but well pause it here and assume that you get the picture We bring these items to focus again in light of an article recently published entitled Once the hope candidate Obama in his final days faces a hopeless electorate  wherein The Washington Post noted how we live in an age of hopelessness on many levels as we roll from the Obama era on into the Trump or Clinton followup The hopelessness that has been inspired by our approach to law liberty truth justice economics politics and everything else has been building for hundreds of years Contrary to what pagan political prognosticators of the day would have us believe the current cultural wreckage is not something that can be understood much less corrected by pagan unbelieving means There is and will never be hope for law apart from submission to Christ as King in practice There is and will never be hope for education apart from submission to Christ as King in practice There is and will never be hope for economics apart from submission to Christ as King in practice There is and will never be hope for culture and civilization apart from submission to Christ as King in practice Thats how things work in Gods creation America included Until we understand this and repent accordingly our hopelessness will only deepen and our implosion will only continue May God grace His people with the clarity to see repent live and thrive accordingly in this remarkable timeeven as an unrepentant American empire crumbles around them Article posted with permission from Fire Breathing Christian Dont forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook  Google Plus   Twitter  You can also get Freedom
