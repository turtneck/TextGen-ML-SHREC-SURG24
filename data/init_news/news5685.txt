From the moment the HBO series The Jinx made its debut it has been called the new Serial Both the series and the podcastare about unsolved murders Both let viewers into the process of uncovering what happened Bothtell stories so compelling its easy to sometimes forget the characters are realBut on Saturday HBO achieved something Serial never could The subject of its sixepisode documentaryThe Jinx The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst has been arrestedRobert Durst a New York realestate heir is known for his alleged connection to three deaths his wife who went missing in 1982 his neighbor who was dismembered in2001 and a close friend who was shotin the head in 2000Until Saturday the 71yearold has walked freeOn March 8 HBO aired the fifth and penultimate episode of The Jinx which included a previously uncovered piece of evidence On the eve of the finale Durst was arrested in New Orleans in connection to the murder of his friend Susan Berman a little more than 14 years ago Sunday night the final episode aired In its closing minutes Durst says What the hell did I do Killed them all of courseHe was not speaking to the camera and was seemingly unaware his words were being recorded  but he had left his microphone on while using the bathroomThe Jinx director says he gave authorities the killed them all audio months agoEarlier in the day Dursts attorney Chip Lewis told The Post Hes maintained his innocence for 10 years now Nothing has changed It is unclear whether Lewis knew about Dursts bathroom comments or whether the recording will be admissible in courtThe attorney accused prosecutors and the documentarys director Andrew Jarecki of timing the arrest as a publicity stunt for the last episode In January Jarecki all but promised TV critics and reporters that the The Jinx would end with a satisfying conclusion  something many thought Serial lacked because host Sarah Koenig ended the podcast with no concrete theory The widely publicized arrest and the audio of what could be interpreted as a confession surely fits the bar he setDurst has been a willing participant in the series that may have brought abouthis downfall He spent more than 20 hours in interviews with filmmaker Jarecki who has been researching Durstfor eight years Jareckis 2010 film All Good Things was a fictionalized version of the Durst story in which Ryan Gosling played a somewhatempatheticversion ofa killerIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times Jarecki said that Durst came to him after seeing the film admitting it made him cry three times The two have been working together ever since with Durst agreeing to let Jarecki ask any questionIt wasnt a question that led to the arrest however Inan episode titled Family Values the filmmakersmet withthe stepson of Berman Dursts friend who was found dead on Christmas Eve 2000 Police were led to her body by a letter that told them of a cadaver at her addressThatletter was addressedBeverley Hills Police in block letters Beverly is misspelledAt the end of episode five Bermans stepson shows the filmmakers aletter from Durst to Berman from the March before she was murdered On the envelope Durst wrote Bermans address in block letters He spelled Beverly as BeverleyDurst had known Berman a writer and daughter of a known Las Vegas mobster since they met at the University of California in the 1960s When Dursts wife Kathie went missing in from their house in New York in 1982 Berman assertedDursts innocence to the media In the series Jarecki seems to be hinting that Berman helpedDurst hide Kathies bodyHe asks Durst about his habit of making collect calls to his family company the Durst Organization Soon after Kathie went missing a number of collect calls were made to the company from an area known as the Pine Barrens in New Jersey This heavilywooded land had the reputation of being a dumping ground for the bodies of Mafia victimsAnd what connection is that asks Kevin Hynes the assistant district attorney on the case Well Susan Berman who was very friendly with Durst at the time had a lot of connections and a lot of friends in organized crimeThe filmmakers take you to the places Durst might have been like the Pine Barrens and what they cant show you live footage of they recreate Durst appears on screen to rebut theories and allegations Wearing a grey cable sweater and khaki pants he nearly always speaks calmly like an eccentric 71yearold man recounting an old story notaman from one of the richest families in New York trying to convince you hes not a triplemurdererUntil the final episode Dursthas maintained in the series that he did not kill his wife and does not know where her body is The camera crew had already packed up from the days interviewing but the recorder kept rolling as Durst went to the bathroomIt appears he was talking to himself making comments that included There it is youre caught Youre right of course but you cant imagine Arrest him  What a disaster Im having difficulty with the question Then follows the I killed them all lineFilmmakers told the New York Times they didnt find the recording for more than two yearsDurst admitted to killing one of the three persons that them all could inlude his71yearold neighbor Morris Black In 2001 Durst was living in Galveston Texasdressing as a female to avoid media attention about the reopened investigation of his wifes disappearanceHe testified that his neighbor who he was friends with for a time sneaked into his apartment When a scuffle occurred between the two men Durst shot his neighbor accidentally in selfdefense He then panicked cut up the body with a bow saw and dumped it intoGalveston Bay Blackshead was never foundAfter four days of deliberation the jury acquitted DurstJudge Susan Criss who oversaw the Galveston trial told The Post Sunday she could not be more thrilled that Durst was arrested Presiding over that trial was like watching a slow train wreck The prosecution dropped the ball every step of the way and the defense came prepared Criss saidDurst was eerily calm the judge said and there were times when he even seemed charming She thinksshe was dealing with an exceptionally cunning serial killer a man made all the more dangerous by his financial resourcesI saw the pictures of the cut up body she said That body was cut up like it had been done by a surgeon He knew what sort of tool to use for this bone and that muscle It would have been impossible for someone to do that if it was their first murder attempt That is a cold calculating actThe Durst Organization his familys prominent real estate company also applauded the arrest In a statement to CNBC Dursts brother Douglas said We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has doneDurst has been estranged from his family for years when his father cut him out of the line of succession for the familys real estate empire in 1994 Durst is said to have urinated in his uncles waste basketHis penchant for theatrics might be what drove Durst to allow  and assist  Jareckiin publicly dissecting his lifeHe has a compulsion to tell his story and frankly I think he enjoys the feeling of being at risk the filmmaker told the Los Angeles Times in February He knows that this is a very live ball that he hasnt been prosecuted for two of the three murders that hes been accused ofWe simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and producer Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx HBO said in a statement Years in the making their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Dursts story with the public and law enforcementCoincidence or not theres no doubt the timing of Dursts arrest will leadto a surge in viewers for The Jinx The accused himselfmeanwhile will be sitting in a New Orleans jail cell or on his way back to California to face the murder chargeWell saddle up and head west Dursts lawyer said And handle this one just like we did this last one
