Monday night Bernie Sanders finally did what all runnersup for a presidential nomination are tasked with doing It is not easy and it certainly is humbling ask Hillary Clinton circa 2008 But Sanders rose to the occasion at that Democratic National Convention and gave a fullthroated public endorsement of his rival Clinton before a national audience and the crowd in the Wells Fargo Center in PhiladelphiaThe most awaited speaker of the evening took an awfully long time to mention Hillary Clinton which probably made some Clinton advisors a bit nervous He thanked Mrs Obama Elizabeth Warren his delegates and supporters and donors and the people of Vermont among others before finally getting down to business Based on her leadership and ideas he said Hillary Clinton must become president of the United StatesHis cannily crafted speech melded the familiar themes of his stump speech with an endorsement of Clinton  and it seemed at times in doing so he was allowing his supporters one last moment of collective grief at the end of his movement There were numerous shots of Sanders supporters in tears throughout the hallIt might have seem unusual to some viewers the amount of time devoted on Monday to bringing the party together But remember Sanders was a phenomenon and nothing about his run for the nomination was conventional He deserved every second that he took addressing his supportersConsider that for all the negative press directed at Trumps convention Donald Trump has received a bounce in national polls since last week So the big questions going into the night was whether Sanders would be able to bring his supporters into the Clinton camp and whether the DNC could stage a convincing show of party unity At least on Day 1 it looks like the answer is yes on both countsWhile the Democrats still have some healing to do  as evidenced by the occasional dueling chants of Bernie versus Hillary and edgier variations on those themes  there were significant differences on display between the Republican National Convention last week and the DNC Unlike the RNC every person who took the stage mentioned their partys nominees name  and often Unlike the RNC there was more diversity on the stage tonight than all week in Cleveland And unlike the RNC we saw some serious star power from Eva Longoria to Demi Lovato to Paul Simon Sorry ChachiMonday night also stood in sharp contrast to the RNC because so many of the speakers on stage  which included a disabled person Latinos immigrants and a Muslim American  represented some of the very types of people that Trump has mocked Whats more instead of simply making a case against Trump speaker after speaker made the case for Clinton This is how conventions should be run and shows smart planning by the DNCPerhaps the most courageous moment on Monday night  one which lit up Twitter  came improbably from comedian Sarah Silverman As she and Al Franken vamped for time before Paul Simons performance she set off a fresh round of boos and chants with her sudden remark  to the Bernie or Bust people youre being ridiculous She was right  and it was refreshing to hear her stating what so many Democrats have been thinkingBut it was Michelle Obama who was unquestionably the star of the night She managed to take down Trump without ever mentioning his name and she made a rocksolid case for ClintonI want a president with a record of public service she said before noting as she described the remarkable evolution of the country that she wakes up every day in a house built by slaves Michelle Obama made the critical point that the President has an impact on our children which is something that undecided voters need to hear She showed restraint and class in not joking about or referencing Melania Trump Very wise and gracious to bootUp next Elizabeth Warren whose job was somewhat akin to following Beyonce She was as upfront and persuasive as usual pointing out the dearth of a plan for the country from Trump and noting his opposition to the minimum wage and to lowering student debt Yet she suffered from following the First Lady and on the tail of such an uplifting speech hers felt a bit flatIf there was one thing wrong with the program on Monday night it was that perhaps Michelle Obama should have been scheduled last Though Sanders endorsement was necessary and longawaited it was Mrs Obamas speech that was the real home run Her speech was one for the ages and should have closed out Day 1Still the overall the messages of inclusion and hope tonight likely left many viewers feeling more optimistic than they did after watching the doomful RNCThere were indeed legitimate concerns that the Democratic National Convention might not kick off with the harmony that the Clinton campaign envisionedHowever as it as it turned out the takeaway from Day One of DNC 2016 seems to be that they are one raucous if slightly dysfunctional family
