CNN The search for EgyptAir Flight 804 continues amid contradicting reports about the aircrafts final momentsAfter it disappeared en route from Paris to Cairo last week some debris from the plane  including life vests personal belongings and parts of wreckage  has been recoveredSmall fragments of human remains have also been found and officials in the Egyptian capital are trying to identify and match them to victims Families of the victims have nearly completed giving DNA samples to help with the grim task EgyptAirs vice chairman Ahmed Adel told CNN on TuesdayBut it remains too early to determine from examining the remains whether or not there was an explosion on the flight an official at the morgue told CNNAdel said that media reports suggesting otherwise were all speculationAny high velocity impact leads to defragmentations and this is not indicative of what caused the accident he said Lets not jump to conclusionsA key focus of the search is for the planes fuselage and the critical black boxes which are expected to provide vital clues about what happened to the aircraft Adel said EgyptAir had no information about the location of the fuselage and that the multinational search team was focusing on an area about the size of ConnecticutAt the heart of the confusion over the final moments of the flight are conflicting reports from Greek and Egyptian authoritiesThe flight was at 37000 feet when it lost contact above the Mediterranean early on May 19 shortly before the aircraft was scheduled to exit Greek airspace and enter Egyptian airspaceInitially Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos said that upon entering Egyptian airspace the aircraft swerved 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees before plunging dramaticallyAsked Tuesday about the conflicting accounts Adel said that the decisive information is going to come from the black boxes and they have not been retrieved yetTime is working against the investigators  as is the scope of the search area with teams searching in waters as much as 10000 feet deep Egyptian and French submersibles are working in the area in an attempt to find the flight data and cockpit voice recorders before their transponder batteries expireThe investigators are up against the clock said aviation analyst Justin Green If they dont find the black boxes in the next 30 days the job of finding them is going to be much harder because the black boxes may no longer be sending out a sonar ping which will help them identify itA representative of an organization devoted to families of French passengers said relatives arent sure they can trust the Egyptian investigation and want more involvement from FranceStephane Gicquel secretary general of the French National Federation of the Victims of Catastrophes said there will be a way to track the investigation put in place by the French government with an appointed official to defend the interests of the families in the weeks and years to comeGicquel said the families are distrustful of Egypt in part due to how the country cooperated very badly with the French authorities during the investigation of the 2004 crash of a jet carrying mostly French tourists taking off from the resort town of Sharm elSheikhEgyptian government and airline officials have promised to be transparent in the investigation into what happened to the planeThe Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry investigative committee is being led by Ayman alMoqadem the investigator also in charge of the inquiry into the October crash of a Russian Metrojet airliner over Sinai That disaster which killed all 224 aboard is widely believed to be the work of terroristsA preliminary report of the investigation will be available within a month Moqadem told state media SundayOn Saturday French aviation officials revealed that an automated system aboard the plane sent messages about smoke in the front of the aircraft just before it crashed into the sea early Thursday en route from Paris to CairoFrances revelation confirmed flight data that CNN obtained from an Egyptian source That technical data  transmitted through Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System or ACARS which sends messages between planes and ground facilities  shows the plane transmitted 11 electronic messages after it departed ParisThe first two messages showed engines were functional but the next message at 0026 GMT stated a rise in the copilot window temperature and sent out messages of smoke in locations such as the lavatory and avionics compartment below the cockpit The alerts continued until the plane vanished from radar screensA screen grab of data has time stamps that match the approximate time the aircraft went missing although aviation experts cautioned the alerts dont necessarily mean a fire occurred on the Airbus A320 or that the crew even knew about the alerts which are automatically transmittedThere have been electrical problems with window antiice heaters in A320s In 2003 the Federal Aviation Administration required windshields replaced in all A320s in the United States Its not known whether Egypt followed the FAA directiveWith little physical evidence the possibilities about what happened to the plane remain wide open from a bomb to a mechanical malfunction to pilot error or even an intentional crashNo group has claimed responsibility for taking down the jet and as of now investigators have found nothing implicating the flight crew or security officials aboard the plane an Egyptian official saidChecks of the passenger manifest have so far resulted in no hits on terror watch lists officials with knowledge of the investigation saidThe jet had routine maintenance checks in Cairo before it left for Paris the airline said Earlier Wednesday the jet was also in Eritrea and Tunisia data from flighttracking websites show
