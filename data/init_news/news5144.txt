Donald Trump has a gift for managing news cycles If his bloated head contains a spark of genius this is where it shines Trump understood as far back as 2013 what it would take to execute a political con of this scale work the media create controversy become an impossibletoignore circus This is what Trump meant when he said its about the power of the mass audienceHes approached his campaign in the same way a producer would approach a reality TV show Its about spectacle really They will never take the lights off of me Trump told a group of incredulous Republicans who didnt believe he could run for president without paid advertising He was obviously correct We havent taken the lights off of him and doing so is unthinkable at this point given his position in the raceOn Wednesday Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEightcom dove a little deeper into the Trump coverage trying to understand how this happened Trump has been able to disrupt the news pretty much any time he wants Silver wrote whether by being newsworthy offensive salacious or entertaining The media has almost always played alongOf course the press has played along  it cant do otherwise A corporatized media has turned citizens into consumers and politicians into products Trump understands this and he acts accordingly  its really quite simple His whole career has been about brand management which is now all the training a national politician needsTrumps mediacentric strategy has been wildly successful Hes received what amounts to 19 billion in TV coverage despite having spent only 10 million on paid advertising By contrast Silver notes Trumps Republican rivals combined have received slightly less than 12 billion worth of television coverage meaning that Trump has been the subject of the clear majority 62 percent of candidatefocused TV coverageSilvers broader conclusion is that Trump has hacked the system which is to say hes exploited a broken process with a perverse incentive structure He writesPut another way Trump has hacked the system and exposed the weaknesses in American political institutions Hes uncovered profound flaws in the Republican Party Hes demonstrated that thirdrail issues like racism and nationalism can still be a potent political force Hes exploited the medias goodwill and taken advantage of the lack of trust the American public has in journalism Trump may go away  hes not assured of winning the GOP nomination and hell be an underdog in November if he does  but the problems hes exposed were years in the making and theyll take years to sort outAll of this is undoubtedly true Our political institutions have failed us The system is so corrupt so inert that its become more or less unresponsive to the general will The Republican Party for its part has done nothing but stir the pot By becoming a party of antigovernment nihilists theyve conditioned voters to despise the state Washington has become a euphemism for everything wrong But thats only because Republicans sought to break the government via brinkmanship and obstructionism in order to reproach the Democrats for mismanaging it The result is a large bloc of voters who literally prefer anyone other than a politician  experience and credentials be damned Thus its no surprise Trump has inched his way to the top of the GOP Everything about our political climate incentivizes his approach The Balkanized media guarantees people will continue to get the information they want not the information they need which further undermines trust in the institution And the socalled mainstream media will persist in covering the circus because thats their business Its about shareholders and ratings  and nothing besides Trump has indeed exposed these problems What Silver doesnt say but certainly implies is that this is only the beginning Others will follow Trump The problems hes laid bare arent going away So long as the system remains unchanged a Donald Trump or a Sarah Palin or a Herman Cain will inevitably emerge Trump is a force of nature and his blend of amorality and shamelessness is rare but future hucksters will learn from his campaign We may see the end of Trump in November but we havent seen the end of the crisis he personifies
