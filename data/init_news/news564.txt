Donald Trump has summoned a tornado of negative stories that threaten to rip his campaign from its foundation if he doesnt stop supporters inside and outside Trumps orbit are warningSeveral top backers  including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani  are trying to persuade Trump to move past his feud with the parents of the late Iraq War soldier Humayun Khan stop bashing fellow Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen John McCain and refocus his attacks on Hillary ClintonBut hopes arent high among Republican allies that Trump 70 can make such a fundamental change at this point And the Trump campaign publicly denies that any intervention is occurring at allThe reality is that I dont think anyone has any influence over Trump a party source told NBC NewsWithin the GOP strategists are increasingly wondering at what point candidates will aggressively break with Trump or the party will divert resources from the presidential race to head off a collapse down the ticketThey dont want to but hes forcing peoples hands GOP strategist Ryan Williams told NBC News Williams described the campaign as freewheeling and careening from one selfinflicted controversy to anotherTrumps allies within the party can complain but they cant say they werent warnedTrump has made outrageous and offensive statements from the minute he announced his campaign last year and he slimed Republican rivals at every step along the wayHes resisted previous entreaties from party elders to change course after calling Mexican immigrants rapists proposing a ban on Muslim visitors to the United States linking Sen Ted Cruzs father to the John F Kennedy assassination and bringing up a federal judges Mexican heritage as proof of biasHe lacks any kind of selfcontrol a GOP operative said Thats not my opinion Its well demonstratedAs Trump regularly reminds voters at rallies however hes also survived numerous socalled crises to reach his current position But the general election isnt the primaries and the timing and intensity of the current episode stand outCNBCs John Harwood quoted an unnamed ally of campaign manager Paul Manafort on Tuesday night who called the mood suicidal and said Manafort was mailing it in after concluding that Trump was incapable of taking his adviceAnother source inside the campaign told NBC News that Harwoods account was all true and that the environment was way worse than people realizeLending particular urgency to this weeks chaos is Trumps declining position in the polls against Clinton who appears to be enjoying a major bump from last weeks Democratic conventionSurveys indicate Clinton not only eliminating Trumps gains from his own convention but also regaining the solid lead she held before FBI Director James Comeys criticism of her email practices depressed her supportThe most recent NBC NewsSurveyMonkey poll puts him behind Clinton 50 percent to 42 percent with registered voters A Fox News poll released Wednesday gave Clinton a 49 percentto39 percent leadConvention bounces are sometimes fleeting but once the race settles there are few opportunities for candidates to make up ground making Trumps missteps especially dangerousThe Olympics begin this weekend making it harder for Trump to win free media for much of the month He could make it up by buying TV time but the Clinton campaign and allied groups have reserved 98 million in ads through November  compared to less than 1 million on Trumps sideThe less likely Trump looks to win and the more toxic he looks with key voting groups the more pressure Republican candidates in competitive races will face to denounce himIf Trump wants us to make a choice between our senators and representatives and him it wont be him another GOP operative in a swing state told NBC NewsBut its a delicate balance If Republican candidates abandon Trump en masse party operatives warn depressed voters might stay home and leave federal and state candidates vulnerable to an electoral wipeoutWhile Republican candidates in some swing states have polled ahead of Trump by distancing themselves from his more controversial positions they still need conservatives to show up and split their ticket to prevailSo far few highprofile Republicans running for office have repudiated Trump  even Sen Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire is sticking by him despite Trumps recent insults and Ayottes longtime discomfort with his rhetoricThe further Trump sinks however the harder it becomes to hold everyone togetherA veteran GOP strategist suggested that the party should be able to win competitive House and Senate races with smart campaigns if Trump is trailing Clinton by 1 to 5 points But if he starts to trail by double digits in polls  as he did in Foxs survey  it could create a panic as Republicans rush to disavow his candidacy in the hope that they might survive the coming disasterPublicly Trump and his top aides argue that talk of campaign troubles are overblownWere great  its a terrible week for Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Jason Miller told NBC News with a smile WednesdayTrump Miller said has always been the antiestablishment candidate His refusal to support Ryan against a proTrump primary opponent only reinforced that brandAnd the campaign has had some good news mixed with the bad This week it raised an impressive 80 million in campaign contributions along with party allies  short of Clintons 90 million but a strong improvement for a campaign that built its fundraising operation from scratch after Trump largely selffunded during the primariesSome also note that Clinton and other Democrats are vulnerable to negative storiesThe Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the Obama administration shipped 400 million in cash to Iran as part of a deal over sanctions at the same time Iran released Americans it had detained The State Department said that the payment was unrelated and that the negotiations were kept separate but Republicans accused it of paying a ransomFact checkers have also pilloried Clinton this week for claiming that the FBI corroborated her previous defenses of her email practicesBut other campaign aides expressed concern that Trump failed to capitalize on Democratic weaknesses or emphasize his core strengths because hes too often distracted by side stories and settling scores within the GOPWeve got to get back to these basic issues that got him this far former Trump adviser Barry Bennett told MSNBCTrumps afternoon speech Wednesday in Daytona Beach Fla demonstrated the difficulty He began with a long and focused recounting of the Iran story and Clintons statements on her use of a private email server He also praised Sen Marco Rubio for endorsing him extending an olive branch to a onetime critic after having baited Ryan and McCain the day beforeThe campaign is doing really well Trump said Its never been so well unitedBut the usual Trump still nursing past grudges and falling into bizarre tangents wasnt far behindAfter discussing Iran he turned to his old feud with Megyn Kelly in which he said the Fox News host had blood coming out of her wherever Trump who made the initial comment one year ago this week told the crowd that perverted Democrats wrongly portrayed it as a comment on menstruation in attack ads when in fact he meant her nose her ears her mouthDespite his outward confidence Trump has sounded more concerned about his position In several interviews and speeches hes made unsubstantiated claims that the election could be rigged against him raising concerns that he might be laying the groundwork to delegitimize a Clinton presidency after a lossWouldnt that be embarrassing to lose to Crooked Hillary Clinton Trump said in Florida That would be terrible
