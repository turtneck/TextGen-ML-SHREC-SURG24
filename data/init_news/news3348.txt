In a last dash final hail mary attempt to end a Donald Trump run for the White House once and for all the National Review has decided to eviscerate the Republican front runner on the basis that he is not a conservativeIt will not workPublications like National Review run by elite conservatives have given us George W Bush and his wars No Child Left Behind Medicare Part D huge deficits caused by Republican consultants spending to woo select voters Mitt Romneycare Romney John McCainthe list goes on and onWilliam F Buckley who founded National Review used the magazine to publish a stellar series of essays by conservative intellectuals who helped foster the Reagan RevolutionSince then movement conservatism has not been a powerful enough force to make things better for the working classes in the countryThis vacuum created by the conservative elites who have backed RINOs Republicans in Name Only and candidates who are antithetical to conservatism is what created the opportunity for Donald Trump to riseIn fact publications like National Review have such a blind spot they never even saw devout proAmerica nationalists like Trump taking offThey arent credible in their criticism of Trump because they never saw it comingBeyond that and most importantly they told us we  the conservatives who are sick and tired of elistist establishment blunders  were wrongAnd they still dont get itTrumps appeal stretches far beyond disgruntled outside the country club conservatives His potential for crossover support especially with blue collar and working class voters is huge Most establishment Republicans have never met a blue collar worker unless they were fixing their JacuzziI can see Trump winning coal miners unionized construction workers auto workers steel workers Teamsters etcTrump may even score a larger share of black votes with his immigration stand His appeal to working class voters is a very under reported story but its evident because even President Barack Obama himself mentioned Trump by name during an interview with NPR in which he said that Trump is tapping into the anger of the blue collar white maleThis showcases just how scared the left is when it comes to Trumps potential to tear into demographics that Democrats have largely considered theirsThe bed wetters at the RNC are dreaming of a GOP that grows because it attracts Latinos proabortion millennial women and other hopelessly Democratic voters Trumps coalition of adding working class voters who actually work makes more senseI have respect for National Review as an institution but the cover and series of articles designed to hurt Trump only hurts the elitest Beltway crowd they represent because it exposes why he is the seemingly solid and unstoppable frontrunner its because of themThey have failed us not Trump Donald Trump is merely capitalizing on a moment in a pursuit to make America Great Again in spite of the failures of the conservative movementJust like they were too dense to see Trumps rise they dont understand why it occurredNational Review its time for your Man in the Mirror moment People are more concerned about the country they love than they are your brand of conservatismBy trying to take out the most popular candidate in this race who has the best general election shot of any of them to win the White House and reverse the progressive policies of Barack Obama Beltway frat boy type elitists are proving my point they dont get itAnd from the looks of it they never will
