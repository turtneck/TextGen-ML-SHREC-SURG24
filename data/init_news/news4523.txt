The warming of the oceans due to climate change is now unstoppable after record temperatures last year bringing additional sealevel rise and raising the risks of severe storms US government climate scientists said on ThursdayThe annual State of the Climate in 2014 report based on research from 413 scientists from 58 countries found record warming on the surface and upper levels of the oceans especially in the North Pacific in line with earlier findings of 2014 as the hottest year on recordGlobal sealevel also reached a record high with the expansion of those warming waters keeping pace with the 32  04 mm per year trend in sea level growth over the past two decades the report saidScientists said the consequences of those warmer ocean temperatures would be felt for centuries to come  even if there were immediate efforts to cut the carbon emissions fuelling changes in the oceansI think of it more like a fly wheel or a freight train It takes a big push to get it going but it is moving now and will contiue to move long after we continue to pushing it Greg Johnson an oceanographer at Noaas Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory told a conference call with reportersEven if we were to freeze greenhouse gases at current levels the sea would actually continue to warm for centuries and millennia and as they continue to warm and expand the sea levels will continue to rise Johnson saidOn the west coast of the US freakishly warm temperatures in the Pacific  4 or 5F above normal  were already producing warmer winters as well as worsening drought conditions by melting the snowpack he saidThe extra heat in the oceans was also contributing to more intense storms Tom Karl director of Noaas National Centers for Environmental Information saidThe report underlined 2014 as a banner year for the climate setting record or near record levels for temperature extremes and loss of glaciers and sea ice and reinforcing decadesold pattern to changes to the climate systemFour independent data sets confirmed 2014 as the hottest year on record with much of that heat driven by the warming of the oceansGlobally 90 of the excess heat caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed by the oceansMore than 20 countries in Europe set new heat records with Africa Asia and Australia also experiencing nearrecord heat The east coast of North America was the only region to experience cooler than average conditionsAlaska experienced temperatures 18F warmer than average Spring breakup came to the Arctic 2030 days earlier than the 20th century averageThe prognosis is to expect a continuation of what we have seen Karl said
