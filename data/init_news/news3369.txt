Just to be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables said Clinton at a New York fundraiseron Friday night where access was purchased at a price of 1200 to250000 Theyre racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamaphobic  you name it she saidBut the other basket  of people are people who feel that the government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures and theyre just desperate for change Clinton added Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as wellTrump feigning outrage has gleefully seized on Clintons comments and most observers believe they were impolitic This is all however missing an importantpoint Clinton was wrong to divide Trump voters between the bigoted and economically anxious because many are both and the two things are interrelated For many its just one big basket Clinton in drawing a distinction between the racists and the justly upset echoes a broader and mostly unhelpful debate about whether Trump supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or bigotry The clearanswer contrary to Matthew Yglesias and company is often bothYes Trump is getting a lot of support from professional racists on the white supremacist and altright and reducing his base of support to any single constituency is a fools errand But for many Trump voters anger and anxiety over economic decline and precarity the rising status of women and people of color demographic change caused by immigration and the countrys waning global power after more than a decade of costly and futile global warfare are all wrapped into one big sense of foreboding terror Trump promises relief and a reversion to something that was in senses both real and imagined betterThere is a lot thats new about Trump But the intersection of exploitative economics and white supremacy certainly isnt White economic anxiety isused to foment racism and racism is manipulatedto further elite economic interestsAs Michelle Alexander has written Americas racial caste system has long been perpetuated by appealing to the racism and vulnerability of lowerclass whites a group of people who are understandably eager to ensure that they never find themselves trapped at the bottom of the American totem poleThe Southern slaveowning aristocracy and the Jim Crow governments that took power after Reconstructions defeat peddled white supremacy to protect a politicaleconomic order that not only terrorized blacks but that also kept poor whites on the margins As historian Ira Katznelson detailed in Fear Itself The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time Southern Democrats during the New Deal era used their hold on Congress to leverage this divide and conquer logic on the national scene They blockedcivil rights measuresand alsoobstructed the growth ofalabor movement poised to improve the condition of workers across the racial divide and in doing sothreaten Jim Crow Later the modern conservative movement once again used racism toward economically reactionary ends employing racial dog whistles to transmute white anxiety into support for conservative economic policies that have harmed us all as Ian HaneyLpez and Heather McGhee wroteforThe Nation Beginning in the 1970s conservatives deployed a highly racialized strategy that relentlessly linked public institutions to undeserving minorities in order to undo the countrys social contract HaneyLpez and McGhee continued The reactionary economic agenda made possible by dogwhistle politics is responsible not just for the devaluing of black lives but for the declining fortunes of the majority of white families Talking about poor and working class people like they are research specimens and not human beings to very wealthy people at an exclusive fundraiser tends to not be a good look as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney both discovered But its not just bad optics Its crummy politics The businessfriendly agenda historically embraced by the Clintons fails to answer workingclass white peoples economic concerns and in doing so actually fuels the fires of racism Opposing racism as some transcendent and ahistorical force obscures the fact that racism functions to not only keep people of color down but also to keep the 1percent in charge Americas racial caste system depends on white supremacy to ensure white privileges andoligarchic prerogatives And so Clinton is right We should understand and empathize with many Trump voters  not because establishment liberalism has much to offer them but becausetheir problems are bound up withthose of the people whom they hate
