Rindge New Hampshire CNN The war over Wall Street between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton escalated Sunday on CNNs State of the Union where both candidates defended their recordsClinton repeated her accusation that Sanders and his campaign are engaged in an artistic smear by using innuendo against herSanders for his part declined to join calls  including from his own spokeswoman  for Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches to big banks but he didnt reject those calls eitherCNNs Jake Tapper asked Clinton about the implication from the Sanders campaign that Clinton changed her vote on a bankruptcy bill fifteen years ago as a senatorEarlier in the week the Sanders campaign had forwarded to reporters comments and writings by Elizabeth Warren the consumer advocate who is now a senator from Massachusetts Warren has said that Clinton had agreed with opposing the bankruptcy provision as first lady but ultimately voted for it years later as a senatorClinton told Tapper she voted for the bill she didnt like in 2001 as part of a deal to strike a provision about child support she said would hurt women and children Thats the way Congress works Clinton saidThats the way it happens sometimes she said I didnt like the bill any more than I had liked it before It still had very bad provisions But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children So okay I held my nose I voted for it It never became lawClinton bristled at the implication howeverThis attack by insinuation by innuendo is really getting old she said arguing the Sanders campaign is grasping at straws to make the case she is beholden to Wall StreetClinton said she has a tougher plan to take on Wall Street than he does and shed rather debate those issuesEarlier this week Sanders criticized his opponent over her ties to Wall Street at MSNBCs Democratic debateWhat being part of the establishment is is in the last quarter having a super PAC that raised 15 million from Wall Street that throughout ones life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests Sanders said ThursdaySanders meanwhile declined to to join calls for Clinton to release transcripts from her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other big banks despite mounting pressure from progressives for the Democratic frontrunner to do soThe Vermont senator also ripped a key Clinton surrogate predicted a close race in New Hampshires upcoming primary and even exuded confidence that he will do well in South CarolinaDo you think she should release the transcripts and what do you think would be revealed in those transcripts Tapper asked SandersNo idea Sanders said I have no idea what she said and I think the decision as to whether or not to release it is her decisionYou dont have a position on it at all Tapper askedNo the Vermont senator saidWhen asked at the debate whether she would release the transcripts Clinton simply said she would look into itBut progressive activists as well as some Republicans have put pressure on Clinton over her paid speeches with some calling on her to release the transcripts And Symone Sanders a spokesman for the Vermont senators campaign called for the transcripts to be released before Tuesdays primaryI think that is a question that is going to live on further even after this debate is over and its a question that deserves to be answered she saidSanders however did not hold back when Tapper asked him about David Brock the man who runs the proClinton super PAC Priorities USAI happen to like Hillary Clinton but I am astounded by some of the people that she has hired including David Brock Sanders said questioning his opponents judgmentBrock is a recovering rightwing attack man and lead a crusade against the Clintons in the 1990sNow however he is a major Clinton backer and has regularly targeted Sanders Among other attacks Brock recently said that a Sanders TV ad didnt feature enough AfricanAmerican and Latino faces and claimed Black lives dont matter much to Bernie SandersDavid Brock people will remember used to be a real rightwing guy who was attacking people like Anita Hill Sanders said This is an AfricanAmerican law professor who tried to do the right thing and he admitted it He said I lied about herSanders added I just dont understand where the Clinton people are coming from hiring somebody like that Every day you know theyre attacking us in one way or the otherThe Vermont senator believes Tuesdays primary will be a close oneWe think its gonna be a close election were working really hard Sanders told TapperIts a sentiment Sanders has echoed for the past five days in the Granite StateDont make me nervous and dont jinx me he addedBoth Democratic campaigns have tried to manage expectations for the primary Clinton has pushed the narrative that Sanders hails from Vermont and thus has an edge with his New England neighbors In turn Sanders reminded voters that Clinton won the state in the 2008 primary when she ran against thenSen Barack ObamaThe Sanders campaign has said its insulting to New Hampshire voters to suggest that they would only support him because hes from the New England areaWell in this sense it is Look I mean obviously Vermont and New Hampshire are separated by a river we are close states he told Tapper But you know what Secretary Clinton won this state in 2008 Her husband ran several campaigns in this stateWhen we began this campaign here in New Hampshire we were 30 points down in the polls and she was much better known in this state than I wasEarlier in the week Sanders reiterated the same line telling reporters on Tuesday that Clinton has very significant political connectionsShe has the support of virtually the entire political establishment here in New Hampshire he addedBut although Sanders says hes focused on not letting New Hampshire slip away he believes his campaign will be viable in South Carolina a state where Clinton is considered to have a significant advantageI think we are the underdog now Sanders said I think we have seen some real momentum there I think we got a shot at it
