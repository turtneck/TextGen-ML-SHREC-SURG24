Romneys condemnation made here at the Stein Eriksen Lodge before hundreds of his donors and business partners highlighted the ill will between the last two GOP nominees for presidentThe former Massachusetts governor harshly criticized Republican candidates such as Ohio Gov John Kasich and Texas Sen Ted Cruz as well as super PACs such as Jeb Bushs wellfunded Right to Rise group for not stopping Trump in the primary The two candidates largely avoided attacking Trump for much of their campaigns He made the comments before many of the individuals who had helped fund those very candidatesTed Cruz was basically praising Donald Trump through the whole process until the very end Romney told CNNs Wolf Blitzer who was hosting the discussion As for Kasich he was in well after the time there was no possible pathway to becoming the nomineeRomneys broadsides were warmly received by many of his allies earning a 21second round of applause when he wondered aloud about the future of the GOPI find this so troubling and I know a lot of folks are saying Mitt just get off your high horse on this and get behind the guy But these things are personal I love this country I love the founders I love what this country is built upon and its values and seeing this is breaking my heart Romney said The 2012 nominee was visibly emotional and appeared to tear up when making the remarks Yet Romney still preached tolerance He declined to criticize previous speakers including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus who pitched Trump to the wellheeled crowd this weekend and said he would not try and sway the GOP elites assembled here to abandon their nominee And he recognized as legitimate the notion that some Republicans may choose to back Trump solely to prevent Hillary Clinton from appointing Supreme Court nominees calling it a darn good reason The day before Romney had told Blitzer in an interview that he worried about the moral fraying of society should Trump become the nominee I dont want to see trickledown racism he said Donald Trump Mitt Romney let us down Donald Trump Mitt Romney let us down And before the crowd here on Saturday Romney used another former president as an example of how society is shaped by his example Bill Clintons dalliances in the White House affected the sexual inclinations and practices of a generation and probably beyond he said But Romney was also challenged by some questioners who were trying to whip up support for Trump Romney has pledged to never support Trump and many of his fundraisers feel similarly Weve got to get behind him one man implored the crowd These are the cards weve been dealt Romney was also pressed as to why he accepted the endorsement of Trump during his 2012 presidential run given Trumps zest for birtherism or the idea that President Barack Obama was not born into the United States and is thus ineligible to be president Romney said he saw Trumps comments as nutty but not disqualifying Now the pair are using one another as political foils with Trump blasting his GOP predecessor On Saturday in Tampa Florida he called Romney someone who let us down and writing on Twitter that Romney choked like a dog The former Massachusetts governor brushed off the attacks I have dogs I dont know dogs choking Romney said to laughs Thats an insult that somehow doesnt work Romney did though express some regret over his failed 2012 campaign saying that he like Bush had failed to connect his economic vision with average middleclass voters But for now Romney said he was trying to remain focused on the future though he has now ruled out serving in the next White House Had there been a President Bush or a President Marco Rubio or a President Scott Walker I mightve been happy to be a part of their administration Romney said
