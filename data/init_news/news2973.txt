 Why Trump Won and Why Clinton LostHillary Clintons stunning defeat reflected a gross misjudgment by the Democratic Party about the depth of populist anger against selfserving elites who have treated much of the country with disdainBy Robert Parry November 10 2016  Information Clearing House    Consortium News   In the end Hillary Clinton became the face of a corrupt arrogant and outoftouch Establishment while Donald Trump emerged as an almost perfectly imperfect vessel for a populist fury that had bubbled beneath the surface of AmericaThere is clearly much to fear from a Trump presidency especially coupled with continued Republican control of Congress Trump and many Republicans have denied the reality of climate change they favor more tax cuts for the rich they want to deregulate Wall Street and other powerful industries  all policies that helped create the current mess that the United States and much of the world are now inFurther Trumps personality is problematic to say the least He lacks the knowledge and the temperament that one would like to see in a President  or even in a much less powerful public official He appealed to racism misogyny white supremacy bigotry toward immigrants and prejudice toward Muslims He favors torture and wants a giant wall built across Americas southern borderBut American voters chose him in part because they felt they needed a blunt instrument to smash the Establishment that has ruled and misruled America for at least the past several decades It is an Establishment that not only has grabbed for itself almost all the new wealth that the country has produced but has casually sent the US military into wars of choice as if the lives of workingclass soldiers are of little valueOn foreign policy the Establishment had turned decisionmaking over to the neoconservatives and their liberalinterventionist sidekicks a collection of haughty elitists who often subordinated American interests to those of Israel and Saudi Arabia for political or financial advantage The war choices of the neoconliberalhawk coalition have been disastrous  from Iraq to Afghanistan to Libya to Syria to Ukraine  yet this collection of knowitalls never experiences accountability The same people including the medias armchair warriors and the thinktank scholars bounce from one catastrophe to the next with no consequences for their fallacious group thinks Most recently they have ginned up a new costly and dangerous Cold War with RussiaFor all his faults Trump was one of the few major public figures who dared challenge the group thinks on the current hot spots of Syria and Russia In response Clinton and many Democrats chose to engage in a crude McCarthyism with Clinton even baiting Trump as Vladimir Putins puppet during the final presidential debateIt is somewhat remarkable that those tactics failed that Trump talked about cooperation with Russia rather than confrontation and won Trumps victory could mean that rather than escalating the New Cold War with Russia there is the possibility of a ratcheting down of tensionsRepudiating the NeoconsThus Trumps victory marks a repudiation of the neoconliberalhawk orthodoxy because the New Cold War was largely incubated in neoconliberalhawk think tanks brought to life by likeminded officials in the US State Department and nourished by propaganda across the mainstream Western mediaIt was the West not Russia that provoked the confrontation over Ukraine by helping to install a fiercely antiRussian regime on Russias borders I know the mainstream Western media framed the story as Russian aggression but that was always a gross distortionThere were peaceful ways for settling the internal differences inside Ukraine without violating the democratic process but US neocons such as Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and wealthy neoliberals such as financial speculator George Soros pushed for a putsch that overthrew the elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014Putins response including his acceptance of Crimeas overwhelming referendum to return to Russia and his support for ethnic Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine opposing the coup regime in Kiev was a reaction to the Wests destabilizing and violent actions Putin was not the instigator of the troublesSimilarly in Syria the Wests regime change strategy which dates back to neocon planning in the mid1990s involved collaboration with Al Qaeda and other Islamic jihadists to remove the secular government of Bashar alAssad Again Official Washington and the mainstream media portrayed the conflict as all Assads fault but that wasnt the full pictureFrom the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011 US allies including Saudi Arabia Qatar Turkey and Israel have been aiding the rebellion with Turkey and the Gulf states funneling money and weapons to Al Qaedas Nusra Front and even to the Al Qaeda spinoff Islamic StateThough President Barack Obama dragged his heels on the direct intervention advocated by thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton Obama eventually went in halfway bending to political pressure by agreeing to train and arm socalled moderates who ended up fighting next to Al Qaedas Nusra Front and other jihadists in Ahrar alShamTrump has been inarticulate and imprecise in describing what policies he would follow in Syria besides suggesting that he would cooperate with the Russians in destroying Islamic State But Trump didnt seem to understand the role of Al Qaeda in controlling east Aleppo and other Syrian territoryUncharted TerritorySo the American voters have plunged the United States and the world into uncharted territory behind a Presidentelect who lacks a depth of knowledge on a wide variety of issues Who will guide a President Trump becomes the most pressing issue todayWill he rely on traditional Republicans who have done so much to mess up the country and the world or will he find some freshthinking realists who will realign policy with core American interests and valuesFor this dangerous and uncertain moment the Democratic Party establishment deserves a large share of the blame Despite signs that 2016 would be a year for an antiEstablishment candidate  possibly someone like Sen Elizabeth Warren or Sen Bernie Sanders  the Democratic leadership decided that it was Hillarys turnAlternatives like Warren were discouraged from running so there could be a Clinton coronation That left the 74yearold socialist from Vermont as the only obstacle to Clintons nomination and it turned out that Sanders was a formidable challenger But his candidacy was ultimately blocked by Democratic insiders including the unelected superdelegates who gave Clinton an early and seemingly insurmountable leadWith blinders firmly in place the Democrats yoked themselves to Clintons gilded carriage and tried to pull it all the way to the White House But they ignored the fact that many Americans came to see Clinton as the personification of all that is wrong about the insular and corrupt world of Official Washington And that has given us Presidentelect TrumpInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the
