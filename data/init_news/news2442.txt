Thousands have run for president but only one candidate has ever unrun for the office Hillary Clinton Ever since she finally announced her entry into the contest a couple of weeks ago she has been unrunning with ferocity First she roadtripped a minivan 1000 miles from New York to Iowa to  listenListening tours or sessions are supposed to add a little fabric softener to a politicians starchy image buffing their scaly reptilian exteriors down to kidleather smoothness The technique worked for Clinton in New York where booking upstate listening stops helped her win a Senate seat in 2000 Listening is the epitome of unrunning allowing a candidate to do nothing at all but remain operational Today Clinton is listening in New Hampshire and a fulltime physician has been assigned to her care lest the pure calm of bland political chitchat turn her life signs negative and she unruns herself to deathWhy is Clinton unrunning If the race for the Democratic Partys presidential nomination were a Little League baseball game the party would have already recognized Clintons insurmountable lead and invoked the mercy rule to give the victory to her By unrunning she avoids the intense political debate that would only call attention to her underfunded unannounced and relatively unknown rivals Martin OMalley Jim Webb Lincoln Chafee and Joe Biden all of whom are ununrunning at various pacesWith nine months until the first presidential primary Clinton cant afford to actively run for president Indeed if she had her druthers she probably wouldnt even be unrunning now She was pressured by the constant press attention about when she was going to announce and the email controversy That sort of press attention was positive media attention she couldnt control and only by announcing could she dial it down The email controversy was negative media attention she couldnt control without the attentiondeflecting machinery of a campaign Indeed she may be the first politician to announce for the presidency in order to decrease attention in her candidacyShes succeeded wildly Her coffees roundtables discussions and spontaneous meetings with voters have immersed her campaign into a box of dry ice and slowed it to the lowest metabolic levels Suspended animation would look vigorous compared to what Clinton is now doing This is smart Steady coverage on the inside of newspapers is exactly what she wants I buy what Team Clinton stalwart Donna Brazile recently told BuzzFeeds Ruby Cramer about the campaigns pacing Theres a rhythm Shes starting off like Beethoven with melodies and chords that people understand But shes got to end up like Beyonc except to my ears early Clinton sounds more like a hobbled version of the Beatles Within You Without You than BeethovenActively running for president at this point would be too politically damaging for Clinton By actively running she would have to declare herself for or against the current administration something she doesnt want to do until it presents some advantage By unrunning she can blend passively into the background where she can be there but not here Depending on how suggestible the audience that is listening with her Clinton unrunning looks like a continuation of the Clinton and Obama legacy without explicitly saying soHaving gotten what they wished for an official Clinton candidacy the press must now cover the Clinton 2016 slow lane the best they can The press already knows almost everything about her and shes not going to voluntarily serve any fresh meat so reporters and editors will have to go to the freezer and the landfills where her past is stored Thats one reason behind the press excitement over Peter Schweizers Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich Even if theres nothing damning in the book reporters can grind out hundreds of column inches on the subject and make it relevant to the campaign The only alternative until the campaign awakens from dormancy will be profiles of the 24yearold staff wizards Im sure they exist who are vitalizing the Clinton campaign I shudderWhat should ordinarily follow unrunning would be running but that wont be possible for Clinton Until the 2016 campaign boiler room fires up with an identity of its own shell be rerunning her 2008 campaign necessitating yet another transition in her candidacy According to POLITICOs Glenn Thrush the Clinton campaign plans to spend more time generating calm and less time fighting the press than it did in 2008 Weve got plenty of time to come up with a snazzy phrase to describe the new yettobereleased Clinton method but until we come up with a winner how about unrerunningDoubleunrunning would mean taking an unrunning campaign
