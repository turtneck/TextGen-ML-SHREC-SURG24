Takis Magazine October 28 2016 This election is going to have unprecedented political infidelity A good 20 percent of husbands for Trump predict their wife wont vote with them This is wrong for a number of reasons but the biggie is a family is supposed to be a cohesive unit He cant have his better half canceling out his vote Even if a husband wants to vote badlysay for Hillaryhis wife should stand by her man and make the same mistake Nobodys saying there cant be discussions and women shouldnt have their own political beliefs but the final decision comes down to the guy paying the bills and she should abide by that This is counterintuitive because we live in a feminist fantasyland but its really the same as deciding where your family is going to live A married couple agree where theyre going to go based on whats best for the kids If he gets an amazing job offer in Cleveland but shes a city gal from Manhattan she needs to accept that Ohio is best for the future of their family Voting is the same Youre deciding where the country is going to go based on whats best for future generations Unfortunately this is not happening A map of America if just men voted is almost completely red whereas a map of America if just women voted is almost completely blue The maps dont differentiate between married and single but judging by this massive split in what gender likes what candidate we can assume the married map would be similar Single people are a lost cause anyway The women vote almost exclusively out of spite They are voting for Hillary because she has a pussy they hate Trump because he grabbed one and they elected Obama because he makes theirs wet they elected Trudeau because he is one As for single men Im not convinced they even vote  There are also stayathome dads and situations where the woman is the breadwinner This is awkward but if youve made her the patriarch then her husband aka wife needs to vote with her For the most part however were talking about a home where the father makes the lions share of the money and the womans contribution is using her magic powers to make babies They have a symbiotic relationship where theyre both utilizing their greatest strengths Patriarchs are best at driving so hes the helmsman He doesnt want to fight about it because he doesnt want to rock the boat but for her to turn starboard while hes going port is to split everything in half and now the whole family is drowning Voting against your husband is a tiny divorce The Best of Gavin McInnes Tags Described as The Godfather of Hipsterdom Canadian expat Gavin McInnes is a writer who cofounded Vice Magazine in 1994 After selling his shares in early 2008 he cofounded the website Street Carnage as well as the advertising agency Rooster New York where he serves as creative director He is a regular on the Fox News show Red Eye and recently published a book of memoirs with Simon  Schuster entitled How to Piss in Public Follow GavinMcInnes on Twitter
