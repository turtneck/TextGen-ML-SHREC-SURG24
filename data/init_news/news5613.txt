Can Israelis And Palestinians Change Their MindsWhat makes people change their minds About the really hard stuffCovering the IsraeliPalestinian conflict for the past three years Ive often wondered if people here ever doThis conflict is frequently described as intractable with neither side willing to give up their historical perspective or their entrenched positions to end it And it does not take many interviews to hear repetitions of the same sweeping narrative repeated on each side Palestinians from different places cite the same historical events to back their views Israelis who have never met each other use similar turns of phrasePeople have a lot of psychological resources invested in what they believe about the conflict says Thomas Zeitzoff a political scientist at American University in Washington DC who has researched Israeli and Palestinian attitudesHe says the high political stakes and emotional involvement make it hard for Israelis and Palestinians to change their mindsBut there have been certain shifts  in public opinion and in individual beliefs  during the 68 years of Israels existence and almost halfcentury of the Israeli military control over Palestinian territoriesWhy Experts list a range of influences that  to varying degrees  can move or even flip deeply held viewsYou can point to major events either in the world or peoples lives changes in their social context as well as changes in the kind of messages they get from politicians and other elite sources says Brendan Nyhan an assistant professor at Dartmouth College who researches politics and misperceptionsOther factors include repeated exposure to a new idea whatever the source scientific research and direct personal experienceFour people  two Israeli and two Palestinian  told me their stories of personal radical belief change related to the conflict They not only changed their minds but a higher hurdle their behaviorHere are some triggers that led these people to see the world differently than they had before even in the midst of a larger impasseMany groups supporting coexistence advocate for exposure to the other side Knowledge develops empathy they say which can broaden an individuals perspective as well as pique curiosityMaayan Poleg is a Middle East program director for the group Seeds of Peace which brings Palestinian and Israeli teens together for summer camp in Maine She says the group does not advocate a particular political position and is not directly aiming to change mindsBut time together deliberately discussing the conflict humanizes the enemy she says and helps participants question their assumptions as well as navigate the onslaught of opinions from politicians family and media to clarify their individual beliefsThey become open to accepting the fact that what they know as truth is a narrative Thats a huge step Poleg said People spend a lot of time defending a specific fact And it takes them a long time to understand that their fact is actually a narrative It doesnt mean that its wrong It just means that theres another way to view itPalestinians and Israelis used to interact with some regularity often in the workplace or the marketplace But over the past 15 years they have been increasingly separated physically They now spend very little time togetherBut one Palestinian who went from throwing stones at Israeli soldiers to teaching nonviolence says he began to change his mind about violence while in an Israeli prison While behind bars he learned Hebrew saw his first movie about the Holocaust and got to know Israeli prison guardsIts a process says Bassam Aramin who became one of the cofounders of Combatants for Peace a group of former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian exmilitants You never wake up in the morning and say Oh my God we are wrong The Israelis are right I give up fightingHe remembers the first time he and other excombatants  Israeli and Palestinian  sat down together He was scaredWe dont trust them I think theyre from the Israeli intelligence Maybe they are coming to arrest us Aramin recallsHe saw fear in the eyes of the Israeli men who sat down with himIts the first time theyre coming to meet a Palestinian terrorist And they have this fear of maybe one of us will kidnap them and kill themTrust did build trust over time and many conversations They built an organization that teaches empathy and understandingBut empathy is also vulnerable to a change of heartMany Israelis and Palestinians reached out to each other eagerly after leaders signed their firstever peace plan back in 1993People were hopeful and more open than ever to the idea they could live together peacefully says Palestinian sociologist Nader SaidIt was highly euphoric and highly exciting times he remembersBut that peace deal the Oslo Accords did not deliver on its promise Violence returned with a vengeance when the second Palestinian uprising or intifada broke out in September 2000Said who has polled Palestinians since the mid1990s says by then Palestinian support for coexistence had already begun to fall as people grew disillusioned by the gap between expectations and realityWhile they felt Israeli settlement activity would decline settlement activity has increased he says They felt maybe theyll have more access to Jerusalem they have less access nowPalestinian Abla Masrujeh is part of this societal shift Now 54 she invested her time money and reputation in joint projects with Israelis in the 1990s She organized Israeli visits to her hometown of Nablus in the West Bank where they shared meals and visited Palestinian homes She helped present a Tel Aviv exhibition of handcrafts done by women from both sidesBut when violence broke out once again she felt her new Israeli friends did not understand her experiences as Israeli soldiers swept through the West Bank or her point of viewAll this made me rethink my position and my opinion of Israelis Masrujeh saysIsraelis went through the same reversal of hope says pollster Tamar HermannThe repeated failures in achieving something tangible and then the huge waves of terror this made people think maybe its not workable she says People started to doubt whether the cognitive change which opened the door for the twostate solution was justifiableMany Israelis cite repeated suicide bombings in cafes and on buses during the second intifada from 2000 to 2005 as the beginning of a national shift in attitudes toward PalestiniansAmerican social psychologist Jay Van Bavel says accumulated experience often leads to changeLike a rat pressing a lever If it gets a pellet it will press the lever again People are the same way he saysOver a decade Israeli Tamar Asrafs mind and lifestyle turned 180 degrees around She describes the process not as repetitive feedback but as digging deeperOnce secular and opposed to Israels West Bank settlements as an obstacle to peace Asraf is now religious and a spokesperson for Eli a growing settlement in the central West BankIt works like this You get more connected to yourself you get more connected to your private roots then you get more connected to your national roots Asraf says of her journeyExposed to religious Jews during her army service Asraf began to feel her secular upbringing left huge gaps When she began to study Judaism her sense of connection to biblical places in the West Bank grew trumping Palestinian claims to the same landIsraels political power base has shifted to the right over the past two decades says Avi Dgani an Israeli expert in mapping social and political dynamicsBut even though identity politics magnified by frequent violence and international attention play a large role in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict Dgani says big personal swings such as the one Asraf experienced arent all that commonThats because many people dont deeply question their personal beliefs or subsequently their politics Dgani says He cites last years reelection of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an exampleA third of Netanyahu backers chose him simply because me and my father and my forefather we always voted right Dgani saysOnce people change their minds one of the most powerful ways to maintain that new belief is to find new friends who share itAsraf moved to a settlement because the people there followed the same religious practices she had recently adopted Once there she started voting for rightwing leaders as do most of her neighborsAnother Israeli Noam Chayut shifted to the left politically He says small jolts shook his beliefs briefly along the way but real change took off when he found likeminded peopleChayut wrote a book The Girl Who Stole My Holocaust about his change from Zionist soldier to cofounder of Breaking the Silence an organization of former soldiers who share anonymous stories critical of Israels military occupation of the West BankTime and a great deal of reflection were key to Chayuts realization that his core beliefs had changedSoldiers get orders they obey he says You just do things But reflecting on it I did things that were close to my moral boundaryPeople can be pushed to change their minds when they sense a clash between their beliefs and actions has become too strongBut change is hard because people protect themselves against internal dissonance especially in situations as emotionally and politically laden as this conflict says Thomas Zeitzoff the American political scientist who has studied how narratives can change hereWe think people engage in what psychologists would call motivated cognition says Zeitzoff To avoid things that may threaten our own view of selves or others maybe motivated in a benign way to remember certain facts more than others and selectively ignore things that contradict beliefsAnd thats just one of the reasons its so hard to change
