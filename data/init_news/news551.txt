Even by his standards Donald Trumps reaction to the release of anaudio tape of him joking about sexually assaulting women was astonishingHe seamlessly pivoted from a devastating revelation about his own misogyny to pointing out that Bill Clinton is the Real SexistThis is part of a pattern In the first presidential debate he congratulated himself for not bringing up Bills infidelities I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary to her family and I said to myself I cant do it Its inappropriate Its not nice In case anyone wasnt clear about what he was talking about after the debate he told reporters Im very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill ClintonIn case that was too subtle he had his surrogates bring the matter up repeatedly Arkansas Attorney General and Trump surrogate Leslie Rutledge told NBC Newss Craig Melvin in response to questioning about Trumps treatment of Miss Universe Alicia Machado If we want to dig back through the 90s on comments made about women we can certainly look to Secretary Clinton referring to Monica Lewinsky as a neurotic loonytoon Rep Marsha Blackburn RTN went even further making shocking new allegations about Hillary Clintons infidelities with the same women as her husband Look at what she has done Gennifer Flowers Paula Jones Monica Lewinsky my goodnessWhats the motivation for Trump and his team to dredge the Clinton affairs up The 90s scandals are pretty old news There are 18yearolds voting in this election who werent alive when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke in January 1998 and millions more voters in their 20s and 30s who werent really old enough to rememberAnd more importantly Blackburns apparent confusion aside these are allegations about Bill Clinton If anything Hillary Clinton as the cheatedon party in the Flowers and Lewinsky cases is a victim Why should any of this reflect poorly on her campaignThe best explanation we have is twofold First the Trump campaign thinks public perceptions around the scandals like those surrounding Bill Clinton have changed in a way that might make that history extremely damaging to the Clintons reputation with millennials  if those millennials are briefed on what happened Thus bringing it up whenever possible Second they view making the conversation about Bill as an effective way to deflect the many many allegations of sexism against Trump that this campaign has brought to lightSteve Bannon the CEO of Trumps campaign and former head of Breitbart News has believed theres potential in reviving the Bill Clinton scandals for some time now In January 2015 way before Trump even announced his run for president Bloombergs Joshua Green talked to Bannon about his and Breitbarts efforts to gather dirt on the Clintons Bannon was insistent that Bill Clintons marital indiscretions were promising groundTheres an obvious counterargument to this claim When people were aware of Bill Clintons indiscretions in the 1990s it didnt make him unpopular Indeed in the first weeks after the Drudge Report broke the Lewinsky story on January 17 1998 Clintons approval rating spiked upward from about 60 percent to 69After the House impeached him in December his popularity spiked again only falling after the whole saga ended with a Senate acquittal in February Its hard to conclude anything besides that the scandal was good for Clintons reputation with the public at the time and completely backfired for congressional Republicans who faced losses in the 1998 midterms for good measureAnd thats nothing compared with what the scandal did for Hillary If Bills approval ratings edged upward as a result of the Lewinsky affair Hillarys positively soaredSo why in the world would a Republicanaligned operative want to replicate that experienceThe answer lies in Bannons allusion to his younger female employees Yes these scandals didnt hurt Clinton the first time around  but the constant barrage of scandals created a numbing effect that weakened the power of each individual charge And more pertinently our norms around sexual misconduct have changed dramatically since the 1990sThe main line of attack against Clinton in the Lewinsky case from Republicans was a combination of a the president was unfaithful to his wife indicating moral bankruptcy on his part and b he lied about it under oath undermining the rule of law It definitely wasnt that he was abusing the power of his office by having an affair with a subordinate That would have been a hard argument for congressional Republicans to make given that House Speaker Newt Gingrich was having an affair with a staffer now his third wife during the whole processBut in retrospect this is clearly the most important and troubling aspect of the story Adultery is wrong but most Americans view it as a private failing that doesnt necessarily reflect a politicians ability to do their job Perjury is also wrong but the focus on that element reeked of an effort to find a charge any charge with which to impeach ClintonA president sleeping with a White House intern by contrast is clear cutanddried sexual harassment Its absolutely unacceptable behavior toward a subordinate In a private company its a fireable offense It might have been accepted as normal in the 90s but sexual harassment has slowly come to be recognized as a serious offense in workplaces and exploiting the power of a senior office to get a lowerranked employee to consent to sex is a particularly egregious manifestation of itMore to the point we now have 20 years of hindsight and its clear that the real victim of the imbroglio was Lewinsky herself who has been denied the ability to live a normal life with relative anonymity and has become an activist against online abuse after enduring loads of it herselfThe even clearer examples of this are cases where Clinton was accused not of consensual sex but of sexual assault Lewinsky and Clintons previous paramour Gennifer Flowers tend to get placed in the same bucket as Juanita Broaddrick Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey but all three of the latter women accused him of sexual assault Broaddrick claims that Clinton raped her Jones alleged that he exposed himself to her Willey accused him of grabbing her breasts and forcing her to touch his genitalsYou can judge those claims credible or not having reviewed the cases I think the Broaddrick allegation is much more credible than the other two but theyre not sex scandals Theyre accusations of sexual violence And recent public conversations about Woody Allen Bill Cosby and other prominent men accused of sexual assault suggest that the American public is much more willing now to treat those kinds of accusations seriouslyTheres an issue with Bannons strategy however It depends not merely on getting young voters outraged about Bill Clintons sexual misconduct To work this strategy has to convince them that Hillary Clinton is somehow complicit in or responsible for his behavior And that is a much tougher sell both because the evidence is far thinner the closest thing to a smoking gun is Hillary calling Lewinsky a narcissistic looneytoon  in a private conversation with a friend and because of the inherent perversity of blaming a wife for her husbands crimesIts a move that denies Clinton her identity as a distinct person from her spouse which in turn undermines any of the feminist appeal this attack line might have had to voters outraged by Clintons treatment of Lewinsky Broaddrick etcSure enough when Rachel Kramer Bussel surveyed female millennial voters for Fortune on their views on the scandals she found that most people she talked to thought it was gross to equate Clintons behavior with that of her husband with one commenting I consider Hillary Clinton as a politician independent of her husband Bill Clinton Just as I would never associate Bernie Sanders as a politician with his wife Jane Sanders I would never associate a politician as a politician with their spouseIts informative to look at the actual point in the debate where Trump broughtupbypretendingtonotbringup the Clinton sex scandals It was directly in response to Hillary Clinton bringing up his treatment of Miss Universe Alicia Machado and other instances of sexismCLINTON You know he tried to switch from looks to stamina But this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said TRUMP I never said that CLINTON women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men CLINTON And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest He loves beauty contests supporting them and hanging around them And he called this woman Miss Piggy Then he called her Miss Housekeeping because she was Latina Donald she has a name TRUMP Where did you find this Where did you find this CLINTON Her name is Alicia Machado TRUMP Where did you find this CLINTON And she has become a US citizen and you can bet CLINTON shes going to vote this November TRUMP You know Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials Some of its said in entertainment Some of its said  somebody whos been very vicious to me Rosie ODonnell I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her But you want to know the truth I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary to her family and I said to myself I cant do it I just cant do it Its inappropriate Its not niceTrump was getting pummeled on his own record of mistreating women and he immediately parried with a reference to the affairsYou see this relationship in the responses of his surrogates as well Recall what Kellyanne Conway his campaign manager said He literally could have gone there and made very clear that he came ready to say some rough things if she was going to challenge him about his abuse  about his record on women Emphasis mine Rutledge the Arkansas attorney general replied to questioning about Machado by saying If we want to dig back through the 90s on comments made about women and running through the Lewinsky scandalThis trend suggests that the Trump campaign has assigned a specific role for the candidates attacks on Bill Clintons sexual misconduct Theyre not deployed right off the bat or in TV ads but only as damage control in response to questions about his own record of mistreating womenThat might be smart campaigning as the old saying goes If youre explaining youre losing and trying to parry specific accusations might come off as defensive But this strategy does have a side effect of implicitly conceding that Trump behaved poorly Even he and his team arent willing to defend his own conduct on the merits So they deflect to Bills  and try to pin it on Hillary in the process
