Posted on October 31 2016 by DavidSwanson Imagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away However where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones lower reading skills poorer memories impaired auditory and speech perception and impaired academic performance Most of us would find this situation at least a little concerning unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people Then itd be just fine Now imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldnt safely live near it Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool Again I think we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission Imagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes emitting highly toxic chemicals particles and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around Normally thatd be a problem But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people well work with its flaws wont we Now what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least 1400000000000 over 50 years And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world What if the 14 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education healthcare housing environmental protection or humanitarian aid Wouldnt that be a worry in some cases I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasnt at stake What if this product even when working perfectly was a leading destroyer of the earths natural environment What if this hightech toy wasnt even designed to do what was expected of it and wasnt even able to do what it was designed for Amazingly even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction Then all is forgiven The tool Im describing is called the F35 At RootsActionorg you can find a new petition launched by locallyminded people acting globally in places where the F35 is intended to be based Also at that link youll find explanations of how the tool Ive been decribing is the F35 The petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia Italy the Netherlands Norway Turkey the United Kingdom Israel Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington Vermont and Fairbanks Alaska where the F35 is to be based This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition Save Our Skies Vermont Western Maine Matters Alaska Peace Center University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace World Beyond War RootsActionorg Code Pink and Ben Cohen The petition reads The F35 is a weapon of offensive war serving no defensive purpose It is planned to cost the US 14 trillion over 50 years Because starvation on earth could be ended for 30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for 11 billion per year it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill Military spending contrary to popular misconception also hurts the US economy  see here  and other economies The F35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes Its emissions are a major environmental polluter Wars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them Nonviolent tools of law diplomacy aid crisis prevention and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars Therefore we the undersigned call for the immediate cancellation of the F35 program as a whole and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas We oppose replacing the F35 with any other weapon or basing the F35 in any other locations We further demand redirection of the money for the F35 back into taxpayers pockets and into environmental and human needs in the US other F35 customer nations and around the world including to fight climate change pay off student debt rebuild crumbling infrastructure and improve education healthcare and housing
