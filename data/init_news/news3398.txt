Has family guy gone nuts page 1 link I was watching and they were singing a weird chant something about patriotic weirdness and barbecued human heads I just brushed it off then 5 mins later some more weird popped in outta nowhere wtf so I recorder it I have no idea why quagmire took Peter back in time so far or what its supposed to mean Why would going back in time cause home to that Or am I missing something Peter demonic voice I see the six stations of the Lords order and they will all burn  edit on 26102016 by ssenerawa because no reason given link That was kind of weird and random Were they referencing anything Probably just typical family guy but they have taken part in predictive programming and subliminal messages I am pretty sure edit on 26102016 by GoShredAK because no reason given Oh family guy There are a lot of references to a time travel and its ramifications including multiple timelines They even have an episode where time flows backward b occultic crap There is another episode where Peter puts on noise cancelling headphones to be alone with my thoughts This is all while on a plane and his innver voice begins babbling about blood shed and something about the dark counsel or something along those lines c Paranormal in general Ghosts and spirits speaking through telelvisions etc One of my personal favorites is when Peter talks to the tv as if the people on it can hear him Ironically enoughthe people on tv respond to him To me the show is some type of op With american dad included Afterall seth macfalane was set to be on the plane that hit the north towertalk about a splitting of timelines Addendum this show has a lot and i do mean ALOT of references that resonate with my life and experiences to a very close T edit on 26102016 by OneGoal because no reason given
