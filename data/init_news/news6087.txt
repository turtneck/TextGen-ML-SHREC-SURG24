Lets start with what we already knew when the 114th Congress gaveled in this January Republicans were cheering their control ofboth chambers for the first time in eight years including a historicmajority in the House of RepresentativesBut they inherited a Congress suffering from serious morale problems Congress had areputation for beingineffective unpleasant and unpopular Americans told Gallup pollsters they thought car salespeople and telemarketerswere morehonestthan their lawmakers in Washington DC  a distinction that remains at years endAmid that dismal back drop Congress arguably got even worse as the year went on There were shutdown threats leadership crises and drama from nasty 2016 presidential primaries seeping into its halls And then suddenly at the end of the year things came togetherHouse Republicans got a new  if initially reluctant  leader inSpeaker Paul D Ryan RWis Both sides can claim victories in a flurry of lastminute bipartisan legislation that funded the government extended tax breaks and lifted the debt ceilingThere are plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about Congress next year as well but thanks to the sudden change of events in the House lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will tell you theres at least a glimmer of hope things will be less contentious in2016But to understand what mightbe to come we have to first dissectwhat just happened Hereare five things we learned about Congress from thistumultuous year1 The House is still broken Consider these sobering statistics from Gallup Those who pay attention to Congress actually like it less In other words its not people who dont actually tune in who are dismissing Congress as a bunch of loutsAnd since July Republicans have actually given the GOPcontrolled Congress lower approval ratings than Democrats and independents according to a November Gallup pollIts not normal to have members of the party in control of Congress most upset with Congress But maybe these voters are on to something The story of 2015 on Capitol Hillis filled withcongressionalgridlock on just about every major issue the government very nearly shutting down in Octoberand the House leaders sudden resignation as his own members threatened to remove himAgrowing and emboldened group of 30 to 40 conservatives played a big role in all this by holding up or stopping legislation they didnt approve of By refusing to back down from their demands the group became so influential it eventually usheredSpeaker John A Boehner ROhio out of his jobThe Fixs Chris Cillizza has argued our current divided outsiderdriven political system is encouraging the dramaLawmakers are able to take more hardlinestands without political consequences thanks to more polarized districts back home while influential outside groups flush with cash are encouraging such behaviorAdding to the challenges is a group of about70100 Republican lawmakers who are nervousabout primary challengers because they are otherwise in safe districts They joined the conservative cause on many votesthis year from not funding the Department of Homeland Security to standing firm against a debt limit increase Congressional leaders had fewertools at their disposal  like earmarks for pet projects  to entice membersto vote differentlyThese dynamics have been quietly forming and playing out for a few years  and in 2015 we finally saw the chaos burst to the surface2  But it can hobble alongAt least the most optimistic of those in Republican leadership say so They point to the spending bill and tax deal that Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif slapped together to avoid a government shutdown It got a majority of votes from both parties although congressional budget watchers mostly attribute the vote totals to goodies the leaders tacked onto the bill  basically earmarks in everything but nameAnd lets not forget that on his way out the door a beleaguered Boehner managed to strike a budget deal with Pelosi that lifted the debt ceiling through 2016  taking a potentially disastrous defaultdebate off the table for the presidential electionNotice the figure central to both Ryans and Boehners dealmaking Pelosi Even though House Republicans have one of the largest majorities since the Great Depression Democrats played a significant role this yearby helping pass just about every mustpass deal sometimes even carrying the majority of yes votesAs such Pelosi had a lot of leverage to shape outcomes We named her one of the spending deals winners after Democrats secured major victories including getting domestic spending increased by the same amount as military spending Republicans got some things to brag about too likelifting the 40year crude oil export banThe backandforth is just what happens in a legislative body with a sizable minority  or at least one empowered by a divided majorityWelcome to divided government Rep Tom Cole ROkla told me last weekAnd as long as conservatives in the House continue to split off from their party a divided government is likely to be Congresss reality next year too Which means Ryan faces many of the same predicaments Boehner did  the endofyear agreements notwithstandingOne of the most interesting storylines in Congress this year is the goodwill conservatives extended to Ryan their new leader even though he arguably didnt produce resultsthat different from BoehnersRyan managed to negotiate a spending bill with Democrats in the same manner and with largely the same outcomes that Boehner likely wouldhave But Ryan did it without earning the same kind of vitriol from the right flank of his party that Boehner likely would have The group on the right didnt like the spending bill and many didnt vote for it but they didnt call Ryan names for negotiating it with DemocratsKnowing he was at risk of being compared to the politically toxic former speaker during these negotiations Ryan did his best to subtly draw contrasts with Boehner outside of them  Boehner smokes and drinks Ryan works out every morning Boehner stacked powerful committees with his allies Ryan opened the positions up to the whole HouseCole told The FixthatRyan also did a better job than Boehner explaining to Republicans why he was negotiating with Democrats and taking everyones ideas into account  even if they woundup on the cutting room floorRyan mightbe different enough in style from Boehner that some conservatives skeptical of their partys establishmentwere willing to forgive the two mens similarities in substanceOn the other hand it has only been two months4 Republicans arent the only ones with partisan dramaA lot has been written  including here on The Fix  about the influence of the farright on the Republican Party pulling the party to the right both in Congress and on the campaign trail while renderingthe House basically ungovernableThat in broad strokes istrue But there are signs Democrats are also moving closer and closer to the extremeof their party tooEarlier this month we named liberal leader Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass one of the winners of the Democratic presidential primary so far as frontrunner Hillary Clinton picks up on some of Warrens economic populist rhetoric The populist Sen Bernie Sanders IVt is also having surprising success this year for obvious reasonsNonpartisan tech startup Crowdpac the ones who recently matched up the 10 most liberal and 10 most conservative cities by campaign donors tried to put numbers to such anecdotal evidence The company analyzedwho has been giving money tolawmakersand tracked lawmakers votessince 1980 Heres what they foundThe findings which combine political contributions and voting records of members of Congress go back to our first point Congressional lawmakers have little incentive to reach for the middle when politics ispushing them further and further apartEarlier this year one of Republicansfirst challenges in their new position of powerwas to try to stop the presidents executive actions on immigration They didntHowever a multistate court challenge has held up those same immigration actions to the point where they mightnot be implemented before President Obama leaves officeA similar situation has played out with the presidents 2010 healthcare reform lawThe House has voted more than 60 times over the past four years to repeal Obamacare Such a bill has never made it to the presidents deskBy contrast there have been not one but two challenges to the law that made it to the Supreme Court Even though the court upheld the law both times the legal challenges got further than the legislation ever couldWe could say the same thing for Republicans attempts to roll back the Obama administrations regulations to cut power plants emissions which they havent been able to stop in Congress either But those regulations arefacing a multistate legal challenge In June the Supreme Court narrowlyruled against the administrations attempts to regulate mercury from power plantsIn short trying to stop or reverse Obamas agenda has confounded congressional Republicans and that failurebeen a major source of frustration for the increasingly influential grassroots faction of the partyPerhaps trying to advance political agendasthrough this broken partisan and often unpredictable Congress is the reason why
