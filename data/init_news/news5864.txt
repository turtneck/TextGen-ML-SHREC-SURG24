News about race in America these days is almost universally negative Longstanding wealth income and employment gaps between whites and people of color are increasing and tensions between police and minority communities around the country are on the rise But many claim theres a glimmer of hope The next generation of Americans they say is postracialmore tolerant and therefore more capable of easing these racebased inequities Unfortunately closer examination of the data suggests that millennials arent racially tolerant theyre racially apathetic They simply ignore structural racism rather than try to fix itIn 2010 a Pew Research report trumpeted that the younger generation is more racially tolerant than their elders In the Chicago Tribune Ted Gregory seized on this to declare millennials the most tolerant generation in history These types of arguments typically cling to the fact that young people are more likely than their elders to favor interracial marriage But while millennials are indeed less likely than baby boomers to say that more people of different races marrying each other is a change for the worse 6 percent compared to 14 percent their opinions on that score are basically no different than those of the generation immediately before them the Gen Xers who come in at 5 percent On interracial dating the trend is similar with 92 percent of Gen Xers saying its all right for blacks and whites to date each other compared to 93 percent of millennialsFurthermore these questions dont really say anything about racial justice After all interracial dating and marriage are unlikely to solve deep disparities in criminal justice wealth upward mobility poverty and educationat least not in this century Blackwhite marriages currently make up just 22 percent of all marriages And when it comes to opinions on more structural issues such as the role of government in solving social and economic inequality and the need for continued progress millennials start to split along racial lines When people are asked for example How much needs to be done in order to achieve Martin Luther Kings dream of racial equality the gap between white millennials and millennials of color all those who dont identify as white are wide And once again millennials are shown to be no more progressive than older generations Among millennials 42 percent of whites answer that a lot must be done to achieve racial equality compared to 41 percent of white Gen Xers and 44 percent of white boomersThe most significant change has been among nonwhite millennials who are more racially optimistic than their parents Fiftyfour percent of nonwhite millennials say a lot must be done compared with 60 percent of nonwhite Gen Xers And this racial optimism isnt exactly warranted The racial wealth gap has increased since the 2007 financial crisis and blacks who graduate from college have less wealth than whites who havent completed high school A new paper by poverty experts Thomas Hirschl and Mark Rank estimates that whites are 674 times more likely to enter the top 1 percent of the income distribution ladder than nonwhites And Bhashkar Mazumder finds that 60 percent of blacks whose parents were in the top half of income distribution end up in the bottom compared with 36 percent of whitesAs to how well whites and nonwhites get along only 13 percent of white millennials say not well at all compared with 31 percent of nonwhite millennials Thirteen percent of white Gen Xers and 32 percent of nonwhite Gen Xers agreeIn a 2009 study using American National Election Studiesa survey of Americans before and after each presidential electionVincent Hutchings finds younger cohorts of Whites are no more racially liberal in 2008 than they were in 1988 My own analysis of the most recent data reveals a similar pattern Gaps between young whites and old whites on support for programs that aim to further racial equality are very small compared to the gaps between young whites and young blacksAnd even though the gaps within the millennial generation are wide as with the Pew data there is also evidence that young blacks are more racially conservative than their parents as they are less likely to support government aid to blacksSpencer Piston professor at the Campbell Institute at Syracuse University used ANES data and found a similar pattern on issues relating to economic inequality He examined a tax on millionaires affirmative action a limit to campaign contributions and a battery of questions that measure egalitarianism He says the racial divide in particular the blackwhite divide dwarfs other divides in policy opinion Age differences in public opinion are small in comparison to racial differences This finding is he adds consistent with a longstanding finding in political science Piston finds that young whites have the same level of racial stereotypes as their parents
