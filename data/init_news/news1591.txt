Belgian authorities missed a chance to press a key terrorism suspect for intelligence in the days ahead of the suicide bombings that struck the capital prosecutors said Friday acknowledging a significant security lapse that may have allowed his allies to attack unimpededEven as the men involved in Tuesdays attacks were racing to strike fearful that authorities were closing in on them investigators did not ask the attackers jailed ally Salah Abdeslam about his knowledge of future plots Belgian federal prosecutors said FridayAbdeslam believed to be the logistics chief of the Islamic States November attacks in Paris was apprehended March 18 apparently spurring one of the Brussels attackers to write that he feared capture by the police But after Abdeslams arrest investigators concentrated solely on the Paris attacks Abdeslam was questioned for two hours last Saturday the day after he was captured in a raid at a Brussels safe house  and then no other discussions were held until after Tuesdays attacks when he refused to speak further prosecutors saidThe failure to push Abdeslam for concrete intelligence  even as close associates were known to be on the loose  adds to an emerging picture of intelligence agencies police forces and criminal investigators that repeatedly failed to take advantage of opportunities to avert the attacks on Tuesday the worst single day of violence in Belgium since World War IIWe cannot exclude that if everybody had been perfect this could have gone differently Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told a special session of Parliament convened Friday to question top security officials about the lapsesThe acknowledgment from the prosecutors came as authorities conducted raids across Brussels and in France and Germany an indication that they were still hotly pursuing terrorist plots and that the network may spread across a wide stretch of EuropeTwo Belgian Islamic State fighters threatened that this is just the beginning of your nightmare in a video released Friday Know we have other targets and we are determined said a man identified as Abu Abdullah alBeljiki according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence Group which monitors jihadist propagandaBelgian commandos and bombdisposal units on Friday swept through a district at the heart of the Brussels attack probe The raids followed police operations in France and Germany that displayed the expanding crackdowns that increasingly connect the last two terrorist blows in Europe Novembers bloodshed across Paris and Tuesdays twinsite suicide bombings in Brussels that killed at least 31 people  including at least two AmericansAmong those arrested in the latest roundups was a French suspect who officials believe was directing a plot for an impending attack in France The investigation touched off a series of related police raids in Belgium on FridayThe police actions came as Secretary of State John F Kerry touched down in Brussels to discuss strategies

reach into the continent Officials have raised alarms about potential threats from citizens returning after fighting with the Islamic State and other groupsSpeaking to reporters after a meeting with Michel Kerry defended Belgiums security efforts He said that it appeared to him at first glance that the Brussels attackers were moved to act because they feared being apprehended by authoritiesThat tells you the dragnet is closing in It tells you law enforcement is in fact having an impact Kerry said It may not have worked out as everyone might have wished here but if that is true  it tells you a lot about whats beginning to become effectiveBut even Abdeslams attorney has suggested that his client may possess knowledge that could avert future terrorist attacks on European soil further highlighting the lapse by Belgian investigators not to press Abdeslam for intelligence ahead of the Brussels attacks The prosecutors said that they were slowed by the doctors treatment of the gunshot wound to the leg that Abdeslam suffered in the raid before his captureAbdeslam was not up to date about the Brussels attacks his attorney Sven Mary told the Europe 1 radio network on ThursdayBut Mary said I would not want him to stop talking for lots of reasons To stop talking could face us again with other Zaventems and other Bataclans and I would perhaps like to avoid thatHe was referring to
