foot On Thursday Jeb Bush stepped into controversy when he used the loaded term anchor babies to refer to the USborn children of undocumented immigrants In a testy exchange with reporters in New Hampshire Bush said that he doesnt believe the expression is offensive and blamed Democrats for perpetuating the notion that it is an insult Do you have a better term he asked one reporter You give me a better term and Ill use itDespite his family ties to the Latino community Bush is off base The term anchor baby is a disgusting slur It is inaccurate as well as offensive It is dehumanizing to Latinos immigrants and children who are as American as you and meThe idea of an anchor baby is centered in part on the assumption that having an Americanborn child can protect undocumented people from deportation The child this line of thought goes anchors a family in the United States and allows them to gain citizenshipIn fact having a citizen child is no protection from possible deportation In the first six months of 2011 for example parents with UScitizen children constituted 22 of deportees Between 2010 and 2012 the United States deported nearly 205000 parents of citizen kids And in 2013 more than 72000 were deported according to The Huffington Post President Barack Obamas executive action plan  which is tied up in the courts would grant temporary deportation relief to parents of children who meet certain requirementsAnother false notion surrounding anchor babies is that people from foreign countries are rushing here to have children While there has been a phenomenon known as  birth tourism  among Asian mothers who temporarily relocate to the United States to have a child their numbers are statistically small The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 7955 children were born to foreign residents in 2012 Meanwhile research has shown that the overwhelming majority of undocumented immigrants come to the United States to workSo while the ideas behind anchor babies are a myth the sting of this term is real Calling someone an anchor baby strips away their humanity and judges them based on a perception of their parents immigration status The American Heritage Dictionary rightfully defines anchor baby as a pejorative term Ironically Bush has been a member of an advocacy group that has discouraged use of the term The Washington Post reports that the Hispanic Leadership Network whose website still lists Bush as an advisory member in 2013 issued a memo warning Republican lawmakers to avoid terms such as illegals aliens  and anchor babies If Bush wants a better term for children born here to undocumented parents how about calling them what they are They are US citizens According to the Pew Research Center in 2012 there were 45 million USborn children younger than 18 living with at least one undocumented parent When Bush and other Republican lawmakers disparage anchor babies they are disparaging fellow citizens and that is unacceptable It also goes against American values of fairness and equality Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush waves as he takes the stage as he formally announces he is joining the race for president with a speech June 15

Republican presidential candidates is being dragged down by the ongoing dominance of Donald Trump in the polls Consider that Bush is far more moderate than The Donald on immigration matters Unlike Trump Bush does not want to end birthright citizenship  which is guaranteed under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution as well as more than a century of settled Supreme Court law In contrast to Trumps endorsement of mass deportations Bush favors a path to legal status for the undocumented Yet perhaps Bush felt he had to ramp up his rhetoric to be heard among all the media focus on Trumps campaign spectacle If so he only brought himself down to Trumps level True illegal immigration remains a contentious issue among the conservative base But scapegoating American children is no substitute for thoughtful policy solutions Bush is actually echoing Trumps ugly messaging about Latinos and immigrants by using such hurtful language In an election cycle where Republicans will need to get a higher share of the Latino vote than in years past to win the White House this could well be Bushs selfdeportation moment  recalling the comment by Mitt Romney during the GOP primaries that Latino voters remembered during the 2012 general election In the midst of an ongoing debate over immigration divisive rhetoric solves nothing Sorry Jeb but absolutely no good is served by using the term anchor babies
