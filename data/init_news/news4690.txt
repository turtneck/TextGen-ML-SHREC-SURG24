The Libertarian Party ticket facing what polls show are two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern American history is seeing a bump in support as the general election race moves into full swing  and a surge in interest that could carry nominee Gary Johnson onto the prized debate stage this fallDespite Donald Trump and Hillary Clintons popularity issues and trust gap with voters few expect the Libertarian ticket to pose a Ross Perotstyle threat this yearBut the party is far more than a political curiosity in 2016 Rumors are swirling in the wake of the majorparty conventions that highprofile Republicans are now considering backing the ticket a recent video from Johnson and running mate William Weld generated considerable buzz and the polls show Johnson getting close to 15 percent  the threshold he needs to reach to land him on the debate stage with Trump and Clinton this fallThe RealClearPolitics average has Johnson at 84 percent in a fourway race with Trump Clinton and Green Party candidate Jill Stein up from 45 percent in June The latest Fox News poll released Wednesday after the conventions put Johnson at 12 percentAn NBC poll taken toward the end of the Democratic convention put Johnson at 9 percent roughly where he was in prior pollingParty officials said the unpopularity of the Republican and Democratic candidates gives the party an unprecedented opportunityIt goes from week to week and day to day watching for what new thing Clinton and Trump are going to do to become more unpopular with the American people and frighten people Nicholas Sarwark chairman of the Libertarian National Committee told FoxNewscom Those candidates are the gift that keeps on giving Were running as the qualified adult in the roomSarwark pointed to Johnsons record as a twoterm New Mexico governor reelected as a Republican in a Democratic state in touting his credentials and appealUnclear is whether the support in the polls will translate into support at the ballot box In 2012 Johnson won just 099 percent of all votes cast  making him the most successful White House candidate in Libertarian history but not making much of a dent in the race as a wholeBut this year there are plenty of signs more voters are seeking an alternative candidate At the Democratic convention last week many Bernie Sanders supporters were getting on board with the Green Partys Stein But so far Johnson is polling the best among thirdparty candidatesHe and his running mate former Massachusetts Gov Weld generated some buzz before the conventions with a slick video ad listing their accomplishmentsWeve been there  And done that the candidates sayJohnson said in an interview Monday with the Los Angeles Times that he believes in addition to appealing to disenfranchised Republicans on issues like free trade low taxes and smaller government the Libertarian stance on social issues and foreign policy could bring Sanders voters on boardSarwark said the party is banking that while Trump and Clinton are about as wellknown as they are going to be Johnson still can introduce himself to voters not familiar with his story  especially if he is able to get on the debate stageThis is far from a foregone conclusionSo far while Johnsons support is higher than in past years an 84 percent average is still a distance from the 15 percent hed need to make the debatesHe has until the middle of September to hit 15 percent in not just one poll but an average of five recent polls chosen by the Commission on Presidential DebatesPolitically where we stand is we have to get into those presidential debates to really stand a chance Weld told The Wall Street Journal last week If we catch a break or two we may get thereEven then the record for thirdparty or independent candidates is not strongIn recent political history the one who came closest to the presidency was businessman Perot in 1992  who was an independent not technically a thirdparty candidate At one point Perot was leading in some polls against thenPresident George H W Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton However after dropping out of the race before reentering he lost support He eventually garnered 19 percent of the vote with some Republicans arguing he split the GOP vote and handed the election to ClintonRepublicans meanwhile were arguably given a boost by Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 when Nader picked up 27 percent of the vote against Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W BushJohnsons potential impact is hard to gauge The latest Fox News poll found Johnson siphoning support about equally from the Democratic and GOP candidatesBut he could get a boost in the coming weeks as some Republicans reportedly consider backing himMost notably 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush reportedly are mulling endorsements for Johnson Marvin Bush youngest brother of Jeb and George W also endorsed Johnson last weekFrom what Ive heard from the Bush and Romney camps theyre still considering it Sarwark claimedAsked if the party is looking just to make a strong showing or go all the way Sarward was bullish Theres a path to the presidency The ground is
