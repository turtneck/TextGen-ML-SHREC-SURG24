chaotic situation after a military coup in March 2012 Islamist extremists with links to al Qaeda carved out a large portion of northern Mali for themselves When the militants tried to push into the south France at the Malian governments request sent thousands of troops in 2013The ground and air campaign sent Islamist fighters who had seized the northern region fleeing into the vast desert The United Nations then established a peacekeeping mission in Mali that year hoping to keep the government secure enough to continue a peace processThough military pressure largely drove Islamist militants from cities they have regrouped in the desert areas said J Peter Pham director of the Africa Center at the Washingtonbased Atlantic CouncilUnfortunately this hotel is a likely target because it is popular with international guests such as UN workers Pham saidUS special operations forces were helping move civilians to secured locations as Malian forces clear the hotel of hostile gunmen
