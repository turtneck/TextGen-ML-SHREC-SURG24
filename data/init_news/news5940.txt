As the Islamic State seeks to export its brand of barbaric terror to wouldbe affiliates the US faces a growing challenge to find the sources of ISIS funding and blunt its flow to allied militantsThe terror armys most recent atrocity was the mass beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya It remains unclear how closely tied those militants are to ISIS in Iraq and Syria but the Islamic States underground economy continues to thrive Even as the USled coalition strikes at what was long the heart of ISIS revenue stream  oil fields and refineries  officials say the terror network is making money in other waysWe know that oil revenue is no longer the lead source of their income in dollars Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm John Kirby said recentlyBut he added They get a lot of donations They also have a significant black market program How much money ISIS truly makes from donations is a matter of debate But experts agree that ISIS receives significant revenue from blackmarket smuggling and other operationsISIS is selling anything they can get their hands on Dr Daveed GartensteinRoss a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said in an interview with Fox NewsPlus according to reports the group is even skimming Iraqi taxpayer dollars by shaking down government employees in areas theyve conqueredIn short ISIS is set on building a terror empire going so far as to tout its annual financialsReportedly ISIS released a 2 billion budget for 2015 including a 250 million surplus though those numbers are disputed After Mosul fell to the Islamic State in June the International Business Times declared ISIS the worlds richest terrorist organization after the central banks vaults were looted of some 420 million Estimates vary but ISIS reportedly rakes in between one and three million dollars per day though the strikes against its oil refineries have taken a tollThe United Nations last Thursday tried to strike at the money stream The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at cutting off millions of dollars in earnings from oil smuggling antiquities trafficking and ransom payments to ISISThe measure calls for sanctions against individuals and entities that trade in oil with ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliates such as the AlNusra Front in Syria The resolution was cosponsored by more than 35 countries It called for all 193 countries of the UN to take steps to prevent ancient artifacts from being smuggled and sold and to ban the direct or indirect sale of ransomsUS Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said payments and donations to ISIS perpetuate a cycle of horrific brutality giving these groups resources to carry out more murderous acts and incentivizing them to take more people captiveHow much ISIS really receives from donations is unclearMost charities supporting radical Islam in the Gulf are aligned with Al Qaeda not ISIS said GartensteinRossGartensteinRoss pointed to Abdulrahman alNuaymi a Qatari who has been accused by the US Treasury Department of transferring millions of dollars to Al Qaeda affiliates in Iraq and Syria as a prime example of this arrangement While many blame Qatar for playing a double game of supporting both radical Islamist groups and the coalition against ISIS the Obama administration disputes the notion that wealthy Arabs from Persian Gulf countries give generously to ISISISIL derives a relatively small share of its funds from deeppocket donors and thus does not today depend principally on moving money across international borders Instead ISIL obtains the vast majority of its revenues through local criminal and terrorist activities said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S Cohen in October at The Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceThere is a lot of opacity GartensteinRoss admitted But he said the smuggling of black market goods similar to the opium trade by the Taliban inside Afghanistan taxation among the Iraqi population particularly in Mosul and the sale of oil round out other areas of ISIS funding GartensteinRoss pointed out that airstrikes from the USled coalition against oil refineries in Syria have denied ISIS a large source of revenue Looting and ransoms make up for some of the difference howeverSome experts point to the Iraqi government as unwittingly contributing to ISIS coffers Aki Peritz a former CIA counterterrorism analyst said in a recent New York Times oped that the Iraqi government continues to pay its civil servants in Mosul despite being controlled by ISISPeritz wrote Baghdad provides about 130 million every month to pay all its workers in Mosul and estimated that Iraqs treasury has paid over 1 billion to these civil servants since Mosul fell in June 2014 He estimated that ISIS has taken half of those payments in the form of taxationWhile efforts are currently underway to dismantle key revenue sources for the Islamic State there are signs the caliphate is receiving setbacks from within According to syriadirectorg Assassinations bombings and defections plague the Islamic State in Deir eZor in oilrich eastern Syria The nonprofit news outlet based in
