Leave a reply Selwyn Duke  Sex crimes with children child exploitation money laundering perjury and pay to play reads the partial list of crimes that say New York City Police Department sources could put Hillary and her crew away for lifeShocking evidence of such criminality has been found on excongressman Anthony Weiners laptop computer say the sources which was seized from him by NYC officials investigating his allegedly having sent sexually explicit texts to a 15yearold girl Moreover Hillary Clintons crew supposedly includes not just close aide and confidante Huma Abedin and her husband Weiner but other aides and insiders  and even members of Congress Reports True Pundit  NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to  Money laundering  Sex crimes with minors children  Perjury  Pay to play through Clinton Foundation  Obstruction of justice  Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a sic NYPD Chief the departments highest rank under Commissioner said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co conspirators NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices Whats in the emails is staggering and as a father it turned my stomach the NYPD Chief said There is not going to be any Houdinilike escape from what we found We have copies of everything We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that These revelations would explain why Director Comey reopened the investigation into Clintons mishandling of classified information a move that shook the political world and caused Comey to come under fire As the NYPD chief put it the new emails contents truly are alarming True Pundit also reports FBI sources as stating that Abedin and Weiner are both trying to cut immunity deals with federal officials and that if they didnt cooperate theyd face long prison sentences Abedins turning states evidence would no doubt be devastating for Clinton as the two women have for years been joined at the hip Abedin has at times been like Clintons shadow has been called her body woman and has even been rumored to be Clintons lesbian lover So Abedin likely knows where as is said the bodies are buried Of particular note the new emails allegedly contain information revealing that Hillary Bill Clinton Weiner and numerous congressmen took trips to convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epsteins private island where he is said to pimp out underage minors of both sexes to prominent people The trips were taken aboard Epsteins Boeing 747 dubbed the Lolita Express the pedophiles island in the US Virgin Islands has been called  Sex Slave Island  These revelations would also explain why Clinton used powerful software called BleachBit to scrub damning information from her private server According to BleachBits website its program gives criminals and others the ability to shred files to hide their contents and prevent data recovery Yet it cant scrub bumbling perverts from your personal life and Weiners laptop also contains incriminating emails revealing the mishandling of classified information by Abedin and Clinton say the sources Both women sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts and this information could have been accessed printed discussed leaked or distributed by untold numbers  of unknown individuals writes True Pundit  Consequently FBI sources say the new Clinton investigation has been broadened and now includes matters such as how informs True Pundit   Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiners email  Abedin stored emails containing government secrets in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500000 archived State Department emails  Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records  Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemailcom address to sendreceivestore classified and top secret documents  a private consultant managed Weiners site for the last six years including three years when Clinton was secretary of state and therefore had full access to all emails as the domains listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts This story just adds more intrigue to a presidential campaign that is truly unprecedented with a torrent of WikiLeaks and Project Veritas revelations and now Clintons Weiner woes From vote fraud to inciting violence to child sex abuse to payforplay to perjury its becoming clear to many that the Democratic Party  and the Clintons in particular  are essentially a criminal syndicate As former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said in a Sunday interview The Clintons thats a crime family basically Its like organized crime I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool God forbid we put someone like that Clinton in the White House And now we know better why as I wrote Sunday this appears standard FBI sentiment I personally know of an exagent  someone with knowledge of Clinton crime family dealings  who Im told is having trouble sleeping at night due to the prospect of a Clinton presidency All these revelations raise important questions How could Hillary Clinton and her cohorts have bumbled so badly that they appear a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Boss Tweed  And if Clinton is so careless with her own personal survival how can she be trusted with national survival Part of the explanation is general incompetence yet theres another factor Both Clintons have engaged in continual criminality over the decades  and have been allowed to skate at every turn This lack of accountability has led to complacency and everincreasing brazenness just as with a child never punished for wrongdoing So finally perhaps Clinton corruption has reached critical mass And with Donald Trump ahead 10 points according to one respected poll among the 88 percent of voters who have definitely made up their minds maybe come late Tuesday evening some tossing and turning FBI agents will finally be able to enjoy a good nights rest SF Source The New American Nov 2016 Share this
