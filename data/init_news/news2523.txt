FBI Agents Must Come Forward to Confront Corruption November 07 2016 FBI Agents Must Come Forward to Confront Corruption We are in uncharted territory Unfettered corruption has metastasized to the highest levels of government FBI Director James Comey a man once widely respected throughout all levels of law enforcement has sadly sealed his legacy as a crooked shill for the Clinton crime family Its the theatre of the absurd Based upon his Sunday announcement that he intends to put the kibosh for now at least on Hillary Clintons criminal investigations Mr Comey has asked the American people to believe that the FBI thoroughly reviewed 650000 emails from Anthony Weiners laptop in a whopping 691200 seconds I suspect Comey may have come across details of his own impending suicide on Weiners hard drive Its little wonder that trust for government is at an alltime low and that the FBI has become a national laughing stock Indeed a preponderance of legal and political analysists agree that the level of corruption and coverup forcing Richard Nixon to resign his presidency in disgrace in 1974 pales by comparison to the evidence behind the multiple criminal investigations surrounding Hillary Clinton  the Democratic Partys embattled presidential nominee Both the Clinton Foundation and Clinton email scandals represent jointly and separately Watergate on steroids While a week ago Mr Comey sent a letter to both Republicans and Democrats in Congress advising them that In connection with an unrelated case the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the ongoing Clinton investigation an even greater bombshell shook the Clinton camp midweek Fox News reports Wednesday night that the FBIs Clinton Foundation probe has produced an avalanche of evidence likely to result in indictments reports the Washington Times Bret Baier based on two sources said in a tweet that barring obstruction theyd likely continue 2 push to try for an indictment The obstruction referenced as Baier later explained is that presently being conducted by the Obama Department of Justice DOJ in general and Attorney General Loretta Lynch in particular As leaks indicate the DOJ has placed a roadblock at every corner in an effort to obstruct the ongoing FBI investigations into Mrs Clintons illicit activities Multiple reports further indicate that said DOJ obstruction has triggered an uprising within the Bureau Mr Baier continues the Times said the probe into payforplay charges at the Foundation by the Bureaus White Collar Crime division has been going on for more than a year and has involved multiple interviews with numerous individuals It doesnt take a beltway insider to recognize that if Hillary Clinton takes the White House on Tuesday an unprecedented constitutional crisis looms large An already divided nation will be thrown into chaos and a hyperpartisan Washington DC will effectively settle like concrete into total gridlock The aforementioned criminal investigations into Secretary Clintons activities though intertwined in a tangled web of deleted emails paytoplay shakedowns and obstruction of justice are otherwise quite easy to understand While serving as Secretary of State Mrs Clinton had a private email server installed in the basement of her Chappaqua NY home with the express and very much illegal purpose of leveraging her federal power and authority to both solicit Clinton Foundation donations and to conduct official State business The private server enabled her to avoid government oversight and accountability and to racketeer under cover of darkness Mrs Clinton then obtained and used a private email address  to conceal her illicit activity While soliciting bribes from foreign dignitaries Islamic terrorist nations and foreign corporate wheelerdealers she likewise transmitted highly classified government information over her unsecured network No less than five enemy nations then hacked the account with little difficulty gaining access to classified State secrets Mrs Clinton shamelessly  treasonously  placed her own personal enrichment above national security and the lives and safety of American citizens both at home and abroad Thus in the interest of both justice and the best interests of the American people FBI agents and other government officials with direct evidence of Hillary Clintons crimes and the Obama DOJs ongoing coverup should immediately release that evidence to both Congress and the public at large Its not a leak when the level of systemic crime and corruption has reached critical mass as it has within both the Obama administration and Mrs Clintons presidential campaign These public servants will be whistleblowers not rouge agents  patriots not partisans Their oath is to the US Constitution not to a second rate community organizer his Marxist political party or that partys career criminal presidential nominee Theyd better hurry though Mr Obama likely has his Clinton pardon
