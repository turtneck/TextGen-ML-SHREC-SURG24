A prisoner sharing a police transport van with Freddie Gray told investigators that he could hear Gray banging against the walls of the vehicle and believed that he was intentionally trying to injure himself according to a police document obtained by The Washington PostThe prisoner was separated from Gray by a metal partition and could not see him His statement is contained in an application for a search warrant which is sealed by the court The Post was given the document under the condition that the prisoner not be named because the person who provided it feared for the inmates safety But the prisoner Donta Allen 22 later spoke to the media including The Post and allowed himself to be identifiedIn a phone interview Allen said he had been in the van with Gray and told police he heard light banging He said the police report incorrectly characterized his statements to authorities and that he never ever said to police that Gray was hurting himselfAllen who is on probation for an armed robbery conviction declined to comment furtherThe document written by a Baltimore police investigator offers the first glimpse of what might have happened inside the van It is not clear whether any additional evidence backs up the prisoners version which is just one piece of a much larger probeProsecutors on May 1 announced they had charged six officers in connection with Grays death One officer faces a seconddegree murder charge three others are charged with manslaughter The remaining two face charges including seconddegree assault and misconduct in officeGrays life is a study in the sad effects of lead paint on poor blacksGray was found unconscious in the wagon when it arrived at a police station on April 12 The 25yearold had suffered a spinal injury and died a week later touching off waves of protests across Baltimore capped by a riot Monday in which hundreds of angry residents torched buildings looted stores and pelted police officers with rocksPolice have said they do not know whether Gray was injured during the arrest or during his 30minute ride in the van Local police and the US Justice Department both have launched investigations of Grays deathJason Downs one of the attorneys for the Gray family said the family had not been told of the prisoners comments to investigatorsWe disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord Downs said We question the accuracy of the police reports weve seen thus far including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incidentCapt Eric Kowalczyk chief spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department declined to comment on the affidavit citing the ongoing investigation The person who provided the document did so on condition of anonymityThe affidavit is part of a search warrant seeking the seizure of the uniform worn by one of the officers involved in Grays arrest or transport It does not say how many officers were in the van whether any reported that they heard banging or whether they would have been able to help Gray if he was seeking to injure himself Police have mentioned only two prisoners in the vanBaltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W Batts has admitted flaws in the way officers handled Gray after they chased him through a West Baltimore housing project and arrested him They said they later found a switchblade clipped to the inside of his pants Batts has said officers repeatedly ignored Grays pleas for medical help and failed to secure him with a safety belt or harness in the back of the transport vanVideo shot by several bystanders has fueled the rage in West Baltimore It shows two officers on top of Gray putting their knees in his back then dragging his seemingly limp body to the van as he cries outBatts has said Gray stood on one leg and climbed into the van on his ownThe van driver stopped three times while transporting Gray to a booking center the first to put him in leg irons Batts said the officer driving the van described Gray as irate The search warrant application says Gray continued to be combative in the police wagonThe driver made a second stop five minutes later and asked an officer to help check on Gray At that stop police have said the van driver found Gray on the floor of the van and put him back on the seat still without restraints Police said Gray asked for medical help at that pointThe third stop was to put the other prisoner into the van The van was then driven six blocks to the Western District station Gray was taken from there to a hospital where he died April 19Batts has said officers violated policy by failing to properly restrain Gray But the president of the Baltimore police union noted that the policy mandating seat belts took effect April 3 and was emailed to officers as part of a package of five policy changes on April 9 three days before Gray was arrestedGene Ryan the police union president said many officers arent reading the new policies  updated to meet new national standards  because they think theyre the same rules they already know with cosmetic changes The updates are supposed to be read out during preshift meetingsThe previous policy was written in 1997 when the department used smaller boxier wagons that officers called ice cream trucks They originally had a metal bar that prisoners had to hold during the ride Seat belts were added later but the policy made their use discretionaryRyan said that until all facts become clear he urged everyone not to rush to judgment The facts as presented will speak for themselves I just wish everyone would take a step back and a deep breath and let the investigation unfoldThe search warrant application says that detectives at the time did not know where the officers uniform was located and that they wanted his departmentissued longsleeve shirts pants and black boots or shoes The document says investigators think that Grays DNA might be found on the officers clothes
