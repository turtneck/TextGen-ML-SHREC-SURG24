The rogue work of one nonconformist scientist could one day enable us to grow cheap replacement body parts Humanity in general and humans in particular have one dream to live longer than the allotted age If we could live forever well thatd be just swell never mind the consequencesHowever enamored to the idea of just swapping out old organs for newer flawless ones were still a long way from mass producing body parts Sure there might be a few unorthodox laboratories secretly catering to the specific needs of the 001 percent but these do nothing to benefit the rest of mankind The reason behind this is that living matter is incredibly wellstructured and its organized form is hard to grow outside of living thingsFor example you could multiply and grow liver cells in a lab but you would end up with an organic mass unable to serve any useful function Thats because a liver is much more than a number of hepatic cells these cells need to form tissue which is fed by blood vessels and crisscrossed by a network of neurons All this needs to sit inside a scaffold called the extracellular matrix ECM Huh another matrix keeping things togetherCOLORED IN BLUE ARE HUMAN CELLS GROWING ON AN APPLE SLICE SCAFFOLDINGWhen growing organs in the lab scientists dont have a lot of options regarding the scaffolding they use Its either sourced from live animals and cadavers or 3D printed from proprietary materials Both these practices are timeconsuming and prohibitively expensive Well maybe not anymoreWe used an apple and it cost penniesMeet scientistentrepreneur Andrew Pelling Also a professor at the University of Ottawa Pelling knows the only way to truly understand the world around us is to be curious and openminded That is how he got worldwide recognition for growing human ears from apple slicesIn order to do this Pelling and his team came up with some minor modifications to wellknown decellularization protocols that are typically applied to existing organs and tissues Decellularization is the process through which cells are flushed out from tissue leaving behind only the extracellular matrix Scientists have been doing this for decades but never before has been fruit used to grow human earsSo how did they manage this feat of biohacking Easy Pellings wife is a musical instrument maker so she carves wood for a living The scientist simply asked his wife to sculpt some ears from Macintosh apples After removing all the apple cells from the apple ear Pelling was left with a readytouse cheap cellulose scaffoldAs weird as this is its actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized Pelling told the audience during a Ted Talk  And we found in our preclinical work that you can implant these scaffolds into the body and the body will send in cells and a blood supply and actually keep these things alive This is the point when people started asking me Andrew can you make body parts out of apples And Im like Youve come to the right place The importance of this endeavor goes far beyond the shock value of using something as unassuming as an apple to potentially make us live longer In a very unexpected way fruits and veggies could help improve the lives of many sufferers The thing is you have to set them in a Petri dish rather than a plateSensing the importance of their project Pelling and his team posted the instructions online as opensource That way smaller laboratories on a tight budget could one day come up with solutions to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies with stuff we make in the kitchen That would leave us with more time to come up with great ideas a process that coincidentally happens in the same kitchen Now I was in my kitchen and I was noticing that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels And when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellulose forms these structures This image reminds me of two things our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord Imagine using asparagus stalks to grow new neurons and them implanting them in the bodies of those with damaged nerve connections If researched properly this technology has the potential to save millions It goes without saying that an unconventional creative way of thinking needs to be in place way before mainstream science can accept the fact that the solution to so many of our problems is right there in front of usIn the meantime dont forget your fruits and vegetables You know what they say an apple a day might save you from having to wear the same pair of tiredass ears for the rest of your life Or so Ive heardSource UFOholic
