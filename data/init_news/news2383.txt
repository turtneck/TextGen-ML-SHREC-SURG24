Washington CNN President Barack Obama offered one of his sharpest denunciations of Donald Trump to date Tuesday declaring the Republican nominee entirely unfit to serve as president and lambasting Republicans for sticking by their nomineeThe strong rebuke in the White House East Room came after Trumps criticism of the family of a slain Muslim US soldier along with comments that displayed apparent confusion related to the Russian incursion into UkraineThe Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president Obama said at a White House news conference with the Prime Minister of Singapore He keeps on proving itThe Trump campaign responded by going after the Democratic nominee as well as the PresidentHillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office a Trump statement said listing a number of policy concerns ObamaClinton have singlehandedly destabilized the Middle East handed Iraq Libya and Syria to ISIS and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at BenghaziLater Trump in an interview with WJLA said of Obama Hes a terrible president Hell probably go down as the worst president in the history of our country Hes been a total disasterObama on Tuesday described his feelings about Trump as unprecedented recalling disagreements with previous GOP presidential nominees Sen John McCain and Mitt Romney  but never an outright sense they were unfit to serveThe notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country the fact that he doesnt appear to have basic knowledge of critical issues in Europe the Middle East in Asia means that hes woefully unprepared to do this job Obama saidSpeaking alongside Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the White House East Room Obama said there are now weekly episodes in which even Republican party leaders distance themselves from TrumpThere has to be a point at which you say Enough  Obama saidObama placed responsibility for Trumps statements squarely on his fellow Republicans many of whom denounced his statements on the slain soldiers family but didnt withdraw their supportWhat does this say about your party that this is your standardbearer Obama asked of GOP leaders This isnt a situation where you have an episodic gaffe This is daily and weekly where they are distancing themselves from statements hes making There has to be a point at which you say This is not somebody I can support for president of the United States even if he purports to be a member of my party Obama said that denunciations from Republicans of Trumps remarks ring hollow without an accompanying withdrawal of supportI dont doubt their sincerity I dont doubt they were outraged by some of the statements that Mr Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family Obama said But there has to come a point in which you say Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesnt have the judgment the temperament the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world Trump and the family of the slain soldier have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over Muslims in America and the nature of patriotic sacrificeAfter Khizir Khan who lost his son in a suicide bombing in Iraq declared at last weeks Democratic National Convention that Trump had sacrificed nothing the Republican nominee claimed hed been viciously attacked and questioned why Khans wife Ghazala didnt make her own remarksCriticism from Trumps own party came swiftly including in a lengthy statement from McCain whom Trump previously derided for having been taken captive in the Vietnam War But he and other top GOP leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan made little indication they would withdraw support for the Republican candidateTrump has also taken flak for appearing unaware that Russian forces had annexed Crimea in early 2014 saying on ABCs This Week Sunday that President Vladimir Putin is not going into Ukraine Later he argued that the people of Crimea would rather be with Russia than where they were  an argument that Putin himself has made in justifying his annexation of the disputed Ukrainian territoryTrump looks for better Russia tiesAnd hes maintained his view that fostering better ties to Putin would benefit areas of American foreign policy including in the fight against ISIS If we could get along with Russia wouldnt that be a good thing instead of a bad thing Trump asked Monday during a campaign appearance in PennsylvaniaTrump also took heat for calling on Russia last week to release deleted emails from Clinton if they had obtained them in a hack of the Democratic National Committee which US officials have fingered Moscow forAt the news conference Obama said the alleged Russian hacking wouldnt necessarily prompt a complete freeze in relations between the the country and the United StatesNoting that the FBI was still investigating the hack Obama said cybersecurity was just another dispute of many between Putin and himselfIf in fact Russia engaged in this activity its just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr Putin talk about Obama said I dont think that it wildly swings what is a tough difficult relationship that we have with Russia right nowObamas administration through the Justice Departments national security division continues to investigate the hack Neither the White House nor the FBI have publicly blamed Russia for the intrusion But federal officials said there is strong evidence indicating the breach was perpetrated by hackers working on behalf of Russia intelligenceTrump has brushed off Democratic charges that Putin could be behind the hack in order to tip the US election in his favor claiming hes never met the Russian leader and doesnt maintain a relationship with him In statements from only a few years ago however Trump said he enjoyed warm ties with PutinObamas remarks Tuesday intensify his patten of inserting himself into the rancorous presidential race While the President has freely criticized Trump in the year since the businessman entered the race his denunciations have come faster and harsher in the last several weeksAt last weeks convention Obama named Trump repeatedly arguing the candidate was ignorant of facts and intent on dividing the nation And in June Obama lit into Trumps response to the mass shooting in Orlando saying he was peddling a dangerous visionThe President is expected to play an outsized role on the campaign trail in the coming months as Clinton works to motivate the supporters who helped elect Obama to office twice
