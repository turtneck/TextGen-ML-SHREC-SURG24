punchNew York Democratic Rep Jerry Nadler told CNN he remains undecided on the agreement but he said the meeting with Rhodes helped provide additional information as he reviews the detailsNadler said one Democrat expressed concerns in the session about the future capability in roughly 15 years for Iran to potentially develop a nuclear weapon Rhodes pointed to restrictions in several areas of deal

said there was no detailed briefing on any arms but the assurances were that the United States was definitely prepared to assure the security of Israel and do what was necessary to make that happenOne member who requested anonymity told CNN the session was very helpful in clarifying various questions including ones about sanctions relief access by the International Atomic Energy Agency for inspections and why the US ended up supporting an eventual relaxation in the embargo on the ability of Iran to buy conventional weapons and ballistic missiles The administration officials emphasized there was going to be 247 monitoring at known nuclear facilities and the different process for othersSome of the concerns that people had were addressed but there are still lots of questions said the

reviewing the deal Defense Secretary Ash Carter leaves for Israel and other countries in the region this weekendBoth Schakowsky and Israel told CNN so far their offices have not gotten a large number of calls from Jewish constituents urging them to block the dealAs part of its aggressive outreach to build support for the Iran deal several key administration officials earlier this week held a conference call with American Jewish leadersTwo participants told CNN there were some pointed questions in the call but said was not hostileAmong the officials on the call were Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and US Ambassador to Israel Dan ShapiroAmong the areas participants pushed the administration on during the call were whether there were holes in the access for inspections concerns Iran would use money from sanctions relief for destabilizing activities and is Iran really going to be forced to divulge information about its past activities according to one of the participants who is deeply concerned about the agreement The source said the officials defended the amount of access for inspections and told the leaders Iran will face pressure to use the money from sanctions relief for internal needsDuring the call the administration officials said Israel will not be more in danger and emphasized how Carter will be going there next week and will talk to the government about ways to bolster itSeveral major American Jewish organizations oppose the deal including the influential American Israeli Public Affairs Committee which said the proposed deal with Iran fails to verifiably eliminate every Iranian pathway to a nuclear weapons On Thursday it posted a petition online urging its members to weigh in Unfortunately the proposed agreement is fundamentally flawedUrge your senators and representatives to oppose the agreementThe Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of American and the Rabbinical Council of America are among a number of groups organizing a rally next week in New York against the deal The inspections regime is insufficient to ensure Iran cannot cheat and surreptitiously develop nuclear weapons despite President Obamas promise that the deal would be subject to the toughest verification and inspections in the world they said in a statement outlining of their key reasons for coming out against itThe White House got a more supportive response from the leftleaning J Street group Following our own review of the agreement we expect to call on Congress to support the deal as the best  if not only  means of ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons
