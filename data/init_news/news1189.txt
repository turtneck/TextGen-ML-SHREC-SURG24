Later this week Pope Francis will reportedly make a moral case for combating climate change arguing that it is mostly a problem created by humans and that we must make fundamental lifestyle and energy consumption changes to reverse course  on behalf of the worlds poor but also on behalf of all of us This among other factors could help push climate change on to the national political agenda giving it more relevance to this cycle than it has enjoyed in previous yearsBut if anything the partisan and ideological divide over global warming is as wide as ever and perhaps is getting worseThats what a new Pew poll indicates The Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise Some 69 percent of Americans now say it is a very or somewhat serious problem However Pew also finds views about the significance of global warming as a problem continue to divergeThe Pew poll finds that 68 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence of global warming But the partisan divide is stark86 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents say there is evidence of it while Republicans are split 4548 on the questionThats driven not surprisingly by conservative Republicans the only ideological group that says theres no solid evidence of climate change  and when you get deeper into the partisan and ideological breakdown the differences get more starkToday roughly nineinten liberal Democrats 92 say that there is solid evidence the earths average temperature is rising and 76 attribute this rise mostly to human activity Very few liberal Democrats 5 say there is not solid evidence of warming A clear 83 majority of conservative and moderate Democrats also say the Earth is warming but just 55 say this is the result of human activity By contrast just 38 of conservative Republicans say that there is solid evidence of global warming Reflecting a divide within the GOP conservative Republicans stand out as the only ideological group in which a majority 56 says that there is not solid evidence of a rise in the earths temperature a 61 majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say the earth is warmingMeanwhile as David Leonardt notes skepticism about global warming is running high among GOP voter groups such as older voters whites men and white evangelicalsWhile there are reasons to doubt that Hillary Clinton will be quite the climate hawk that some advocates hope for in her Saturday kickoff speech she leaned harder than expected into arguments for robust action to combat climate change and transition towards a clean energy economy and future Its often said that climate is not a motivating issue for voters and its true that Democrats and advocates have not cracked this problem yet That said whatever the impact on the electoral outcome its still plausible that climate will have a significantly higher profile this cycle than it has in previous onesIts not just that Clinton appeared to signal that she will campaign on climate as part of a broader bet on the Obama coalition of millennials nonwhites and socially liberal college educated whites Its also a confluence of other factors The Obama administration will roll out new EPA rules for existing power plans this summer and the court battles over them will intensify Meanwhile President Obama will be trying to negotiate a global climate deal later this year in Paris All indications are hell be talking about the issue more and more as a key piece of his legacy These developments may coincide with the intensifying GOP presidential primary in which the candidates will all be showcasing the zeal with which theyd roll back Obamas agenda  the climate piece includedAll of which seems likely to only make polarization around climate change worse No matter what Pope Francis has to say about itUPDATE I should also have noted that the Pew poll finds that worry about global warming is on the rise Some 69 percent of Americans say it is a very or somewhat serious problem Ive edited the above to add that
