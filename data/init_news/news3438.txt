By Rmuse on Sat Oct 29th 2016 at 323 pm He is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in Republicans faces   The following is an opinion column by R Muse Although this campaign season has been interesting to say the least there is something happening one never thought would occur After spending nearly eight years demonizing obstructing and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing It is hypocritical to say the least and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of Donald Trump President Obama is also reminding Republicans that  Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of GOP toxic hostility  It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him  but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at Republicans Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the Presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed opposed and attempted to get rid of Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President to break the grip of heroin addiction President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for  Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump  but only  After looking at the polling Now that its politically expedient But he has supported him up until last week So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists  and insulting Gold Star moms making fun of disabled Americans I guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge Why was that OK And now he says he will vote for the vicepresidential nominee instead except that guy still supports Donald Trump  The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times California Republican Representative Daryl Issa is sending out campaign mailers with the Presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama  to protect victims of sexual assault  Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the Presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issacreated scandals During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the Presidents image on it The President said  Issas primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumpedup investigations that have led nowhere This is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me Now that is the definition of chutzpah As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable  He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans faces  The President clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue Republicans with He said   Heres the thing For years Republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me About Hillary About Harry They said I wasnt born here They said climate change is a hoax They said that I was going to take everybodys guns away They said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law This is what theyve been saying for years now So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true And if the world theyve been seeing is Im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though I cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do we wont be able to appoint judges well gum up the works well create gridlock itll give us a political advantage So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff So Donald Trump did not start this Donald Trump didnt start it he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it take credit for it and promote it Thats what he always does And so now when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away Oh this is too much So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down suddenly thats a dealbreaker Well what took you so long What the heck What took you so long All these years The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution or  revenge  against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years Without knowing what goes on in the Presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive The President is though an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House
