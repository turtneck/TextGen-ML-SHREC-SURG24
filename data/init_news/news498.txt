Donald Trump is adamant that he raised more than 5 million for military veterans this campaign season and that it is all going to veterans charities After reports raised questions about whether thats trueTrump scheduled a press conference Tuesday to give more details about the donations whereaboutsAt his press conference Trump explained the lack of clarity surfaced in a recent Washington Postreport by stating he wanted to keep it private I dont think its anybodys business if I wanna send money to the vets before ultimately unveiling the list of recipientsAccording to reporting from theAssociated Press many of these donations were dated the same day as the Washington Posts article Trump associated the timing with the vetting process reviewing statistics reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money he said TuesdayBut what his reaction to scrutiny of his alleged veterans donations really reveals about Trump is how he handles criticism from the press  viewing factchecking from reporters as personal attacks rather than a nettlesome but necessary role in democracyLast week the presumptive Republican nominee responded to the Posts report which found his January charity event  which he claimed raised more than 6 million in donations for veterans charities  had come up shortIts not the first time reports have raised questions about the donations In March Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks shot down media inquiries in an interview with CNN that similarly wondered about these alleged donationsIf the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated rather than trying to disparage Mr Trumps generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation we would all be better for it Hicks told CNNAt the event which Trump held as counterprograming to the Republican presidential debate he boycotted in January the candidate said he broke 6 million in donations 1 million of which he donated himselfBut as of March Hicks said they were still collecting donations Now Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says some of the events biggest donors have backed down on their promises The fundraiser actually brought in 45 million or 75 percent of what was initially said the Washington Posts David Fahrenthold reported He later remarked on Twitter that even the adjusted numbers are still a hefty and admirable sum for a worthy causeAt the time of the report the campaign said the amount was not 45 million Trump tweeted it is somewhere between 5 million and 6 millions and it was unclear where Trumps own pledge of 1 million ended upBut regardless of the numbers something has become increasingly clear Trump feels this isnt about the money Hes making it about him doing a good deedThe press should be ashamed at themselves and on behalf of the vets the press should be ashamed of themselves Trump said Tuesday even calling a reporter at his press conference a sleazeThe reports were a personal attack Trump saidInstead of being like Thank you very much Mr Trump or Trump did a good job everyone said Who got it Who got it Who got it Trump said And you make me look very bad I have never received such bad publicity for doing a good jobThe Washington Post report was yet another dishonest ploy from the mainstream media trying to spin his good deed into scandal he tweeted when the report surfacedIn many ways Trumps idea to host a fundraising event honoring veterans began as a reaction to the disgusting media In January Trump decided to boycott the last GOP presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses because of Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn KellyIt was an early chapter in their monthslong feud  she represented the biased media he felt she had personally targeted him in the first debate and intended to tank Fox Newss ratings by hosting a charitable even in Iowa at the same time as the debate Trump and Kelly have of course now officially made upTrumps fundraiser was organized on a whim and featured the things that represent Trump the most Middle America an unyielding love for America and Trump supportersFor Trump the Washington Posts report was an attempt to turn a good deed sourBut Fahrenthold maintains that wasnt the intention launching a 16tweet response to Trumps comment He has some questionsJanuarys fundraising event raised a lot of money for veterans It was also undeniably a political platformIt resembled a Trump rally as much as it did a charitable event I reported in JanuarySince then Trump has used the event to exemplify all the good he has done for the military and its veterans In the weeks after he used his campaign events to give large checks to various charities rallying confidence that he can get good things done with a snap of his fingers he raised millionsThe point is clear Trump under no obligation did a good thing
