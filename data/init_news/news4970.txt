believer who promises to amplify the GOP nominees nationalist message and reinforce his populist impulsesSteve Bannon is a fighters fighter He is somebody who wants to be the first boots on the beach In the military its called the tip of the spear said David Bossie a conservative activist It was Bossie who five years ago introduced Trump to Bannon the top executive of the new media clarion of the establishmentloathing right Breitbart NewsBreitbart has since become a champion of Trumps candidacy  in large part because Stephen K Bannon himself believes it represents a cause much bigger than a

else on this side of the Atlantic was taking the prospect of a British exit from the European Union seriously Bannon invited influential Republican leaders to a dinner for Nigel Farage the head of the UK Independence Party at the Capitol Hill townhouse known as the Breitbart EmbassyBossie and others hailed Bannons pick as a sign that Trump whose campaign has wobbled since the GOP convention will return to the messages that won him the Republican nominationIts been frustrating that the campaign is not as vibrant and agile as we thought it could be at this stage Bossie said Steve is all action action actionDemocrats saw a darker more divisive turn in the selection of Bannon to hold the new title of chief executiveRobby Mook campaign manager for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told reporters on Wednesday We absolutely expect with this change for Donald Trump and the campaign as a whole to double down on more conspiracy theories more hateful rhetoric more wild accusationsMook also called Breitbart News a divisive at times racist antiMuslim conspiracy news site citing a report earlier this year by the Southern Poverty Law Center a legal advocacy organizationOne headline last October dubbed Bannon the most dangerous political operative in AmericaIn that Bloomberg News article Joshua Green reported that Andrew Breitbart the late founder of the site had described Bannon with sincere admiration as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement a reference to the infamous and glamorous maker of Third Reich propaganda filmsMoviemaking has been one of the many chapters of Bannons career which had previously included four years aboard a Navy destroyer a postMBA stint with Goldman Sachs and founding an investment firm specializing in mediaIn one particularly felicitous deal Bannons fee included an early stake in Seinfeld the residuals of which alone would turn out to be enough to make him wealthyAlong the way he developed a worldview remarkably in tune with what is now regarded as Trumpism suspicious of free trade and liberal immigration policies wary of military adventurism and contemptuous of the old orderBannon grew up in a workingclass Democratic family in Norfolk Va He has attributed his disillusionment with the Democrats to his years in the Navy under Jimmy Carter as commander in chief and said his experience running businesses in

weve gotta take back the cultureAt the time Breitbart was trying to get his own website going after having been an editor for the conservative aggregator Matt Drudge and a researcher for Arianna Huffingtons leftleaning Huffington Post Bannon signed on to Breitbarts new ventureAfter Breitbarts death from heart failure in 2012 Bannon vowed to carry on his vision by building a global operation of real hell fightersHis operation has a more wonkish side as well in the form of the nonprofit Government Accountability Institute which produced the bestselling book Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Business Helped Make Bill and Hillary RichTrump was not the first potential president to catch Bannons eyeIn 2011 Bannon released a twohour documentary about Sarah Palin called The Undefeated attempting to reshape the way that voters and the media viewed the former candidate for vice presidentThe reason she draws this kind of fire is that she is an existential threat to the establishment Bannon told Fox Newss Sean Hannity during the films promotional tour The vested interests in our country are scared to death of herWhile Palin dithered about whether to run for president the documentary flopped grossing 116381 But Bannon remained convinced that the GOP was ripe for a populist takeover That say former employees of the site was what set up the sites aggressive coverage of illegal immigration and what turned into the most proTrump news sourceIn March 2014 after BuzzFeeds McKay Coppins ran an unflattering report on what happened after traveling with Trumps fake presidential campaign Breitbart published a series of stories in which Trump allies attacked the reporter This nervous geek isnt fit to tie the Donalds wing tips Palin said defending Trump against CoppinsWhen Trump became a candidate for president the relationship deepened and the billionaire frequently made himself available to break news on his raceHe went to Breitbart to mock Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish and to attack Republicans for folding on trade In a typical interview conducted in November Bannon joked that he himself had gone to the poets version of business school  Harvard and he helped Trump dump criticism on the Republicans consultant classFormer employees of Breitbart describe a work environment that mirrors the Trump campaign Reporters who couldnt break or

hes doing a fantastic job even if he isnt Shapiro wrote Wednesday on his new site The Daily Wire Thats how Bannon Svengalis political figures and investors  by investing them in his personal genius then hollowing them out from the inside Theres a reason Sarah Palin went from legitimate political figure to parody artist to Trump endorser with Steve Bannon standing alongside her every step of the wayA lot of the people that you like and respect have targets on their backs as a result of Bannons ascent to the top wrote Ben Howe an editor at the conservative blog Red State who had spoken out against Trump You have no idea how dangerous this man is It is going to be score settling time for him if Trump wins If Donald Trump won the election and Steve Bannon were his chief of staff I would have legitimate fears about the use of government power to come after political enemies Shapiro said I dont think Steve Bannon has principlesBut a current employee of Breitbart who had not been authorized to speak for the record disputed that characterization of his boss What he does is he gets the best out of peopleThat it would appear is what Trump is hoping as well
