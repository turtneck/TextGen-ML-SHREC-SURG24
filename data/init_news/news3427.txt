When the news broke that our French colleagues had been killed a deep feeling of pain overwhelmed my newsroomand an immediate feeling of fear All of a sudden it seemed possible that we might be next that something might happen to us here in the heart of Berlin only a hundred yards or so away from Checkpoint CharlieIf there is any paper in Europe that comes close to Charlie Hebdo it is the one that I run  die tageszeitung which means simply The Daily or taz for short Both papers are an outcome of the student revolution founded in the spirit of the 68 Generation In my country it was clearly a reaction to Germanys authoritarian leaders some of whom were holdovers and exNazis from the pastLike Charlie Hebdo taz often uses satire to challenge the socalled mainstream We too have run satirical images of the Prophet Muhammad We decided to republish Charle Hebdos first postmassacre cover on Wednesday not only to express our solidarity but also as a proof that terrorists wont stop us from printing whatever we want to sayabout Islam or any religionAfter the massacre in Paris last week it didnt take long before a police car was parked in front of our building Since the morning of January 8 heavily armed police have stood in front of the entrance their machine guns at the ready The alert has risen since the attack on a German paper in Hamburg in the early Sunday morning hours where fortunately nobody was hurtThere are some picture posts on Facebook making fun of this scene at taz which itself sounds like a satire since we are known as some of the loudest critics of the police in Germany and many of our editorials have urged police not to wear weapons in publicAnd yet here we are Do not misunderstand me We are grateful for the help Instead of throwing stones at the policeas the founding generation of this paper might have donewe offer hot tea and coffee in the icy winds of Germanys capital as a little gesture of thankfulnessStill passing this bristling display of weapons every time we enter our building does not give us a feeling of being wellprotected For the past week I have seen my colleagues constantly gathering together and asking each other questions like How do you feel Do we have to worry Are you also afraidIn every meeting we discuss what this fear does to us and if it influences our way of reporting or our editorial boardIs the freedom of speech already hurt by the strongest weapon terrorists have The weapon of fear So far we resist But the coming days and months will answer that questionThis terror act in France hits Europe in a crucial time We are experiencing a huge shift in the political landscape that endangers the whole order of the last two decades We see a strong increase of the right in many European countries in France but also in Great Britain and Italy And even in Germany which is doing financially so well we have the new party Alternative fr Deutschland or AfD with its very strong antiEuropean attitudeAll those parties have one political approach in common They not only use the real problems of unemployment and poverty for their political goals but they are the masters at blaming the European Union with its open markets and borders for everything bad that is happening Their goal is to renationalize their countries at the cost of the EU to strengthen the power of their own countries and parliaments and to fight the liberalization of their societies Many of them have strong resentments against gay people and are deeply racist They dream of the old order when white male Christians from the upper class ruled their countriesThe wall fell 25 years ago And that means that there are many people old enough to vote who never experienced the Cold War who never lived in a divided Europe and therefore easily forget the beauty of our UnionThat makes it easier for some rightwing politicians to exploit these acts of terrorism for their goals The blood in Paris wasnt even dry when the first German politician AlexanderGauland one of the top candidatesfrom the Alternative fr Deutschland party claimed this killing as a proof that Germany has the right to fear the influence of Muslim culture and that Germans have the right and the obligation to defend their Christian heritageWhether they are Germans French or Brits Europe is afraid of more terror from Islamic terrorists But the answer cannot be to add fuel to the socalled clash of civilizationsThe answer only can be to analyze the reasons and march toward solutions The Paris terrorists were French They were born in France went to French schools Europe has to learn that Muslims are not foreigners not outsiders That they are as French and German and British as Christians Jews or atheists areThe European Union the house of one unified continent is the main reason we have been living in peace for nearly 70 years Our Union was the only possible way to heal the wounds of World War II and to build trust in each other We must understand this and urgently fight together to overcome the big challenges of these daysespecially the rise of violence perpetrated by terroristsand autocratic states like Russia closer to homeNext week the CIA torture reports will be printed in German This report is the proof of how a country can be misled when it becomes ruled by fear We as European journalists must beat back this fear and stand up for our free democracies for tazand for the policemen outside our doors keeping us safefor the freedom to choose your own religion and for our Union here in Europe
