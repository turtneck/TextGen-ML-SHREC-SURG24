Why is Canada so boring Its a question that Canadian journalist Jeet Heer tried to answer in aseries of tweets that are both quaintly earnest this is a Canadian writing about Canadianness after all and surprisingly insightful The question it turns out gets to the very core of what it means to be Canadian That might sound to Americans like the setup to a joke but to the countrys 36 million citizens its a very real  and not totally settled  issueThe full series of tweets is embedded below and well worth your time but Heer lands on two theories As he clarifies these apply to Englishspeaking Canada not to the culturally unintegrated Frenchspeaking QuebecThe nice theory Canadians have cultivated an identity of boringness as an alternative to the two other cultures that loom so large for them the British whose empire they were a part of until relatively recently and the noisy Americans to the south Canadian boringness isnt intrinsic its something we work at cherish and reward Heer writes Because both of those cultural forces exert such power in Canada cultivated boringness is another way of saying We are not British and we are not AmericanThe less nice theory Canadas selfmade image of boringness is really just shorthand for whiteness In other words Canadian culture emphasizes look at how charmingly boring we are as a polite way of saying this is a white Anglo nation Or as Heer put it The constructed mask of boringness is also the mask of whiteness This he suggests presents the county as being much whiter than it is and is a way to exclude First Nations and ethnic minorities from Canadian identityThere is probably real truth to both of theseOne point I will add is that Ive noticed Canadians frequently describe their culture in contrast to American culture But talking so much about how you are different from Americans is really just another way of talking around all the ways youre similar and thispreoccupation with highlighting the differences and downplaying the similarities has always felt telling to meCanadian writer Bruce McCall in a great 2013 Vanity Fairpiece on why Canada produces so many successful comedians explained it as a kind ofresistance to American cultureIt is impossible to fully express Canadian resentment of Americas cultural dominance and the sense of impotence and helplessness he writes Humor  subversive ironic usually dark  is one of the very few weapons available to the oppressed But thats not just a reaction to American identity of course its also a way of dealing with the fact that it leaves very little room for a distinct Canadian identity Cultivated Canadian boringness is perhaps a way of owning that problem and making it the identity itselfHeres Jeet Heers full series of tweets on the subjectIf you made it to the bottom as a reward here is a great old Jim Carrey standup bit on American conceptions of Canada that speak to my earlier points
