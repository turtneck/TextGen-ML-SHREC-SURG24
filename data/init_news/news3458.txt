The Republican chairman of a highprofile House committee on Sunday shook up the race to succeed outgoing Speaker John A Boehner launching a challenge to the heavy favorite Majority Leader Kevin McCarthyThe bid by Rep Jason Chaffetz Utah chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes amid unrest from conservatives driven by doubts that McCarthy Calif will be any more inclined than Boehner to embrace the right flank of the House Republican ConferenceChaffetz said on Fox News Sunday that he was recruited by members displeased with McCarthys ascent and that he would bridge the divide in the House GOPChaffetz to run against McCarthy for House speakerYou dont just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership team he said That doesnt signal change I think House Republicans want a fresh face and fresh new person who is actually there at the leadership table in the speakers roleChaffetzs remarks not only reflect tensions between conservatives and establishment Republicans but also concerns about McCarthys ability to communicate with the GOP base and the public at large Those concerns grew after McCarthy made comments last week suggesting that a House investigation into the 2012 attacks on a US diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in Benghazi Libya stemmed from political motivationsMcCarthys comments on Benghazi probe may be a political gift to ClintonWe need somebody whos out there who is actually going out there and making the case to the American people talking to the Senate about what we need to do and going on the national television shows and winning that argument Chaffetz said We dont seem to win the argument and thats a problemChaffetz has spent his four House terms working his way to the top of the Oversight Committee a post that makes him the GOPs prime attack dog against President Obamas administration He is well versed in the handtohand political combat of cable news and talk radio and has become the partys face on a variety of issues including Secret Service failures and government funding for Planned ParenthoodHe made headlines this week after an inspector generals report found that a top Secret Service executive suggested leaking information that Chaffetz had been passed over for an agents job years ago in retaliation for his committees aggressive investigationsBut McCarthy retains considerable advantages ahead of the closeddoor GOP leadership elections set for Thursday He enjoys a weeks head start in building support a readymade political infrastructure and close relationships across the Republican conference built during his stint as the GOPs chief House candidate recruiter ahead of the 2010 midterm electionsIn Thursdays party elections a speaker candidate need only win the backing of a simple majority of those voting to become the Republican nominee But unlike other leadership posts the speaker is chosen in a subsequent floor vote of all House members and the Houses 246 Republicans will be under no obligation to select the party nomineeNo Democrats are expected to back McCarthy or any other Republican so the nominee cannot afford to lose the support of more than 28 GOP membersChaffetz suggested that McCarthy does not have that level of support There are nearly 50 people and a growing number that will not and cannot vote for Kevin McCarthy as the speaker on the floor Hes going to fall short of the 218 votes on the floor of HouseBut Chaffetz has weaknesses of his own He has received mixed reviews of his tenure as the Oversight Committee chairman with conservative commentators recently accusing him of squandering a hearing last week featuring the president of Planned Parenthood Cecile Richards And Chaffetz who criticized McCarthys comments on the Benghazi investigation has his own history of bombastic and controversial remarksHe also played a role in a key episode that fanned conservative outrage against establishment Republicans stripping an Oversight subcommittee chairman of his gavel in retaliation for breaking with leaders on a June procedural vote That member Rep Mark Meadows RNC went on to file a rare motion to vacate the speakers chair accelerating Boehners departureChaffetz said Sunday that he learned from that lesson that youre not going to do things by cutting people off at the kneesI think Im better for it and I think Mark is better for it and were certainly good friends on this day he saidMeadows agreed Sunday that bygones are bygones Any emphasis placed on past disagreements would be misguided and is certainly not a factor in this race for meChaffetz will audition alongside McCarthy and a third speaker candidate Rep Daniel Webster RFla in closeddoor meetings this week scheduled ahead of the Thursday elections A Tuesday evening session sponsored by hardline conservative groups including the increasingly influential House Freedom Caucus could be especially crucialWebster a backbencher who has emphasized the need for procedural improvements has won some support from conservatives but his appeal across the conference is limited A previous speaker bid challenging Boehner in January garnered 12 votesThe stakes of the speakers race were heightened in recent days after the Treasury Department announced that Congress must act to raise the federal debt ceiling on or about Nov 5  less than a week after Boehner leaves officeAn effort by Boehner to pass a debtlimit increase in his final days with mainly Democratic votes  as happened last week on a 10week government funding extension  could further weaken McCarthy who as majority leader is considered to be in control of the floor agendaChaffetz said Sunday that were just not going to unilaterally raise the debt limit and suggested that he would take cues from members who overwhelmingly support using the deadline as leverage in spending negotiations with ObamaAs the speaker youve got to take the will of our body appreciate and respect the process and then go fight for that he said
