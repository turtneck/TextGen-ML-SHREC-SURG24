Rubio Cruz Christie Improve Their Standing In Third GOP DebateThe Republican presidential race entered a new phase Wednesday night as the outsider candidates who dominated the first two debates were upstaged by several of their officeholding rivals  and by a budding controversy over the conduct of the third debate itselfBen Carson Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina were all on hand and all had their moments But the featured performer of the night was Marco Rubio the senator from Florida who at 44 is the youngest contestant in the field Also acquitting themselves well were his Senate colleague Ted Cruz of Texas and Chris Christie the oftembattled governor of New JerseyChristies muchmaligned campaign had barely qualified for inclusion in this debate but he seemed revivified by the questions and the interchange  especially the contretemps with the CNBC moderatorsEven in New Jersey what youre doing would be called rude said Christie referring to CNBC moderator John HarwoodRubio became the debates focus largely because of tough questions from the CNBC moderators that he deftly turned into recitations of his talking points When other rivals tried to probe the same vulnerabilities Rubio was quickly able to flip the polarity and deliver a put down in responseQuestioned about his missed votes in the Senate the most of any senator this year and his stated lack of interest in that position Rubio noted how many votes had been missed by senators in both parties pursuing the presidency in the pastWhen Jeb Bush the former Florida governor sometimes described as Rubios mentor renewed the criticism What is it in the Senate a French work week where you only have to show up for three days Rubio wondered why Bush had never spoken out about such things beforeThe only reason why youre doing it now Rubio charged is because were running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help youBush was not able to establish much momentum after that finishing near the bottom of the list in speaking time It was his third flat performance in the debate series to date and the most damaging in its timing His campaign had highlighted the evening calling it Bushs chance to rebut suggestions he lacks real enthusiasm for this campaign In recent weeks he has seemed diffident and offmessage at times in public appearances He has laid off staff as his standing in the polls has continued to declineRubio by stark contrast was both sharp with a cutting remark and adept at the charming aside Talking about a program for older people he beamed boyishly as he said Id never vote for anything that would hurt my momRubio has been locked in the single digits in national polls and surveys in the early voting states as well But many who watched the third debate expected that to change And if the current frontrunners should fade leaving their voters up for grabs the contest could become between Rubio and CruzThe nights peak energy point came when Cruz fielded a typically truculent question from one of the CNBC moderators and hit it out of the parkThe questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people dont trust the media Cruz saidThe debate audience clearly a sympathetic crowd roared its approval nearly drowning out Cruz as he continuedThis is not a cage match Cruz added And you look at the questions  Donald Trump are you a comicbook villain Ben Carson can you do math John Kasich will you insult two people over here Marco Rubio why dont you resign Jeb Bush why have your numbers fallenCruz contrasted these questions with those at the Democratic debate even though that event was put on by CNN He said all the Democrats were asked was Which of you is more handsome and whySeveral of the other Republican candidates tried to get in on the crowds appetite for media criticism before the evening was over Their staffs were also complaining about the inyourface tone of the CNBC crew After the debate Carsons campaign manager talked about renegotiating the terms of the remaining debatesReince Priebus the GOP national chairman who took control of the debates this year and made deals with the various news outlets also expressed dismay after the debate and said changes would be made to future formatsMeanwhile the man who has been proud of leading in polls among Republicans since July Donald Trump held his own Wednesday night despite a disappointing slide to No 2 in some of the most recent tests both nationally and in Iowa Trump delivered his stock lines about taxes immigration and badly negotiated deals on trade and foreign relations But the Trump presence was a measure less effervescent than on the stump or in earlier debatesThe new leader in some polls Carson the retired neurosurgeon reprised his role as the quiet man on stage He had less speaking time than almost any other candidate and when he had the spotlight he did little to hold it Asked for a weakness he cited his failure to think of himself as presidential material until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it He also seemed unsure of his footing at times when describing his tax rate plan and other economic mattersBut Carson too took the opportunity to push back on the CNBC journalists When Carl Quintanilla asked about Carsons association with a controversial maker of nutritional supplements Carson flatly denied any involvement and called the assertion pure propagandaIn fact Carson starred in a promotional video for the company and may face more questions about his statement in the days ahead But when Quintanilla tried to follow up the crowd booed and Carson took the out See he said they knowCarly Fiorina regarded by many as the standout performer in the Sept 16 debate managed to get more speaking time this time than any of her rivals  in part by resisting the moderators But while she came across as selfassured and offered one of her best defenses of leadership at HewlettPackard a decade ago Fiorina did not have a memorable exchange with Trump or any of the candidatesThe other four candidates who took part may have experienced more frustration than fulfillment Rand Paul a senator from Kentucky was one of the three candidates with fewest minutes of airtime His efforts to climb into the tax debate were largely unsuccessful Mike Huckabee had his usual moments of folksy humor but few scoring opportunitiesThe man who had the highest hopes for this round may have been John Kasich the governor of Ohio who has tried to go after the nonpolitician frontrunners attacking the unrealistic promises of lower taxes and an end to illegal immigration Kasich kicked off the evening with thinly veiled criticisms of Carson and Trump as potential occupants of the Oval OfficeMy great concern is that we are on the verge perhaps of picking someone who cannot do this job he charged adding We need somebody who can leadTrump promptly fired back with a withering rebuttal about Kasichs Ohio success being a windfall from oil produced by fracking and about Kasichs partnership at Lehman Brothers shortly before that Wall Street firm collapsed and set off the worst of the 2008 financial panicKasich had a comeback but his offensive came up short
