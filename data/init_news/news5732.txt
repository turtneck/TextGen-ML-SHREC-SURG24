While Russias increased presence in Syria gives the regime another leg to stand on some in Damascus say Moscow could also temper Irans influenceStarbucks will expand in China  and it looks like a smart ideaThis Sept 15 2015 satellite image with annotations provided by GeoNorth AllSource Analysis Airbus shows Russian tanks and armed personnel carriers at an air base in Latakia province SyriaRussias increased military assistance to Syria provides President Bashar alAssads embattled regime with a welcome boost to its hold on power after a series of territorial losses this year to rebel forcesBut while Russia appears to have coordinated its military expansion with Iran Mr Assads other key ally the move could also serve as a counterbalance to Tehrans powerful influence in Syria a phenomenon that has generated ripples of unease in some circles of the Damascus regimeRussia and Iran are staunch allies of Assad and collectively have provided diplomatic financial military and material support to help his regime stave off the challenge posed by opposition groupsBoth countries have much at stake Syria is one of the few Middle Eastern countries where Russia continues to wield influence and it provides Iran with a vital geographical conduit to its Lebanese protg Hezbollah It is also a key component of the axis of resistance an alliance of countries and parties opposed to Israel and Western regional interestsBoth Iran and Russia want to preserve the political system in Syria to keep Assad in power says Rajab Safarov the director of the Moscowbased Center for Studying Modern Iran Assads defeat would have a serious impact on Iran and wouldnt suit the interests of Moscow eitherStill despite the shared interest of Moscow and Tehran in the Assad regimes survival there are differences that Russias expanding military presence in Syria may expose in the coming monthsUntil recently the Iranians had much a bigger involvement on the ground than the Russians So I think the increase in Russian arms supplies is probably an attempt to balance the situation on the ground says Nikolay Kozhanov a visiting fellow of the RussianEurasia program at Londons Chatham House and nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Moscow CenterRussia continues to work with the Syrian state while Iran has set up a parallel security structure of local militias and foreign Shiite expeditionary forces from Lebanon Iraq Afghanistan and Pakistan granting it prolonged influence in Syria if the Assad regime fallsRussia seeks to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria and prevent it from breaking into militiarun fiefdoms That is a goal shared by the Assad regime which continues to fight for distant and isolated areas in the far north south and east of the country despite a critical manpower shortage in the decimated Syrian ArmyThe priority of Iran on the other hand is to hold onto the western periphery of Syria with access to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Mediterranean coast In recent months Iraniansupported forces including Hezbollah have pulled back from outerlying areas to concentrate on securing the key real estate from south of Damascus to Latakia on the coast in the northwest corner of the countryThe Russians see it as important that the country remain with its current borders  but I think the Iranians will be satisfied with control over certain areas of the country with proIranian groupings that would ensure their access to Lebanon and Hezbollah says Mr Kozhanov previously a diplomat at the Russian Embassy in Tehran Thats the difference and that difference is clearly understood in MoscowThe Assad regime owes Iran much for coming to its rescue with billions of dollars for the cashstrapped economy and deploying thousands of Shiite fighters against rebel forces But that Iranian lifeline came at a price Iranian military commanders rather than Syrian Army generals have been shaping much of the regimes defense according to Arab and Western diplomats in the region Tellingly Iranian and Hezbollah officers rather than the Syrian Army recently conducted ceasefire negotiations with a rebel group over the besieged oppositionheld town of Zabadani 17 miles northwest of DamascusFurthermore there have been allegations that Iran has been tampering with Syrias demographic geography by settling Shiites including the families of foreign fighters in and around Damascus and preventing Sunnis from returning to their homes in some regimeheld areas Last year the Assad regime passed a decree allowing Shiite doctrine to be taught in schools alongside Sunni Islam Shiite mosques are proliferating as well as stalls selling Shiite books pamphlets and motifs in Sunni areas of DamascusThe level of Iranian influence has fueled unease in Damascus reportedly even within the regime itself There have been several reports in the past year of top Syrian figures grumbling that Syria was giving up its sovereignty to IranHowever Russias expanded role in Syria could serve as a counterweight to Irans pervasive influenceSome observers are reading the Russian intervention as an attempt to preempt the total Iranization of the Syrian state as much as it is an attempt to rescue the regime says Faysal Itani resident fellow at the Atlantic Councils Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle EastThese differences aside Russian and Iran continue to share a vested interest in the Assad regimes survival While the level of coordination between Moscow and Tehran is unclear at this stage it may be no coincidence that signs of a Russian military buildup began shortly after a reported visit in late July to Moscow by MajGen Qassem Suleimani commander of the Quds Force the external operations wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Lebanons As Safir newspaper reported Tuesday that Suleimani paid another visit to Moscow last weekI believe Iran and Russia are getting closer in the course of the Syrian crisis although they have had different approaches in dealing with the situation says Kayhan Barzegar director of the Institute for Middle East Strategic Studies in TehranStill their common interests should ensure continued cooperationIn fact its Russia that currently needs a powerful regional partner to shape its new politicalsecurity doctrine in the region says Mr Barzegar I think Russia is careful to not upset Iran in the new circumstances especially in a time that there is an ongoing thaw between Iran and the WestStaff writer Scott Peterson contributed to this report from Tehran and contributor Olga Podolskaya
