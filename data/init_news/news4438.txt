BNI Store Nov 7 2016 HERE THEY GO AGAIN Muslims trying to claim that the Hebrewlanguage Dead Sea Scrolls are Arab Muslim in origin So let me get this straight The Dead Sea Scrolls are demonstrably written in Hebrew But the Palestinians are now saying these ancient documents are like Jerusalems Temple Mount  the holiest site in Judaism Arab Muslim in originThat is how ridiculous the campaign to delegitimize Israel has become Israel Today Carmel ShamaHacohen  Israels ambassador to the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO  said the Palestinians raised the matter informally during a recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin JERUSALEM POST The dead Sea Scrolls are about 900 documents and Biblical texts discovered in one of the greatest archaeological finds of the 20th century in the 1940s and 50s in caves in and around Qumran on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea The texts include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 BCE and preserve evidence of Jewish life during the Second Temple period According to the ambassador and to representatives of the Israel Antiquities Authority who were present at the meeting the Palestinians intend to make a formal claim to the Dead Sea Scrolls when the committee next convenes in 2017 This is another provocative and audacious attempt by the Palestinians to rewrite history and to erase our connection to our land ShamaHacohen told The Jerusalem Post  The Dead Sea Scrolls are factual and weighty archeological evidence of the presence of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel The accusation is part of an ongoing effort to deny the continuous Jewish presence in Israel The Dead Sea Scrolls provide incontrovertible proof of the historical facts that underpin the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state David Koschitzky chairman of the UJA Federation in Toronto As such they pose a threat to the ongoing attempts to obscure the unique relationship of the Jewish people with the land of Israel
