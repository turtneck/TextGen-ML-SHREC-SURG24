  Edmondo Burr in News  US  0 Comments Adam Schwartz a senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF explains how the government spies on people using a powerful phone surveillance tool built by ATT called Hemisphere Every day ATT stores billions of call records and sells the information to Sheriffs and police departments around the country who each pay upward of 1 million a year for the communications metadata In his article ATT Requires Police to Hide Hemisphere Phone Spying Schwartz says law enforcement officials kept Hemisphere  under the radar  for many yearshidden from courts legislators and the general publicuntil the New York Times exposed the program in 2013 Democracy Now interviews Adam Schwartz New details are emerging about how ATT has been spying on Americans for profit with a secret plan called Project Hemisphere The Daily Beast reports ATT is keeping private call records and selling the information to authorities investigating everything from the war on drugs to Medicaid fraud ATT reportedly has been retaining every call text message Skype chat or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure Some of the records date back to 1987 Sheriffs and police departments each pay upward of 1 million a year for access to the call records No warrants are needed and ATT requires governmental agencies to keep secret the source of the information JUAN GONZLEZ  Well all of this comes as new details are emerging about how ATT has been spying on Americans for profit The secret plan is called Project Hemisphere The Daily Beast reports ATT is keeping private call records and selling the information to authorities investigating everything from the war on drugs to Medicaid fraud ATT reportedly has been retaining every call text message Skype chat or other communications that passed through its infrastructure Some of the records date back to 1987 Sheriff and police departments across the country each pay upwards of a million dollars a year for access to the call records No warrants are needed and ATT requires governmental agencies to keep secret the source of information AMY GOODMAN  A 2014 statement of work from ATT to the city of Atlanta published by The Daily Beast outlines the secrecy ATT demanded It reads quote The Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence The Government Agency shall make every effort to insure that information provided by the Contractor is nonattributable to ATT if the data is provided to a thirdparty Well for more we want to bring in Adam Schwartz to this conversation senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation His latest article  ATT requires police to hide Hemisphere phone spying So explain What is this Project Hemisphere ADAM SCHWARTZ  inaudible the largest known possibly the biggest database of telephone metadata that the government is using to spy on us Every day the database grows by literally 4 billion records As you said it has records going back to the 1980s And police are using powerful algorithms to scrutinize this database of everyone that we are having telephone and other digital communications with to discover our personal relationships whether were talking to a psychiatrist or a criminal defense lawyer or a union organizer on the telephone We view this as a menace to our privacy And one of the most disturbing features of it is how it has been kept a secret so that the public and the courts and Congress cannot scrutinize this program and decide whether we even want it JUAN GONZLEZ  Well and how are they able to do this Why are they notwhy are the law enforcement agencies not required to have courtordered subpoenas to obtain these records ADAM SCHWARTZ  Well thats a great question Under federal statutes that protect our privacy ordinarily the police do have to go to a judge and get some kind of approval before they get this metadata of who were talking to What ATT has required the police to do through the provision of the contract that you just read is what the police call parallel construction and what the EFF calls evidence laundering And what this means is after the police find evidence against someone in the Hemisphere database they wall it off quoteunquote from their training manual and then they use a traditional subpoena to recreate the exact same evidence trail And when it comes time to put the person on trial they present the second set of cleaner evidence and no one is the wiser that they were using this massive disturbing digital database to spy on all Americans including the criminal suspect JUAN GONZLEZ  But wouldnt there be a requirement for the company to at least notify their consumers that theyre participating in something like this ADAM SCHWARTZ  Yeah unfortunately there isnt You know ATT in its public comments about Hemisphere has suggested they are merely responding to government requests for information the same way that all kinds of providers of consumer services have to respond In fact as we see through the contract that ATT wrote which came to light earlier this week in The Daily Beast it is ATT who was demanding of government that the program be kept a secret We dont know what ATTs motive is to demand the secrecy Perhaps its because ATT is literally making millions of dollars a year from government agencies in exchange for providing this unique database of telephone records to the police for their scrutiny AMY GOODMAN  So the police might pay up toone police department somewhere might pay like a million dollars to get this information ADAM SCHWARTZ  Yeah just to be clear there is a task force of federal state and local officials called the HIDTAs the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas and it is funded by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy And the HIDTAs have three regional centers across the country where ATT employees are posted along with DEA agents and other law enforcement And that is the entry point for law enforcement to the ATT Hemisphere database And the funding is a little bit shadowy but it is clear that at one of these three HIDTA centers White House funds to the tune of a million dollars a year are going to the HIDTA in turn going to ATT So its not a million dollars from each agency but it is millions of dollars in total JUAN GONZLEZ  And Adam Schwartz am I correct on this that ATT is notdoes not only provide information on their own customers but on other carriers who possibly may be going through the ATT infrastructure as well ADAM SCHWARTZ  Thats exactly correct Any consumer whether they are notwhether or not they are with ATT when a call goes through an ATT switch it goes into the Hemisphere database So for example if youre using roaming away from your own carriers network and youre using ATTs network then your call goes into the Hemisphere databaseagain 4 billion records per day from American consumers and for international calls into the Hemisphere database AMY GOODMAN  And the significance of broadband internet providers having to ask permission if they want to sell customers private data to third parties the ruling that was just adopted Thursday by the FCC ADAM SCHWARTZ  You know I think that the critical principle here is that consumers should have control over their data and corporations should not be diverting that data for their own profit reasons We think that a program like AMY GOODMAN  That they could sell it to other companies youre saying They couldnot only to police agencies but to corporations they could sell youryou know our texts to each other ADAM SCHWARTZ  Right The ruling yesterday from the FCC which the Electronic Frontier Foundation was strongly in support of and lobbied for says that they have to get each individual consumers permission before they divert their private information to anything other than providing the standard broadband service So theres a parallel between that issue and the Hemisphere issue which is that you know consumers have a right to privacy And ATT should not be undermining that privacy in the case of Hemisphere by creating the worlds biggest ifor one of the worlds biggest databases to allow the government to scrutinize our private relationships based on who we are having digital correspondence with JUAN GONZLEZ  And Craig Aaron of Free Press your sense of how this information on the Hemisphere programwhether this is going to become now part of the overall discussions on ATTs increased market power if it has this merger CRAIG AARON  I think it has to be You know this is just yet another example of why we cant trust ATT and its promises And you know I think its very concerning that ATT is literally you know putting employees right alongside sitting law enforcement to willingly mine their data to help them out and then sell it So theyre taking their own customers private information selling it back to the government for a hefty profit while violating their privacy So this is the kind of company ATT is You know EFF has exposed for years and years and years through their legal work everything ATT has been up to supporting the DEA the NSA etc I think this is something to be concerned about when a company gets even bigger and when a company is about to take over a major news network Whos going to hold ATT accountable when these kind of stories are out there Are we going to even hear about them AMY GOODMAN  We want to thank you both for being with us Craig Aaron president and CEO of Free Press and Adam Schwartz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation Of course well continue to follow this The decision is not finally made In fact Craig Aaron just whats the timetable on this CRAIG AARON  I think this merger were probably talking about a year which means this is a decision thats going to be made by the next presidential administration by the Justice Department which gives us time to organize but its very very important that we get started now because this is going to be a fight that will be going well into next year AMY GOODMAN  Well thanks so much to both of you This is Democracy Now When we come back we head to North Dakota to the standoff at Standing Rock Well over a hundred people were once again arrested yesterday as Native Americans and their allies faced off against a heavya heavily militarized police department Stay with us
