House Speaker Paul D Ryan attempted to lift the horizons of his party with a speech last week in which he called for a competition of ideas rather than insults and constructive political debate rather than the politics of demonizationRyans speech was aimed at pulling the Republican Party away from Donald Trumps embrace  though he never actually mentioned Trump by name Events quickly showed what he is up against The speaker was quickly drowned out by a snarling argument between Trump and Sen Ted Cruz of Texas over their wives that almost eclipsed the terrorist attacks in Brussels in the US mediaBy weeks end the Republican race had gone into the gutter over tabloid charges of infidelity which the senator vehemently denied and for which he blamed the New York billionaire who called it unfounded A race that seemed already at the bottom managed to find another lowRyans speech was a relatively highminded moment in the middle of this mud fight of a Republican nominating contest His effort to rescue the party from a coming crisis is laudable but the root causes of the condition go far beyond TrumpThe frontrunner for the nomination of the Republican Party is as much a reflection of the condition as a cause a reality that Ryan RWis touched on only lightly in calling for a more positive and uplifting approach to politics by all sides Which means stopping Trump alone wont necessarily solve all of the partys problemsFour years ago scholars Thomas Mann then with the Brookings Institution and Norman Ornstein then and now with the American Enterprise Institute published a book examining the breakdown in American politics It was titled Its Even Worse Than It LooksThe authors took aim at the gridlocked and dysfunctional politics of Washington and the broader issue of political polarization that has become endemic in recent years They were unsparing but not evenhanded in their critique They were ahead of others in describing the underlying causes of polarization as asymmetrical with the Republican Party  in particular its most hardline faction  as deserving of far more of the blame for the breakdown in governingMann and Ornstein are back again with a second and updated paperback edition called Its Even Worse Than It Was The paperback arrives in the middle of the most raucous presidential campaign in memory one that has exposed even more the fissures fractures and divisions within the Republican Party coalitionWhat played out primarily in the partys congressional wing has come to consume the presidential nominating contest In their own ways Trump and Cruz have brought to the surface the economic and cultural anger among many of those in the partys base as well as the distrust of the party leadership  the same motivating forces behind the Freedom Caucus rebels in the House Republican conferenceThe current campaign only adds fuel to the MannOrnstein thesis of a Republican Party at war with itself in ways that have helped cripple the governing process Trump and Cruz reflect the yearning within the Republican base for antiestablishment outsiders to topple the insiders in WashingtonOhio Gov John Kasich the third remaining candidate for the nomination is a dissenting voice calling for cooperation and compromise At this point he is not just a dissenting voice he is a minority voice in the presidential competition unless he can start winning more primariesTrump and Ryan represent bookends in a political debate that has considerable consequences for the Republican Party and for the country Trumps position as frontrunner not only highlights the degree to which the party is being taken over by antiestablishment forces but also foreshadows the possibility of a significant defeat in November if as the GOP nominee Trump is unable to reverse his standing among women Hispanics African Americans and other voting groupsRyan represents something far different politics grounded in ideas and policies and an attitude of goodwill toward the opposition that he inherited from his mentor Jack Kemp the former House member from Buffalo who prodded his party to be more open and inclusiveYet Ryans speech left unanswered key questions about his capacity to change the behavior of his partys conference in the House and in particular the degree to which he is willing to find a governing coalition apart from the hardliners in the Freedom CaucusAs the countrys highestranking Republican elected official Ryan symbolizes the establishments backlash to Trumps candidacy a backlash that has so far failed to stop the New York businessmans march to the nomination The resistance might yet succeed Whether it does or doesnt it raises the question of whether this presidential campaign ultimately will produce a true course change for the party or merely end up intensifying the forces that have brought it to this momentI put that question to Ornstein in an email exchange Friday This really is I believe an existential crisis for the Republican Party he wrote Will it be a Ryanstyle conservative problemsolving party or will it be either a Trumpstyle authoritarian nativist and protectionist party or a Cruzstyle radical antigovernment party content with blowing things up as they now stand Or just as possible will the party break apart with no clue as to what will replace it or how the pieces will fit into the broader political systemThe prospects for a crackup are real given what Trumps candidacy has revealed about the partys fractured coalition Trumps views on issues outlined on the campaign trail and in a recent interview with The Washington Post editorial board represent a fundamental break with many of the conservative ideas that have been at the partys core for yearsTrumps constituency finds his support for protecting rather than transforming Social Security and Medicare appealing His words of praise for the work of Planned Parenthood apart from performing abortions are anathema to many religious conservatives His views on trade run counter to the freetrade philosophy of the GOP elites His comments about reevaluating the US role in NATO shocked many in the Republican foreignpolicy establishmentThats the threat Ryan and others in the party see as they watch the nominating contest move into the next rounds of primaries But it isnt clear that what the speaker advocated in his speech would be enough to put the Republican Party in a better place even absent Trump House Republicans are still an unruly group and with some exceptions the GOP still prefers to try to do business with itselfThe Republican Party remains a party of protest It continues to struggle to demonstrate that on the national level it can be a true governing party
