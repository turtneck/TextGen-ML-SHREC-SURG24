Gay man finds it in himself to tolerate religious person 011116 A GAY man has met a Christian who appears civilised and could even be described as nice Tom Booker met churchgoer Wayne Hayes when he started working in his office and has expressed his surprise that he really couldnt tell Booker said We often end up in the kitchen at the same time to make a cup of tea so we started exchanging pleasantries and worked up to longer conversations He was always nice enough and talked about his family and allotment and stuff so I presumed he was just a normal person However a few weeks later he mentioned something about believing in God I was really shocked but he seemed very cool about it I asked if he thought it was just a phase and he said no hed been feeling this way since he was about nine I wanted to ask him what Christians actually do in church but I got worried that he might think Im secretly into it and try to recruit me He hasnt mentioned it since Its almost as if its a perfectly acceptable way to live your life which has really given me pause for thought Just because you expect someone to be a massively judgemental dickhead it doesnt mean they will be Share
