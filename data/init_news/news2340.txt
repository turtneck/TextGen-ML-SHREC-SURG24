Small Stocks Threaten Breakdown  Can They Hang On by IWB  October 27 2016 by Dana Lyons The Russell 2000 SmallCap Index has violated for now the 2 key uptrend lines that we recently identified A main theme recently among both our posts and our quantitative risk analysis has been the battle between weakening market internals and resilient price averages Despite deteriorating breadth and momentum most of the major averages had been able to hold above the key levels that weve identified For example just 9 days ago  we highlighted 2 Up trendlines on the chart of the Russell 2000 SmallCap Index RUT These lines eg the post2009 and postFebruary Up trendlnes we suggested were the key in determining whether the RUT would maintain its upward trajectory above the lines or see an expansion in potential downside Recently the RUT had been able barely to hold the top side of of the trendlines and maintain its path of least resistance to the upside That path may have shifted today As these updated charts show the RUT closed below the 2 key trendlines today  albeit by a fairly slim margin Wide Angle CloseUp While the winds may have potentially shifted following todays action the overall message here is the same as it was 9 days ago Thus we will repeat what we stated in that post If the RUT should Continue to hold above the trendlines the bulls will remain in control and the intermediateterm rally in smallcap stocks can persist further Should the level give way however the bears may have their chance to finally deliver a more serious blow Absent a quick recovery of the broken trendlines the bears would appear to have their chance now especially given the elevated status of our broad market risk assessment The question is will they finally follow through or will the small stocks manage to narrowly hang on once again
