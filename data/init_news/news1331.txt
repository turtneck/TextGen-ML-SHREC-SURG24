Donald Trumps rise is spurring a backlash from Latino communities across America that has the potential to prove a formidable barrier to the billionaires success in the November presidential electionFrom Florida to Nevada Arizona to Iowa and countless other states beyond there is evidence that the sleeping giant of the Latino vote is stirring Trumps favorability ratings with Hispanic voters are running at historic lows while he faces an increasingly wellorganized nationwide campaign to oppose himA Guardian exploration of three key swing states and survey of national Hispanic outreach groups has found that the presumptive Republican nominee faces an uphill struggle to repair the damage caused by his threats to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and build a wall with MexicoA poll of Hispanic Americans carried out by Latino Decisions and Americas Voice in April found some 87 of Latinos felt unfavorably towards him Significantly almost half said they felt more enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election than they did four years ago and 41 of those said it was because they wanted to stop TrumpIn Florida groups report that new Hispanic voter registrations are running at 1000 a week Some 26 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida for this years general election and about 800000 of them have not yet registeredThat unprecedented number corresponds  not coincidentally Latino organizers believe  with polls that show almost nine in 10 Latino Floridians view Trump unfavorablyIn Iowa the Latino community has been virtually silent until this year In 2012 only 1000 Latinos participated in the Iowa presidential caucuses this year the number soared to 13000  about 25 of all registered Hispanic votersClearly they were worried about the rhetoric specifically of Trump We could not have mobilized the community anything like as effectively without him said Joe Henry of the League of United Latin American CitizensIn Nevada a state where almost one in five of the 19 million eligible voters are Latino an aggressive push to mobilize the community has started to bear fruit among some 362000 Latinos who are still unregistered for the November ballotEven in Arizona which has voted Democratic only once in a presidential race in the past 60 years Hispanic activists hope to bring the state into play by registering up to 75000 firsttime voters They have already expanded by 125000 since 2010 to a total of 536003 registered Hispanic voters 144 of the overall voter poolThere is something new going on something unique in the immigrant community said Luis Gutirrez a US Congress representative for parts of Chicago And it has something to do with the tenor and tone of the presidential raceTo what extent Hispanic Americans will be motivated to vote by Trumps antiimmigrant remarks is one of the great unknowns of 2016 The Latino population continues to grow at a faster pace than any other demographic from 195 million eligible Latino voters in 2008 to 233 million in 2012 with 273 million projected by November That would amount to some 12 of the nations electorate in 2016Yet the proportion who actually cast their ballot has remained stubbornly low In 2012 it was only 48 much lower than the figures for African Americans 66 and whites 64The Latino vote cannot be taken for granted even with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee said Sylvia Manzano a principal of the political consulting firm Latino Decisions Telling Latino voters that Trump is hostile to you is one thing  getting them to the polling stations anotherAgainst that backdrop of such unflexed political muscle there are signs that 2016 may see a larger turnout Mi Familia Vota a notforprofit group devoted to encouraging Hispanic participation has reported a surge in interest in voter registration In the first four months of this year it helped 18450 Latinos to get on the voter rolls in six states  Arizona California Colorado Florida Nevada and TexasThree of those states Florida Colorado and Nevada are likely to be among the handful of battlegrounds where the outcome of the fight for the White House will be decided Small but increasingly wellorganized Latino populations in North Carolina and Virginia could also prove significantOutreach groups have been busily encouraging the 88 million Hispanic immigrants who are legal US residents to take up citizenship as the first step towards voting Nationally average requests for citizenship reached 65000 every month in the five months up to January with half the applicants being Latino Thats a modest 15 increase on the same period in the previous yearNonpartisan groups working to increase Hispanic political participation hope to boost that number as the presidential election looms largely on the back of Trumps attacks In a normal year some 650000 green card holders are granted citizenship this year the groups goal is one million although with the election now six months away it is not certain how many of those the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS would be able to process in time for them to secure a vote by NovemberRoco Senz of the Service Employees International Union which is part of a coalition that has helped 12781 Latinos apply for citizenship in more than 300 naturalization workshops around the country detects a new intensity There is a sense of urgency as a result of the hateful rhetoric about mass deportations building walls calling us criminals  this is personal for usGuardian reporters in three key states sought to answer the increasingly critical question is 2016 the year the sleeping giant of the Hispanic vote wakes upIts impossible to overstate the importance of Florida it has officially at least sided with the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1996 All of the contests have been close with Obama taking the state in both his presidential runs by fewer than three percentage pointsThat paperthin margin is vastly overshadowed by the potential of the Floridian Hispanic population  24 of the total today up from 17 in 2000 At the same time the political affiliation of Latinos in the state has been drifting steadily towards the Democratic party largely as a result of the influx of leftleaning Puerto Ricans to central FloridaWhen you add in the Trump effect the billionaires prospects appear particularly bleak in Florida where recent polls indicate that close to 90 of Hispanic voters view him unfavorablyLatinos are registering to vote in unprecedented numbers to oppose him advocacy groups sayTheres a lot of Latinos who are very angry with Trump said Vivian Rodriguez president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida Thats created a wave of Latinos who want to get citizenship and get things going to vote in this election cycleThe most recent figures from Floridas division of elections showed that 18 million Hispanics registered to vote in Februarys primaries almost 150000 more than the number who voted in the 2012 general election when Obama carried the state with more than 60 of the Hispanic voteWith the number of Hispanics who registered for the Florida primary already so high the figures suggest there may be an extraordinarily large turnout of Latinos for the general election in November In 2012 the increase in registered Hispanic voters after the primary was 110000 This year the indications are it will be much greaterA record 26 million Hispanics are eligible to vote in Florida an increase of half a million since 2012 boosted significantly by the mass influx of Puerto Rican US citizens particularly around Kissimmee and Orlando seeking to escape the worsening economic conditions in their homelandThat leaves about 800000 eligible Hispanic voters who have not yet registered and if the feedback being received by the many outreach groups in the state is accurate  the National Council of La Raza alone told the Guardian it was signing up new Hispanic voters at a rate of about 1000 a week  not many of them are going to be supporting Donald TrumpLatinos are going to be voting in unprecedented numbers against the villains the politicians who dehumanize immigrant families to score political points said Maria Rodriguez executive director of FLIC Votes Florida Immigrant Action CommitteeWeve already been seeing the trend of a new generation of younger Cuban Americans registering as Democrats Theres going to be an exodus from the Republican party lots of Latino Republicans are going to switch to no party affiliation or the DemocratsOne of those is LuisCarlos Fumero a Miamiborn Cuban who fits kitchens for his uncles condo renovation company and who fervently supported Mitt Romneys unsuccessful 2012 campaign This time he says he will not voteI cannot support this man said Fumero 25 of Trump This nonsense over the wall not letting Muslims into America what he says about Mexicans and about women this man is locoThe loss of support from Miamis Cuban Americans could be a body blow to Trumps hopes of carrying Florida in the general election Historically a bulwark of Republican support the influence of Floridas Cuban voting bloc has already waned from 46 of the states eligible Hispanic voters in 1990 to barely 30 today according to Pew researchNow there are clear signs that even that bloc might desert the Republican candidate under the weight of Obamas opening up of trade and travel with Cuba and with the rise of a younger generation of Cuban Americans who are less ideologically drivenIn Februarys primary the heavily Hispanic MiamiDade was the only county in Florida that Trump lost and although he led Hillary Clinton 4129 among Miamis Cuban Americans in a Bendixen and Amandi poll this month his support level is still far below the 64 Romney received from Cuban Americans statewide in 2012Perhaps more worryingly for Trump Miamis influential Republican Cuban American political leaders continue to speak out against him House representatives Ileana RosLehtinen and Carlos Curbelo have said they cannot vote for him and Toms Regalado the mayor of Miami and himself a Cuban exile launched a searing attack on the presumptive nominee in the Miami HeraldHe mistreats people speaks derisively of people Regalado said A presidents biggest asset is the bully pulpit This guy is capable of creating national and international chaosKarina Ruiz de Diaz president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition takes the long view The Latino vote is still very young she told the Guardian We will reshape the state its just going to take a little bit of timeArizonas electorate is in the midst of rapid change One in five eligible voters in the state are Hispanic according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center It estimates that 13 million Arizona Latinos will be eligible to vote in 2016 up from 796000 in 2008Young Latinos make up a large share of the Hispanic electorate Nearly twice as many Hispanic voters in Arizona are millennials compared with their white counterparts according to 2014 Pew dataArizona has historically been a conservative state But the changing demographics and the prospective general election race between Trump and Clinton has activists and experts predicting that this will be the year Arizona Latinos realize their political force and sweep Democrats in to powerIts exciting for us in Arizona because we keep getting talked about as a purple state as possibly a swing state said Kate Gallego the vicemayor of PhoenixThat would be astonishing Since the second world war Arizona has only once voted for the Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton in 1996 So could it happenCertainly John McCain thinks so Gallego said referring to comments recorded at a private fundraiser in which the longserving Arizona senator said Trump could threaten his chances of being reelected If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket here in Arizona with over 30 of the vote being the Hispanic vote no doubt that this may be the race of my life McCain is reported to have saidYet even if record turnout were to turn the solidly red state blue Arizonas 11 electoral votes would probably be superfluous as the outcome is unlikely to shift the dynamics of the raceIf Trump is to be the motivation that finally unleashes the electoral power of Arizonas Latinos the achievement will not be his alone He will also have to credit the assistance of two of his most ardent supporters Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County the selfstyled toughest sheriff in America and Jan Brewer the former Arizona governor who signed into law one of the harshest state immigration measures in the countryIn 2010 Arizona enacted Senate Bill 1070 a draconian law aimed at driving out the states undocumented immigrants that pushed the state to the forefront of an acrimonious debate over border security and comprehensive immigration reformYet instead of disappearing the law drew many of the states undocumented immigrants out of the shadows Latinos joined forces with business leaders concerned about the economic impact of the law Together tens of thousands marched through the streets of downtown Phoenix in oppositionWe have seen many Trumps in Arizona said Ian Danley a director with One Arizona speaking after a meeting on voter suppression in Phoenix We were birthed out of SB 1070 which is a Trumplike policy We werent prepared in 2010 Were prepared nowOne Arizona a nonpartisan network of Hispanic and immigrant groups working to increase Latino voter turnout in the state has registered between 110000 and 125000 new voters since 2010 and helped triple the number of Latinos enrolled in the states early voting system Now the network has set itself the ambitious target of registering between 60000 and 75000 new voters by NovemberBecause volunteers are restricted from telling registrants who to vote for and the group doesnt track registrants party affiliation its hard to assess the Trump effect Anecdotally several volunteers said it was not uncommon for registrants to ask which party Trump belonged to and then tick the opposite boxPeople are paying a lot of attention said Raquel Tern the state director for Mi Vota Familia sipping vegan horchata at a coffee shop in downtown PhoenixWhen Donald Trump came to Arizona in March he held his rally in Fountain Hills a predominantly white town in Maricopa County He was joined by Brewer the former governor and introduced by Arpaio the controversial sheriff who has cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in an ongoing racial profiling case that found his officers had targeted Latinos during raids and traffic stopsWe had a little problem Some demonstrators were trying to disrupt Arpaio told the crowd which began to boo and hiss If they think theyre going to intimidate you and the next president of the United States its not going to happen  not in this townI call that the hate and fear playbook said Petra Falcon a longtime Arizona activist and director of the rights group Promise Arizona If you want to divide a country or a state just take out that playbook and start talking about the harm immigrants do  they come here to take your jobs They rob He took that playbook from Arizona and is using it nationallyThe biggest challenge for Arizonas Democrats remains voter turnout There are approximately 170000 more registered Republicans than Democrats in the state according to the latest data from the secretary of states officeIn the primaries on 22 March 55 of Republicans cast ballots compared with 49 of Democrats However registered independents who make up the largest share of Arizona voters but are not represented by a party could not vote in either primaryAt an outlet mall in Tempe Jos Barboza and Francis Sullivan of Promise Arizona took turns approaching shoppers and sales associates with their clipboardsJaritma Avilez told Barboza she was registered to vote and he moved on But later Avilez admitted to the Guardian that even though she was registered she didnt plan on voting in November I dont feel like politics really affects my life she shruggedIn November the Latino community is going to come out in large numbers Jocelyn Sida a Nevada organizer for Mi Familia Vota which works to increase Hispanic turnout told the Guardian A lot of millennials like myself are getting involved in leadership roles to educate and engage the community and its been very accepting Theyre not withdrawing theyre not closing their doors to us On the contrary theyre seeking us out to find ways to get involvedWith 17 of Nevadas electorate being Hispanic the Latino vote certainly has the potential to deny Trump victory through strong turnout In 2012 70 of Nevada Latinos voted for Obama helping him to win the state by a comfortable sixpoint marginAll the time Trumps yelling about kicking people out the country Its horrible said Rodulfo Martinez 60 a Las Vegas construction worker expressing an anger felt by many The way he insults us isnt right Many of the things he says about the border wall and why Latinos come here dont make senseA poll last month by Latino Decisions showed that immigration reform was the most pressing issue for Nevada Hispanics The state has the countrys largest percentage of undocumented immigrants many of whom count registered voters as friends and familyEst loco said Vicky Legaspi 36 echoing Fumero in Miami A restaurant owner on Las Vegass workingclass east side Legaspi nearly choked on a spoon of ice cream when asked if she would vote for the celebrity businessman He just wants attention He doesnt care about this countryAna Hernandez 34 a housekeeper said Trump was mean and has a bad heart and that she intended to vote for Clinton because first of all shes not a racist setting a somewhat low barLatino participation in Nevadas 2016 Democratic caucus showed a 5 uptick over the 2008 contest another encouraging sign for Clinton who won the vote in both cycles The primary season also saw Democrats build a 5 lead in voter registration in Nevada while an ongoing naturalization blitz organized by progressive groups has brought thousands of new minority voters into the frayAt the start of this election season Nevada had 362000 potential new Latino voters including 42000 Hispanic youth who will come of voting age this cycle and 40000 legal permanent residents eligible for citizenship according to Mi Familia VotaIts amazing to hear from people who never had a reason to vote or speaking of the citizenship workshops people who have never had a reason to become citizens until now said Laura Martin associate director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Plan which promotes civic engagement We focus on lowincome communities of color so we meet lots of people at the bus station the welfare office or outside the dollar store They used to not care but now they see Donald Trump and thats scary to themAdditional reporting by Mona Chalabi in New York
