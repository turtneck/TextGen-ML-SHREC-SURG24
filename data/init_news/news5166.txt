WASHINGTON  Facing an increasingly narrow path to the nomination and failing to thwart Donald Trumps dominance Sen Ted Cruz RTexas withdrew from the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday Tonight Im sorry to say that path has been foreclosed Cruz said in a speech Tuesday night in Indianapolis but the voters chose another path We are suspending our campaign he added As Trump barreled toward the 1237 delegates required to winCruzs campaign in recent weeks resorted to increasingly desperate measures mounting a lastditch effort to win the Indiana primary one of the only remaining primary states that gave Cruz a chance of winning But Indiana turned out to be the final nail in the coffin  Trump won handily in the Hoosier State including among social conservatives a demographic that in theory favored Cruz To reinvigorate his campaign Cruz last week named former presidential candidate and HewlettPackard CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate even though candidates typically do not name their running mate until they have amassed enough delegates for the nominationHis campaign also announced a plan to coordinate with the campaign of Ohio Gov John Kasich the other remaining candidateKasichs team agreed to pull resources out of Indiana and cede the race there to Cruz However this effort quickly backfired when each candidate caused confusion by diminishing its importance Kasich said voters in Indiana should still vote for him Like many of the GOP candidates and party leaders Cruz underestimated the strength of Trumps appeal Initially he often defendedTrump instead of attacking him strategizing that he could pick up Trumps supporters if the businessman exited the race But when it became apparent that Trumps populist and nationalist rhetoric was resonating with Republican voters with the reality television star dominating the majority of the primaries Cruz began to target Trump on the debate stage and on the campaign trail  to little avail Once positioned as a strong threat to become the Republican presidential nominee the Texas senator was the first candidate in either party to officially declare his intent to run for the presidency in 2016 Bypassing the typical first step in a presidential campaign  the exploratory committee  he kicked off his campaign in March of 2015 with a rousing speech at Liberty University the Christian university founded by the Rev Jerry Falwell What is the promise of America The idea that  the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon which is that our rights dont come from man They come from God Almighty he said in his announcement speechA star of the tea party movement Cruz made social conservatism and religious liberty a fundamental part of his pitch to voters He highlighted his staunch opposition to gay marriage on the basis of religious freedom particularly after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide In response Cruz said he would introduce a constitutional amendment to hold elections for Supreme Court justices Over the summer he held a religious freedom rally in the key state of Iowa during which he proclaimed that there is a war on faith in America today in our lifetime and bemoaned the persecution of Christians But despite touting his conservative credentials and fashioning himself as an antiestablishment candidate Cruz never quite managed to rally conservatives around him The Texas senator was hugely unpopular among his colleagues with most GOP lawmakers reluctant to endorse him until it became clear he was the only viable option to potentially halt Trumps momentum Only then did Republicans begin backing him though many gavetepid reasonsfor doing so and perceived him merely as the lesser of two evils when compared to Trump Sen Lindsey Graham RSC announced his support of Cruz just weeks after joking that he wanted to murder him Former House Speaker John Boehner ROhio told students at Stanford University that Cruz was Lucifer in the flesh and a miserable son of a bitch Cruzs campaign never had the enthusiasm and fervor of Trumps insurgencyFor example when Cruz introduced himself at the second GOP debate in September the audience responded with silenceAnd while Cruz portrayed himself as an outsider most voters viewed him as an establishment candidate compared to the brash takenoprisoners Trump As the reality of Cruzs downfall and Trumps presumptive nomination begins to sink in the Republican party faces a serious dilemma whether to support Trump as the partys nominee and potentially hand Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton the presidency or risk further damage to the party with Trump at the helm Soon after Cruzs announcement Tuesday Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus urged his party to unite around Trump
