Over the last few weeks the news for Scott Walkers presidential campaign has been getting grimmer and grimmerThe last of those points above is particularly ominous Word of money problems often serves as the canary in the coal mine  signifying an imminent campaign collapse And they can start a downward spiral leading supporters to jump ship and fundraising to dry up because the candidate looks more and more like a loserFor instance it got out in early August that Rick Perrys campaign was no longer paying staffers due to poor fundraising Perry managed to hang in the race for one more month but everyone could see he was a dead man walking He finally quit after failing to qualify for this weeks debateIf Walker already isnt paying his consultants fundraising has likely fallen well short of expectations and the campaign has committed to much more spending than it can afford Johnson and Gold report that there are 90 fulltime staffers If so it would be possible for Walker to radically downsize his operation and stay in the race  John McCain did just that in 2007 and won the nominationBut it would be a tough road ahead The next debate is a long way away and theres no indication that Donald Trump is going to stop monopolizing media attention anytime soon Meanwhile the host of that debate CNBC hasnt announced how it will determine who qualifies  but if it uses national polls like Fox News and CNN did Walker could be in serious danger of failing to make the cutAs far back as 2014 and especially earlier this year Scott Walker has seemed on paper to be a fantastic Republican candidate He was elected three times in a blue state and while governor of Wisconsin he fought hard for conservative priorities in a way that impressed both the GOPs base and its elitesBut presidential campaigns arent fought on paper and in person Scott Walker simply isnt compelling or attentiongrabbing I argued nearly a year ago that Walkers lack of charisma would be his biggest problem in a world where primary candidates rise and fall in the polls based partly on their performance in televised debatesIndeed Walker led the polls in Iowa up until just before the first presidential debate August 6 Afterward he plummeted as you can see in this RealClearPolitics chartWalkers lack of charisma isnt his only problem Hes also proven unexpectedly feckless on the issues changing his position on topics like immigration in various insincereseeming ways But it was when Republicans got a look at all the candidates onstage  seeing Walker live rather than on paper  that his position in Iowa collapsed He hasnt stopped falling sinceStill Id be surprised if Walker dropped out any time soon Hes built his political brand on his willingness to fight and he seems to bea true believer Indeed hes now vowing that hell stay in the race andfocus entirely on winning the Iowa caucuses All the recent caucus winners  Rick Santorum Mike Huckabee Barack Obama and John Kerry  surged in the polls quite late Hes invested so much of his reputation in the race already  so he might as well stick it out a few more months
