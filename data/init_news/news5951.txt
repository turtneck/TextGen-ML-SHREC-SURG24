When the Commission on Presidential Debates on Monday finalized its rules for determining which candidates get invited to this falls headline debates it suddenly made Libertarian darkhorse candidate Gary Johnsons job a whole lot harderJohnson a former Republican who has been picking up voters disaffected by Donald Trump has had his eye on winning a debate slot all summer Though he has conceded that extraordinary things have to happen for him to win its the debates that matter for him If he can get onstage his strategists think he has a chance to upset a race that has left a huge number of Americans unhappy with their choicesHe already knew the threshold for a debate invitation a 15 percent showing in polls a hurdle no thirdparty candidate has overcome since the commission set the bar in the 2000 campaign Johnson harbors hope of being the first But the combination of the polls the commission just announced it will use to make the cut  and the decision of most of the sponsoring media outlets to include both Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein in those polls  effectively made the bar tougher for him to clear With Stein siphoning off some of the antiestablishment vote hes counting on Johnson is probably going to end up watching the debates at homeThe selection rules the commission just announced seem reasonable in one sense and not obviously designed to undercut a thirdparty run It will use polls released by the five major television news networks ABCWashington Post NBCWall Street Journal CBSNew York Times CNN and Fox News These are the same five polls that were used in 2012 except last time Gallup was used instead of CNN Gallup you may recall predicted a Mitt Romney victory in 2012 then published what was dubbed a mea culpa exploring why its likely voter model was so wrong This election cycle Gallup hasnt done any trial heats taking itself off the tableThird parties should be further pleased that all of those organizations have been including thirdparty candidates in their polling A perennial complaint has been that thirdparty candidates cant get to 15 percent in polls if they arent even mentioned in the polls as the campaign develops But ABCWashington Post NBCWall Street Journal and CNN have been running fourway trial heats while CBSNew York Times and Fox News have done threeway polls that include Johnsons name And upon the commissions announcement Fox News said it would include Stein in subsequent polls That means at least four of the five will include all four candidatesThats what hurts Johnson however As the former New Mexico governor picks up Republicans alienated by Trump  and even picks up some progressives excited about his antiwar promarijuana and civil liberties stances  his numbers have been climbing into the range where the debate feels like a possibility When Stein is left out of the polls Johnson isnt far short of the 15 percent bar  he hit 12 percent in the last Fox News and CBSNew York Times polls A late July CBS poll sans New York Times sponsorship but using the same pollster has Johnson at 10 But in the most recent polls from the three media outlets tapped by the commission which have been running fourway trial heats Johnson comes in at 8 9 or 10 while Stein averages 5 Johnson performs just a bit worse with Stein in the mix but in the race for 15 every inch counts And Stein who would need to triple her support to secure an invite is taking an inch or two from JohnsonThe bottom line By including all four candidates the commissions sanctioned polling outfits are reducing the odds that a third candidate will make the cutThis leaves Johnson with a tough strategic choice to make Does he continue to hold himself up as an amiable alternative to the status quo Or does he turn aggressive and start boring into the candidates who are standing in his way Donald Trump and Jill SteinWhile both Johnson and Stein rail against the TrumpClinton duopoly in reality Johnsons most immediate opponent is Stein and vice versa Theyre each scrambling to claim as much of the small antiestablishment vote as possible The most recent CNN poll found they both draw from independents with Johnson winning 16 percent of selfidentified independent voters and Stein 8 percent They roughly split the pot of Bernie Sanders voters as Stein takes 13 percent and Johnson 10 They also both get a little from disaffected partisans Johnson wins 7 percent of Republicans to Steins 3 and Johnson edges Stein with Democrats 3 percent to 2Yet Libertarians have no ground to demand that Stein be left out of the polls since the Greens may well get on the ballot in 44 states breaking the partys record and far exceeding the commissions ballot access requirement Johnson has little recourse but to boost his standing and fastHe doesnt have much time to make up ground The commission says it will issue invites after Labor Day 2016 but sufficiently in advance of the firstscheduled debate on Sept 26 to allow for orderly planning So he has about a month give or takeTo date Johnson has largely sold himself as a tonic to the status quo His ads and videos tread lightly on ideology and even lighter on policy prescriptions For example in his latest Johnson says to millennials We may never agree on all the small things but lets agree on the big thing both parties have blown it  Working together well find fair sensible and honest solutionsNonideological platitudes may be enough to win some of the throw the bums out vote But Johnson needs more He needs to consolidate the leftwing antiHillary vote and the economically libertarian antiTrump vote And those two goals are in conflictHe could directly engage Greenleaners employ the issues where he shares common ground with the left and say bluntly The truth is Jill Stein is not going to get into the debates whereas I might but only with your help If you stand with me I will ensure that there is a voice on the main stage calling for an end to the drug war the abolishment of the NSA and a halt to drone strikesHe could also use the issues where he distinguishes himself on the right and tell conservatives squeamish about Trump but allergic to Clinton The truth is Trump is not a conservative and hes not going to win He opposes free trade rejects entitlement reform and supports budgetbusting stimulus Give me a shot to beat her If you stand with me I will be the only one on the main stage defending the TransPacific Partnership making the case for raising the retirement age and pledging to balance the budget without tax increasesJohnson hasnt been this pointed on the issues in his advertising precisely because the issues mentioned above are just a few of the small things on which people vehemently disagree And he never mentions Stein hoping to silently dismiss her In one video Johnson says All this talk about thirdparty Im it But that is simply untrue Hes not the only thirdparty candidate in the race and Johnson needs to deal with itIts certainly possible even likely that this is a box Johnson cant get out of Its hard to win sufficient support with a thin gruel of nonideological talking points and its also hard with a gumbo of disparate policy specificsThird parties loathe the commissions 15 percent threshold which was established in 2000 The commission is a private entity unaccountable to the public and its chosen number is literally arbitrary Yet it does serve a public purpose There are only so many debates that more than half of the electorate will sit through Its legitimate to ask that a candidate prove that he or she truly represents a significant faction of voters before getting such rarified face time and pulling attention away from the oneonone contest that is almost certain to decide the presidencyThis time around Johnson and Stein have been given every opportunity to prove themselves They have been listed in the polls They have been given exposure on mainstream media networks  Johnson has done two CNN primetime town halls and Stein gets her first on Wednesday Both are even outspending one of the majorparty candidates in television ads for the first time since Trump has bizarrely refused to spend a dime But the downside of being included in those polls and getting those town halls is that there are no more excuses If you dont get to 15 percent its your own fault
