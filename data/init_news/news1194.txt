Miami CNN The oppression felt by many under the Castro regime still looms large at the epicenter of Cuban America Miamis Little Havana neighborhoodCubanborn Americans at the popular Domino Park chat casually in Spanish as the domino tiles click but most of them refuse to discuss President Barack Obamas new policy of normalizing relations with the communist countryThis past weekend Obama shared a historic handshake with Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas and on Tuesday Obama told Congress he intended to take Cuba off the state sponsors of terrorism list moves that would have been unthinkable just years agoThe Cuban immigrants in Miami though are concerned that if they talk about Obamas actions their words could travel back to Havana and cause trouble for their familiesIts a fear said Helena Jimenez thats very real You talk the wrong way youre put in jail your family is hurtAnd yet Jimenez who immigrated to the United States from Cuba when she was 8 years old nearly 55 years ago supports Obamas new policySpeaking outside Caf Versailles the famous Cuban eatery where exiles young and old gather for caf con leche Jimenez called the US embargo against Cuba a cane of support that Cuban President Raul Castro has been leaning on as an excuse for poor conditions in his country  and now that the cane is gone shes hopeful he could tumble and fallJimenez is emblematic of a broader shift within in the Cuban population in America one that ultimately opened up the political space for Obama to start to change the US stance toward the island nationBut the same shift in attitudes that helped pave the way for Obamas course change has also diluted some of the potency of what was once a clear political winner for Republicans Fernand Amandi a principal at Bendixen  Amandi International which specializes in polling Cuban Americans said what was once a reliable GOP base vote has now become more of a swing voteGoing into 2016 the Cuban American vote in Florida will arguably be even more important than ever before because now youre going to see both sides Republicans and Democrats go after them in ways we havent seen before he saidIts a transformation that makes Florida GOP Sen Marco Rubios intense opposition to the Cuba opening a potential obstacle in his presidential pitch to voters who share his background rather than the surefire crowdpleaser it has long beenThe senator leaned heavily on the story of his immigrant parents exile from Cuba in his presidential announcement on Monday and he chose Miamis Freedom Tower which served as a landing hub for many Cuban exiles through the latter half of the 20th century for the launch itselfThough the 43yearold cast himself as a leader of the future his focus on reasserting tough sanctions and freezing relations with Cuba is seen by many especially younger Cuban Americans as a policy of the pastAnd that was the gist of the attack launched by the Democratic National Committee when Rubio on Tuesday condemned Obamas call for Cuba to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism listFor a guy who just yesterday said he wanted to be a new leader and usher in a new American century it sure sounds like Marco Rubio is clinging to an outdated foreign policy relic from the Cold War said DNC spokesman Mo ElleitheeDistance and time have transformed the Cuban American population and in turn its politicsOrlando Feliciano a 20yearold sophomore at Miami University is one of those young Cubans who say its time for change He described his family as split along generational lines with his mother in favor of the move and his grandparents opposed because they feel like thats a strategy that the Cuban government is using to generate more moneyBut Felicianos own view is that thawing relations is the right decisionI mean Cuba has been stuck with this government for over 50 years now and I feel like its time for something to change he said Monday on his way to class on the sunny campus The people deserve itCarl Meacham director of the Americas Program at the Washingtonbased Center for Strategic and International Studies said it was difficult to pin down the Cuban American population as a voting bloc because of the diverse opinions within itThey are much more split today on the way forward than they have ever been he said You have more Cuban Americans supporting a change to how the United States is supporting Cuba than you have in the pastBut its still a potent political issue for older Cuban Americans which helps explain Rubios  and the rest of the GOP fields  Cuba focus as older voters remain a key portion of the GOP baseAnd Meacham noted that the stance on Cuba plays into the broader GOP campaign against executive overreach from the President with Republicans portraying it as yet another example of Obama acting without congressional approvalPart of the policy shift stems from Obama being a secondterm president unconcerned with the politics of the issue  and perhaps wanting to test his own theories of international engagementThats what Jaime Suchlicki director of the Institute for Cuban and CubanAmerican Studies at the University of Miami and an opponent of the thaw said was behind Obamas moveHe comes with a philosophy based on the idea that you make nice with your enemies and they become your friends Suchlicki said The President is doing this based on his own mindset not on the reality of what is happeningHe warned The administration takes a significant risk that by taking this unilateral action they get nothing from CubaPotential political backlash from the estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States  a huge portion of whom live in the key swing state of Florida with a sizable enclave in heavily Democratic New Jersey  has helped keep previous Democratic presidents from moving on promises to normalize relationsThat was the case in the early 1990s when President Bill Clinton ended up signing the HelmsBurton Act which further entrenched the embargo and restricted the presidents ability to roll it back rather than moving toward normalizationIt was good electionyear politics in Florida he admitted in his memoir before acknowledging that it undermined whatever chance I might have if I won a second term to lift the embargo in return for positive changes in CubaMeacham who supports the policy shift said the fact that Obama was freed from some of those concerns likely influenced the moveThe President isnt going to have to run for office again and wasnt being overly careful with maintaining support in places like Florida where the Cuban vote is pivotal he saidBut not only do Democrats have less reason to fear a backlash on the Cuba shift they have more Cuban voters to count on their side of the aisleCuban Americans historically have been seen as a monolithic Republican voting bloc but polling shows they have started to switch allegiances as the population has grown younger and more distant from CubaThose shifts Meacham argued have made the Cuba issue one in which the train has sort of left the stationAnd they also mean that Rubio could have even less to gain by making the Cuba embargo a major issueRepublicans run the risk of losing a big chunk of support within the Cuban community by campaigning so aggressively against the diplomatic thaw Amandi warned Its not the type of issue where they can count on appealing to all Cuban Americans anymoreIt is however the issue that entices 73yearold Miguel Coppola who came to the United States from Cuba on New Years Eve 1951 to Rubio After finishing a cafecito at the Versailles Coppola said that of course the Florida senator will have the support of the Cuban American communityHes got the same values we have he said listing freedom in Cuba freedom of speech electing people in Cuba against dictatorships as examples of those valuesBut for others particularly the younger immigrants it makes less of a differenceJimenez who left Cuba in the late 1960s said the Cuba issue isnt much of a dealbreaker She said shes most interested in former Florida Gov Jeb Bush because what we need in this country is a good personAnd anyway she said Itll be hard to go back to the way we were with an embargo against CubaIt hasnt worked for more than 50 years so why go back to that you know she said
