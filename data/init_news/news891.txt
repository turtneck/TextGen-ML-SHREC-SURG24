The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the foiled terrorist attack at a Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas Sunday But that doesnt mean the group had much to do with the attackThe attempted terror attack by two MuslimAmericans in Garland Texas Sunday so far appears to confirm what terrorism experts have been saying for months The Islamic State has no ability to carry out attacks in the United StatesBut the incident shows that the Islamic States ability to inspire and to a limited degree direct lone wolf jihadis remains a challenge with no simple answersNo evidence yet shared with the public suggests that the two men killed by a security officer when they opened fire on a building hosting a Draw Muhammad contest were hardened Islamic State operatives They pledged fealty to the Islamic State in a tweet minutes before the attackBut one of them Elton Simpson had been on the Federal Bureau of Investigations radar screen since 2006 and he faced charges in 2011 over claims that he wanted to join jihad in SomaliaThe degree to which he and his Phoenixarea roommate Nadir Soofi reached out to the Islamic State  or the Islamic State also known as ISIS reached out to them  is unclear The FBI is combing through the mens social media histories for cluesBut it is becoming increasingly clear that the Islamic States greatest threat to the US is in its online messaging which Jessica Stern coauthor of the new book ISIS The State of Terror calls a social contagion What is known about Sundays attack underscores that its less important that ISIS actually speaks directly to attackers because ISISs goal is to inspire this kind of attackThis is terrorism on the cheap The Islamic State doesnt have to try to send operatives to the US It can simply prod disgruntled Americans and claim the creditFor the Islamic State trying to get guys from Syria or Iraq into the United States to fight would be stupid and fruitless because it would take time and money it would take guys away from the fight and why would you even do it when you have a great force multiplier in the Internet where you can get people to pop up anywhere making you seem omnipotent and universal asks Tim Clemente a former FBI counterterrorism agentOn one hand Sundays attack gave that impression But it also suggested the limitations of outsourcing terrorism operations Americas legal dockets are strewn with the stories of homegrown terrorists who were rumbled by the FBI or simply failed CNN notes that the attackers had body armor and semiautomatic weapons and yet were killed by a traffic officer with a pistolThe events showed that the attackers were wannabes who have never really done anything legitimate and who hope this act will give them acceptance Mr Clemente saysFor that reason the attack in Garland doesnt suggest to me that this is a clear escalation says Ms Stern Rather it points to the Islamic States opportunism  both in recruiting wouldbe terrorists and in capitalizing on their exploitsThis is something ISIS has been hoping will happen she saysThe Islamic State has made many claims of responsibility in attacks throughout North Africa and Europe though this is the first time it has done so for an attack in North AmericaThe attack last October on the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa by a lone gunman seemed taken out of the Islamic State playbook investigators said but Canadian intelligence never found a credible connectionThe Garland attack also stirred memories of the attack by jihadists on the satirical Paris magazine Charlie Hebdo as well as an attack at an event this spring attended by Lars Vilks a Swedish cartoonist who has caricatured MuhammadSundays event sponsored by controversial freespeech activist Pam Geller promised the artist behind the best cartoon of Mohammad a 10000 prize It included a keynote address from controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders who has decried the Islamicization of the NetherlandsThe Islamic State message does appear to hold some appeal for a minuscule fringe In addition to Islamic Stateinspired attacks an estimated 3000 Westerners  including perhaps hundreds of Americans  have traveled to Syria since 2011 to join violent jihadAs of last October Norwegian terrorism analyst Thomas Hegghammer found a low blowback rate for those fighters coming back to their home countries to engage in terrorism  only about 1 of every 150 to 300 much lower than the rate for foreign fighters in Afghanistan for exampleHe suggested that was because of the Islamic States primary focus on establishing a caliphate in the Middle East ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global terrorism operations the way al Qaeda Central has The organization is not designed for that and such a strategy is not compatible with its statebuilding ambitions he wrote on CNNIn the months since ISISs messaging campaign has become more global but its operational reach has apparently remained focused on the Middle East The result experts say is attacks like the one SundayIts not as if ISIS has a cell in the United States or trains people Aymenn Jawad alTamimi an Islamic State expert at the Interdisciplinary Center in Harzliya Israel tells The New York Times This is not ISIS coming to America
