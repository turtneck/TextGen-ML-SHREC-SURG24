For those who cant wait to get this election over with theres good news  early voting is startingThe bad news That only applies to you if you live in one of 37 states that offer some kind of early voting in person absentee or by mail without an excuse neededMore than 1 in 3 people is expected to cast a ballot early this year On Friday voters in Minnesota and South Dakota can start turning in absentee ballots On Saturday they can do so in Vermont and ballots will go out in New JerseyVoters have already had the chance to go to the polls in Wisconsin Rapids Wis which started holding early inperson voting Monday In Wisconsin each municipality and county sets its early voting datesOver the next three weeks voters in a third of the country will already be able to voteEarly voting could account for up to 34 percent of the vote this year according to Michael McDonald associate professor of political science at the University of Florida and founder of the Elections Project which tracks turnoutHe predicts that voting methods such as inperson and allmail ballots will become the future of exercising democracy There are even states that operate without physical polling locations relying solely on the mail during an election  Washington Oregon and Colorado And as Americans start to cast their tickets some as early as September those votes will carefully be dissected by both campaignsEarly votes will give us a good contour of whos enthused to show up to vote McDonald explainedWhen the absentee ballots begin to flow in a campaign could spin the numbers in whatever direction it wants But those reactions will most likely be overwrought The Trump campaign could spin mailin votes as an indicator of the polls being wrong if they still show Clinton ahead but that would likely be a false reading McDonald said Thats because registered Republicans tend to vote by mail in bigger numbers than Democrats and Democrats tend to use early inperson voting more oftenRomney in 2012 put out records that he was crushing it in Ohio McDonald said They were saying the polls are wrong look at how well hes doing there Well he lost OhioA pointintime comparison is a better indicator of how well a candidate is doing in a certain state By comparing the data and trends of early voting from previous election cycles the campaigns will know if citizens are passionate enough about their platform to participate in voting  and if campaigns are hitting their marksEarly voters are people who have already made up their minds McDonald said Clinton and Trump supporters will vote right now and it wont matter what happens until Election Day Theyre welleducated and dedicatedThis could be a component for each of the campaigns successes or failures especially in battleground states that allow early and noexcuse absentee ballot voting Florida for instance saw almost 4 in 10 people vote early 20 percent early inperson 19 percent absentee Professor Paul Gronke of Reed College and founder of the Early Voting Information Center told NPRs Scott Simon that Florida could see an even bigger early vote turnout this yearEarly voting could also be a factor in Ohio and North CarolinaThis is going to change the dynamics in those states so that you will expect to see early rallies timed when the early voting period opens up Gronke said adding that the candidates travel schedule will reflect this because they want to follow up that kind of enthusiasm and get people to the polls right awayIts not clear how the feelings toward these candidates will affect early voting Partisan divisions are at their highest levels in decades and although both candidates hold recordlow favorability ratings Clinton and Trump supporters tend to be pretty adamant about their candidate of choiceThe earliest movement for absentee voting began during the Civil War Soldiers on both sides wanted to cast their ballots in the 1864 election Several state legislators hashed out the details How would the votes be cast How would voter fraud and coercion votes be curtailed And how would the votes be deliveredDespite these sizable challenges 25 Union states passed some form of absentee voting for soldiers battling in the muddy and bloody trenchesSome say Abraham Lincoln might not have been elected if they werent allowed to vote McDonald saidSince then the absentee ballot has evolved to include the sick and the elderly business people who frequently travel and others who can provide valid reasons for being out of state like students in college in a different state There are currently 27 states and the District of Columbia that do not require any reason to request an absentee ballotBy the 1990s many states took up early inperson voting measures which allowed individuals to cast their ballots at a polling location during a specific period of time before Election DayThe only way we can lose in my opinion  I really mean this  in Pennsylvania is if cheating goes on Trump said at a campaign event in Altoona Pa I hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that its 100 percent fineBut according to McDonald the chances of voter fraud occurring at polling locations is slimIf we look at the weakness in the election system McDonald said its not at the polling places There is impression fraud but its so rareSo rare in fact that there were only about 31 separate incidents of possible voter fraud since 2000 based on data collected by Justin Levitt a professor at Loyola Law School This includes general primary special and municipal elections from 2000 to 2014To put that in perspective there were 1 billion ballots cast in the general and primary elections during that time Thats 0000000031 percentSome of these incidents may not have been an attempt to actually participate in voter fraud but could have resulted in data entry errors a mixup of matching different people with the same name  or someone accidentally signing in as the wrong person in a poll bookHowever there is a bigger risk of voter fraud when it comes to absentee and mailin ballots McDonald pointed outAgain this is small not a huge problem he noted Local elections are the most vulnerable not presidential electionsThere were 491 cases of absentee ballot fraud from 2000 to 2012 according to an analysis by News21 If broken down thats about 80 cases every two yearsThere are also checks to confirm the authenticity of these ballots Certain states require people pick up a ballot in person with a valid ID All absentee and mailin ballots require a signature that is crossverified against the voters voterregistration signature Any signatures that look suspicious are thrown outWhile voter fraud is one issue another is whether mailin ballots are filled out and returned correctlyWhere most people make a mistake is through the mail McDonald said They wont sign the privacy envelope People try to save the election board money by putting two ballots in one envelope but they have to throw that away Its vital for people to follow the mail procedures accuratelyVote by mail Washington state switched to an entirely votebymail system in 2011 Officials noticed that by 1996 more than half of voters were casting their ballots through the mail It didnt make economic sense for the state to keep its polling places openThe Internet Its already being used for military members and certain citizens who live outside the country under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act In addition to the ability to return a mailin ballot which may be limited to military members who are serving in remote locations electronic ballot transmission is another optionHow it works per McDonald Voters request electronic delivery of the ballot either by email or by a secured website where the ballot may be downloaded The voter then prints out the ballot completes it and signs it Now if the state permits electronic ballot return the voter will scan the completed ballot and send it either by email or by uploading it to the secured websiteIf the state does not allow electronic ballot transmission the voter must print out and assemble a privacy envelope to deliver the ballot which McDonald said officials call the origami project When officials receive the ballot they check the signature against the one on file with the voters voterregistration applicationThis option is only available for uniformed military stationed both abroad and domestically and overseas citizens through the voting act However Alaska was the first state to extend the electronic ballot delivery and return option to everyoneIt starts in the military and goes down to the general public McDonald said Thats usually how this stuff happensThat seemed to be the case with absentee voting and the Civil War I believe more states will follow Alaskas lead to expand ballot electronic delivery and return in the future McDonald saidBut dont expect the transition to occur anytime soon With the recent hack in Arizona and Illinois voter registration databases and the Democratic National Committees computer system tackling the challenges of cybersecurity will likely take precedence over convenienceWhen can people start voting Inperson or absentee dropoff without an excuseSept 19  Wisconsin Rapids Wis town
