Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election Is this the gamechanging October surprise that many hope for  and others dread November 2 2016 Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center FBI Director James Comeys reopening of the investigation into Clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election Donald Trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than Watergate Clinton the DOJ Democrat Senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trumps side and put him in the White House Theres no doubt that Comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying Not because it is unprecedented as the Democrats keep squealing They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a pollsurging George HW Bush for his alleged involvement in the IranContra scandal No the mystery is Comeys motives Is Comey like Conrads Lord Jim now sacrificing his FBI careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators To quote one of our candidates At this point what difference does it make The real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters Right now we dont know if the content of the 650000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother Comey back in July So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the Democrats Whatever is found on the Abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters They have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore Here are the greatest hits from Hillarys catalogue Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering Stealing 200000 worth of china furniture and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under sniper fire in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House dead broke Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that shes got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30000 missing emails personal communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americans families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they werent Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous reset with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary the paytoplay State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage the Trans Pacific Trade deal and the Keystone pipeline Promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work Her campaign staffs dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media Her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions And last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health Back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress let alone the White House And Mr Trumps offenses Hes talks exactly as youd expect a New York real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk Hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every WhiteHousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity When youre a star they let you do it as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances Hes ignorant of policy He doesnt understand the economics of global trade He doesnt know what the nuclear triad is Hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law Hes not suitable for office He does not have the right temperament Hes used bankruptcy as a business tool Hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star Hes mean and insulting He has orange hair In short Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices Just ask Hillarys various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be The voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous But whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates This transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House his approval ratings were 73 He left the White House with a 66 rating higher than any president since Harry Truman including Ronald Reagan Think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history That was the inflection point for our political culture No wonder that Barack Obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiAmerican racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters So why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone So absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump Comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging October surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate Then again the rapid erosion of Hillarys support is drawing analogies to Reagans late surge against Carter Either way on November 8 most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me Or they might just finally realize that Hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess
