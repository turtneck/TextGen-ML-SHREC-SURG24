CEDAR RAPIDS Iowa  I had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in 1992 Bill Clinton said by way of opening to the crowd of more than 1100 on Saturday nightTwo days before the Iowa caucuses Cedar Rapids tried to deliver that same old feeling to his wife Hillary ClintonIn the crowdone woman held a sign that said 227 years of men Its HER turn Some carried signs and books Others had traveled from as far as Missouri They had waited hours even after the fire marshal told them there was no more room inside the high school gymnasiumThe restive crowd chanted slogans and buzzed with anticipation until finally Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton all appeared on stage handinhand an hour behind schedule As they roared Hillary Clinton beamedIt has been a long slog in Iowa for the Clinton campaign which has struggled mightily to shake the label that its supporters cant muster the enthusiasm of its rivals backers As the caucuses near and with the help of a former president the energy levelat her events are notably dialing upHes a charismatic speaker said Cigi Ross 31 In general Id say hes a bigger draw for peopleMonday night will put the campaigns months of their work to the test Can the campaigns organization bring out their supporters Can the candidate energize votersClinton who seemed to draw on the higherthanusual energy stood at the center of it all and delivered a confident closing statementWhat we need is a plan and a commitment Clinton said at the top of her voiceAnd me yes thank you Clinton finishedEight years later Clinton is in Iowa once again facing what could be a nailbiting conclusion of a hardfought campaign Clinton acknowledges that it isnt just her campaign that has changed since her devastating loss here in her last run she too has changed  and improved she told CNN on SaturdayI think I am a different and perhaps a better candidate so I hope that also shows Clinton said in an interview with the network that morningDays ago Iowa seemed to be slipping from her grasp but campaign aides are feeling more confident now A slew of positive news endorsements and the latest poll from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News indicate the bleeding has at least slowed That poll  considered the gold standard in Iowa  gave Clinton a slim lead over her rival Vermont Sen Bernie SandersIf Democrats are wary of political dynasties they didnt show it Spotting someone in the audience carrying Chelsea Clintons book her father remarked Thank you young woman for holding up her bookBill Clinton who has spent days crisscrossing the state on his wifes behalf has settled easily into this role as boosterinchief He lays off the policy leaving that to his wife He focuses instead on what he knows about the jobThere are certain almost intangible qualities that determine whether a president succeeds or not Clinton said his voice raspy even and low You need a sticker A sticker someone who wont quit on youShes the best at that Ive ever known he added
