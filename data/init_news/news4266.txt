Earlier today I talked with Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson for about half an hour Heres an edited version of my conversation with the former twoterm Republican governor of New Mexico The topics we covered include whether he supports carbon taxes and mandatory vaccines no to both agrees with Hillary Clintons characterization of Donald Trump as racist yes and if he thinks there is any chance he will crack 15 percent in the national polls that will earn him a ticket to the presidential debates Were very optimisticJohnson who ran for president on the LP ticket in 2012 and pulled more than 1 million votes says that the response his campaign is getting this time around is a transformation He attributes this to an appetite voters have for a different approach to politics one that combines liberal social views and conservative fiscal views He is certainly the only presidential candidate who believes taxes to me are like a death plague blacks are systematically denied equal opportunities in America minimumwage laws punish lowskilled workers and marijuana should be legalizedWe are two former Republican governors who served in heavily Democratic states Johnson told me while discussing the reaction to the way he and his running mate former Massachusetts Gov Bill Weld mashup positions normally associated with either the right or the left What that meant is that we pissed everybody off and because we pissed everybody off we both got reelected by bigger margins We pissed off the left we pissed off the right but really where we came down was right in the middle Where we came down on was right where everybody is right where the majority of people are atNick GillespieNICK GILLESPIE Earlier this week you suggested you were in favor of a carbon tax or fee Yesterday at a rally in New Hampshire video here you said you were against it What is your position on carbon taxesGARY JOHNSON A carbon tax sounds good in theory but it wouldnt work in practice I never called it a tax I called it a fee As it was presented to me this was the way to reduce carbon and actually reduce costs to reduce carbon Under that premiselower costs better outcomesyou can always count on me to support that sort of notion In theory it sounds good but the reality is that its really complex and it wont really accomplish that So no support for a carbon fee I never raised one penny of tax as governor of New Mexico not one cent in any area Taxes to me are like a death plagueGILLESPIE You do believe that climate change is happening and that human activity adds to it Does that mean it is an issue that should be addressed by government policyJOHNSON Well Ill agree with the first two but Im a skeptic that government policy can address this The United States contributes 16 percent of the contribution of carbon in the worldGILLESPIE So you would be against the United States unilaterally making any kind of move that puts a huge economic disadvantage that also wouldnt really mitigate carbonJOHNSON If there is any way we can address this issue without the loss of US jobs my ears are openGILLESPIE Lets talk about vaccines There are no federal laws mandating vaccines and thats how it should be as far as youre concernedGILLESPIE Various states treat vaccines differently and youre not wild about the range of individual choice and optout provisions but you do believe its a statelevel decisionor certainly that its not a federallevel decisionGILLESPIE There are people who say vaccines cause autism and other problems or that vaccines dont work Are you in that campJOHNSON No I chose to have my children vaccinated I understand all the concerns that some people have but for me personally I made a decision to have my children vaccinated I want people to make decisions and I believe in optouts With the exception of a few states everyone has an optout But I also want to say that as president of the United States if I am confronted with a zombie apocalypse that will happen unless the total herd is totally immunized I will support mandatory vaccinationsGILLESPIE Yesterday Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she explicitly said that Donald Trump was racist and that he has brought a racist presence into the Republican Party A year ago you told Reason something very similar You said Trumps comments about Mexicans and his views on immigration were racist Do you agree with Hillary Clinton that Donald Trump is a racistJOHNSON Well if it walks like a duck if it talks like a duck its a duckGILLESPIE As a former Republican governor how does that make you feel about the current state of the GOPJOHNSON It makes me feel like I think more than half of Republicans feel This is not representative of RepublicansGILLESPIE Do you think the Republican Party is going to be permanently damaged by Donald Trumps candidacyGILLESPIE What do you think of his recent appeals to black voters Hes been saying to African Americans that the Democratic Party hasnt really helped them much That everything in their lives has gotten worse under Barack Obama and that Hillary Clinton is not their champion Do you agree with Trump that Democratic Party policies havent really benefited the black communityJOHNSON I do Both parties are engaged in pandering The libertarian approachequal opportunityisnt that what you really want But Id argue that equal opportunity currently does not existGILLESPIE How does it not exist and what policies would you enact to make it a reality Is it a question of ending a drug war that disproportionately impacts blacks promoting school choice so they can escape chronically bad schools and ending minimumwage laws that price lowskilled workers out of getting their first jobsJOHNSON All of what you just mentioned Let me offer up a story I was on Fox News The Five a couple of days ago with Eric Bolling I made the statement that black lives matter and Eric chimed in to say All lives matter Its not a criticism of him its just indicative of the conversation about race and politics I said Yes all lives do matter but blacks are getting shot at the rate of six times that whites are If youre of color and youre arrested theres a four times greater likelihood that youll go to jail than if youre white Eric said Blacks commit eight times the crime My answer was little muddied but I think I got to my point Yes blacks are being arrested they are being charged and they are being convicted at eight times the rate of whites If that same scrutiny were applied to you and I as whites we would have those same results Thats the awareness of unequal treatment that doesnt currently existGILLESPIE The set of ideas mindsets and positions that your campaign is putting out there doesnt have a home in contemporary Republican and Democratic politics The way things are is that if youre against the minimum wage because you think it hurts unskilled workers youve got to be a conservative But then youre saying I care about blacks and they are having a tougher time in America than whites So then you must be on the left Do you feel the framework you and Bill Weld are presenting is getting through Is it changing the way people think about politicsJOHNSON I think were getting through in a huge way Between Facebook Twitter and other social media weve got a reach of 300 million We had a rally the other night in Vermont and there was a crowd of 300 or 400 people very enthusiastic people Our Facebook Live stream of the rally got 300000 views on Facebook Live in two hours 300000 Clearly theres an appetite for what were talking about Bill Weld says this all the time We are two former Republican governors who served in heavily Democratic states What that meant is that we pissed everybody off and because we pissed everybody off we both got reelected by bigger margins We pissed off the left we pissed off the right but really where we came down was right in the middle Where we came down on was right where everybody is right where the majority of people are atGILLESPIE A writer at the conservative website The Federalist recently said that your embrace of a carbon tax clearly meant you are a leftwing candidate Do you consider yourself a leftwingerJOHNSON Well no But you know tomorrow you will see an article that says this guy is a rightwing radical BravoGILLESPIE Lets talk about your stance on religiousliberty issues which has angered a lot people on the right and many libertarians Your position is that you essentially want to extend antidiscrimination protections for race and gender to cover sexual orientation when it comes to businesses that are open to the public Yet you support an optout for vaccinations Why not support an optout for the religious owner of a business who doesnt want to bake a gay Nazi wedding cakeJOHNSON Because it would create a new exemption for discrimination At the end of the day were just going to agree to disagree But you bring me specific legislation dealing with a cake baker not having to decorate a cake for a Nazi and Ill sign itGILLESPIE Lets talk about Hillary Clinton In response to being called a bigot and a racist by her Donald Trump said that she was fundamentally not trustworthy Do you agree with him on thatJOHNSON Yes I agree with himGILLESPIE So youre in a weird position arent you You actually agree with both Hillary and Donald but you dont think either should be presidentJOHNSON I agree I had always surmised that Bill Clintons speaking feeswhich hadnt been highly publicized over the yearswere tied to payoffs for what he had done as president Ive always felt that OK this is the way of paying him back What Ive come to discover is that it was also access to Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State that was being sold Its paytoplay textbook paytoplay Thats not right Having never held political office before becoming governor I had no idea of what was possible in terms of selling access and favors For me it had everything to do with doing the right thing For me it had everything to do with analyzing legislationwould this actually improve lives or would it not If it didnt I was going to veto it If it was going to make things better even incrementally I signed on to itGILLESPIE Do you have a particular instance that you can point to with Hillary Clinton where she accepted a donation to the Clinton Foundation in regard to this action or this accessJOHNSON View the documentary thats online right now Clinton Cash The preponderance of what they break down in the film clearly shows to me that this was an ongoing activityGILLESPIE You still have a lot of ground to cover to reach 15 percent in the national polls that will get you into the presidential debates What do you think your odds are at this pointJOHNSON Were very optimistic Our reach on social media is doubling every three weeks right now That simply means that for the first time people are hearing the name Gary Johnson In the five polls being used by the Commission on Presidential Debates were smack dab at 10 percent Not 101 percent not 9 percent but smack dab at 10 percent And if you look at those polls six weeks ago the average would have probably been between 6 percent and 7 percent Currently were on the ballot in 45 states and we have 100 percent belief that well be on the ballot in all the states and the District in Columbia This campaign is really a transformation We showed up in New Hampshire the other day to a big crowd I ran in the 2012 cycle and I think I got more media at that event than I got in the entire 2012 cycle Everything is changed right now from an attention standpoint Whether or not that means we end up in the debates and getting to make a difference on the stage is still a question But right now Im as optimistic as everGILLESPIE Thank your for time
