Lausanne Switzerland CNN As nuclear talks with Iran neared the endgame US Secretary of State John Kerry shied away from predicting successDifficult issues remain on the table as the worlds most powerful diplomats meet in Switzerland with Iranian nuclear negotiators Kerry told CNN on MondayWe are working very hard to work those through We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow We are working with a view to get something done he said There is a little more light there today but there are still some tricky issues Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrowNegotiators have set Tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal A comprehensive deal including technical additions is supposed to be negotiated by June 30World powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years  In exchange Iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economyKerrys comments to CNN came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in Lausanne Switzerland made headlinesThe assertion Iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bombOn Sunday an Iranian negotiator told journalists that Tehran would not send fissile material to Russia which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bombmaking materials out of reachThe export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program and we do not intend to send them abroad  There is no question of sending the stocks abroad Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saidBut on Monday a senior US State Department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet downNegotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material and Iran has made the comments many times before the official said citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reportsChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks progress earlier Monday saying that the diplomats were narrowing down their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking pointsThese marathonlike negotiations have reached the final stage he saidThings have been tense in Lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms with talks snagged on three important points How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15year agreement How quickly crushing UN sanctions will go away Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the dealIran wants them gone for good But international negotiators want merely to suspend them so they can reapply them as leverage if Iran does not keep the bargainAgreement on the points is crucial a Western diplomat saidThere cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions the diplomat saidIn the background a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again Over the weekend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the deal he believes is taking shapeThis agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse he said after a meeting in Israel with visiting US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Netanyahu also attacked Iran for its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen who have overtaken many parts of that countryHe said Iran was trying to take over the whole Middle East with the nuclear deal and its influence in YemenConservative Washington lawmakers are threatening new sanctions if Tehran doesnt comply with demands which could throw a wrench into negotiationsUS negotiators are working to reach an agreement in part to prevent this kind of congressional punishment They fear it could prompt hardliners in Tehran to push for killing the talks which would scuttle the chances of a deal altogetherAside from the three tough points negotiators on both sides have shown optimismUS officials have said most of the other elements were solvable if those three major hurdles could be overcomeIrans Araghchi agreed Getting to an accord is doable Solutions have been found for numerous questions he saidIran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed But diplomats says its not so simpleIran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade oil and banking but sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicatedMany are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the UN nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency that Irans nuclear program does not have a military dimensionOn Saturday Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlockHe said he believes the world powers have realized that sanctions pressure and an agreement will not go together Its only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiatingUS officials said that all sides including Iran agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formulaIran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect New machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machinesUS and European officials worry that could enable Iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weaponDiplomats say the first 10 years of the 15year deal would have the most stringent restrictions which would be relaxed over the last fiveWe are not asking them to do nothing in technology development but they want to do more than we want them to do a Western diplomat saidBut the diplomat added After 15 years they can do what they wantDiplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium That figure is down from the 6000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started Thursday but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wantedIran currently runs about 10000 centrifuges but it has around 19000 in its stockpileUS officials maintain the number is not that important because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon  known as the breakout time  to at least a yearWhile the focus this week is on the March 31 deadline its important to note it isnt the final deadlineEven if a pact is reached Tuesday its unclear what form it would take and the United States and Iran have varying needsThe parties are seeking to reach whats being called a framework agreement  essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final dealBut if theyre able to come together on the big issues they still have until the end of June when the Joint Plan of Action expires to iron out the details So that means the talks wont be finished this monthOfficials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders The United States would prefer a written accord but Iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reachedUS officials say they will need to quantify Irans commitments before submitting the agreement to Congress But US and Western diplomats say that Iran is looking simply for an understanding of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached
