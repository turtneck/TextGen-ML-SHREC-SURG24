Airstrikes Move To Syria Target More Than Just ISISIn a major escalation of the air campaign against Islamic extremist groups the US and its Arab allies jointly hit targets inside Syria for the first timeThe New York Times says The intensity of the attacks struck a fierce opening blow against the jihadists of the Islamic State scattering its forces and damaging the network of facilities it has built in Syria that helped fuel its seizure of a large part of Iraq this yearBesides the US the Pentagon says that Bahrain Qatar Saudi Arabia Jordan and the United Arab Emirates participated in or supported operations against targets associated with the selfdeclared Islamic StateUS State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki confirmed that we informed the Syrian regime directly of our intent to take action through our Ambassador to the United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power to the Syrian Permanent Representative to the United NationsAt a morning Pentagon briefing Lt Gen William Mayville the Joint Chiefs director of operations said there were three waves of attacks and that coalition partners provided combat air patrols and conducted airstrikes as part of the final two wavesWe warned Syria not to engage US aircraft We did not request the regimes permission We did not coordinate our actions with the Syrian government We did not provide advance notification to the Syrians at a military level or give any indication of our timing on specific targets Secretary of State John Kerry did not send a letter to the Syrian regime Psaki said The Islamic State in its Syrian headquarters of Raqqa The alQaidaaffiliated Nusra Front or Jabhat alNusra in northwest Syria A shadowy group known as Khorasan that the US says is planning an imminent attack against the United States and Western interestsNPRs Deborah Amos tells Morning Edition that militants with the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL were a major focus of the attacks The Pentagon said the strikes employed 47 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea operating from international waters in the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf as well as US Air Force Navy and Marine Corps fighter remotely piloted and bomber aircraft deployed to the US Central Command area of operationsAccording to Deborah What is striking about this air campaign is that it was expanded to include the Nusra FrontNPRs Tom Bowman says not much is known about the Khorasan group The Pentagon says they took this action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the United States by this group thats made up of seasoned alQaida veterans There were eight strikes around Aleppo targeting this group The Pentagon says it had training camps explosives and munitions productions facility communications building and also command and control facilitiesGen Mayville said that weve been watching Khorasan and that the group clearly is not focused on fighting the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad but instead had been putting down roots to work toward attacks on the USMayville said in the first strike which began about midnight Syrian time and involved mainly Tomahawk cruise missiles the US unilaterally hit Khorasan command and control in the countrys northeast The second wave employed F22 Raptors in their first combat roles as well as F15s F16s and B1 bombers he said The third and final wave against Islamic State militants in the east employed F18 Hornets from the USS George HW Bush as well as groundbased F16s he saidMayville said the majority of support from Arab allies came in the third waveHe showed journalists before and after bombdamage assessment photos and video of various structures that had been hitAn unnamed US official tells The New York Times that the Khorasan group is led by Muhsin alFadhli a senior Qaeda operative who according to the State Department was so close to Osama Bin Laden that he was among a small group of people who knew about the Sept 11 2001 attacks before they were launched The Times saysThe Wall Street Journal reports So far more than a dozen airstrikes have hit Islamic State military targets and administrative buildings in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces in the north as well as al Qaedas official arm in the country al Nusra Front in the northwestern city of Idlib the opposition saidWhat Are The ConsequencesReuters quotes a resident in Raqqa as saying there is an exodus from the city in the wake of the bombardment It started in the early hours of the day after the strikes People are fleeing toward the countryside the resident tells ReutersThe participation of the partners gives the operation some legitimacy  more legitimacy in the region because Arab governments took part There are political optics about this operation put together in Washington NPRs Deborah Amos says adding that the agreement to participate changes the stakes for the Arab partnersThe BBCs security correspondent Frank Gardner speculates that the Islamic State will be enraged by this  it has no effective military answers to US air power  so those Arab countries that supported or took part in the action may well now be bracing themselves for possible reprisalsThe Associated Press quotes Rami Abdurrahman head of the Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as saying There is confirmed information that there are casualties among Islamic State group membersSpeaking on MSNBC Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm John Kirby says the US is still assessing the effectiveness of these strikesLater Gen Mayville said Last nights strikes are the beginning of a credible and sustained campaign to destroy the Islamic State
