Sen Ted Cruz RTex came to a convention of libertarianleaning Republicans and talked about shrinking government slashing regulations fighting against the bulk collection of phone data and his great affinity for a rival in the presidential racePaul Kentuckys junior US senator and scion of one of the countrys most famous libertarian families was expected to lock down the support of libertarian voters in the presidential campaign But as Pauls poll numbers have sagged nationally  and in such libertarianminded places as New Hampshire  Cruz is trying to pick off what is sometimes called the liberty voteCruz essentially crashed what was supposed to be Pauls big libertarian party here the biennial meeting of the Republican Liberty Caucus Cruz stood in a hotel here on a dreary Friday morning surrounded by supporters and curious attendees who held signs and jostled for photosI was elected with tremendous support from the liberty movement Cruz said of his 2012 Senate campaign noting that Rand Paul and his father former representative Ron Paul RTex both endorsed him in that raceThe Texas Republicans presidential campaign has been making the case that as Pauls campaign has floundered Cruz is viable  flush with cash and able to go the distanceOn the trail Cruz has invoked the Fourth Amendments privacy protections and railed against the Federal Reserve Last month the campaign rolled out a video showing eight supporters of Ron Pauls 2012 presidential campaign who are backing Cruz for 2016The liberty movement has been integral to our campaign since Day One Cruz saidCruz breaks down the Republican electorate into four brackets of support tea party conservatives evangelical Christians establishment Republicans and libertarians He sees his base in the tea party and evangelical wings but he also is trying to siphon off libertarian voters with a message of limited governmentCruz tailored his speech here in New Hampshire to those voters He took a less hawkish tone when discussing foreign policy saying that the United States shouldnt engage in nationbuilding and calling for armed Kurdish ground troops to fight the Islamic StateTheres no reason for us to get in the middle of the Syrian civil war he saidCruz praised the liberty movement as an amazing thing and vowed that the size of government will be materially smaller if he is elected president He promoted a bill he cosponsored to end the bulk collection of phone metadata  an issue that Rand Paul championed this year with a nearly 11hour Senate floor speechThis is the battleground between Cruz and Paul said Dave Nalle a former chairman of the Liberty Caucus He said Paul appeals to privacyminded libertarians while Cruz appeals to those who want a strict adherence to the ConstitutionI was impressed with Cruz said Louis Colavecchio Sr of Wakefield RI who also said he has not decided whom he will support in the primaryThe scramble for supporters seems to have somewhat strained the cordial relationship between the onetime Senate allies Last month Paul said Cruz was pretty much done for in the Senate after Cruz tried to disrupt the passage of a government funding bill because it would give money to Planned ParenthoodTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership  which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate and as a consequence he cant get anything done legislatively Paul said on Fox News Radio On Friday Cruz called Paul a friend and good manPaul gave an animated speech here and appeared to be in his comfort zone saying he wants a government that leaves him alone He reminded his audience of his marathon Senate speech to defend that principle He called for reform of the criminaljustice system and he knocked other candidates for saying they would not hold talks with rival nations Paul also rapped Congress labeling a justpassed bill that temporarily funds the government a bunch of crap and the body itself impotent and inconsequentialIm embarrassed that Im even a part of it said Paul sporting a brightblue belt with the University of Kentuckys logo on itPaul played down the threat from CruzBoth here and Iowa we know where our support is and where my dads support was and we feel comfortable that the overwhelming majority of it is with us Paul saidSome libertarians here were uncomfortable with Cruz making religion such a large part of his campaignI dont think hes going to have as much sway on Rand Pauls electability as people think he will because hes a religious zealot Its too much said Austin Sekel 22 who is supporting Paul Cruz needs to stop grandstanding on the Senate floor he saidSekel and others said they do not think Pauls sagging poll numbers will change anything Sekel thinks Paul has a base of support that has not yet become engaged in the campaignBob Pyle a pastor from Harrisburg Pa said Paul has a solid loyal following that is not given to the sounds of throwing red meat Between those people and Ron Paul supporters Pyle said the Kentucky Republicans fortunes will only increaseOther people here are not completely enamored of either candidate Some libertarians have said that Paul has run his race too far from his fathers pure libertarian principles They include John Cisar 36 of Burlington VtI think theres a big schism among libertarians that hes fallen short of expectations Cisar said of Paul Cisar said that he is not a Cruz fan and that he thinks Paul is the more acceptable of the two in the 2016 raceHes the lesser of the evils Cisar said of Paul And that doesnt make me feel really good inside to vote for him
