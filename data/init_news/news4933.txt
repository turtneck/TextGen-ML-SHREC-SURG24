This week we learned that billionaire Peter Thiel who made his fortune as a cofounder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook has been bankrolling a lawsuit that could drive Gawker Media out of business The story was first reported by Forbes and confirmed by Thiel himself in a Wednesday interview with the New York TimesIts not like it is some sort of speaking truth to power or something going on here Thiel argued The way Ive thought about this is that Gawker has been a singularly terrible bully I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violationsThiel in other words sees his lawsuit as a publicspirited attempt to enforce norms of decency and respect for personal privacyBut whatever you think of the merits of the particular lawsuit against Gawker critics warn that this kind of arrangement  where a wealthy person funds thirdparty lawsuits against a common foe  is ripe for abuseThe law used to disapprove of this kind of arrangement says Walter Olson a legal expert at the Cato Institute For centuries he argues courts in the United Kingdom United States and elsewhere recognized that wealthy people could use thirdparty lawsuits as a weapon against those they disliked  and had rules in place to prevent this power from being abusedBut laws limiting this kind of thirdparty involvement have fallen out of favor in recent decades opening the door for billionaires like Thiel to use their vast resources to wage war on people they dont likeIn 2012 Gawker published a video of former professional wrestler Terry Hulk Hogan Bollea having sex Hogan said the video was taken without his knowledge or consent and he sued Gawker for invasion of privacyIn March 2016 a jury awarded Hogan 140 million in damages The ruling is still being appealed but if its upheld it could put Gawker Media  which publishes sites like Jezebel and Gizmodo in addition to Gawker itself  out of businessThe First Amendment gives American media organizations greater latitude than they enjoy in most other developed countries But US media organizations dont have unlimited freedom One of the key constraints is personal privacy Revealing certain kinds of information  especially about people who are not public figures  can get a media organization troubleAnd Gawker exercises this freedom more aggressively than most other media organizations In one of its most infamous stories Gawker reported on a New York media executive soliciting the services of a male escort The piece was later removed after founder Nick Denton decided that the story had gone over the ethical lineOuting gay people is something of a specialty for the digital gossip rag Gawker was one of the first to report that CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was gay in 2009 In 2013 Gawker reported that Fox News anchor Shepard Smith was romantically involved with a male stafferAnd one of the early targets of Gawkers outing campaign was Peter Thiel A 2007 post called Peter Thiel is totally gay people apparently marked the start of Thiels vendetta against the site Its less about revenge and more about specific deterrence Thiel told the Times on Wednesday indicating he viewed his funding of lawsuits as bigger than just its previous posts about himStill the Hogan video represented a new low for Gawker The video of Hogan having consensual sex with the wife of a radio shock jock who arranged the encounter and made the videotape had no obvious news value but Gawker decided to publish it anywayIn court Hulk Hogans lawyers sought to portray Gawker as an organization without a moral compass It wasnt a hard argument to make At one point one of Hogans lawyers asked a former Gawker editor if there were any situation in which a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthyIf they were a child replied the editor Albert Daulerio Under what age the lawyer askedAs a result arguments about media freedom fell on deaf ears in the jury box Jurors didnt buy arguments that the First Amendment protected Gawkers right to humiliate random celebrities by publishing video of their most intimate momentsEven if you think Gawker stepped over the line in publishing the Hogan sex tape  and personally I do  theres still a lot of reason to worry about the prospect of wealthy people using lawsuits as a weapon against people they dont likeGawker isnt the only publication to be targeted by a disgruntled billionaire Last year the liberal magazine Mother Jones defeated a defamation lawsuit filed by Republican donor Frank VanderSloot Winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones a relatively small nonprofit organization and its insurance company 25 million in legal feesIf VanderSloots goal was to punish Mother Jones for writing an accurate but unflattering story about him a loss was almost as good as a victory His lawsuit sought 74999 staying just under the 75000 threshold that would have allowed Mother Jones to move the case to federal court and away from an Idaho jury that might have favored the hometown plaintiff So winning the lawsuit cost Mother Jones 30 times as much as the amount it would have had to pay if it had lostWhat was really ominous was what happened after VanderSloots loss He announced that he was setting up a 1 million fund to pay the legal expenses of people wanting to sue Mother Jones or other members of the liberal pressAs far as I know no one has taken him up on the offer But the threat to freedom of the press is obvious Any news organization doing its job is going to make some enemies If a wealthy third party is willing to bankroll lawsuits by anyone with a grudge and defending each case costs millions of dollars the organization could get driven out of business even if it wins every single lawsuitThat appears to be the situation Gawker is in The Hogan lawsuit is not the only lawsuit Gawker is facing Hogans attorney Charles Harder is also leading two other lawsuits against Gawker We dont know for sure which lawsuits Thiel is funding but ultimately it may not matter If Thiel keeps paying for people to sue Gawker sooner or later the legal costs will drive Gawker out of businessSome people following the Thiel story appear to be surprised that these weapons can be used by rich and powerful people in order to get their way Olson tells me But he argues that they shouldnt beOlson argues that if you went back a century or two and talked to British or American legal scholars theyd say of course these things would be used by the rich and powerful if you allowed them Under doctrines called champerty and maintenance the law used to bar unrelated third parties from paying someone else to engage in litigation and financing a lawsuit in exchange for a share of the damagesBut states have loosened these laws over the past 50 years in part because lawyers began to see easy access to the courts as being in the public interest This was driven in part by the rise of public interest litigation  think for example of an environmental group finding a thirdparty plaintiff to sue a company to stop an environmentally sensitive development projectAwards are constantly being given to projects in which some wealthy person decides that someone needs to be sued finds someone who has standing as a plaintiff and generously funds their litigation Olson saysBut whether you view this kind of litigation as publicspirited or vexatious will often depend on your politics After all Thiel portrays his campaign against Gawker as a kind of public interest litigationI can defend myself Thiel told the Times on Wednesday Most of the people they attack are not people in my category They usually attack less prominent far less wealthy people that simply cant defend themselves Thiel added that even someone like Terry Bollea who is a millionaire and famous and a successful person didnt quite have the resources to do this aloneI dont expect to make any money from this Thiel added This is not a business ventureWhether or not you find Thiels specific complaints about Gawker persuasive the larger problem is that this kind of tactic systematically shifts power from the media to wealthy people Wealthy people can use this kind of thirdparty lawsuit to inflict harm on publications that anger them whether or not their lawsuits ultimate prove meritorious And that in turn will put pressure on publications to tread lightly when reporting on wealthy peopleUpdate I changed the section on Mother Jones to make clear that the 25 million cost of the lawsuit was born by Mother Joness insurance company as well as Mother Jones itself
