By wmwadmin on November 6 2016 Darkmoon  Nov 6 2016 RT  Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special released late yesterday courtesy of Dartmouth Films Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year LD  Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American Assange says that Trump cannot be allowed to win Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions Recent news reports reveal that election related violence is increasing and Rightwing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton steals the election as they fear will happen If Hillary Clinton wins this election as Assange predicts we can expect riots to erupt all across America Violent insurrection in the circumstances of a rigged election would appear to be more than justified Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars not in the White House LD John Pilger left conducted the 25minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself Click to enlarge THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger Whats the significance of the FBIs intervention in these last days of the US election campaign in the case against Hillary Clinton Julian Assange If you look at the history of the FBI it has become effectively Americas political police The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress Almost noone is untouchable The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that noone can resist us But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIs investigation so theres anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak Weve published about 33000 of Clintons emails when she was Secretary of State They come from a batch of just over 60000 emails of which Clinton has kept about half  30000  to herself and weve published about half Then there are the Podesta emails weve been publishing John Podesta is Hillary Clintons primary campaign manager so theres a thread that runs through all these emails there are quite a lot of payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks PILGER  The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails ASSANGE  The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neoMcCarthy hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything Hilary Clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications That is false we can say that the Russian government is not the source Saudi Arabia  Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton PILGER  The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically are quite extraordinary Im thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque ASSANGE  And twelve million dollars from Morocco  PILGER  Twelve million from Morocco yeah ASSANGE  For Hillary Clinton to attend a party PILGER  In terms of the foreign policy of the United States thats where the emails are most revealing where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism of ISIL in the Middle East Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL are actually those who have helped create it ASSANGE  Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton not so long after she left the State Department to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation Even the US government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL or ISIS But the dodge has always been that well its just some rogue Princes using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves But that email says that no it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS PILGER  The Saudis the Qataris the Moroccans the Bahrainis particularly the Saudis and the Qataris are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales particularly to Saudi Arabia ASSANGE  Under Hillary Clinton the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia worth more than 80 billion In fact during her tenure as Secretary of State total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value doubled PILGER  Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation ASSANGE  Yes PILGER  Thats extraordinary Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition ASSANGE  I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network Shes a centralising cog Youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis Shes the centraliser that interconnects all these different cogs Shes the smooth central representation of all that and all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States Its what we call the establishment or the DC consensus One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank This is quite amazing PILGER  Didnt Citybank supply a list  ASSANGE  Yes PILGER  Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet ASSANGE  Yes PILGER  So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States ASSANGE  If you were following the Obama campaign back then closely you could see it had become very close to banking interests So I think you cant properly understand Hillary Clintons foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate Libya is Hillary Clintons war PILGER  Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us  told you  about what happened there Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria the ISIL jihadism and so on And it was almost Hillary Clintons invasion What do the emails tell us about that ASSANGE  Libya more than anyone elses war was Hillary Clintons war Barak Obama initially opposed it Who was the person championing it Hillary Clinton Thats documented throughout her emails She had put her favoured agent Sidney Blumenthal on to that theres more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that weve published just about Libya Its not that Libya has cheap oil She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state  something that she would use in her runup to the general election for President So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state which resulted in around 40000 deaths within Libya jihadists moved in ISIS moved in leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis Not only did you have people fleeing Libya people fleeing Syria the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa So all problems economic problems and civil war in Africa  previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean That was said explicitly at the time back in early 2011 by Gaddafi What do these Europeans think theyre doing trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State Theres going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe and this is exactly what happened Trump wont be permitted to win PILGER  You get complaints from people saying What is WikiLeaks doing Are they trying to put Trump in the White House ASSANGE  My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win Why do I say that Because hes had every establishment off side Trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind Hillary Clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves PILGER  There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians Some people say Well why doesnt WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia ASSANGE  We have published about 800000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia Most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia most of which are critical Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia which they use our documents to back up PILGER  Do you yourself take a view of the US election Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump ASSANGE  Lets talk about Donald Trump What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind He represents American white trash which Hillary Clinton called deplorable and irredeemable It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan urbane perspective these people are like the red necks and you can never deal with them Because he so clearly  through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies  represents people who are not the middle not the upper middle educated class there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way including any criticism of Hillary Clinton If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power that makes absolute sense US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status PILGER  Id like to talk about Ecuador the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where were doing this interview in the Embassy for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the US election campaign Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuadors support for you ASSANGE  Lets let go back four years I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy because of the US extradition case and the result was that after a month I was successful in my asylum application The embassy since then has been surrounded by police quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than 126 million They admitted that over a year ago Now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds  so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador a country of sixteen million people and the United Kingdom and the Americans who have been helping on the side So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do Now we have the US election campaign the Ecuadorian election is in February next year and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador we publish from France we publish from from Germany we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status and this is this is really intolerable It means that they are trying to get at a publishing organisation they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election PILGER  Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy ASSANGE  I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden In Sweden I am not charged I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne We were not certain exactly what would happen there but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the US has requested since at least 2000 So over the last fifteen years every single person the US has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited and they refuse to provide a guarantee that wont happen PILGER  People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here ASSANGE  Look one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable They adapt and start to tolerate abuses they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses they adapt to adversity and they continue on So in my situation frankly Im a bit institutionalised  this the embassy is the world  its visually the world for me PILGER  Its the world without sunlight for one thing isnt it ASSANGE  Its the world without sunlight but I havent seen sunlight in so long I dont remember it PILGER  Yes ASSANGE  So  yes you adapt The one real irritant is that my young children  they also adapt They adapt to being without their father Thats a hard hard adaption which they didnt ask for PILGER  Do you worry about them ASSANGE  Yes I worry about them I worry about their mother I am innocent and in arbitrary detention PILGER  Some people would say Well why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden ASSANGE  The UN the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has looked into this whole situation They spent eighteen months in formal adversarial litigation So its me and the UN verses Sweden and the UK Whos right The UN made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden and that those countries must obey It is an illegal abuse It is the United Nations formally asking Whats going on here What is your legal explanation for this Assange says that you should recognise his asylum And here is Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say No were not going to recognise the UN ruling so leaving open their ability to extradite I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press because it doesnt suit the Western establishment narrative  that yes the West has political prisoners its a reality its not just me theres a bunch of other people as well The West has political prisoners Of course no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons political prisoners They dont call them political prisoners in China they dont call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the United States UK or Sweden it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of selfperception ASSANGE  Here we have a case the Swedish case where I have never been charged with a crime where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum Those are the facts but what is the rhetoric PILGER  Yes its different ASSANGE  The rhetoric is pretending constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes I am subject to persecution by the United States
