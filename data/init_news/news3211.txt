Obama On Climate Change I Actually Think Were Going To Solve This ThingI actually think were going to solve this thingThats what President Obama said in a news conference just before he left a United Nations summit on climate changeClimate change is a massive problem Obama said It is a generational problem Its a problem that by definition is just about the hardest thing for a political system to absorb because the effects are gradual theyre diffused And yet despite all that  Im optimistic I think were going to solve itJust a few years ago Obama said nobody would have predicted that more than 150 leaders would come to Paris holding plans to cut greenhouse gas emissionsAll of this will be hard Obama said Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard  but Im convinced that were going to get big things done hereObama leaves the conference but his deputies will remain in Paris in an effort to craft a global legally binding agreement intended to curb climate change The big goal to keep the global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees CelsiusAt the moment if you add up all the commitments on the table at the summit and assume that they would be met the temperature would still rise by 27 degrees Obama saidThats too high Obama said But what we expect is that well hit these targets faster than expected and  we could pick up the paceObama said that is not just foolish optimism but an expectation based on past experience The United States for example was able to meet its goals faster than expectedThe key here is to set up the structure so were sending signals all around the world that says this is happening and were not turning around Obama saidObama touched on a whole host of other issues during the conference Here are a couple of highlights Obama says that the fact that the peace process for Syria is progressing in Vienna is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin realizes there is not going to be a military solution to the situation in SyriaEventually Obama said he expects the Russians to shift their focus in Syria from trying to prop up the regime of Bashar Assad to fighting the Islamic StateI think Mr Putin understands that for him to get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he is looking for Obama saidIn other words Obama said both the US and Russia agree that the only lasting solution in Syria will be politicalWhere we continue to have an ongoing difference is not in the need for a political settlement its whether Assad can continue to serve as president as that transition goes on Obama saidRussia believes Assad should play a role and Obama believes that it is impossible for Mr Assad to bring that country together On the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Obama said Congress should act Just as the country takes huge costly steps to fight terrorism it has to take steps to reduce gun homicidesAt the end of the day Congress states local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we are preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies from getting weapons that magnify the damage that they can do Obama saidEarlier in the day President Obama urged Turkey and Russia to ease tensions by focusing on a common enemy the Islamic StateThe relationship between the two countries has been frayed since Turkey downed a Russian jet in November Turkey has refused to apologize saying the Russian warplane crossed over into Turkish airspace Russia has implemented a series of sanctionsReuters reports that Obama said the United States supported Turkeys right to defend its airspace but he also urged the two countries to deescalate tensionsWe all have a common enemy That is ISIL Obama said using an acronym for the Islamic State according to the AP I want to make sure that we focus on that threat
