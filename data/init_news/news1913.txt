In President Obamasinterview with Matt Yglesias on foreign policy he did something interesting when pressed on how he squares support for human rights with a foreign policy that has included a number of alliances with dictators Obama said that the US could only do so much and that sometimes he has to recognize the world as it is and make practical tradeoffs And he said The trajectory of this planet overall is one toward less violence more tolerance less strife less povertyOn the surface it seemed like a dodge an argument that the US doesnt have to worry too much about promoting democracy and human rights which will arise naturally But Obama returned to this point at the very end of the interview and said something thats crucial to understanding his worldview and the role he sees American foreign policy playing in the worldObamas point here is that the arc of history bends naturally toward democracy and human rights and that the best thing the US can do is not to solve every crisis individually  which can sometimes make things worse  but rather to help bend that arc in the right direction globallyThe world is in the long view getting much better for human beings people are healthier freer and safer than theyve ever been and those trends are holding The best thing the United States can do for the world Obama thinks is strengthen the forces that drive this progressIn this long view of foreign policy the best weapon in the war for human rights and democracy isnt the US military or economic sanctions its the forces of human progress themselvesThat the world is getting much better is at this point an undeniable fact People live longer and healthier lives than they ever have Deaths from war are at an alltime low After the Cold War ended democracy spread rapidly and is now the dominant form of government worldwideBut Obama also has a theory of why humanity has gotten better Modern creations like the global economy a USled global network of alliances and international institutions like the UN in this thinking all work together to in the aggregate reduce suffering and promote freedomObama lays this out in one paragraph right at the beginning of the interview Its the golden ticket to understanding everything he says later onI think it is realistic for us to want to use diplomacy for setting up a rulesbased system wherever we can understanding that its not always going to work If we have arms treaties in place it doesnt mean that you dont have a stray like North Korea that may try to do its own thing But youve reduced the number of problems that you have and the security and defense challenges that you face if you can create those norms And one of the great things about American foreign policy in the postWorld War II era was that we did a pretty good job with that It wasnt perfect but the UN the IMF and a whole host of treaties and rules and norms that were established really helped to stabilize the world in ways that it wouldnt otherwise beThere are two things to understand how boringsounding international institutions can help accelerate the forces of history like this First institutions provide material things  medicine financial assistance economic growth  that make peoples lives longer and richer Second they deter and coopt bad actors and encourage what you might call good international behaviorThe Americanled alliance system for example deters aggression in Europe and East Asia Russias bad behavior in eastern Europe likely would have been a lot worse if NATO didnt exist to deter it for example or if the EU didnt exist to organize sanctions More broadly the everexpanding webs of international trade ties and political organizations such as the EU make war costly and cooperation with the global community more desirable By making wars more costly institutions help protect the spread of democracy which in turn further reduces the likelihood of war because democracies tend not to fight each otherThe United States is far from the only player in these international institutions by their very nature but as the single most powerful and most important member the US has been crucial to bringing other countries on board and helping to enforce and maintain that liberal international systemOf course you cant credit international institutions alone for the spread of prosperity and democracy these are huge complicated historical phenomena with lots of causes But Obama is quite right to say that the design of the postWorld War II international order and its expansion after the end of the Cold War have helped protect and encourage the longterm historical trendsThats fine for the long view but Obama also has to manage foreign policy now daytoday And on that view it can look like hes significantly less active on global human rights Obama hasnt seriously challenged Chinese authoritarianism or Saudi theocracy Iran and Russia pose major threats to stability in Europe and the Middle East And North Korea is still North KoreaIn the Vox interview Obamas direct response to this line of criticism is pretty weak the Internet will fix it I am a firm believer that particularly in this modern internet age the capacity of the oldstyle authoritarian government to sustain itself and to thrive just is going to continue to weaken he saidStill his longerview implicit argument is a great deal stronger the best way to deal with authoritarianism in the long run is to build up the global institutions that have accelerated positive trends worldwide  and to prevent other countries from weakening those institutions and trendsChina is a good example of this As a rising power that has been at times hostile to Western power it was widely expected to challenge the USdominated global order  potentially catastrophically  and in some cases it has But since 2008 the country has generally worked within and even endorsed that international system This was mostly out of selfinterest but the Obama administration has worked to make sure that Chinas selfinterest and that of the international system lined up The result has been China buying into those positive trends of the status quo rather than overturning themFor example China helped the United States and global economic institutions rescue the global economy after 2008 by refraining from turning to trade protectionism According to Tufts Fletcher School Professor Dan Drezner thats evidence that China is not proposing a serious challenge to what the liberal international order looks like China benefits from a fairly open international trading regime and would suffer if security competition with the United States ramped upRoping China into these systems demonstrates Obamas strategy in action Throughout the interview he mentions the need to get China on board with helping maintain global institutions youve got to step up and help us underwrite these global rules that in fact help to facilitate your rise he says addressing Chinas leadersObama has attempted to integrate other bad actors into the global system to make them less likely to cause trouble The opening to Cuba is the clearest example but so too are his overtures to Iran on nukes and the original if illfated Russia reset We cant guarantee that Iran makes a rational decision on nukes any more than we can guarantee Russia and Mr Putin make rational decisions about something like Ukraine he said But weve also got to see whether things like diplomacy things like economic sanctions things like international pressure and international norms will in fact make a differenceAnd while these bad actors are coopted or contained by sanctions or international isolation the rest of the world will continue to improve bringing more states into the global system and depriving its enemies of potential allies Thatll make it harder for these states to sustain aggressive foreign policies  and even brutal repression at home  in the face of longrun international pressureThis longrun vision is in many wells quite compelling But it doesnt do a whole lot for protestors in Hong Kong Saudi women demanding the right to drive or Ukrainians gunned down by Russian troops in Donbas What about abuses that are happening nowThats where Obamas recognition of Americas policy limits kick in Yglesias calls this Obamas Undoctrine avoid costly and counterproductive mistakes particularly military ones In the area of human rights that means avoiding ostentatious pressure that might backfireFor instance Obama avoided openly embracing Irans green protest movement in 2009 and hes kept support for the Syrian rebels to a relative minimum Thats because in a lot of these cases Obama thinks highprofile American statements or actions can backfireInstead Obama argues we have to take human rights wins where can get them Not every issue is amenable to American pressure or direct action Our successes will happen in fits and starts and sometimes theres going to be a breakthrough and sometimes youll just modestly make things a little better he saysThis may not always be a satisfying approach to spreading human rights  longviews rarely are  but it has the virtue of being a smart one
