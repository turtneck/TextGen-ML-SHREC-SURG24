The Clinton campaign blasted the FBI director James Comey for jawdropping double standards on Monday after claims that he had sought to withhold evidence of Russian support for Donald Trump for fear of influencing next weeks US electionIn a sharp escalation of their unprecedented war of words with federal law enforcement authorities Clintons key aides contrasted this apparent caution with Comeys controversial decision to release new details of its investigation into Clintons private email server to lawmakers on FridayIt is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard her campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters claiming the decision defied all logic especially as other intelligence agencies had favoured disclosure of suspected Russian involvementThrough these two decisions he shows he favours acting alone and without consulting  these are not the hallmarks of a responsible investigation added MookBoth CNBC and the Huffington Post have reported that Comey privately urged against naming Russia for allegedly meddling in the election and hacking Democratic email accountsThough this advice has not been confirmed officially it tallies with the fact the FBIs name did not appear on a list of US intelligence agencies supporting the allegationsA foreign power was trying to undermine the election He believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election one former official told CNBC Comeys position this official reportedly said was If it is said it shouldnt come from the FBI which as youll recall it did notThe Clinton campaign called on Comey to immediately explain this incongruenceHe has set the standard for narrating a playbyplay added spokesman Brian Fallon If that is his way of handling things he needs to take the same approach to the Trump campaignOn Monday night NBC News reported that the FBI was conducting a preliminary inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manaforts business ties to Russia though it was not yet a criminal investigation Manafort called the report an outrageous smear being driven by Harry Reid and the Clinton campaignEarlier the White House highlighted concerns over the FBI directors decision to announce that the bureau was examining whether newly discovered emails may be relevant to its investigation of Clintons use of a private email serverPress secretary Josh Earnest was careful to say that Comey is regarded by Barack Obama as a man of integrity and principle But he also noted the importance of longstanding tradition and practice and norms and warned of the risk of communicating with CongressComey has faced a fierce backlash for going public with the new FBI investigation just 11 days before a presidential election reportedly against the advice and guidelines of the attorney general Loretta Lynch and other senior figures at the Department of Justice On Sunday the FBI obtained a search warrant to begin reviewing the emails reportedly numbering 650000 and found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma AbedinOn Monday a spokesman for the Office of Special Counsel indicated that the independent federal agency may be investigating Comey over an alleged violation of the Hatch Act which guards against federal officials seeking to influence an electionAn emboldened Trump has described the revelation as bigger than Watergate but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race A Morning ConsultPolitico poll carried out after the announcement put Clinton three points ahead while a CBSYouGov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1 of Clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequenceTrump claimed on Monday that the FBI had stumbled across a digital mother lode and predicted they would discover missing workrelated emails that had been deleted from Clintons computersSix hundred and fifty thousand emails  I think you are going to find the 33000 that are missing he told supporters in Michigan I think we hit the mother lode as they say in the mining industryTrump urged Comey to resist political pressure Hes gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing but he did the right thing he told the Grand Rapids rally I was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputationIt took guts for Director Comey to do what he did he added to chants of lock her up from the crowdTrump has seized on signs of momentum to push into oncesafe Democratic territory in the industrial midwest He was also due to speak in Warren in Michigan on Monday before appearing with running mate Mike Pence in Eau Claire Wisconsin on TuesdayUntil his polling gap began to narrow again last week Trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states while Clinton eyed Republican territory in Utah Arizona and Georgia Renewed optimism among Republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground particularly as Trumps economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing linesMichigan and Wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for Clinton in the Democratic primary when large numbers of bluecollar workers favoured Bernie Sanders Signs of Democratic nervousness in Wisconsin became apparent last week when the Clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz Sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for Clinton in the state on WednesdayThe impact of early voting may also be forcing Trump to look further afield States such as a North Carolina have seen heavy early turnout among Democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from ClintonIf he cannot win North Carolina but picks up Florida and Ohio Trumps best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like Michigan and Wisconsin or in the northeast New Hampshire Pennsylvania and MaineClinton is redoubling her efforts Two stops on Monday in Ohio were to be followed by three in Florida on Tuesday and another swing to North Carolina later in the weekMost people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this she told a rally in Ohio on Monday Now what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commanderinchiefI am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and its a good a question she said to boos from a young crowd at Kent State University By all mean they should look at the emails and I am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails there is no caseMeanwhile Clinton suffered another blow from a separate source the ongoing WikiLeaks release of emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta The latest batch appeared to show that Donna Brazile the interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a CNN contributor gave Clinton a heads up about a likely debate question the day before she was due to take on Sanders in a primary debateCNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions prep material attendee list background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debateBrazile has subsequently announced her resignation from CNN
