What happened in this election By John Chuckman   John Chuckman Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis there are some observations which deserve attention These unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy enlightenment and progressivity The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever and better than has been generally been recognized that America is indeed a plutocracy It took a genuine American Oligarch a multibillionaire a man with a lifetimes economic empirebuilding to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically wellconnected a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well everflowing with money for their ambitions It was the everflowing well of money drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends such as Jeffrey Epstein that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalshipalthough Bill in his heyday displayed some of both of thosethat earned the Clintons their place it was the money the mothers milk of politics In what is euphemistically called fund raising many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clintons efforts Hillary fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence She lacked Bills superficial charm but she certainly more than shared his ambition On the charm front when she was ready to move into running for office she adopted perhaps under Bills tutelage a kind of forced clown face with arched eyebrows buggedout eyes and a smile as big as her lips would allow and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helterskelter whenever she campaigned Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant These were not natural for her They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife both in a governors mansion and later in the White House bizarre because she indulged her husbands nonstop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politicianhusband Anyway Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics She determined to build a political war chest long ago and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view as when running for the Senate when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable She was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money embarrassingly large amounts In her years of speaking engagements she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees Later in the influential appointed post of Secretary of Statecoming as it does into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed bigtime international schemershe unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all Covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family values public prayer and catering to the Christian Right and antiflag burning Constitutional amendments and now it is truly out of gas That is precisely why a political outsider like Oligarch Trump could manage to hijack the party He was opposed by tired boring men like Jeb Bush seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency and a dark intensely unlikable phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz and it proved to be no contest It was a remarkable political achievement but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party The Republican Party had been given a breather some new life by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s He had an extremely mixed record as president but he was popular held in some affection and did have a clear vision but his effect on the party was not lasting Trump could be seen as another Reagan but I think the comparison is superficial Trump literally hijacked the party and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincolns candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors including the Whigs and FreeSoil Democrats Parties do not last forever and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed The press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented His most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the neocon wars Hillary vigorously embraced and would expand But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble too It has a great deal of internal rot as the WikiLeaks material from the DNC clearly shows us Arrogance lack of direction ignorance of the people it has always claimed to serve bad decisionmaking and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot She has always had strong negatives in polling always been rightly suspected concerning her honesty The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts including harsh highlevel judgments of Hillarys decisionmaking resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run And frankly she had become for many a rather tiresome usedup figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected But they not only blindly supported her they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender Bernie Sanders Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy outofhand After all there were Bill and Hillary beckoning to their running well of money In hindsight it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination He proved a weak individual in the end giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down He may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the Clintons since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward But in any event there he was out on the hustings supporting everything he ever opposed personified in Hillary Clinton Men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive corporations a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat The numbers are unmistakable Yes Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure but Hillary simply did badly not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a wellliked figure and the party blundered badly in running her But again money talks and the Clintons particularly Bill are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money Now to many Americans the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution although a revolution conducted through ballots any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive militarysecurity state In a way it does represent something of a revolutionary event owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views And as in any revolution even a small one there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come Lyndon Johnson lifelong crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president Franklin Roosevelt son of wealthy establishment figures provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression restoring hopes and dreams for millions Change important change never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality I have some limited but important hopes for Trump I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person and after the experience of Obama who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing bloody disappointment I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician And what was the choice anyway Hillary Clinton was a boughtandpaid oneway ticket to hell Trump offers two areas of some hope and these both represent real change The first is in reducing Americas close to outofcontrol military aggressiveness abroad This aggressiveness reflecting momentum from what can only be called the CheneyRumsfeld presidency continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as secretary of state Hillary the feminists who weep for her should be reminded did a lot of killing during her tenure She along with Obama are literally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of women and their families many of them literally torn apart by bombs The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary American people themselves who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades George Bushs lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina before he was internationally shamed into some action has become the normal pattern for Americas national government when it comes to ordinary Americans The truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role in the Democratic Party and of course never did in the Republican Party By welfare I do not mean the kind of state assistance that Bill Clinton himself worked to end Nothing can impress someone not familiar with Americas dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicagos South Side parts of New Orleans or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes No I mean the peoples general wellbeing Trumps approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs I dont know whether he can succeed but just as he asked people in some of his speeches What do you have to lose Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the deplorables is a small gain People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary His record as presidentapart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runswas actually pretty appalling He in his own words ended welfare as we know it He signed legislation which would send large numbers of young black men to prison He also signed legislation which contributed to the countrys later financial collapse under George Bush He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off leaving them dangling when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming His FBI conducted the assault on Waco killing about eighty people needlessly A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason There were a number of scandals including the suicide of Vince Foster and the socalled Travelgate affair which were never fully explained to the public It was his secretary of state Madeleine Albright who answered unblinkingly a television interviewers question about tens of thousands of Iraqi children who died owing to Americas embargo We think its worth it He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government the order secretly went out to shut up about it No effort was made to intervene No any real change in
