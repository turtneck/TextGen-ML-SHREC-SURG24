Around the world markets are in chaos Japans stock market plunged 5 percent on Friday while markets in France Germany and the UK all saw big losses on Thursday The US stock market is doing better than most but it is also down since the start of the year Oil hit a new low on Thursday of 26 per barrelThese declines reflect growing concerns that the world economy is headed for another recession Before 2007 wed say If things get bad the Fed will cut interest rates But with the Feds benchmark rate below 05 percent already a substantial cut would mean rates that are below zero Thats an unorthodox strategy and it might not even be legal according to testimony by Fed Chair Janet Yellen before congressional committees this weekThe Fed needs a new strategy Stop targeting interest rates and instead target the growth of the overall economy Moving away from interest rate targeting would give markets confidence that the Fed has the tools to deal with the next economic downturn which would reduce the danger of another 2008style meltdownUnfortunately theres little sign that the Fed is laying the groundwork for a shift in strategy Instead Yellen seemed to be in denial about the magnitude of the challenge she is facingLets remember that the labor market is continuing to perform well she said to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday We want to be careful not to jump to a conclusion about what is in store for the economy Maybe not  but the Fed needs to be prepared for the worstThe Fed needs to change their fundamental approach argues Scott Sumner a monetary policy expert at the Mercatus Center Right now the Feds policy discussions are all about where to set shortterm interest rates But not only does that approach stop working when interest rates fall to zero  as they did in 2008  but interest rates arent even what people actually care aboutInstead Sumner argues the Fed should start directly targeting a variable people do care about either the inflation rate or even better the total amount of spending in the economy He argues that the Fed should focus on setting longrun goals for these variables and then doing whatever it takes to meet those goalsThe Fed currently has an official target of 2 percent inflation But the central banks actions make it clear that its not serious about this target Last December for example the Feds own forecast showed that inflation would be around 16 percent in 2016  and the forecast inflation rate had actually been falling Yet the Fed raised interest rates anyway That was a pretty clear signal to the markets that the Fed cared more about returning to normal interest rates than it did about achieving its inflation targetThe problem isnt just that the economy will grow a little bit slower in early 2016 than it could have otherwise By ignoring its own targets the Fed sent a message that it wasnt really committed to robust growth over the long run which undermines businesses confidence in the recovery and discourages investmentThe solution Sumner argues is for the Fed to use a strategy called level targeting to make its own targets more credible Under a level targeting regime the Fed would compensate for missing its target in one year by overshooting the following year For example in 2015 the Feds preferred measure of inflation came in at 14 percent  06 percent below the Feds 2 percent target Under level targeting the Fed would aim to achieve 26 percent inflation in 2016 delivering 2 percent inflation on average in 2015 to 2016 That would not only support faster economic growth in 2016 it would also give the markets more confidence in the Feds forecasts for 2017 2018 and beyondAbandoning interest rate targeting might seem radical but the Fed has actually done it once before in the late 1970s Back then it seemed that no matter how high the Fed raised interest rates it couldnt get inflation under control So in 1979 the Fed stopped targeting interest rates altogetherInstead it simply set a target for the total amount of money in the economy Fed Chair Paul Volcker knew that if the amount of money in circulation stopped rising the inflation rate would eventually have to stop rising too It took a couple of years and helped induce a major recession in 1980 but it workedA big reason the strategy worked is that markets believed Volcker was serious about the target Targeting the money supply directly signaled he was willing to let interest rates go as high as they had to in order to get inflation under control Once markets believed he was serious they started doing a lot of his work for him  and businesses began to curtail price increases in the expectation that the overall inflation rate was going to declineToday were facing the reverse situation A big reason the economy has been recovering so slowly is that businesses are worried about sluggish growth  or worse another 2008style meltdown  in the coming years So theyve been reluctant to invest making slow growth a selffulfilling prophecyIf the Fed can convince businesses that its serious about delivering consistent growth businesses will start investing more in the expectation that demand for their products will grow  and that investment will itself produce growthLevel targeting is a strategy for giving the market more confidence in the Feds longterm targets And while inflationbased level targeting would work better than what were doing now Sumner argues that the best strategy would be to target the total amount of spending in the economy This approach known as nominal GDP targeting has been endorsed by prominent economists such as Christina RomerThere are two big problems with the Feds current strategy of focusing on interest rates The obvious one is that once rates hit zero the conventional approach to monetary policy becomes ineffective After rates hit zero in 2008 the Fed was forced to use an ad hoc strategy known as quantitative easing to pump more money into the economy Lacking experience with this new strategy the Fed twice made the mistake of ending easing too early slowing the economic recovery between 2010 and 2012The larger problem with zero interest rates however is politics People are used to thinking of low interest rates as a sign of easy money and vice versa so the zero interest rate struck many as a sign of recklessly easy monetary policy In the years after the financial crisis critics warned that Fed policies would create runaway inflationIn retrospect its clear that these concerns were unfounded The average inflation rate since 2008 has been well below the Feds 2 percent target while the economy has suffered from persistently slow job and wage growth But fear of a political backlash for doing too much discouraged Yellens predecessor Ben Bernanke from acting decisively to promote economic growthMore recently the Fed has come under a lot of pressure to normalize  that is raise  rates above zero percent After resisting these pressures for most of 2015 the central bank finally pulled the trigger in December boosting its target rate from zero percent to 025 percent It did this despite the fact that  as Voxs Matt Yglesias pointed out at the time  most economic indicators suggested that a rate hike would do more harm than goodThis is the flip side of the situation the Fed faced in the 1970s Because interest rates were high many people thought monetary policy was too tight and the Fed faced a lot of pressure to cut rates But cutting rates triggered another wave of inflation forcing the Fed to raise rates once again Interest rate targets had become a distraction and abandoning them helped Volcker focus on the variable he really cared about inflationNegative interest rates are one way the Fed could try to salvage the current regime of focusing on interest rates But its not a very good oneJust as you might have a savings account with your bank so a nations banks all have accounts with their nations central bank The money deposited in these accounts is called reserves and in recent years a lot of banks around the world have chosen to build up huge reserve war chests Thats frustrating to central bankers who have been trying to encourage banks to stimulate economic activity by lending out the moneySo recently Japans central bank and some central banks in Europe have been experimenting with negative interest rates on reserves Last month the Japanese central bank announced that banks would be assessed a 01 percent penalty on their reserves  an interest rate of 01 percent A bank with a billion yen deposited with the Bank of Japan will now have to pay 1 million yen per year for the privilegeObviously 01 percent is not a very big number so the direct effects of Japans new policy wont be very large But going negative breaks through an important psychological barrier  once a central bank has instituted a slightly negative interest rate its more likely to cut rates further in the futureIn her testimony before Congress this week Yellen was pressed on whether the Fed would follow its European and Japanese counterparts and impose a penalty on reserves Yellen demurred saying that the Feds experts were still studying whether negative interest rates would be legal and technically feasibleBut even if the Fed ultimately decides to adopt negative rates there are real limits on how far they can go If negative interest rates get too steep banks have an obvious alternative They can get physical cash and store it in a big warehouse By definition cash is worth as many dollars a year from now as it is todayThere are a couple of ways central banks could try to make negative interest rates more feasible University of Michigan economist Miles Kimball for example advocates a shift to a new form of electronic money that would allow central banks to impose economywide negative interest rates Others argue that the Fed should raise its inflation target so that real inflationadjusted interest rates can go lower But not only do both of these approaches have technical challenges theyre also likely to be intensely unpopular with votersSo even if the Fed adopted negative rates it wouldnt improve the effectiveness of the current interest rate targeting regime very much Just as the Fed got stuck at zero percent interest rates in 2008 it could get stuck at 1 percent interest rates in 2017 or 2018 So the Fed is going to need a new framework thats less dependent on interest rates regardless It might as well get started
