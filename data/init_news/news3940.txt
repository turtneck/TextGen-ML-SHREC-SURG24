Mitch McConnell has decided to wager the Republican majority in the Senate on blocking Barack Obamas pick for the Supreme CourtIts a bold and understandable gambit designed to prevent a leftward lurch in jurisprudence after Antonin Scalias unexpected death this weekend but it could backfire badlyAssuming the president picks a Hispanic African American or Asian American  bonus points if shes a woman  this could be exactly what Democrats need to reactivate the Obama coalition that fueled his victories in 2008 and 2012 Even if he does not go with a minority candidate the cases on the docket will galvanize voters who are traditionally less likely to turn outGet your campaign fix delivered directly to your email inbox withThe Daily 202Last night in Las Vegas for example Hillary Clinton said it would be nakedly partisan and unconscionable if Republicans dont give a hearing to the presidents nominee And she emphasized the immigration case that the justices recently agreed to hear Because of his passing there will be most likely a tie four to four on important issues that affect so many people in our country the Democratic frontrunner said And the most important is the decision about President Obamas actions under DACA and DAPA If there is no new justice appointed then as with other cases before the court the decision that was decided will stay in place And that was a bad decisionKeep in mind that a quarter of Nevadas population is Hispanic Beyond being a battleground in the presidential race there is also an open Senate race to succeed Harry Reid Democrats will nominate a Latina and Republicans will nominate a white guy who is already in CongressOr take abortion rights Marco Rubio is against abortion even in cases of rape and incest For women the prospect of Roe v Wade being overturned just became much more real When Im president of the United States Ill nominate someone like Justice Scalia the Florida senator declared on the Sunday showsAnd environmentalists just this month saw the court put a stay on Obamas Clean Power Plan The next justice will be the swing vote who determines the future of coal in the United States Though these sorts of cases mean that business interests will pour more money than ever into 2016 races it could also help Democrats attract crucial suburban women who might lean to the rightbut worry about global warmingMore broadly this could also undermine efforts by Senate Republicans to show that they are capable of governing and not just the party of no Make no mistake The upper chamber will grind to a standstill if the GOP follows through on this threat Democrats who are inclined to work with them promise to stop doing so if Republicans play hardball Ultimately though there is not really anything Democrats can do procedurally to force Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing on Obamas nominee The only lever they have is public pressureThe most potent pressure points are the seven GOP incumbents who are up for reelection this year in states Obama carried in 2012 New Hampshires Kelly Ayotte and Wisconsins Ron Johnson publicly came out in favor of obstruction yesterday The others are holding their cards close to the vest for right now Ohios Rob Portman praised Scalia but would not address the core issue Spokesmen for Pennsylvanias Pat Toomey declined to comment and Illinois Mark Kirk ignored inquiries per CNNPay particularly close attention to Portman who is already vulnerable and could be wiped out if African Americans make up the same percentage of the electorate in 2016 as they did in 2012 They are likelier to vote if they believe he is disrespecting the first black presidentI intend to continue to talk about this until the polls close former Ohio Gov Ted Strickland the Democratic candidate against Portman told my colleague Paul Kane yesterday Senator Portman who has your allegiance your country or your party leaders  The people have spoken on two occasions he added referring to Obamas 2008 and 2012 victories Conventional wisdom is that whichever party wins the White House in November will control the Senate Thats obviously the primary factor but were not convinced it will be determinative Democrats need to pick up four seats to win the Senate and its conceivable they could get those from states that Clinton would probably carry even if she loses the Electoral College In 2014 its worth recalling Democrats lost each of the seven seats they had to defend in states Mitt Romney had carried two years earlierAnd remember that this wont be happening in a vacuum If Obama knows for sure that his pick is not going to get formally considered he can go with someone who gives his party maximum political leverage to bludgeon these Republican incumbents Monica Mrquez is the first Latina and first openly gay justice on the Supreme Court in Colorado which will again be a crucial swing state Attorney General Loretta Lynch is an African American woman Lucy Koh is the first Asian American district judge in the Northern District of CaliforniaHe could also go with someone who was previously confirmed unanimously by the Senate to give additional rhetorical heft to his attacks that Republicans are being hypocrites Whats the Republican political calculus Blocking judges historically motivates their base  including donors and the US Chamber  more than it does liberals And they dont think independents will really care all that much It will just sound like more Washington noiseMcConnell not a favorite of the grassroots also needs to keep his own base ginned up Amidst a presidential primary it is untenable for Republicans to look like rubber stamps for ObamaChris Christie offers a cautionary tale for GOP members His bubble in New Hampshire was punctured when opponents began attacking him for offering support of Sonia Sotomayor while he was running for governor of New Jersey in 2008 Christie denied making comments he had made Allies and rivals agree that the Sotomayor hit was a turning point for his campaign Republicans who fear primary challenges such as Alabamas Richard Shelby are never going to back any Obama nomineeMost smart Republicans in DC still believe either Trump or Cruz would lose a general election Their hope is that a Supreme Court vacancy might help galvanize conservative volunteers to go do work for endangered Senate incumbents To be sure not every Democrat has a clean nose on this Harry Reid shortsightedly invoked the nuclear option in 2013 which allows nonSupreme court judges to be approved by a simple majority This incensed Republicans and only accelerated the upper chambers decline to be more like the unruly HouseLindsey Graham one of just two current GOP senators who voted to confirm Elena Kagan during Obamas first term tells The Post that Reid poisoned the well by going nuclear I voted for every Supreme Court justice nominated by Bush and Obama I believe the Senate should be deferential to qualified picks the South Carolina senator said But I did tell Harry Reid and the president that the consequence of changing the rules in the Senate to pack the court will come back to haunt themGeorge F Will also zeroes in on Reids use of the nuclear option in his column today which he describes as institutional vandalism He frames the battle this way Scalias death will enkindle a debate missing from this years presidential campaign a debate discomfiting for some conservatives Do they want a passive court that is deferential to legislative majorities and to presidents who claim untrammeled powers deriving from national majorities Or do they want a court actively engaged in defending libertys borders against unjustified encroachments by majorities The big question right now Will there even be a confirmation hearingMcConnells Saturday night statement declaring that the vacancy should be filled by the next president did not rule out the possibility of a confirmation hearing or floor time to consider whoever the president picksThat might be the more politically astute play since Republicans could slow walk the vetting trickle out negative revelations about the nominee to rightwing media outlets and then ultimately vote to reject the nomineeHaving hearings could give some cover to purple state Republicans to say they are doing their jobs If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing I think that is going to guarantee theyre going to lose control of the Senate said Patrick Leahy the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary CommitteePlus even if Obamas pick gets past the Judiciary Committee they will be hard pressed to get confirmed by the full Senate Fourteen Republicans would need to come out against Cruzs promised filibuster During Obamas first term when Democrats held a near supermajority only nine Republicans voted for Sotomayor and five voted for KaganGiven that the Senate is on a Presidents Day recess White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama will not rush out an announcement this week This gives both sides a few days to poll and focus group their optionsA former top adviser to the president says the GOP could have been savvier Another wildcard How will the press cover this One of the mainstream medias problems is a really short attention span What is unknowable today is whether this vacancy is a twoweek story a twomonth story or a 10month story Also is the narrative that Republicans are creating an unprecedented Constitutional crisis Or is it played as a boring hesaid hesaid storylineDemocrats note that Obama still has the bully pulpit so he can come up with creative ways to drive news coverage about the GOPs failure to bring his nominee up for a vote The party can also use paid media to target the vulnerable Republican incumbents For both sides it really is difficult to overstate the stakes Scalia left an indelible mark on both the court and our country for nearly three decades and his replacement could do the same Ironically if Clinton wins and Democrats retake the Senate after McConnell spends the year taking heat she will have a mandate to put the most progressive justice imaginable on the bench And Republicans will have no real grounds to oppose her For McConnell right now thats a risk worth takingTHE BUZZ AT THE CAPITOL Some hopeful Democrats now see the nomination of a sitting senator as the best chance Obama has to seat another justice on the Supreme Court before leaving office Juliet Eilperin and Paul Kane report There are several Senate Democrats who fit that description including Amy Klobuchar Minn Sheldon Whitehouse RI Christopher A Coons Del and Richard J Durbin Ill But individuals who have spoken with the White House about the nomination process  said the president is interested in a candidate who is young enough to serve an extended period of time Only two of those senators  Klobuchar at 55 and Coons at 52  are younger than 60 the age Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she was nominated But we hear that POTUS is more likely to go with someone who has already been confirmed and vetted Although Obama has installed fewer federal appellate judges than either Presidents Clinton or George W Bush he has put enough nominees on the bench that Democratic appointees are in the majority on nine of the nations 13 circuit courts Juliet and Paul note In that group the 9th Circuits Paul J Watford a 48yearold African American and Sri Srinivasan a 48yearold judge on US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who would be the first SouthAsian American on the Supreme Court would be the leading contenders Others include the DC Circuits Patricia Ann Millett 52 and Jane L Kelly 51 a judge on the 8th Circuit who was confirmed 96 to 0 with the support of Grassley What does the loss of Scalia mean for cases currently on the docket In the short term conservatives could still prevail on many of the cases before the court this term But the wins could come in the form of tie votes that preserve the status quo rather than provide precedents that will shape the future writes Robert Barnes our Supreme Court correspondentA big break for public employee unions At oral arguments the court seemed prepared to hand a significant defeat to organized labor and side with a group of California teachers who claim that their freespeech rights are violated when they are forced to pay dues to the states teachers union The courts conservatives  Scalia included  appeared ready to junk a 40yearold precedent that allows unions to collect an agency fee from nonmembers to support collectivebargaining activities for members and nonmembers alike But the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit citing that precedent had ruled for the union And with the Supreme Courts liberals seemingly united in upholding the precedent a 4to4 vote would mean the union victory would standThe law could be interpreted differently in different regions For instance a Texas law that imposes new restrictions on abortion providers was found constitutional by a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit A 4to4 tie would uphold that finding But a similar law in Wisconsin was struck down and would be unaffected by the courts tie in the Texas caseBarnes adds that if Republican leaders hold firm it will also affect which cases the justices choose to take up when the next term starts in October Read a breakdown of how four cases will likely be impacted here Chaos confusion and conflicting reports in the hours after Scalias death which happened during a blue quail hunting trip From Lana Straub Eva Ruth Moravec Sari Horwitz and Jerry Markon After his body was discovered it took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a justice of the peace When they did she pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body and decided not to order an autopsy A second justice of the peace who was called but couldnt get to Scalias body in time said she would have ordered an autopsy If it had been me  I would want to know Juanita Bishop a justice of the peace in Presidio Tex told The Washington Post in an interview SundaySome details of his final hours at the Cibolo Creek Ranch a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border remain opaque As late as Sunday afternoon there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy would be performed though officials later said Scalias body was being embalmed and there would be no autopsy One report by WFAATV in Dallas said the death certificate would show the cause

Theyre taking their firstintheSouth primary and we pick presidents to heart There is a seriousness here thats on display this timeOn the Sunday shows Trump focused on Cruz Justice John Roberts gave us Obamacare twice Trump said on ABC He could have ended Obamacare twice He got there because Ted Cruz pushed him like wild  Cruz shouldnt be talking because that was among the worst appointments Ive ever seen We have Obamacare because of Ted Cruz Jeb Bush and George Bush Trump also emphasized Cruzs personality No endorsements no support  hes a lone wolf Hes going to get nothing done hes not a leader hes never employed anybody never created a job Hes a nasty guy no matter how you figure it And Cruz focused on Trump If Donald Trump becomes president the Second Amendment will be written out

he wants to have a new system that would be quite challenging because you would have to give up the insurance you have now and it would cost a lot of money The goal is a good goal  I absolutely agree

immigration during previous races Watch here Debate rips open GOP wounds and party risks tearing itself apart by Robert Costa and Philip Rucker The GOP is at risk of tearing itself apart over its past as it heads into the thick of the primary season A day after a debate marked by personal petty exchanges Republicans were grappling with their core beliefs as well as the image they were broadcasting to the country  The increasingly harsh discussions of these and other issues amount to an existential crisis within the Republican Party and reflect the growing influence of nonideological populist voters Contenders are making their most concerted effort yet to stop Trump in South Carolina even though previous attempts to take him down have attained little The escalating quarreling may increase the likelihood of a long expensive and potentially futile effort  As the candidates returned to the campaign trail the mess they left behind on the stage of Greenvilles Peace Center had some party strategists wondering whether the damage may be politically irreparable What made the friendship between Scalia and Ginsburg work by Irin Carmon Nino and RBG the courts most famous odd couple friendship stood as an example of warmth and professionalism across traditional divides  The reserved Clinton appointee and the bombastic Reagan pick had vastly different views on the constitution and the role of the court And yet One former clerk told us Scalia was Ginsburgs favored souvenir shopping buddy when they traveled together On a trip to India they famously rode an elephant with Scalia sitting up front They shared New Years Eves with their families and friends In 2010 when Chief Justice Roberts announced Ginsburgs husband Martys death from the bench Scalia wiped tears from his eyes  Whether or not it was how Scalia saw it for Ginsburg their public friendship also made a statement about the court as an institution that it was strengthened by respectful debate that it could work no

dimensions risks erupting into a wider war Russian warplanes are bombing from the sky Iraqi and Lebanese militias aided by Iranian advisers are advancing on the ground An assortment of Syrian rebels backed by the United States Turkey Saudi Arabia and Qatar are fighting to hold them back Kurdish forces are taking advantage of the chaos while the Islamic State has snatched a couple of small villages  Syrias civil war long ago mutated into a proxy conflict with competing world powers backing the rival Syrian factions almost since the earliest days of the armed rebellion against President

latest one Three nuggets jumped outIndependents will see the 2016 election as a choice between the lesser of two evils This years Republican primary is the most rightward leaning since 1964 while Democrats have not been this far to the left since the 1972 campaign As the parties have become increasingly ideological Americans have drifted away from both of them Selfidentified independents are at near historic levels  In this period of profound alienation with both parties engaging in harsh ideological primaries the public is likely to view the entire political process as a race to the bottom They will be inclined to view their choice for president through the prism of which candidate is the least flawed and poses the least threat to their future wellbeingObamas approval rating is remarkably durable Since the summer of 2009 when these divisions began to intensify Obamas positive job approval ratings have remained flat never going below 40 or above 53 A closer look at these numbers shows the impact that age race and income have had on his ratings The narrow band reflects little movement from Obamas core supporters as well as steadfast opposition from his detractorsThe

end REVENGE OF THE POPULISTS is the headline on the front page of The State to describe the success of Trump and Sanders The Columbia SC newspaper searches for historical antecedents Trump rails against immigrants echoing the nativist mid1800s Know Nothing Party that grew out of fears that an influx of Catholic immigrants was threatening the American way of life Sanders outcry against banks

figure reputed to have underworld connections He was one of the worlds top five gamblers a whale in casino parlance willing to wager 10 million in a single gaming bender After his murder one unnamed executive told the paper that Kashiwagi had owed the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino 4 million  The story of Kashiwagi drawn from Trumps memoirs and news accounts from the day offers a revealing window into Trumps instincts It shows that Trump isnt just a onetime casino ownerhes also a gambler prone to impulsive even reckless action Trump is obsessed with winning a topic he usually brings up in the context of his merciless dealmaking style But a crucial question about any wouldbe president who may be confronted with questions of war and peace is his attitude toward risk Some presidents are highly averse to it  Others roll the dice The Atlantic The New Look of the PostObama Electorate by Theodore R Johnson In 2008 when thenSenator Barack Obama rode the highest black voter turnout in US history to the White House black voters felt The Look had been exchanged  African American voters felt that a black president could give them special attention and understand black Americas grievances better than any other It wasnt favoritism African Americans sought they simply wanted an acknowledgement that structural racism is real and some executive resolve to address it from the first president to have experienced it firsthand But things havent gone quite as they had hoped The welledup hope that racism would be a presidential priority and undergo an incremental process of amelioration began to slowly dissipate in the face of politics as usual  And frustration has given rise to a new generation of black voters and activists a generation who uses more overt and dynamic techniques to influence the political agendaThe New Yorker Can Cruz Beat Trump on Conservative Principles by Ryan Lizza Ted Cruz is the best political tactician in the Republican race But for all of Cruzs tactical successes so far he made one enormous mistake he misunderstood the threat posed by Trump By repeatedly praising Trump throughout 2015 Cruz did more than any other Republican to validate the realityTV star as a true conservative  Cruz the most wellfunded conservative stuck to his hugTrump strategy until just a few days before the Iowa caucuses At the CBS debate he tried desperately to undo that damage and his attempt to unmask Trump as a closet liberal led to the most fiery exchange of the evening And now there is a new accelerant to the CruzBush campaign to turn Trump into a liberal Antonin Scalias death For many ideological conservatives the makeup of the Supreme Court is the most important issue in America  and the success of Cruzs campaign may depend on that fight New
