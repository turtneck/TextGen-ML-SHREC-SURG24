Essentially everyone in Washington is freaking out about the blizzardBut for several weeks now many congressional Republicans have privately freaked out about the prospects of Donald Trump or to a lesser degree Sen Ted Cruz RTexas emerging as the partys standardbearer in the presidential sweepstakesThe theory is that both candidates are so polarizing that their electoral prospects will impale Republican candidates down the ballotLets start with the House The GOP currently holds a 246188 edge over Democrats The current vacant seat belonged to former House Speaker John Boehner ROhio and is expected to stay in Republican hands So for the sake of argument lets say its 247188 in favor of the GOP Democrats would have to flip a staggering net of 30 seats to reclaim control of the HouseDemocrats would be rapturous at the prospects of rankandfile Republicans having to defund Trump or Cruz  or run away from themDemocrats could probably put a substantial dent in that 30seat Republican margin But thats expected in a presidential election year Its just a question of how many more seats a Trump or Cruz candidacy could turn to Democratic controlBut make no mistake Knowledgeable sources on both sides of the aisle are clear that it would be almost impossible for Democrats to win back the House this cycle That net gain of 30 seats is just too high a bar The map favors RepublicansThere arent a lot of swing districts in which Democrats could steal a seat or two Nothing is ever out of the question But the likelihood of Democrats nabbing the House majority is low at this writingThe Senate however is another story Republicans already faced an uphill climb to retain their majority this fall The GOP must defend 24 seats Only 10 Democratic seats are up this cycle Plus its a presidential year And many of the Republican seats on the ballot are in purple states or states that President Obama won in 2008 and 2012For the GOP Sens Ron Johnson Wis Mark Kirk Ill Rob Portman Ohio Kelly Ayotte NH Pat Toomey Pa and Richard Burr NC are running in competitive states Democrats would also like to win the seat now held by GOP Florida Sen Marco Rubio who is running for president and not seeking reelection to the SenateDemocrats must also defend the seat of Sen Michael Bennet Colo and the seat of retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid NevadaColorado and Nevada are potential GOP pickups Republicans currently hold a 5446 advantage over the Democrats in the Senate two independent senators caucus with the DemocratsSo a net gain of five seats isnt out of the realm for Democrats Many political theorists think those seats in swing states could all tilt to the Democratic side if Trump or Cruz is the nomineeThis pariah status for Trump and Cruz is rare On Thursday a reporter asked Sen Lindsey Graham RSC whether he preferred Cruz over TrumpIts like being shot or poisoned It doesnt really matter replied Graham Donald Trump is the mostunprepared person Ive ever met to be commanderinchiefLast week House and Senate Republicans huddled jointly in Baltimore for their annual issues retreat Much of the conversation focused on an approach to fighting ISIS terrorism and polling Trump and Cruz werent thereBut their specter haunted the entire confab As a result Republican leaders tried to present a positive image and sidestep internecine battles that loom inside the partyWhat happens above us on the presidential campaign is out of our control So you try to control what you can control said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune SDWhen asked about the eventual nominee Thune left scribes with a lessthanconfident answer that spoke deeply to Republican divisionsHopefully well be able to sync up with their agenda he said about the nomineeHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise RLa sought to deflect inquiries about the GOP chasms and pivoted to fissures among DemocratsI think if you look at the fractures there are more on the Democratic side proffered Scalise Hillary Clinton hasnt been able to close the deal yet I think you are going to see a very united conventionThe mostprominent issue next to Trump and Cruz is the unity of Republicans heading into the convention Everyone seems to be talking about it  except for House Speaker Paul Ryan RWisThe speaker dismissed a reporters inquiry who asked if he thought the GOP would conduct a brokered conventionThats ridiculous Ryan protested How do I know I think thats ridiculous to talk about thatEven though people are talking about itAnd to hear Ryan and Scalise chatter everyone will be in lockstep come convention timeWere going to support whoever our nominee is because thats the Republican primary voters decision Ryan saidThats where Democrats think they have Republicans in a fix if the GOP nominates Trump or CruzReid said hed like to see the Senate vote on some of Trumps policies  specifically the plan to ban Muslims from entering the USThis is why Republicans fear Trump  and why Democrats would love to put GOPers on the spot and exploit the schismSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell retorted that what is good for the goose is good for the gander The Kentucky Republican argued he might concoct votes on the policy positions of Clinton or fellow Democratic Sen Bernie Sanders IndependentVermontAdam Jentleson a top aide to Reid indicated to Fox that Democrats would accept the deal McConnell proposed in a heartbeat  votes on Trumps policies in return for votes on ClintonSanders policiesIn many respects congressional Republicans are trying to rise above the frayWe need to appear like the sane ones said one senior House aideThats why Ryans pushing a robust policy agenda and vision items this yearTheres a lot of us who believe this is a make or break year We are going to build an agenda that is agnostic to our nominee said Texas GOP Rep Bill Flores chairman the Republican Study Committee the largest bloc of conservatives in the HouseThe agenda is a key piece of infrastructure that any presidential nominee would need he saidIn short House GOPers are hoping to wag the dog a little If say Trump is the nominee and he propounds farflung ideas perhaps congressional Republicans can temper that red meat with bona fide policies that represent core values of the partyBut that doesnt stop everyone from freaking out on Capitol Hill Maybe Trump and Cruz already wagged the dog And then those in Congress are the ones who look like theyre out of step with the nominee their party selects
