they knew several membersWe knew their pastor Reverend Clementa Pinckney who along with eight others gathered in prayer and fellowship was murdered last night Obama said And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their community doesnt say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feelObama declined to comment on specific details of the investigation which currently centers on 21yearold suspect Dylann Roof a white man who was taken into custody late Thursday morning in Shelby North Carolina authorities have saidBut the President said the shooting should refocus attention on preventing potential killers from getting their hands on gunsWe do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun Obama said at the White House At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries It doesnt happen in other places with this kind of frequency It is in our power to do something about itCommunities like Charleston have had to endure tragedies like this too many times he saidRepublican presidential candidate Rand Paul however was skeptical that a government solution was availableWhat kind of person goes in a church and shoots nine people Theres a sickness in our country Theres something terribly wrong but it isnt going to be fixed by your government the Kentucky senator said at the Faith and Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority conference in WashingtonMeanwhile the National Rifle Association declined to comment following the Presidents remarks Thursday afternoon saying it was sticking to the same policy it has followed after similar incidentsThe NRA will not be making any public statements until the facts are known spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNNThursday isnt the first time Obama has used a shooting tragedy in the United States to make a renewed call for toughening gun ownership laws Bolstering restrictions on gun sales became a top White House priority immediately following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook which killed 20 children and left a total of 28 people deadAdvocates for tougher gun laws rallied behind a bipartisan measure that would have mandated background checks on every gun sale The bill was seen as the best chance for any type of new gun restriction to gain approval on Capitol Hill where many lawmakers balked at imposing bans on assault weapons or highcapacity magazinesBut even the background check measure failed to gain enough support in the Senate in April 2013 and the issue of gun control has largely remained off the agenda in Washington sinceWithout congressional support Obama has signed dozens of unilateral executive actions meant to quell gun violence But broad actions like creating a universal background check law or banning certain types of ammunition would still require lawmakers approvalA year ago Obama said it was stunning that Congress wasnt able to get behind a single piece of gun control legislation after the Sandy Hook shooting He called the failure to expand background checks to handgun sales his biggest frustration as presidentObama on Thursday conceded that the current political arrangement in Washington  where Republicans control both chambers of Congress  means any movement on gun control laws remains unlikely during his presidencyThe politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now he said adding that acknowledging the steady beat of shootings  and their perpetrators access to guns  was a first stepAt some point its going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively he said
