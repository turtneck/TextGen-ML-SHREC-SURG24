The Powerful Act Immoral as they Also Suffer from Herd Mentality Nov 7 2016 2 0 The people at or near the top of the power pyramid are just as vulnerable to being sheep as we all are In fact theyre even more likely to fall to pressure from their peers because they have so much more at stake if they make the wrong choice That stake is money power and other forms of capital Its their entire lifestyle at risk If they rock the boat there goes their business deals their favors their prioritization And these aspects of their life most likely define their identity as sad as that might be Thats because all these consequences are of a nature which do not account for honor integrity and morality Connecting with the self to become an authentic man or woman is one of the real successes in life so if they disregard this basic tenet to being human then theyve sold their soul for nothing less than a false path These sorts of people have a lot of influence that theyre failing to utilize for the benefit of humanity as well as the environment The core effect they could achieve is based in helping people to expand their understanding and therefore their consciousness to facilitate bringing about an era of truth justice peace and abundance for humankind Who exactly is being referenced here They include celebrities politicians bureaucrats military and police personnel journalists business moguls socalled selfhelp gurus and pretty much anyone who is connected to the oligarchical families that are orchestrating the grand plan of global governance Now of course not all of them are alike But lets face it how many of those with a massive social influence are speaking out against not just the peripheral problems but the core ones such as the scams embedded into our system itself Fuck all that hows many Entering into their minds its easy for them to be persuaded by the fear if they talk about some of the seriously uncomfortable truths of the world theyd be labeled as a conspiracy theorist Yet the reality is that many conspiracy facts are backed up with so much evidence they are simply matter as fact Like so many of us do the truth needs to be shared We all need to hear understand and embody it into our thoughts and actions Simply it stands to reason that we all need to play our part especially those who have taken on a role with societal responsibility In any case there are obviously many other reasons why these people dont speak up Examples include that theyre subtly pretending to themselves that nothing is happening ensuring they are a very unconscious person turning a blind eye even though they know and feel it just simply ignorant of how the world works like most people psychopaths andor sociopaths where theyre involved in deeply disgraceful ideologies and practices programmed and conditioned to support the status quo dazed and confused in an overwhelming game of socalled power a fake and weak human being andor in the drift of an existential crisis which means their tide might actually turn Final Thoughts In the awakening community we talk a lot about the people having the ultimate power because weve got the numbers So if we want the sham of our system to cease then all we have to do is organize to at least some degree to bring about the next steps of our societal evolution Well what about all these people embedded in the parasitic culture that has hijacked humanitys future Cant they be a beacon of light too Of course they can To do so they like all of us need to do their proper research and open their minds and hearts to both the madness and magic that permeates our existence of duality If they do theyll deeply connect with their true role as a light shining into the darkness After all no shadows exist when the light is shone from all angles A B OUT THE AUTHOR Phillip J Watt lives on the Mid North Coast of NSW Australia His written and film work deals with topics from ideology to society as well as selfdevelopment Follow him on Facebook  watch his interviews with an array of inspiring guests at his YouTube Channel or visit his website
