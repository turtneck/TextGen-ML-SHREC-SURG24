Institute and runs TomDispatchcom  His latest book is Shadow Government Surveillance Secret Wars and a Global Security State in a SingleSuperpower World  Originally published at TomDispatch  p To say that this is the election from hell is to insult hell Theres been nothing like this since Washington forded the Rubicon or Trump crossed the Delaware or delivered the Gettysburg Address you know the one that began Four score and eleven women ago  or pick your own seminal moment in American history Billions of words that face those gestures the endless insults  the abused women and the emails the 247 spectacle of it all Whatever happens on Election Day lets accept one reality were in a new political era in this country We just havent quite taken it in Not really Forget Donald Trump Doh Why did I write that Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets month after month before when those same polls turned against him discovering that they were all  rigged  Whatever you think of The Donald who in the world  and I mean the whole wide world including the Iranians   could possibly forget him or the election hes stalked so ominously When you think of him however dont make him the cause of American political dysfunction Hes just the bizarre disturbed and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system Admittedly he is a oneofakind politician even among his associates in surging rightwing nationalist and antiwhatever movements globally He makes Frances Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that were not just talking about the presidency of a country but of the country The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere And yet based on the last strange year of election campaigning its hard not to think that something  and not just The Donald  is unnervingly amiss on Planet America The World War II Generation in 2016 Sometimes in my fantasies as while watching the final presidential debate I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world With them in the room I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment Of course they lived through a devastating depression light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 20072008 as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and  short of nuclear war  is not likely to be again Despite this I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with To start at a global level both my mother who died in 1977 and my father who died in 1983 spent decades in the nuclear age the era of humanitys greatest  for want of a better word  achievement After all for the first time in history we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God or the gods where it had resided for thousands of years and placed it directly in our own What they didnt live to experience however was historys second potential dealbreaker climate change already bringing upheaval to the planet and threatening a slowmotion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort While nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9 1945  even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries climate change should be seen as a snailpaced version of nuclear war  and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping nearrecord levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere I imagine my parents amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didnt get a single question  not to speak of an answer in the three presidential debates of 2016 the four and a half hours of charges insults and interruptions just past Neither a moderator nor evidently an undecided voter in the town hall second debate nor either presidential candidate  each ready to change the subject on a moments notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression emails or anything else  thought it worth the slightest attention It was in short a problem too large to discuss one whose existence Donald Trump like just about every other Republican denies or rather in his case labels a hoax that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America So much for insanity and inanity when it comes to the largest question of all On a somewhat more modest scale my mom and dad wouldnt have recognized our political world as American and not just because of Donald Trump They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system  at least 66 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate more than 10 of that from only 100 families They would have been stunned by our 1 elections  by our new Gilded Age  by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a populist by riling up once Democratic workingclass whites immiserated by the likes of him and his brand of casino capitalism scam and spectacle by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding and by just how much money can be invested in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days And I havent even mentioned the Other Candidate who spent all of August on the true campaign trail hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires and assorted celebrities  to build up her phenomenal  war chest  I would have to take a deep breath and explain to my parents that in twentyfirstcentury America by Supreme Court decree money has become the equivalent of speech even if its anything but free And lets not forget that other financial lodestone for an American election these days the television news not to speak of the rest of the media How could I begin to lay out for my parents for whom presidential elections were limited fall events the bizarre nature of an election season that starts with media speculation about the nextinline just as the previous season is ending and continues more or less nonstop thereafter Or the spectacle of talking heads discussing just about nothing but that election 247 on cable television for something like a full year or the billions of ad dollars that have fueled this neverending Super Bowl of campaigns filling the coffers of the owners of cable and network news Weve grown strangely used to it all but my mom and dad would undoubtedly think they were in another country  and that would be before they were even introduced to the American system as it now exists the one for which Donald Trump is such a bizarre front man What Planet Is This Anyway I wish I still had my high school civics text If youre of a certain age youll remember it the one in which a man from Mars lands on Main Street USA to be lectured on the glories of American democracy and our carefully constructed checkedandbalanced tripartite form of governance Im sure knowledge of that system changed life on Mars for the better even if it was already something of a fantasy here on Earth in my parents time After all Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower  my mom and dad voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson  was the one who in his farewell address in 1961 first brought the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power and the militaryindustrial complex to the attention of the American people Yes all of that was already changing then as a peacetime war state of unparalleled size developed in this country Still 30odd years after my fathers death surveying the American landscape my parents might believe themselves on Mars They would undoubtedly wonder what exactly had happened to the country they knew After all thanks to the Republican Partys scorchedearth tactics in these last years in bipolar Washington Congress that collection of putative representatives of the people now a crew of wellpaid wellfinanced representatives of the countrys special interests in a capital overrun with corporate lobbyists hardly functions anymore Little of significance makes it through the porticos of the Capitol Recently for instance John McCain usually considered a relatively moderate Republican senator suggested  before walking his comments part way back  that if Hillary Clinton were elected president his fellow Republican senators might decide a priori not to confirm a single Supreme Court justice she nominated during her tenure in office That of course would mean a court now down to what looks like a permanent crew of eight would shrink accordingly And his comments which once would have shocked Americans to the core caused hardly a ripple of upset or protest On my tour of this new world I might start by pointing out to my mom and dad that the US is now in a state of permanent war  its military at the moment involved in conflicts in at least six countries in the Greater Middle East and Africa These are all purely presidential conflicts as Congress no longer has a real role in American warmaking other than ponying up the money for it and beating the drums to support it The executive branch stands alone when it comes to the war powers once checked and balanced in the Constitution And I wouldnt want my parents to simply look abroad The militarization of this country has proceeded apace and in ways that I have not the slightest doubt would shock them to their core I could take my parents for instance to Grand Central Station in midtown Manhattan their hometown and still mine and on any day of the week they would see the onceinconceivable actual armed soldiers on guard in full camo I could mention that at my local subway stop Ive several times noted a New York police department counterterror squad that could be mistaken for a military Special Ops team assault rifles slung across their chests and no one even stops and gawks anymore I could point out that the police across the country increasingly have the look of military units and are supplied by the Pentagon with actual weaponry and equipment directly off distant US battlefields including armored vehicles of various sorts I could mention that military surveillance drones those precursors of future robotic warfare and for my parents right out of the childhood scifi novels I used to read are now regularly in American skies  that advanced surveillance equipment developed in faroff war zones is now being used by the police here at home and that though political assassination was officially banned in the postWatergate 1970s the president now commands a formidable CIA drone force that regularly carries out such assassinations across large swaths of the planet even against US citizens  and without the sayso of anyone outside the White House including the courts I could mention that the president who in my parents time commanded one modestsized secret army the CIAs paramilitaries now essentially presides over a fullscale secret military the Special Operations Command 70000 elite troops cocooned inside the larger US military including elite teams ready to be deployed on what are essentially executive missions across the planet I could point out that in the twentyfirst century US intelligence has set up a global surveillance state that would have shamed the totalitarian powers of the previous century and that American citizens en masse are included in it that our emails a new concept for my parents have been collected by the millions and our phone records made available to the state that privacy in short has essentially been declared unAmerican I would also point out that on the basis of one tragic day and what otherwise has been the most modest of threats to Americans a single fear  of Islamic terrorism  has been the pretext for the building of the already existing national security state into an edifice of almost unbelievable proportions that has been given once unimaginable powers funded in ways that should amaze anyone not just visitors from the American past and has become the unofficial fourth branch of the US government without either discussion or a vote Little that it does  and it does a lot  is open to public scrutiny For their own safetythe People are to know nothing of its workings except what it wants them to know Meanwhile secrecy of a claustrophobic sort has spread across significant parts of the government The government classified 92 million documents in 2011 and things seem not to have gotten much better since In addition the national security state has been elaborating a body of  secret law  including classified rules regulations and interpretations of already existing law  kept from the public and in some cases even from congressional oversight committees Americans in other words know ever less about what their government does in their name at home and abroad I might suggest to my parents that they simply imagine the Constitution of the United States being rewritten and amended in secrecy and on the fly in these years without as much as a nod to We the People In this way as our elections became elaborate spectacles democracy was sucked dry and ditched in all but name  and that name is undoubtedly Donald J Trump Consider that then a brief version of how I might describe our new American world to my amazed parents America as a National Security State None of this is The Donalds responsibility In the years in which a new American system was developing he was firing people on TV You could of course think of him as the poster boy for an America in which spectacle celebrity the gilded class of One Percenters and the national security state have melded into a narcissistic selfreferential brew of remarkable toxicity Whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is elected president one thing is obvious the vast edifice that is the national security state with its 17 intelligence agencies and enormous imperial military will continue to elaborate itself and expand its power in our American world Both candidates have sworn to pour yet more money into that military and the intelligence and Homeland Security apparatus that goes with it None of this of course has much of anything to do with American democracy as it was once imagined Someday perhaps like my parents I will be called back from the dead by one of my children to view with awe or horror whatever world exists Long after the America of an unimaginable Donald J Trump presidency or a farmoreimaginable Hillary Clinton version of the same has been folded into some godawful halfforgotten chapter in our history I wonder what will surprise or confound me then What version of our country and planet will I face in 2045 0 0 0 0 0 0
