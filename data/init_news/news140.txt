Sharpton Attacks OKeefe So OKeefe Releases Brutal Expose on Sharpton BOOM If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire though MSNBC is by far my favorite  and trust me a yearandahalf of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the leftslanting morass MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet  or at the very least another culture a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what Im talking about perfectly He had found a mother and daughter in line apparently for early voting They were also AfricanAmerican which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult by liberal media standards   However when he asked them about criticism of Trumps AfricanAmerican outreach the mother and daughter blew him out of the water Well I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens including AfricanAmericans Trina the daughter told MSNBC Hes trying to address a problem It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong and you have a plan that wants to help people Thats what a president should do for us He should reach out and try to help people and address problems thats going on in our country Some of the criticisms have been about Trumps pitch to minority voters What do you have to lose Rascon said to Gloria the mother What do you think about that criticism
