on primary rival Bernie Sanders to step aside  though the Vermont senator vowed to keep fighting for every delegateFox News projected Tuesday that Clinton will win an outright majority of pledged delegates while reaching the 2383 necessary to clinch the nomination with help from freeagent superdelegatesAs Clinton now launches a general election battle against presumptive rival Donald Trump Sanders remained defiant at an early Wednesday morning rally in Los Angeles where he awaited results of the California primary which Fox News has yet to call The results of the California vote could weigh heavily on Sanders decision whether to go forwardMeanwhile Fox News confirmed early Wednesday that Sanders was planning to lay off more than half his campaign staffFar from bowing out however he vowed to campaign through the final primary next Tuesday in Washington DC and then take our fight for social economic racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia Pennsylvania the site of the conventionThe crowd erupted in cheers as Sanders announced hed keep going a decision he kept close to the vest right up until his remarksSanders closed by declaring Thank you all the struggle continuesIn a potential move toward reconciliation however the White House revealed that President Obama called both Clinton and Sanders Tuesday night  and plans to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday to discuss how to build on the extraordinary work he has done to engage millions of Democratic votersClinton earlier claimed victory over Sanders  after attaining the delegates needed to claim the nomination outright with a New Jersey primary win  during a lofty speech to supporters in BrooklynMarking the historic moment Clinton said This campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings no limits on any of us She also congratulated Sanders calling his campaign and the debate he brought about income inequality good for the party  while also saying this is a moment to come togetherEight years to the day after she conceded to rival Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary the former first lady and secretary of state became the presumptive 2016 nominee with the help of delegates in New Jersey She won the states primary and with it enough delegates to easily surpass the 2383 needed to clinch the nomination She also is projected to win New Mexico and South DakotaSanders vow to stay in the race was based on his belief that his campaign could sway enough of Clintons superdelegates to force a contested convention Superdelegates are free to support any candidate and do not technically vote for a nominee until the Democratic National Convention next month Pledged delegates however are bound to support the candidate who won the primary or caucusFox News projects that with the delegates Clinton is winning in California she will have won a majority of all pledged delegates at the Democratic convention  making it more difficult for Sanders to argue shes winning only because of support from superdelegatesSanders did notch projected wins Tuesday in North Dakotas Democratic caucuses and the Montana primary A total of six states were voting TuesdayOn the GOP side Donald Trump  the only major Republican left in the race  was projected to win the primaries in California Montana New Jersey South Dakota and New Mexico Trump also surpassed a new milestone in the primary contest Tuesday night winning enough bound delegates alone to clinch the GOP nominationMarking his victories during remarks at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor NY Trump said Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin anotherPreviewing the general election battle he slammed the Clintons alleging they turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves He also appealed to Sanders supporters saying We welcome you with open armsClinton in her victory speech also took shots at Trump claiming he would take America backwardsThe stakes in this election are high and the choice is clear Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president she saidThe contests Tuesday largely conclude one of the most unpredictable and rowdy primary seasons in modern history  one that saw a brash billionaire clear through a formidable field of 16 rivals to defy the pundits and claim the GOP nomination and the frontrunner on the Democratic side locked in a fight to the end against a socialistleaning senator from VermontPrimary season formally ends next week when the District of Columbia holds its Democratic contestEven before Tuesdays races both parties effectively had their presumptive nominees Trump clinched the nomination last month as late support from unbound delegates put him over the top and his remaining rivals suspended their campaigns The Associated Press declared Monday night that Clinton had hit the 2383delegate mark thanks to a burst of support from freeagent superdelegatesBut unlike Trump Clintons last remaining rival has not exited the raceThere is nothing to concede Sanders said in a TV interview Monday nightSanders also had said hed assess his plans after Tuesdays elections as he heads home to Burlington but gave no indications of having second thoughts during his Los Angeles rallyThe Democratic Party pressure on him however is sure to mount in a matter of days if not hours Obama reportedly is planning to get behind Clinton and start campaigning for her and senior Democrats have been voicing mounting frustration with Sanders campaignAt the same time the senator has touted general election polls suggesting he may be better positioned to go up against Trump in the fall Over the course of the campaign he mounted an unexpectedly strong challenge to Clinton buoyed by the support of young and energetic voters whose enthusiasm at times echoed the spirit behind Barack Obamas bid in 2008 Clinton was dogged all along by questions about her private email use while secretary of state  and a stillongoing FBI investigation  though Sanders largely steered clear of the issue in his campaignTrump by contrast will have no compunction about hammering Clinton for what he describes as criminal activity with her email use as well as controversies surrounding her work as secretary of state  in particular her role in the Benghazi terrorist attack that took the life of four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens Trump gave a preview of his attack strategy Tuesday night ripping Clintons use of a totally illegal private serverYet even as Trump has seen all 16 of his rivals fade away hes still struggling in a historic way to unite the GOP behind him The tensions flared again this week as leading Republicans condemned his comments that a federal judge of Mexican heritage had a conflict of interest in a Trump University case On Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan called it the textbook definition of a racist comment while other Republican lawmakers condemned his comments
