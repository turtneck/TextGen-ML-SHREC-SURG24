Mike Pence and Tim Kaine will take the stage for thevice presidential debate on Tuesday night The vice president arguably holds the second most powerful office in the country  in part because theres a chance the president will die or have to resign in office in part because the president has increasingly delegated key duties and powers to the postBut the way America chooses its vice presidents seems to give little weight to the gravity of the role Presidential candidates pick their number two during the heat of a campaign and the VPs often represent some shortterm electoral interest far more than readiness for the job As was very much the case this year questions about the VP are far more likely to center on their impact on a swing state or on solidifying a crucial voting bloc than about experience and presidential mettleTo find out if there might be a better way of doing things I talked to six political scientists who have studied the vice presidency It turns out there actually is a strong defense for keeping things as they are  just not the one I had expectedThe Constitution has required that the vice president be on the ballot in one form or another since our nations founding But I was relieved to learn that Im not the only one to think the way we pick VPs in the heat of an election cycle seems somewhat nuttyIn the early 1970s Michigan Sen Bob Griffin proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would have ended the direct election of vice presidents and instead let presidents appoint their VPs subject to congressional approval after being sworn inOf course the idea didnt go anywhere But it wasnt without its supporters  especially after Richard Nixons veep Spiro Agnew had to resign over accusations of extortion and tax fraudAt the time reporters like Tom Wicker of the New York Times made a case similar to mine according to John D Feericks The Twentyfifth Amendment Its Complete History and Applications Wicker wroteWickers point is twofold 1 that VPs are often chosen out of ruthless political calculation alone and 2 that voters dont really get to vote on whether they support the VPSome of the contemporary political science research backs Wicker up Theres little evidence that voters make any consideration based on the vice president says Joseph E Uscinski a political scientist at the University of Miami and the author of several studies on the vice presidencyYoud think that nominees wouldnt then let electoral factors seep into their choices But they do and sometimes that gives us vice presidents who dont do what the presidents or the presidents voters wanted Uscinski saysYou dont need to go back to the 1970s to see how shortterm electoral considerations can warp presidential candidates VP picks  with really worrying implicationsThe most obvious recent example is Sarah Palin in 2008 when Sen John McCain  hoping for a Hail Mary comeback in the polls  picked the obviously unqualified Alaska governor in the hopes of firing up his partys baseMcCain and Palin lost of course But McCain certainly theoretically could have won and he could have died while in office We may have risked a disastrous presidency in part because we make presidents choose their successors when an election is at stakeTheres enough historical evidence of this happening for us to know that it isnt just an unlikely possibility In 1864 Abraham Lincoln chose southern white Unionist  and it turned out white supremacist  Andrew Johnson for his VP in a bid for geographic diversity After Lincoln was assassinated Johnson advanced a disastrous set of Reconstruction policies totally at odds with what the great emancipator and his Republican base wanted Plus Lincoln lost the Southern state of Kentucky that year anywayDiscrepancies between the POTUS and the VP have also made leadership crises more difficult to resolve and may even create an incentive for political assassins Uscinski wrote in one recent paper In 1881 President James Garfield was shot twice in the back but stubbornly clung to life for 80 days while completely incapacitated Some lawmakers wanted to resolve the crisis by making VP Chester Arthur president but feared the political implications of doing so because Arthur and Garfield came from different factions and had completely contradictory policies on civil service reformPresidential candidates have often opted for running mates who are politically different from the head of the ticket  to increase the chances of winning the general election Uscinski writes But when presidents and vice presidents differ significantly the country could inherit espousing policies the country does not democratically supportUscinskis argument here isnt just that an unqualified VP could become president despite not enjoying the support of much of the country Its that we explicitly look to vice presidents to complement the ideological profiles of the nominees thereby intentionally inserting confusion into our government that could potentially be avoided under a different systemSo if the vice presidency is a powder keg of risk and undemocratic outcomes then why shouldnt presidents just appoint VPs like Cabinet members I know Vox stories are unlikely to spur new constitutional amendments but bear with me After all you never hear of a president tapping an unqualified secretary of state merely to cement a voting bloc these days  rightI agree that its a messy system and that there are a number of anomalies says Joel Goldstein a law professor at St Louis University and the author of a new book about the modern vice presidency But my bottom line is that the system we have makes the most sense when all things are consideredGoldstein has lots of compelling defenses of our current system but they boil down to one essential point Requiring VPs to be confirmed by a gridlocked Congress as is the norm for highlevel presidential appointees could be nightmarishRight now a president basically gets to pick anyone he wants for his running mate if his conventions delegates approve the choice If he wins a landslide at the ballot box the other party doesnt get a veto of the VP That would probably have to change if the US tried to convert the vice presidency into a position chosen after the electionAnd just imagine a recently elected President Hillary Clinton trying to get her VP nominee through a Republican Senate Goldstein says The difference between who she thought would be good for the job and who she could get approved would presumably be even greater than it is under our current arrangementGiving Congress a veto seems less democratic than giving the public a veto Goldstein saysHe adds that vice presidents have become increasingly powerful over the past several decades Subjecting that office to our current partisan warfare just doesnt seem like a promising way to improve the VPs accountability or effectivenessThe vice president has become an office that provides highlevel help to the president as a senior political adviser and highlevel troubleshooter Goldstein says And thats at a time when most of the rest of the government is appearing increasingly dysfunctional I dont think we should mess around with itThe upshot of the political science research is clear When it comes to its impact on who wins most of the media obsession over the VP selection is dramatically overstatedIn one study recently highlighted in Politico two political scientists found that vice presidents dont even have a statistical impact on increasing votes for the ticket in their home statesDemographic groups dont fall in line because of a VP selection and neither do states says Kyle Kopko a political scientist at Elizabethtown College who conducted the research with University of Dayton political scientist Chris Devine Voters think of partisan preferences and what the presidential candidates are sayingBut the political scientists also argued that the VP choice can make a difference  even if it tends not to The experts cant often find examples of VP picks really siphoning votes away from the nominee But that may be because our current system is effectively deterring presidential nominees from picking running mates that really hurt their chancesAnother reason for optimism Theres growing evidence that presidential nominees understand the importance of picking a good governing partner over an illusory electoral gain says Matt Grossmann a political scientist at Michigan StateI think presidents are recognizing what the VP means adds Matt Dickinson a political scientist at Middlebury College The most recent presidential candidates seem to be made from a need for a governing partner as much as for any electoral gainThe idea of Sarah Palin becoming president because of some quirk in the system seems to argue against this But maybe shes also a sign that voters really do punish  and therefore consider  terrible VP picks Indeed one study has found that picking Palin cost McCain about 2 million votesYes there are some exceptions but the fact that the presidential candidate has to pick someone before an election tends to force them to pick pretty good people Goldstein says Youd really lose something by not having the vice president as part of the campaign
