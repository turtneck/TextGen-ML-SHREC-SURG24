Speaking from Hiroshima the site of the first wartime atomic weapon detonation President Obama on Friday called for the pursuit of a world without nuclear weaponsOnly a few days prior his Department of Defense published new data revealing that the government Obama oversees  a government which manages the secondlargest nuclear stockpile in the world  had dismantled fewer of its nuclear devices than in any year since at least 1980Every year the Department of Defense declassifies data on the size of the countrys nuclear stockpile and the number of warheads dismantled Its most recent data released this week shows that the US stockpile numbered 4571 at the end of 2015 about 15 percent of its size at its peak during the Cold War in 1967 The number of weapons dismantled was 109 the lowest figure since at least 1980In 1945 the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed  two The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George HW Bush and a decade later during his sons At the end of 2008 the stockpile numbered 5273 over the course of Obamas two terms it has dropped to 4571It is of course easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger As a fraction of the total weapon count Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than onetenth  13 percent But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obamas progress in this regard That 13 percent is the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous postCold War administration the 109 dismantlings last year continues a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled under Obama The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administrations control for the lower number last year  but also that political pressure discourages a push for reductionWhy does the size of our stockpile matter As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states
