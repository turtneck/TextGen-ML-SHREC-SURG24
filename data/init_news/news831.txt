Home  Be The Change  The State  Sheriff Says Cannabis Makes People Murderers Because Rational Thought Leads to Violence Sheriff Says Cannabis Makes People Murderers Because Rational Thought Leads to Violence Claire Bernish May 10 2016 35 Comments It isnt gang violence It isnt even domestic violence What is the leading cause of murder in Carson City According to Sheriff Ken Furlong its marijuana Its against that law Furlong told local ABC affiliate KOLO 8 It does change peoples attitude and we do see people dying as a result of it needlessly and theres no excuse for it In the last 1315 years all of the violence weve seen that has turned deadly have sic been in someway related to a marijuana issue Before you get too excited thinking Furlong nailed it  the fact cannabis remains a federal Schedule 1 drug and thus technically illegal in the ongoing yet utterly failed war on drugs  that isnt all he had to say on the matter KOLO 8 noted the 2016 deaths of 18yearold Grant Watkins and 40yearold Dennis Watkins Jr  both killed during transactions involving the sale of cannabis During a transaction they set it up Im going to sell this to you then all of a sudden someone gets shot and killed Furlong continued Its not because they were under the influence its because they were doing something deadly and it turned out that way As Furlong explained the threat to life isnt due to the drugs effects on the system per se  but the culture and crimes surrounding it that can be overwhelming as KOLO 8 paraphrased Its a very cherished culture and people have very strong beliefs the Sheriff elaborated When you violate someones beliefs you put them in a position where they can act out But Furlongs complete lack of understanding of all things cannabis  including both medicinal and recreational aspects  didnt stop there According to the Sheriff the community faces repercussions following a law enforcement drug bust  because addicts suddenly have no way to procure their  cannabis Were watching very closely not only for a spike in crime but for people who are in critical need of medical care because of that lack of treatment based on withdrawal from the drug he asserted Yes you read that right Carson Citys Sheriffincharge firmly believes depriving people of cannabis  a plant scientifically and anecdotally proven to save lives  will lead to a crime wave and health crisis of no small proportions But what he explained next as paraphrased by KOLO 8 harkens back to the earliest days of cannabis prohibition and the propagandist classic Reefer Madness Sheriff Furlong says unlike other drugs like heroin or methamphetamines that can distort your mind people using marijuana usually have rational trains of thought which give them the ability to act out and become violent when someone takes away or violates their drug At this point if youre having a good laugh stunned or shaking your head you most certainly are not alone Obviously Sheriff Furlong grasps the potential perils in black market trade  but he wholly fails to recognize removing cannabis illegality would thus remove the risk of violence When the State is removed from consensual business transactions individuals are free to conduct trade as they see fit  if cannabis were abundant and legal it would be highly unlikely people would continue killing each other over soured deals But Furlongs stupefying lack of knowledge concerning the effects cannabis has on the body though certainly laughable also should concern the residents hes tasked with overseeing Mischaracterizing cannabis so broadly as to believe it will warp peoples minds to a heightened frenzy where theyre likely to commit violence is downright dangerous For one thing this inexcusable misperception could color the training Sheriff Furlong decides to give law enforcement trainees and officers Considering the absolutely epidemic national spate of violence inflicted by triggerhappy cops who already seem to have an irrational fear of the public training them to further view cannabis users as likely to act out physically is nothing short of dangerous If sheriffs deputies conduct a raid on a residence known for cannabis transactions with the preconception the people inside could turn violent instantly its arguable they would be more likely to misinterpret anything they encounter This unnecessarily heightened fear that their life could be in peril from a cannabiscrazed maniac would have obvious influence on their decisions for whether or not to employ deadly force Sadly Sheriff Furlong likely isnt alone among law enforcement in the United States As long as the drug war remains firmly entrenched in policy and culture dangerous misunderstandings and lack of knowledge will arguably be the greater source of violence than would the substances be were they not illegal In the meantime while forced to pick apart drug laws state by state perhaps drug and cannabis education  not fear and prohibitionbased propaganda but serious education  should be mandatory in law enforcement training Share Google  Lannim All he did without knowing it was admit that the real criminals are the ones who enforce prohibition and create this culture of violence When you suppress a legitimate market it will be replaced by a black market that is regulated by force instead of voluntary interaction Violence begets violence and it doesnt get any more violent than the state ACAB Matt Agorist EXACTLY James Michael Considering the government never created a constitutional amendment allowing prohibition the entire drug war is treason and felonius EVERY killing a murder EVERY raid a felony home invasion EVERY jailing a false imprisonment EVERY fine extortion The cops and the courts are a criminal enterprise AKA RICO and meet the definition of it perfectly Lannim Exactly I would say that the drug war would be just as illegitimate and criminal with an amendment but being able to argue that its ALSO unconstitutional helps considering most Americans think their rights are contingent upon whats written on sacred documents b4integrity The federal government is a continuing criminal domestic terrorist enterprise We need a DEA eradication program Paschn Goddamn it does my old heart good to see folks lay things out as you did Couple that with SCOTUS treason with corporate citizenship Patriot act Habeas corpus gone Posse Comitatus gone granting civil immunity to big pharma setting up a federal committee to review claims made by citizens harmed by safe vaccines then paying off those claims WITH TAX PAYER MONEY to protect the bottom line of the elites Murdering Ranchers for pointing out the FEDs treason Let us not forget the 2 sets of books most governments run CAFR Let me know when you folks have had enough SEWER NATION  IDIOT CULTURE Centrist Force This is easy to solve end the criminal part of this There is no need for marijuana to be illegal You want to end drug deals and guns get the cops out of the equation and nobody needs to play this mob games Gregory Pius We did that in Oregon and Washington Tax revenues are bursting the state coffers and the police now have to find honest work or at least overzealously enforce something else Everybody wins Sadly almost all LEOs Ive ever heard to talked to have a deeplyheld conviction that legalization of cannabis will result in the loss of their job A  kaynash We have far too many ignorant people in positions of powerof course our press doesnt help either they are just as ignorant so no one is getting educated from that source any longer But really a Sheriff If you are going to criminalize people you should have a much better understanding of what you are saying Because thinking people in law enforcement are more than aware that its criminalizing drugs that is the problemand this guy actually comes close to realizing that and then draws the totally wrong conclusions from it dufasduck When you violate someones beliefs you put them in a position where they can act out Sounds like he described the average policeman Gregory Pius
