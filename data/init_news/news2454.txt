The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers Some believe that Nazi Germany under the control of Adolf Hitler possessed supernatural powers and largely employed pseudoscience during the 19331945 period However some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact Over the years researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi GermanyNazi Germany invaded Russia formerly the USSR during the Second World War on June 22 1941 At the time the German army progressed deep into Russian territory gaining ground close to the capital Moscow before the Russians could counterattack eventually driving the Nazis backDuring the Nazi occupation in Russia in 1942 the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic codenamed Schatzgraber or Treasure Hunter which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops warships and submarines The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences Founded on July 1 1935 by Heinrich Himmler Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darr the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the worldHowever the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944  a time when the Russian army began its offensive pushing the Germans out of the country According to a wartime story supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear which ultimately was infected with trichinosis This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German Uboat Despite Russian authors telling the story of Treasure Hunter some observers consider it a myth doubting its existenceBut Russian researchers have now announced that Treasure Hunter has been discovered saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle located 620 miles from the North PoleA senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery  Before it was only known from written sources but now we also have real proof
