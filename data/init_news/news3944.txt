If you had to sum up Mitt Romneys planned third bid for president in 2016 in a single slogan and why wouldnt you it would be Mitt Romney 30  now with more Mormon Heres The Washington Posts Phil Rucker on that pointIf he runs again in 2016 Romney is determined to rebrand himself as authentic warts and all and central to that mission is making public what for so long he kept private Herarely discussedhis religious beliefs and practices in his failed 2008 and 2012 races often confronting suspicion and bigotry with silence as his political consultants urged him to play down his Mormonism Now Romney speaks openly about his service as a lay pastor in the Mormon Church recites Scripture to audiences muses about salvation and the prophet urges students to marry young and have a quiver full of kids and evencracks jokesabout Joseph Smiths polygamyI get Romneys decision I was one of the people who thought he should talk more about his faith in the 2012general election campaign as a way to counter the perception being pushed by the Obama campaign that he was a flipflopping plutocrat with no core beliefs His Mormon faith has always been central to Romneys private persona so if the goal is to run the real Romney this time then its the right moveThat said theres plenty of reasons to believe that a forwardfacing of his Mormonism might have lessthanideal political consequences for Romney  particularly among a Republican primary electorate After Romneys 2008 defeat in the Iowa caucuses during the Republican primary  at the hands of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee an evangelical and minister  there was lots of grumbling from Romneyworld that the main reason their guy came up short was his faith Iowans  and especially those who considered themselves born again or evangelical  were deeply skeptical of Romneys Mormonism and the Mormon faith more generally Many believed it wasnt a Christian faith and when being candid considered it a quasicultFour years later even as Romney was on his way to becoming the nominee that skepticism among evangelicals was readily apparent Romney lost every primary in 2012 in which exit polls found evangelical Christians comprised a majority of voters In South Carolina evangelicals were the decisive vote they went for former House speaker Newt Gingrich by 22 points over Romney Across all primary contests in 2012 Romney did 13 percentage points worse among evangelical Christians than nonevangelicals Is it possible that evangelicals were reacting to something other than Romneys Mormon faith when they voted for other candidates Sure But it seems very unlikelyAnd theres little evidence that Romneys past presidential bids have had much effect on how white evangelicals view Mormonism generally This chart comes courtesy of a December 2012 Pew pollWhite evangelicals are roughly divided on whether Mormonism is a Christian religion and are significantly more skeptical of that fact than the public at large And remember that 57 percent of Iowa caucusgoers in 2012 identified as born againevangelical while 65 percent of South Carolina primary voters said the sameIve always believed that Romneys Mormonism  along with his wealth  was something that made him seem other to the average Republican primary voter Less than two percent of Americans by most estimates are Mormon That number is far lower in places such as Iowa or South Carolina Many Republican primary voters dont know anyone who is a Mormon or anyone who even knows a Mormon Its a barrier to familiarity  whether it should be or not And in states such as Iowa and South Carolina that are not only heavily evangelical but also demand retail politicking any barrier like that is a big oneNone of the above should sway Romney from more publicly embracing his religion in this campaign if there is a campaign for him The best thing you can be in politics is yourself But a damn the torpedoes approach by Romney on his Mormonism has to come with this expectation too There are torpedoes out there
