Man uses Trump victory as excuse to call exgirlfriend 101116 A MAN has decided the US election result is sufficiently insane to justify calling his exgirlfriend Martin Bishop woke up yesterday to news of Donald Trumps election and thought it was a solid excuse to call his ex Donna Sheridan and ask her what she thought Bishop said I tried to call her after Brexit but I just got her answer machine  Today I got through though which has nothing to do with the fact Ive got a new number  I asked her if everything was OK and if shed seen the election result and she said she had Then there was a bit of a silence so I asked her if shed come across that cordless drill I couldnt find when I moved out  She said she hadnt so then I asked her if that dipshit barman she was screwing now even knew what a Black and Decker was and then she hung up on me  Fucking Trump
