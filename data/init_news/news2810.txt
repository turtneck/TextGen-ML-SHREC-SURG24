According to a new study eight percent of our DNA is ALIEN In fact it is made up of NONHUMAN viral fragments The new study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  The recent study revealed that there is literally nonhuman DNA residing in modern humans genome This study comes after a froup of researchers from Tufts and University of Michigan Medical School examined 2500 peopleExperts discovered that our DNA is less human and that nineteen pieces of Ancient Viral DNA exist within our own genomeMost strikingly experts discovered the full genetic mockup for an entire virus within 2 percent of the people they examined According to sciencedailycom  whether or not the virus can be replicated or reproduced isnt yet known But other studies of ancient virus DNA have shown it can affect the humans who carry itScienceDaily reports that the study offers new insight on human endogenous retroviruses HERVs are actually antique diseases which possess eerily similar characteristics to human immunodeficiency virus the precursor to AIDSExperts believe that this Viral DNA0 has been passed down through thousands of generations of human beings The studys authors are still unsure whether the ancient strains of DNA could cause infectionsThis one looks like it is capable of making infectious virus which would be very exciting if true as it would allow us to study a viral epidemic that took place long ago says senior author and virologist John Coffin PhD of the Tufts University School of Medicine This research provides important information necessary for understanding how retroviruses and humans have evolved together in relatively recent timesMany studies have tried to link these endogenous viral elements to cancer and other diseases but a major difficulty has been that we havent actually found all of them yet says cofirst author Zachary H Williams a PhD student at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University in Boston A lot of the most interesting elements are only found in a small percentage of people which means you have to screen a large number of people to find themThis is a thrilling discovery says cofirst author Julia Wildschutte PhD who began the work as a PhD student in Coffins lab at Tufts It will open up many doors to research Whats more we have confirmed in this paper that we can use genomic data from multiple individuals compared to the reference human genome to detect new HERVs But this has also shown us that some people carry insertions that we cant map back to the referenceReference httpwwwpnasorgcontent11316E2326fullpdfSource EWAO
