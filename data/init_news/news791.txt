President Obama embarks on a trip to Africa on Thursday that includes a controversial stop in Ethiopia where the authoritarian government has come under sharp international criticism for its handling of political dissentThe Ethiopia visit has raised hackles among human rights advocates who question the administrations level of concern about the issue as it seeks to advance new security and economic goals on a continent where good governance and democratic freedoms often do not top the priority list But to others it reflects the evolution of Americas relationship with the continent which now offers opportunities for the United States in a way it didnt decades ago when it was primarily an aid recipientThe decision to go to Ethiopia greatly undermines the stated goals and commitments of this administration when it comes to support for human rights the rule of law and good governance in Africa and beyond said Sarah Margon Human Rights Watchs Washington director It shows that it ranks priorities and shows that security and development often trump human rights concerns which is a very shortsighted policy approachDozens of journalists left Ethiopia last year saying they faced threats from the government because of the work they do In April 2014 the government charged seven bloggers known as Zone 9 as well as three reporters under the countrys antiterrorism law A few months later the owners of six private publications were charged under Ethiopias criminal code In early July the government released two of the bloggers and all three of the reporters who had been arrested along with a journalist who had served roughly four years in prison though the Committee to Protect Journalists said at least a dozen members of the media remain jailed on terrorism chargesEthiopias ambassador to the United States Girma Birru described Obamas decision to visit his country as confirmation of the strong relationship thats been built between the two countriesBirru said prosecuting journalists was not evidence of human rights violations If a journalist or a teacher or a professor or a farmer is supporting these types of groups to instigate violence then he should be charged he said But the fact that he is carrying the name of journalist should not save him from being charged on this groundWhite House aides acknowledge that visits like the one to Ethiopia can bestow a measure of credibility to foreign governments and often use the lure of a presidential visit to win diplomatic concessions from nondemocratic and repressive regimes Obama often meets with members of civil society during his overseas visits as a way of encouraging independent groups to pursue their goals in the face of government oppositionSpeaking to reporters Wednesday national security adviser Susan Rice said the president would not hesitate to raise difficult topics during his trip including the way Ethiopias ruling party treats its opposition and discrimination against Kenyas LGBT communityNot just in Africa but around the world  when we are traveling to countries where we have concerns about the rule of law human rights corruption whatever democratic governance  we make those concerns known publicly and privately Rice said And we have done so continuously in the case of these two countries and will continue to do soSome experts say that Obama must weigh human rights against other important factorsPrinceton Lyman who served as US special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013 and did stints as the US ambassador to Nigeria and South Africa said that the United States must now consider the opportunity for investment in Africa even as the continent has become increasingly important for national security reasons in the fight against international terrorists and other destabilizing regional forcesThe question for policymakers is How do you balance these different interests when they sometimes run up against each other Lyman saidThe Obama trip will try to balance several of those interests In Ethiopia he will visit the Addis Ababa headquarters of the African Union which has played an increasingly active role in trying to maintain regional and economic stability in the region The Ethiopia stop will follow a visit to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit which is being held this weekend in Kenya where Obamas father was bornKenya has made strides in recent years with increasingly democratic elections though it has still come under fire for its restrictions of two Muslim groups on the coast Haki Africa and Muslims for Human Rights and abuses by members of its security forcesBut Samuel R Berger who served as President Bill Clintons national security adviser and is currently cochairman of the Albright Stonebridge Group said one cannot view foreign policy through the single lens of human rights The world is too complicated right now he said and too dangerous in this part of the world to think of human rights and security as an eitheror propositionWhen President George W Bush was contemplating a trip to Vietnam in 2006 it set off similar questions inside the White House said Joseph Hagin the deputy chief of staff for operations from 2001 to 2008The real key on any of these trips is Whats the deliverable What good would the visit do Hagin said If you think youre going to get a commitment to change behavior and you think thats valuable that could be enough to goHagin said that in the end Bush aides concluded that Hanoi had made enough progress on opening its economy that the trip would be beneficial Bush visited the nascent stock market in Ho Chi Minh City and used a red mallet to strike a gong that opened trading on the day he arrivedObama is reportedly considering a trip to Vietnam during a planned Asia tour this fall Vietnam is one of the 11 nations negotiating with the United States on the TransPacific Partnership an expansive free trade deal that Obama has placed high on his secondterm agenda But human rights advocates protested this month when the president played host to Communist Party Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong at the White HouseForeign policy experts said a Vietnam visit makes sense for a president who has already made history in Southeast Asia becoming in 2012 the first US president to visit Burma also known as Myanmar His stop in Malaysia in 2014 was the first by a sitting president since Lyndon B Johnson in 1967At a town hallstyle appearance with young activists during his April 2014 visit Obama pressed the Malaysian government which is also part of the TPP deal to improve its human rights record but declined to meet with opposition leader Anwar IbrahimYou cant expect an American president to go solve Malaysias problems in Malaysia Malays have to solve them said James Keith who served as US ambassador to Malaysia from 2007 to 2010And presidential human rights advocacy has clear limits Ahead of Obamas historic visit to Rangoon Burma in 2012 the nations ruling military junta released dozens of political prisoners and President Thein Sein agreed to allow human rights advocates to inspect prisons Obama met with democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi who had been released two years earlier after 15 years of house arrest and he gave a speech at Yangon University saying the flickers of progress  must become a shining North Star for all this nations peopleBut by the time Obama returned to Rangoon  and to the countrys capital Naypyidaw  last fall many of those political gains had been reversed Thein Seins regime had jailed journalists and political activists Suu Kyi was banned from running in this falls presidential election and violence was displacing tens of thousands of Muslim Rohingya in the countrysideOne has to recognize that more and more ever since the Cold War ended the value to foreigners of an American visit  our ability to influence change  has gone down Keith said Its the rise of the rest Its not American decline Its just naturalOnce the Africa trip is over the White House will have more difficult decisions to make regarding presidential travel such as whether Obama should visit Cuba now that the two countries have normalized relations Asked on Friday what the United States would need to see from the Cuban government before Obama would visit White House press secretary Josh Earnest rattled off a long list of human rights initiativesWe would like to see the rights of political opponents of the Cuban government inside of Cuba not be thrown in jail just because of their political views he said adding A respect for a free and independent media would be another step that we would like to see them take
