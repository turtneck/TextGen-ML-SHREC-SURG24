The debacle in Congress last week over President Barack Obamas trade agenda was further evidence that domestic political wrangling is harming US leadership in the global economyBy failing to pass Trade Adjustment Assistance which provides help to American workers affected by international trade Congress has raised doubts about the USs ability to conclude the TransPacific Partnership an agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim economies It also dims the prospects for the negotiations on the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with EuropeIt wasnt the first time recently that Congress sought to derail an agreement the executive branch had successfully advanced abroad In recent months lawmakers have again failed to approve reforms to the International Monetary Fund that were crafted by the administration approved by most of the funds global membership and are in the US national interest and they entail neither additional financial obligations nor an erosion of US influence representation and veto power on major IMF decisionsAs with trade congressional blockage of IMF reforms had less to do with the merits of the case than with the posturing of individual lawmakers as they prepare to seek reelection The dysfunction reflects a legislative branch that has been operationally undermined not just by extreme polarization of the two parties but also by the influence of the extremes within the parties as they set up the terms of the debate for the next presidentialnomination primariesOutside the US the image of an uncooperative Congress has also been fueled by the Republican lawmakers who took the unprecedented step of sending a letter to Irans leadership warning that the nuclear agreement being pursued by Obama could well be overturned after the November 2016 electionsTo be fair such signals to the rest of the world havent been emitted by Congress alone The administration itself slipped in its handling of the Asian Infrastructure Investment BankIgnoring advice to join this new institution and seek to shape and influence it from within the US embarked on a concerted public campaign to block it Those efforts were thwarted as US allies joined the Chinaled initiative forcing a rather embarrassing retreatAll this justifiably worries those who believe that effective US economic leadership is essential to a wellfunctioning global system This is especially true now when world growth is struggling there are genuine concerns about currency wars and countries have fallen further behind in dealing with some collective challenges including environmental onesHistorically the US has been the most effective in coordinating crisis management efforts pushing forward multilateral reforms and enabling global policy cooperation Moreover there is no credible alternative to US leadership on the international economic stageThe Group of Seven isnt representative of the realities of recent global economic realignments The G20 is unwieldy and lacks sufficient continuity Europe with its endless challenges is too internally focused and preoccupied China is hesitant to step up to broader international responsibilities And too many international institutions are burdened with longstanding legitimacy and credibility deficits related to outmoded representation and governance featuresAfter Congresss loud statement last week many hope that lawmakers will find a way to put trade authorization back on track this week Yet such a stopgo strategy is far from costfree It does little to restore confidence in Congress whose public approval rating languishes at or close to record lows And it suggests to the rest of the world that due to seemingly endless internal political polarization and dysfunction the US cannot be relied on to play its natural role as the worlds economic conductorCongress would be well advised to take note of this before turning other international economic initiatives into spectacles And while it is at it it should really move to approve IMF reforms that are in both the national and global interestThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its ownersTo contact the author of this story Mohamed A ElErian at melerianbloombergnetTo contact the editor responsible for this story Max Berley at mberleybloombergnet
