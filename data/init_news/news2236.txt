Washington CNN Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States CNN projects a historic victory for outsiders that represents a stunning repudiation of Washingtons political establishmentThe billionaire real estate magnate and former reality star needed an almost perfect run through the swing states  and he got it winning Ohio North Carolina and FloridaThe Republican swept to victory over Hillary Clinton in the ultimate triumph for a campaign that repeatedly shattered the conventions of politics to pull off a remarkable upset Clinton conceded to Trump in the early hours of Wednesday morningSpeaking at a victory party in New York Trump was gracious toward Clinton and called for unityWe owe Clinton a very major debt of gratitude to her for her service to our country Trump said I say it is time for us to come together as one united peopleHe added I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all AmericansTrump won with 289 electoral votes compared to 218 for Clinton according to CNN projectionsTrumps supporters embraced his plainspoken style assault on political correctness and vow to crush what he portrayed in the final days of his campaign as a corrupt globalized elite  epitomized by the Clintons  that he claimed conspired to keep hardworking Americans downHis winning coalition of largely white workingclass voters suggests a populace desperate for change and disillusioned with an entire generation of political leaders and the economic and political system itselfNow Trump faces the task of uniting a nation traumatized by the ugliest campaign in modern history and ripped apart by political divides exacerbated by his own explosive rhetoric  often along the most tender national fault lines such as race and genderTrump is sure to follow his own playbookTrump will be the first president to enter the White House with no political diplomatic or military executive experience His victory will send shockwaves around the world given his sparse foreign policy knowledge haziness over nuclear doctrine vow to curtail Muslim immigration and disdain for US alliances that have been the bedrock of the postWorld War II foreign policyHis promises to renegotiate or dump trade deals such as NAFTA and to brand China a currency manipulator risk triggering immediate economic shocks around the globeTrump 70 will be the oldest president ever sworn in for a first term and will take the helm of a nation left deeply divided by his scorchedearth campaign His victory was built on fierce anger at the Washington establishment and political elites among his grassroots voters many of whom feel they are the victims of a globalized economy that has resulted in the loss of millions of jobsHis victory ends Clintons crusade to become the first woman to ever rise to the nations highest office Its a humiliating chapter in the long political career of Clinton and her husband former President Bill ClintonTrumps win also deals a painful rebuke to President Barack Obama whom he pursued for years with his birtherism campaign built on the false premise that Obama was born outside the United States Now Trump will have the power to eviscerate Obamas political legacy  including the Affordable Care Act the latters proudest domestic achievementBut there are deeper more fundamental questions about Trumps presidency that will be key to his capacity to unify a deeply divided country and appeal to Americans who will feel outraged and disgusted by his victoryHes got the attention of the whole worldTrumps campaign was built on rage falsehoods and singling out culprits for the ills of modern America including undocumented migrants foreign nations such as China and Muslim immigrantsHe mocked a disabled New York Times reporter vowed to use the power of the presidency to put Clinton in jail and pledged to sue women who accused him of sexual assaultTrump has promised to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it and to deport undocumented migrants He has vowed to reintroduce interrogation methods for terror suspects that are more extreme than waterboardingSo the demeanor that Trump will adopt as president and the manner in which he will behave will be closely watched  not just in the United States but among nervous leaders abroadOne of the many uncertainties about Trumps coming presidency is how his White House will interact with Republicans in Congress  and whether he and GOP leaders will heal their rift from the campaignRepublicans repelled a Democratic bid to recapture the Senate giving the GOP control over Capitol Hill and the White HouseThat means it would fall to the GOP either to rubber stamp policies likely to mark a break from conservative orthodoxy or to provide a check on the power of Trump who has shown every sign he will use executive power aggressivelyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan will face intense pressure from proTrump members of his own coalition to cooperate with the new presidentSenate Republicans meanwhile are likely to hold Trumps feet to the fire to ensure he lives up to his promise to appoint justices who could ensure a generational conservative majority on the US Supreme CourtClinton apparently failed to reassemble the diverse coalition that helped Obama win the presidency in 2008 and 2012The events of Clintons terrible final week on the campaign  the revival of her email controversy by FBI Chief James Comey and a damaging drip drip drip of revelations by WikiLeaks which her campaign says was orchestrated by Russian intelligence  could have helped consign her to defeatThere also is the question of Trumps temperament Clinton repeatedly warned that he was unfit to control the nuclear codes because he could be baited with a tweetObama passionately denounced Trump as intellectually and temperamentally unfit to succeed him in the Oval OfficeBut now he will be forced to greet his successor on the morning of Inauguration Day in January and look on while he is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States
