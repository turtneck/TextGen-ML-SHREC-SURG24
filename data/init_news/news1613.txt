That may soon be possible thanks to a provision tacked onto this years National Defense Authorization Act which the House of Representatives is set to pass this weekThe provision was added as an amendment during a latenight session at the end of last month during which the legislation authorizing the nations military activities for 2016 was draftedAccording to a white paper prepared for Congress by the Army opposing the amendment the measure would allow the unregulated distribution of up to 100000 Colt 45s more formally known as 45caliber semiautomatic M1911 handgunsThe provision added by Rep Mike Rogers RAla changes parts of federal rules that were meant to boost rifle skills in the country under a program dating back to Teddy Roosevelt Under existing law which was updated in 1996 the Department of Defense makes surplus military rifles available to the public through something known as the Civilian Marksmanship Program which has a regional headquarters in Rogers stateRogers amendment would change language in the law that specifies certain rifles allowed in the program to include the much broader category of firearmsAlthough the marksmanship program aims to educate youth about safety and shooting according to the militarys white paper There is a significant risk of approximately 100K semiautomatic handguns that are virtually untraceable being released into commerceThats because although the amendment specifies that the weapons cannot be sold to people who are barred by law from having guns the CMP sells guns over the Internet and has no mechanism to verify who is making purchases By law the CMP can sell  only to members of CMP affiliated clubs who are also US citizens over 18 years of age and who are legally eligible to purchase a firearm according to eligibility requirements posted on its website On top of that although the CMP is allowed by law to sell guns across state lines it is not covered by the Gun Control Act and is not required to keep records tracking purchasersThe Army noted in its opposition that the Department of Justice has tracked an average of nearly 1800 Colt 45s being used in crimes every year over the last decade including a significant but unspecified number of those guns that were originally military surplusA spokesman for Rep Adam Smith Wash the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee said his boss agreed with the Army and would try to strip the amendmentThis provision which the Army has said it does not want or need could potentially put nearly 100000 untraceable 45caliber militarygrade handguns on our streets the spokesman Michael Amato said in an email This provision is an unnecessary risk
