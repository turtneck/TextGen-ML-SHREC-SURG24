Australian taxpayers charged over 88 million for donation to corrupt Clinton Foundation October 31 2016 Google  They both love to play the gender card turning their immense privilege into victim status and dividing the electorate by sexThus Gillard nobbled Tony Abbott with her fabled misogyny speech and Clintons machine manages to drown out every Wikileaks embarrassment with a new Donald Trump bimbo eruption The other thing the two ladies have in common is the Clinton Foundation  which Wikileaks emails now show is an influencepeddling political slush fund And guess which country was one of its biggest donors Australia Yep were up there with Saudi Arabia and Qatar The Australian taxpayer shovelled at least 88 million into the Clinton Foundation and associated entities from 2006 to 2014 reaching a peak of 103 million in 201213 Gillards last year in office Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard both involved in the influencepeddling political slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation On the Clinton Foundation website AusAID and the Commonwealth of Australia score separate entries in the 10 millionplus group of donors one rung up from American teacher unions In 200910 Kevin Rudd handed over another 10 million to the foundation for climate research part of 300 million he squandered on a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute Gillard also donated 300 million of our money to the Clintonaffiliated Global Partnership for Education Lo and behold she became chairman in 2014 and has been actively promoting Clinton as president ever since  in a campaign video last December slamming Trump in opeds trumpeting the next woman president and in appearances with Clinton spruiking girls education The Abbott government topped up the leftwing organisations coffers with another 140 million in 2014 bringing total Australian largesse to 460 million according to a press release from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop And yet apart from the beautiful friendship with Gillard what did Australia get from the Clintons for all that cash A whole lot of trouble is what The latest treasure trove of Wikileaks emails released last week shows that Australian green groups have been secretly funded to destroy our coal industry by environmental activists connected to the Clinton campaign Apart from the friendship between Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard what does Australia get from the Clinton Foundation for donating all that cash A whole lot of trouble is what The email account of Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta reveals extraordinary details of the sabotage of the 16 billion Adani coalmine in Queensland which has damaged Australias national interest and denied cheap electricity to millions of poor Indians Last August John Hepburn former Greenpeace activist and founder of Australian anticoal group the Sunrise Project sent a crowing email to his American paymasters the Sandler Foundation which is also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation Founder Herb Sandler and mate George Soros funded another Clintonaligned progressive group the Centre for American Progress previously chaired by Podesta The Adani Carmichael mine and the whole Galilee Basin fossil fuel industrial complex is in its death throes Hepburn wrote in the email forwarded to Podesta I am going to buy a few bottles of bubbly for a celebration with the Environmental Defenders Office legal team our colleagues at GetUp Greenpeace 350org ECF Australian Youth Climate Coalition Mackay Conservation Group Market Forces and the brilliant and tireless Sunrise team In another email forwarded to Podesta Hepburn panics about an Abbott government inquiry into environmental charities and discusses hiding Sunrises sources of funding to safeguard its charitable tax status Hepburn boasts about the latest legal blow to Adani when the Federal Court overturned its approval and the Commonwealth Bank quit the project In it he now wants to escalate the campaign towards the other 3 big Australian banks And he mocks miners who try to claim that there is some kind of foreignfunded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systematically destroy the Australian coal industry I seriously dont know where they get these wacky ideas from As if its not bad enough that foreignfunded activists are meddling with our largest export earner Podestas emails also detail their insidious influence on indigenous land owners who blocked the Adani mine using powerful native title rights This alliance of green groups with native title owners is a frightening development detailed in a new book by historian Keith Windschuttle The Breakup of Australia The Real Agenda behind Aboriginal Recognition He reveals the imminent expansion of native title claims either approved or quietly being processed stretch across a whopping 60 per cent of the Australian continent an area twice the size of Western Europe Already 6000sq km of the Kidman cattle empire in the Kimberley has been given via native title to green activists to be converted from productive cattle country to a wildlife conservation area In return the Yulumbu people get a paltry 50000 a year royalty Windschuttle writes As a flora and fauna sanctuary it is economically defunct for the foreseeable future At worst writes Windschuttle the upcoming referendum for indigenous constitutional recognition proposed by Gillard in 2012 could pave the way for a separate Aboriginal state on native title land funded by taxation royalties and lease payments  passive welfare in another guise At the very least the alliance between foreignfunded green groups and indigenous owners gives environmentalists the opportunity to take whole swathes of Australia out of the productive economy and shut down industries they dont like from coal mines in Queensland to cattle farms in Western Australia Thanks for nothing Hillary and Julia
