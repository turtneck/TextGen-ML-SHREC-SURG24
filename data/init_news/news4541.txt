October 31 2016  Fort Russ   Aleksandr Khrolenko R IA Analytics   translated by J Arnoldski   Hardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information In July 2013 according to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand  In October 2014 the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Raad alHussein determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200000  By October 2015 according to UN figures the number of killed in Syria was more than 240000 In September 2016 the UN officially presented the figure of 300000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees According to the Dubai news channel AlArabiya in October 2015 the number of killed had already surpassed 250000 The New York Times produced similar figures After the beginning of the Russian air forces operation in Syria the figures of casualties presented by Western sources did not change for the better Of course the countries participating in the conflict correct the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the Supervisory Board on Human Rights of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights created by the opposition How objective are these disseminated figures  The Russian Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences has conducted its own study using data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Syria This was reported at a press conference entitled Syria The Thorny Path to Reconciliation at the Russia Today media agency by the UNs senior advisor and representative on Syria Russian Academy of Science correspondent Vitaliy Naumkin  In 2011 the population of Syria amounted to 2251 million people According to the figures of the Syrian Central Statistical Bureau the Syrian Arab Republics population has declined to 1787 million  Given the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees the total number for today was supposed to be 2464 million people As of October 20th 2016 the number of Syrian citizens including emigrants is 2454 million  Given correct calculations the number of Syrians killed over five years of war has been determined taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left Syria as refugees According to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences the total number of Syrians killed is 105000 The losses of the government army and militia amount to 45000 24000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed and 35000 civilians have been killed The largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the socalled moderate opposition Around 18000 in Syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries  Earlier the exhead of the Israeli secret services Nativ Yaakov Kedmi presented almost identical figures of Syrian losses around 40000 civilians American assessments as a rule range from several hundred thousand to millions killed which is beyond the boundaries of reality But the point is not even in the statistics The death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war American lies on the number of people killed in Syria is doubly disgusting because it is the US that developed and attempted to realize regimechange projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of Middle Eastern and African rouge states by means of terrorists from moderate oppositions and fomenting civil wars The American coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on ISIS in Iraq And yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population During the Iraq War 20032011 460000 Iraqis were killed The assault on Mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population Palestinian political analyst Azzam Abu Saud remarked in the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen  The US has made a mass of mistakes in Syria The war in Syria never would have been so bloody if the US had not supplied weapons to rebels The US in addition created the Islamic State which has now spun out of their control Another Norwegian publication ABC Nyheter  adds The US claims that only 55 civilians and 45000 militants from ISIS and other militant Islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11000 coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria since 2014Even when the American leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq and their photographs they refuse to acknowledge their deaths  The Russian approach to resolving the Syrian and other Middle Eastern conflicts remains the same there is no military solution Success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation       Follow us on Facebook
