Is This Why Comey Broke A Stack Of Resignation Letters From Furious FBI Agents   Source Zero Hedge Conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why FBI Director James Comey reopened Hillarys email investigation after just closing it back in July concluding that although Hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her Democrats after lavishing Comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an impartial way have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the 2016 election cycle with Hillary herself describing his recent actions as deeply troubling Republicans on the other hand have praised Comeys recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to Clinton staffers According to the Daily Mail  and a source close to James Comey the decision at least in part came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI who felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist James Comeys decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled FBI director The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against Hillary said the source a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to Catholic mass every week Some people including department heads stopped talking to Jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist According to the source Comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife Patrice He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom The people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him the source continued And that includes his wife Pat She kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state Though were sure there are many facets behind Comeys decision making process we can all be quite certain at this point that hes not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in Washington both in law enforcement and in both political parties In fact after Tim Kaine just last week praised Comey as a wonderful career public servant with the highest standards of integrity  everything has now been turned on its head with Hillary calling his latest moves unprecedented and deeply troublingseemingly implying an attempt on the part of Comey to rig the election from Trump  Meanwhile President Obama and Attorney General Loretta Lynch are apparently also furious with Comey over his recent decision His announcement about the revived investigation which came just 11 days before the presidential election was greeted with shock and dismay by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the prosecutors at the Justice Department Jim told me that Lynch and Obama are furious with him the source said Lynch and Obama havent contacted Jim directly said the source but theyve made it crystal clear through third parties that they disapprove of his effort to save face And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence As such we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post At a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillarys email server isnt warranted OOOOh The remorse The GUILT  I can almost feel it from here Get off it you jabbering fast talking asshole Statements  Reopening investigations Is that a maybe you wiil have a couple of interns fiddle with Emails a little longer and then having legal promptly announce they will take MONTHS and MONTHS to complete the case  We Have AN ELECTION LOOKING AT US We need to know who the bad guys are But then we already know dont we No a resignation is in order  Declare a conflict of interest and turn states evidence would be more like it  You  Are  A  Crook Dir Comey I know ZHers are getting tired of seeing this but for the benefit of any little clueless FBI junior GMen out there that can still read English
