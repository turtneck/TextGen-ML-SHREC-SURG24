With the fires out and much of the glass cleaned up in Baltimore the soul searching as President Obama called it has begun For those hoping to become the next president of the United States weighing in presents both an opportunity and a challengeHillary Clinton told an audience in New York Wednesday the criminal justice system is out of balanceShe called for body cameras for every police department in America and the end of mass incarceration of lowlevel offendersWe have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America said Clinton in a keynote speech at the 18th Annual David N Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum at Columbia UniversityThere is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes and an estimated 15 million black men are quote missing from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature deathThe evening before onetime Baltimore mayor and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley returned to that city and visited with people near where the rioting had taken place Jason Horowitz of the New York Times was along for the rideAs mayor OMalley subscribed to the broken windows theory of policing which was very much in vogue at the time As Horowitz tells it OMalley wasnt universally welcomed to the city he once led but he also seemed undeterredDid you see all those boardedup houses on your way out shouted a man who greeted him in front of the Arch Social Club Please Pardon Our Dust where volunteers made turkey sandwiches handed out water and watched Bonanza I actually did Mr OMalley said You plan on doing anything about that I got elevated to the same rank as you Im a citizen now Mr OMalley said with a grin that he often wears as a shield You made a lot of promises the man shouted And I did the best that I could the former mayor said In what community Not in the black community A few seconds later and a couple yards closer to the intersection a young man named Chris Dickens read to Mr OMalley a list of young black men who he said had been victims of police brutality Ive heard of them all Mr OMalley said I think its tragic and I think we all need to search for a deeper and better understanding Im getting crushed with camerasHis notyetofficial campaign team put out a fact sheet outlining his work on matters of policing and criminal justice reform and proudly linked to the Times article as if to imply OMalley wasnt afraid to mix it up with real people who might not tell him what he wants to hearAnother potential presidential candidate Ben Carson lived in Baltimore for 30 years He was a worldrenowned neurosurgeon who worked at Johns Hopkins University He wrote on Facebook that he urged parents grandparents and guardians to please take control of your children and do not allow them to be exposed to the dangers of uncontrolled agitators on the streetsAnd Tuesday he penned an oped for TimeWhen rioting and looting occurs in instances like this I cannot help but think how important it is to get police involved early on in the community so that the first encounter a young person has with a police officer is not a hostile encounter That is the type of thing that will make a huge difference in this country The police have to acknowledge any shortcomings and if there is unfairness we need to look at it and improve upon that Objectivity is the real answer In order to get there we have to be able to sit down at a table and have an intelligent conversation rather than getting to our respective corners and demonizing each other We need to create relationships Relationships are key to resolutions of problemsFor Kentucky Sen Rand Paul a Libertarianleaning Republican the situation in Baltimore presented an opportunity to highlight his bipartisan work on sentencing reform in the Senate But a call to a conservative talk show host took the topic in a different directionIts depressing Its sad Its scary Paul told Laura Ingraham on her show TuesdayHe joked that he was on a train that went through Baltimore on Monday evening saying he was glad it didnt stopHe then turned to the potential causesThe breakdown of the family structure The lack of fathers Paul told Ingraham The lack of sort of a moral code in our society And this isnt just a racial thing It goes across racial boundaries But we do have problems in our country And you see this and you see that we are close to the tipping point and closer than many thinkSen Ted Cruz on Tuesday called on the government ensure domestic securityToday families are scared Cruz wrote Our government must perform its central functions and purposes to preserve the peace protect the people and serve justiceAn open question remains how long politicians will continue talking about these issues once the conflict recedes in Baltimore and the cable news cameras pack up and go home President Obama Tuesday said more conflicts between police and the people they are supposed to protect even more riots would be inevitable without sustained attention and soul searchingIf we really want to solve the problem if our society really wanted to solve the problem we could its just it would require everybody saying this is important this is significant Obama said And that we dont just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns
