CNN Shes staring down the worst polling numbers of her campaign struggling to overcome the scandal surrounding her private emails and grappling with persistent chatter that Vice President Joe Biden might challenge herBut Hillary Clinton has one key advantage going into primary season A firm perception that shes the only Democrat who can keep the White HouseExcept for Hillary who is there said Brent Budowsky a Democratic insider who worked for party luminaries including former Sen Lloyd Bentsen There is really no one else at this moment who has a chance of winning That is a problem that Democrats face  that is the problem progressives faceHe added If for some reason she dropped out there would be chaosAs progressives swoon for Bernie Sanders and Biden allies float trial balloons and even rumors of an Al Gore comeback swirl Budowskys sentiment points to the reality at the heart of Clintons 2016 efforts While grassroots Democrats might not love the former secretary of state who often seems to the right of the partys increasingly liberal base they appear ready to make a pragmatic choice that she is their best  or only  hope on Election DayThough her lead has narrowed in some instances Clinton is still on top of most polls of Democratic primary voters And she beats potential Republican nominees in most matchup surveysSuch is the power and aura of the Clinton family that few Democrats will go on the record as criticizing the former first lady and many say they respect her and will ultimately support her if she is the nomineeBut from multiple conversations with Democratic activists its clear that suspicion lingers over her true beliefs and instincts Some fear for instance that she would prove to be more to the right of her current political position once in the White HouseAll the love in a party that tends to fall hard for its favored candidates is going to Sanders And after all there is a precedent  2008  for Clintons primacy as her partys apparently unassailable front runner being undermined by a grass roots revoltNew polls are adding to the jittersA survey this week for the first time put Sanders in the lead in a key nominating state  New Hampshire  and Clintons negative ratings continue to rise over the email controversy that has haunted her candidacy and looks set on to drag on for months giving a torrent of material for the GOP to brand her secretive and shadyClintons presidential campaign is hardly setting the party on fire either Shes failed so far to recapture the barnstorming persona which prolonged her battle against Barack Obama for the party nomination seven years agoAnd Clinton often seems a ponderous campaigner  the undeniable connection she has with individuals does not translate easily to the campaign trail and she frequently suffers by comparison with the political magnetism of her husband  former president Bill ClintonAs she tries to prove that despite her wealth and life in the political bubble shes in touch with everyday Americans Clintons choice of campaign events also makes it hard to inspireFor instance on Friday in Iowa Clinton held a wonkish event on cutting college debt  part of an emerging attempt to lay a policy foundation under her presidential bid Asked later about her repeated focus on mental health  one of the core of issues on which she likes to focus in depth  she was unapologeticI think a president should try to help people have better lives Clinton said defending a strategy of narrowing in on issues that preoccupy everyday voters rather than big venue campaign events like the ones with which Sanders is packing out sports arenasThe former secretary of state has also sometimes seemed an uneasy fit with progressives in a party that has undeniably moved left since 2008 Shes dodged taking a stand on issues that fire up the party base in united opposition like the Keystone XL pipeline and Obamas push for a panPacific trade deal  a pact she supported as secretary of stateSome Democrats are increasingly worried following Clintons handover to the Justice Department of the private server she used as secretary of state which is at the center of a controversy over classified intelligenceThere is so far no evidence that Clinton is the target of an investigation or could face criminal charges and her campaign says she never sent email with information that was classified at the time But the latent fear of the unknown may be one reason why Clinton communications chief Jennifer Palmieri sent an email to the Democratic frontrunners supporters this week assuring them the socalled scandal was mere campaign nonsense trumped up by RepublicansSome senior Democrats believe its too early to push the panic button for ClintonIts in the DNA of Democrats to worry and to freak out and a lot of folks out there are worrying and freaking out said Mo Elleithee who worked on Clintons 2008 campaign and now leads the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Give it a couple of months If the dynamics dont start to improve then you start to worry but at this point there is no reason to worryTheres another reason why the Clinton campaign is unlikely be to raising the alarm over nervousness in party ranksDespite Sanders rise  hes basking in adulation and drawing huge crowds for a campaign based on blasting Wall Street demanding campaign finance reform free college a battle against climate change and universal healthcare  many party insiders doubt America is ready to elect a 75yearold self declared socialist as presidentAnd while Biden is beloved in the party stirs deep sympathy following the death of his son Beau from a brain tumor and enjoys the stature of office there are still questions about his electabilityThats not stopping supporters of the vice president  who wrapped up his last presidential campaign in 2008 after barely registering in the Iowa causes  from laying the groundwork for a possible runA draft Biden movement has kicked into high gear drawing more donations and support at a time when reports say Biden is considering whether there is a path to run in 2016The group took in roughly 200000 in the first quarter and has amassed almost 200000 signaturesBut those figures pale next Clintons 45 million haul and the 18 million votes she got in 2008 That current landscape is part of Bidens calculus as he mulls challenging ClintonFor the last week he has been vacationing in South Carolina and reaching out to supporters to gauge interestIf he does decide to enter the race he will add more gravitas to the Democratic field said Jon Cooper the national finance chairman or Draft Biden 2016 He has a strong capable hand and is ready to lead on day one without any learning curveThat decades long resume however could also be an Achilles heel as polls show that voters are pining for outsiders and fresh facesAside from Biden the Democratic bench is scarcely populated by alternative power players Two other Democrats in the race former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley and former Virginia Sen Jim Webb might pose tricky moments for Clinton in Democratic debates But theyre the longest of long shot challengersMeanwhile the next generation of Democratic presidential possibles  like New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand  have yet to emerge partly because of the prohibitive presence of Clinton as the heir apparentAny late entrants to the race at this stage would run headlong in to the Clinton machineThe campaign has quietly been building the kind of comprehensive grassroots voter identification structure in early states to swell her delegate count that she lacked in 2008And shes consolidated her support among Democratic Party elites  a barometer of political strength that history suggests is just as important as polling in early states in the summer before nominating votes are castOn Friday Clinton trumpeted the latest significant endorsement welcoming the support of former Sen Tom Harkin a liberal Iowa political iconI have had the privilege of knowing Hillary Clinton for a long time She and I share many of the same deeplyheld beliefs Harkin said in a statement that may help insulate Clinton from claims she is aloof from the economic woes of many AmericansAs often happens with Clinton however over a long political career marked by fierce fights with Republicans and questions about her trustworthiness good news shares equal billing with unflattering headlinesIts that trend that has some Democrats worried and looking with some trepidation towards Clintons prospects in an eventual general electionIn July a Quinnipiac University poll of three swing statesColorado Iowa and Virginiashowed Clinton lagging behind possible GOP opponents Marco Rubio Jeb Bush and Scott Walker As she has battled bad headlines about her personal email account her negative ratings have spiked in those states and her trust numbers have also taken a hitA CNNORC poll of Democratic voters in Iowa released this week shows that Clinton still beats Sanders overall yet voters see the Vermont Senator as more trustworthy And since July Sanders has attracted cumulative crowds of 100000 people with his soaktherich rhetoricHillary Clinton has been doing well in Iowa but her people there are rattled by the Bernie Sanders crowds which by Iowa standards are quite large said David Yepsen who has covered Iowa politics for decades The polls look good for her now but we are six months away and Ive seen things change rapidly The drip drip drip drip is causing some concern
