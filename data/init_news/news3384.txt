Top Republican senators Friday demanded answers after a military official revealed detailed operational information about a looming Iraqi mission to retake Mosul from the Islamic State saying the disclosure has put the mission at riskNever in our memory can we recall an instance in which our military has knowingly briefed our own war plans to our enemies Sens John McCain RAriz and Lindsey Graham RSC said in a letter to President ObamaThese disclosures not only risk the success of our mission but could also cost the lives of US Iraqi and coalition forcesThe senators asked who was responsible for the briefing conducted Thursday by a military official and whether they had White House approval Those responsible have jeopardized our national security interests and must be held accountable they wroteThe letter follows criticism in other corners that the military may have revealed too much detail in previewing the operationOn Thursday the US military official outlined plans to retake Mosul and said the shaping for the battle is currently underway He said the Iraqi military hopes to begin operations in the April May timeframe with the goal of retaking Mosul before Ramadan begins on June 17The official then went a step further and leaked that five Iraqi Army brigades will be used in the fight as well as several smaller brigades composing a total force of up to 25000 Iraqi troops Three brigades of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters will participate as wellBut the details disclosed at the close of a White House summit on combating violent extremism raised some concernsThat is pretty amazing that that informations out there retired Gen Jack Keane former Army vice chief of staff and a Fox News military analyst said FridayA current and former military intelligence officer also told Fox News that the decision to publicly announce the plan was counterintuitive because it telegraphs the timing and number of units involved The officers said it would allow Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL to prepare for the battle by laying improvised explosive devicesBoth officers questioned whether political considerations on the part of the Obama administration factored into the decision to announce the offensiveThe Obama administration wasnt the first to discuss plans to retake Mosul however Iraqi government leaders previously had talked about the looming offensive and Defense officials are pushing back on the notion that anything tactical was revealed on ThursdayCENTCOM sources also stressed that the briefing on Thursday came from the military not the White HouseKeane suggested there should be nothing surprising about the fact that Iraqi forces are looking to retake Mosul before RamadanISIS is not stupid he said adding that their fighters already know that Mosul is the key to any counteroffensive and have likely been preparing for weeks This is not something new to ISISHowever Keane said the details about the force size and other elements were surprising to hearISIS militants overtook Mosul last June as the group marched across large sections of Iraq and Syria sending Iraqi forces fleeing At this point officials estimate there are between 1000 to 2000 ISIS insurgents in the city of Mosul Military leaders have been talking about retaking the city for some time but they have said they wont launch the operation until the Iraqi troops are readyIncluded in the force would be a brigade of Iraqi counterterrorism forces who have been trained by US special operations forces The brigades include roughly 2000 troops eachThe CENTCOM official said the US will provide military support for the operation including training air support intelligence and surveillance The official said there has been no decision made yet on whether to send in some US ground troops to help call in airstrikesBut by the same token if theyre not ready if the conditions are not set if all the equipment they need is not physically there and they arent trained to a degree in which they will be successful we have not closed the door on continuing to slide that to the right he saidThe official also revealed for the first time that Qatar has agreed to host a training site for coalition forces to train moderate Syrian rebels who would return to Syria to fight the Islamic State forces there Other sites are in Turkey Jordan and Saudi Arabia
