Cathy Cuthbertson once worked at what might be thought of as a command post of political correctness  the campus of a prestigious liberal arts college in OhioYou know I couldnt say Merry Christmas And when we wrote things we couldnt even say he or she because we had transgender People of color I mean we had to watch every word that came out of our mouth because we were afraid of offending someone but nobodys afraid of offending me the former administrator saidAll of which helps explain why the 63yearold grandmother showed up at a recent Donald Trump rally in Hilton Head Island SC where she moved when she retired a year agoThe Republican frontrunner is saying what a lot of Americans are thinking but are afraid to say because they dont think that its politically correct she said But were tired of just standing back and letting everyone else dictate what were supposed to think and doIn the 2016 Republican presidential primary season political correctness has become the allpurpose enemy The candidates have suggested that it is the explanation for seemingly every threat that confronts the country terrorism illegal immigration an economic recovery that is leaving many behind to name just a fewOthers argue that growing antipathy to the notion of political correctness has become an allpurpose excuse for the inexcusable They say it has emboldened too many to express racism sexism and intolerance which endure even as the country grows more diverseDriving powerful sentiments underground is not the same as expunging them said William A Galston a Brookings Institution scholar who advised President Bill Clinton What were learning from Trump is that a lot of people have been biting their lips but not changing their mindsDonald Trumps provocative first TV ad raises the temperature of GOP raceOne thing is clear Trump is channeling a very mainstream frustrationIn an October poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University 68 percent agreed with the proposition that a big problem this country has is being politically correctIt was a sentiment felt strongly across the political spectrum by 62 percent of Democrats 68 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans Among whites 72 percent said they felt that way but so did 61 percent of nonwhitesPeople feel tremendous cultural condescension directed at them and that their values are being smirked at laughed at by the political and media elite said GOP strategist Steve SchmidtPolitical correctness are the two words that best respond to everything that a conservative feels put upon added pollster Frank Luntz who has advised Republicans The label is he said a validation that what many on the right see as legitimate policy and cultural differences are not the same as racism sexism or heartlessnessAllegations of racism and sexism have turned into powerful silencing devices Galston agreed You can be opposed to affirmative action without being a racistThe PC backlash does not necessarily mean that people support the kinds of things that Trump is saying or the way he says themWhen the Fairleigh Dickinson pollsters added his name to the same question  prefacing it with Donald Trump said recently    the numbers dropped sharply Only 53 percent said they agree that political correctness is a major problemThis is not a new debate It has raged since at least the early 1990s when college campuses began adopting speech codes Some went well beyond obvious slurs  with animal rights activists contending for instance that the word petwas disrespectful and should be changed to companion animalMore recently the PC wars have flared again in academia where there is an ongoing argument over whether campuses should be a safe space where students are protected from upsetting ideas and receive trigger warnings when course material contains distressing informationFew would argue that it is wrong to confront and eliminate prejudice But even some liberals have called political correctness a form of McCarthyism aimed at stifling free expressionTrump has brought the question from the university quad to the political arena in a way that no leading candidate has in the pastFor many its satisfying to have a loud tribune like Trump said David Axelrod who was President Obamas top campaign adviser But I dont think the hunger for authentic plain speech is Trumpspecific One of the appeals of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is that people think he says exactly what he thinks and is not passing it through a filter There is a fundamental yearning for authenticity that is probably felt more broadlyThe edgy liberal comedian Bill Maher who for nearly a decade hosted a talk show called Politically Incorrect has said that Trumps ideas sound a little HitleradjacentBut he has also noted a yearning for somebody to say You know what I just dont bend to your bull And Donald Trump Ive got to say I dont agree with him on a lot but I kind of get him Weve been doing the same thingTrump sounded the antiPC clarion call at the first Republican debate in August when moderator Megyn Kelly of Fox News challenged him on comments that he had made disparaging womenI think the big problem this country has is being politically correct he said Ive been challenged by so many people and I dont frankly have time for total political correctness And to be honest with you this country doesnt have time either This country is in big trouble We dont win anymore We lose to China We lose to Mexico both in trade and at the border We lose to everybodyDonald Trump says were all too politically correct But is that also a way to limit speechIt is hard to follow the logic of an argument that insulting women could somehow make the country stronger overseas But the sentiment behind it came through clearlyAnd it has been picked up by other GOP contendersPolitical correctness is killing people said Sen Ted Cruz RTex because it prevents the Obama administration from focusing on the communications and activities of potential terrorists who are MuslimsPolitical correctness is ruining our country said former neurosurgeon Ben Carson after he was criticized for saying a Muslim should not be presidentIt is corrosive Carson said in an interview because many people will not say what they believe because someone will look askance at them call them a name Somebody will mess with their job their family This was not supposed to be the way it was in AmericaLast months terrorist attack in San Bernardino Calif carried out by a Muslim couple who appear to have been inspired by the Islamic State also known as ISIS has become a case in point for many conservativesThey say political correctness has made the Obama administration too timid in calling it what it is  which is why Cruz and other Republicans taunt the president for not uttering the phrase radical Islamic terrorismWhat animates ISIS is an apocalyptic religious philosophy People look at that and dont understand the unwillingness to say red is red and blue is blue Schmidt said We live in a postfact America where the facts are subordinate to the advancement of an ideologyPolitical strategists and others say a number of other forces are behind the backlash It has both a cultural and an economic component and it also reflects the continuing polarization that has grown deeper during Obamas presidencyFor many of these people they played the game by the rules and essentially they got shafted Democratic pollster Peter Hart saidTrump is the voice of an aggrieved cohort in our society  lowermiddleincome working whites who have taken the hit from the big changes in the economy and are angry about it Axelrod said He creates a permission structure for othersCuthbertson for instance made a connection between her frustrations over political correctness and the other things she sees going on around herI look at what I get every month  and thank God I was financially savvy and saved I cant live off Social Security And you look at these people who have never worked and theyre having babies and theyre getting free rent and free food stamps and free medical care she said I couldnt afford what they have on my Social Security and I worked 50 yearsSomething has to be done because were shrinking were being taken over by people that want to change what America is she added You cant say it nicely
