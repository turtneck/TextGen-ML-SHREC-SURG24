Secretary of State John Kerry found himself on the defensive Thursday at a Senate hearing where he was hardpressed to find support for the Iran nuclear deal from either side of the aisle  and sharply sparred with Republicans who accused him of being fleeced and bamboozledThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing was the first on the controversial deal to lift economic and other sanctions in exchange for concessions of the Islamic states nuclear program With Congress taking up the deal and expected to vote on it sometime in September the hearing underscored the deep resistance the Obama administration faces from both partiesFrom my perspective Mr Secretary Im sorry  I believe youve been fleeced Committee Chairman Bob Corker RTenn told Kerry claiming the agreement paves the path for Iran to eventually develop a nuclear bombCritics repeatedly suggested the Obama administrations negotiating team gave in to pressure from the Iranians on key points They question whether sanctions indeed can be reinstated once theyre lifted whether Iran might be able to stall international inspectors and whether Iran might be closer to a weapon once the deal expiresSen James Risch RIdaho said You guys have been bamboozledKerry though vigorously defended the agreement calling it fantasy plain and simple to think the United States failed to hold out for a better deal at the bargaining tableLet me underscore the alternative to the deal weve reached isnt what Ive seen some ads on TV suggesting disingenuously he told the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeIt isnt a quote better deal some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Irans complete capitulationEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz also said the deal is not built on trustSome lawmakers tried to play referee when the hearing got heated Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif said the remarks from Corker and Risch were disrespectful and insultingIf you were bamboozled the world has been bamboozled  thats ridiculous Boxer told KerryKerry still had to contend with skeptical Democrats notably Sen Bob Menendez DNJ who questioned whether the language in the deal is tough enough and like Corker said the deal aids Iran in building an industrialscale nuclear programKerry earlier warned that Iran will not come back to the negotiating table to pursue a new deal voicing frustration that Weve got 535 secretaries of stateThe hearing comes as lawmakers raise new concerns about alleged secret side deals struck with Tehran over its nuclear programSen Tom Cotton RArk and Rep Mike Pompeo RKan first brought attention to them Tuesday saying they learned from the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA that there were two side deals between Iran and the IAEAAccording to the lawmakers one agreement covers inspection of the Parchin military complex and the other concerns potential military aspects of Irans nuclear program On the former they said Iran would be able to strike a separate arrangement with the IAEA concerning inspections at ParchinHouse Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Cotton and Pompeo in sending a letter to President Obama on Wednesday requesting that the agreements be made available to Congress so that they can be reviewedWe request you transmit these two side agreements to Congress immediately so we may perform our duty to assess the many important questions related to the JCPOA Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action the letter saysNational Security Adviser Susan Rice while defending the overall nuclear agreement appeared to acknowledge the existence of the side deals on Wednesday She said the matter of the Iran nuclear programs possible military dimensions PMD has long been an issue between Iran and the IAEA She said they negotiated and concluded an agreement to deal with this issue of PMD which was one of the major sticking points in our dealingsShe added These documents are not public but nonetheless we have been briefed on those documents we know their contents were satisfied with them and we will share the contents of those briefings in full in a classified session with the Congress So theres nothing in that regard that we know that they wont knowPompeo also asked Kerry about the secret deals in a briefing Wednesday and said afterwards that Kerry confirmed that there were in fact side deals and himself had not seen the agreementI was incredibly surprised to learn there were components of the deal that Congress was not going to be privy to Pompeo said adding that he had expected that American negotiators would have demanded to see the side deals being cutKerry said after Thursdays hearing though there are no side dealsThe letter to Obama expressed concern that Congress was being kept in the darkMost troubling Iran and the IAEA reached agreement to resolve issues related to research at Parchin but Congress will not have the ability to review this agreement nor will we know the results of the IAEAs assessment until December 15 the letter saysIt goes on to request access to the side deals so that Congress can effectively review the deal as a wholeFailure to produce these two side agreements leaves Congress blind on critical information regarding Irans potential path to being a nuclear power and will have detrimental consequences for the ability of members to assess the JCPOA the letter saysThe Associated Press
