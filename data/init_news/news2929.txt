Washington CNN The White House is making clear that President Barack Obama will defy Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail who want him to leave the momentous task of nominating a new Supreme Court justice to the next administrationThis is not the first time that Republicans have come out with a lot of bluster only to have reality ultimately sink in White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters MondaySchultz pointed to previous White House victories over the GOPled Congress  raising the debt limit implementing the Iran nuclear deal and reauthorizing the ExportImport Bank  and said history shows Republicans fell back when their positions arent tenableWashington is in tumult after the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia which left a turbulent White House race transformed a lameduck president back at the center of the political storm and Senate Republican leaders juggling an electoral hand grenade After the shock of Scalias passing and the swift eruption of a bitter partisan feud over his replacement Obama and his GOP adversaries are digging in for a showdownSchultz emphasized Obamas plans to nominate a successor to Scalia and said its the Senates job to fulfill its constitutional duty to consider that nomineeThere are no caveats The Constitution does not include exemptions for election years or for the presidents last term in office Theres no exemption for when a vacancy could tip the balance of the court Schultz saidBut he said Obama wont select a nominee immediatelyThe president will take the time and rigor this process deserves before selecting a nominee I would not anticipate an announcement this week especially given that the Senate is out of recess Schultz said Monday But as soon as the Senate returns the president was very clear that hes going to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to nominate a successor to Justice ScaliaThat position ensures a titanic fight over Scalias replacement placing Obama on a collision course with Republicans while thickening the plot of an election that now leaves the White House the Senate and the nations top court up for grabsGOP presidential candidates are leading the charge in the battle over a replacement for Scalia a beloved icon for conservatives who was found dead at the age of 79 at a resort in West Texas on Saturday They are warning that since an appointment could remake the court for a generation as key legal battles over abortion rights affirmative action and campaign finance loom it should be put off until next yearThis is for the people to decide Texas Sen Ted Cruz said at a rally in South Carolina on Monday I intend to make 2016 a referendum on the US Supreme CourtRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already warned Obama not to try to fill the vacancy on the Court saying it should be up to a new president to weigh in once voters have spoken in NovemberMcConnell must navigate a treacherous political moment and decide whether a Republican maneuver to block a confirmation process could benefit his party at the polls or risk driving up Democratic turnout in November and put his grip on the Senate at riskSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid and several other Democrats want Obama to choose a Supreme Court nominee who would inflict maximum political pain on Republicans because he or she would be very difficult for the GOP to oppose according to two Democratic sourcesIn other words some influential Senate Democrats want Obama to choose a nominee who Republicans would ordinarily support but are only opposing now because its an election year This they believe would allow them to paint the GOP as intransigent and well outside of the mainstream undermining the Senate GOPs electionyear argument that they are committed to governing in a bipartisan mannerGoing this route they believe would increasingly ratchet up pressure on atrisk Republicans who are facing tough reelections energize the Democratic base and potentially flip the Senate if the GOP stands in their way and denies a popular nominee a voteReid spoke with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough shortly after Scalias death according to a source familiar with the callIts unclear who specifically Reid wants in the post Some Democrats point to appellate judge Sri Srinivasan who would be the first justice of South Asian descent serving on the court and was confirmed to his current post by a 970 vote in 2013I think the president past is prologue will nominate someone who is in the mainstream Sen Chuck Schumer DNew York the likely incoming Democratic leader said SundayBut several other Democrats are also pointing to other potential groundbreaking choices and candidates who dont hold judicial posts including Sens Amy Klobuchar DMinnesota and Cory Booker DNew JerseyThe sudden political crisis also put one group of Republicans  swingstate senators whose seats could dictate whether the GOP can hang on to the chamber in November  in a difficult position Privately senior Democratic officials told CNN that theres little chance of Obamas nominee winning confirmation unless these endangered GOPers break ranksOne vulnerable incumbent Sen Mark Kirk of Illinois would not say if they wanted the Senate to deny Obamas nominee a voteSen Joe Manchin a centrist Democrat from West Virginia who often votes with Republicans wants the Senate to act on a nominee when the President puts one forward an aide to the senator told CNNBut several others made clear they stood with Republican leaders who believe that the issue could invigorate conservative turnout in NovemberI strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the US Senate Sen Ron Johnson of Wisconsin a vulnerable incumbent said in an email to CNNAnd in a statement Sen Kelly Ayotte a New Hampshire Republican facing a competitive reelection fight in 2016 said the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee until a new president is electedWere in the midst of a consequential presidential election year Ayotte said and Americans deserve an opportunity to weigh in given the significant implications this nomination could have for the Supreme Court and our country for decades to comeOn Monday Sen Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania became the fourth of five swingstate Republicans to back McConnells strategyWe should honor Justice Scalias legacy and we should put off a decision on his replacement until the newlyelected president can make his or her choice Toomey said in a statementSen Rob Portman an Ohio Republican up for reelection this year also said Monday he thought the future president should nominate Scalias replacementWhether the next president is a Republican or Democrat I will judge any nominee on the merits as I always have Portman said in a statement
