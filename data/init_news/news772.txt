A gay man is selling beer during the NBA playoffsIn a lighthearted ad airing repeatedly during the pro basketball games television and Broadwaystar Neil Patrick Harris is hawking Heineken Light I noticed the commercial in part because its such a stark counterpoint to a more traditional alcohol ad airing during the playoffsIn that ad part of a series actor Ray Liotta sidles up to a bar silent and cool staring down another guy who lacks the requisite guyness to order the same 1800 Tequila as Liotta Before Liotta another actor who became famous playing a mobster Michael Imperioli played the tequila brands tough guy The chief creative officer of the ad agency behindthe Liottaads told Adweek Its about what tequila used to be which is mystery and toughness  a guys guys drinkActually its about something even more rudimentary preying dully predictably on masculine insecurity for profitBeer advertising has traditionally been a bro world with a visual vocabulary limited to stereotypical expressions of masculinity Tough guys and hot babes rule Heineken is offering a different vision Although light beer tends to get less macho treatment a clever funny glib gay Tonywinning songanddance man is not the beerhawking norm  Harriss past engagement with bro culture notwithstandingA few years ago Heineken targeted masculine insecurity in the ugliest way basically marketing misogyny in 12ounce increments An ad featured Jay Z fetching himself a Heineken and disregarding a female friends request to refill her champagne glass Like Liotta in the tequila ad Jay Z conveyed his contempt for theunworthy other in the frame Jay Z is worldrenowned for his remarkable capacity to articulate Yet to sell beer the megafamous rapper went muteA 2013 Harvard Business Review article on brand polarization cited a competition between two hard cider brands in the UK After a new advertising campaign helped transform Magners a cider into a hip drink for young upscale professionals a demographic that hadnt consumed much cider in the past a rival brand Strongbow decided to drive a wedge inthe marketHeinekens choice of Harris seems indicative of a similar kind of polarization although class seems a less obvious wedge here than cultural politics In the familiar landscape of beer marketing Harris counts as counterculturalEven less obvious choices have caused friction A 2013 Cheerios ad featuring a multiracial family may not have been intended to polarize  but judging from the racist reactions it elicited it surely did When the cereal brand opted to follow up with another ad using the same multiracial actors however it knew exactly where it was planting its cultural flagwith the emerging multiracial majorityand in opposition to racial conservativesLikewise a 2014 Cadillac ad that all but screams Republican is too knowingly crafted to be any kind of mistake It traffics in snide stereotypes about Europeans andsuggests that buying more stuff  including a Cadillac  is the reward for people who make their own luck So spare me your liberal sob story about inequality and lack of opportunityThe linkage of political identities and brands isnt new Democratic Subarus Republican Cadillacsas the New York Times reported It makes sense that a polarized cultural and political sphere would encourage polarized consumer branding as well If you watch the Harris Heineken ad and the Liotta tequila ad you cant help but make assumptions about a host of underlying values being conveyed Harris may like plenty of stuff for example  hes rich and famous and can afford it  but he seems a better fit with the Cheerios family And wedont have to guesswhere he stands on gay marriage After Liottas character leaves the bar by contrast its not hard to imagine him riding off into the sunset silent and alone  in a Cadillac with a Ted Cruz sticker on the bumperPerhaps well know that political polarization is easing when we can watch a game on TV without having to choose teams even during the commercial breaksThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg Views editorial board or Bloomberg LP its owners and investorsTo contact the author on this story Francis Wilkinson at fwilkinson1bloombergnetTo contact the editor on this story Zara Kessler at zkesslerbloombergnet
