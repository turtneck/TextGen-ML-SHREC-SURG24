First let us get the known but essential details out of the wayRep Paul Ryan RWis has become what a lot of people consider the solution to the Republican Partys potentially very big and very messy problem in the House Still Ryan is reluctant to vie for the House speaker job He has reminded colleagues and reporters that he is a married man with three young children with whom because ofhis existing work in DC he already spends only weekends The New York Times reported that in recent years current Speaker JohnBoehnerROhio the man who wants out of the job spent as many as 200 days a year en route to fundraisers or fundraising somewhereFor Ryan its hard to imagine how the two travel patterns would not conflictTheres almost nothing about Ryans conundrum that Americans havent heard before In fact worklife balance is about two days away from joining the list of arguably meaningless cliches More than a few public figures  particularly lawmakers  have used the old resigning to spend more time with my family excuse for bowing out of some political race or office Oftentimes the excuse seems dubiousAnd most of Ryans own House colleagues seemed to haveall but dismissed hisfamily life concerns Look closely at all those stories about which lawmaker has said what to Ryan to convince him to take the job Not many have bothered to share a thought  at least in print  on how one might be speaker and a good father to three young children TranslationRyan should be more like them He should leave the bulk of family responsibilities and relationshipbuilding to his wife or the hired help a rising career can buyThe truth is theres almost nothing about Ryans dilemma that many working parents dont know The real and important difference here is that this time this is a conversation that is kind of sort of being had about a manLets admit at least this much The way we think and talk about family life and work generally stays in some wellknown territoryFirst theres childcare costs For amiddleincome family with a child born in 2013 feeding clothing educating and caring for that child into adulthood will cost over 300000 Thats after inflation The figure is 241080 before it But lest anyone comfort themselves with the idea that we must be talking about the cost of raising a family in a big glamorous city or a childhood with all manner of lessons and camps and enrichment activities check out and use this useful government calculator Its digital birth control For realHeres just a taste Check out the full report hereBut that math often leads to the second topic America likes to cover on the occasion that family and work responsibilities are discussed This is the one where people ask in the most obtuse fashion possible why so many mothers are leaving or have left the workforce 43 percent and what on Earth can be doneabout itThe answer is beyond simple Most womenstill makeless than men Thats especially true for mothers And when those who have a differentsex partner or husband sit down and do the math on child care costs and all the other items in that graphic above we strongly suggest you check out the full thing for some work stops making much immediate financial senseWhen all else fails theres the inevitable trend story or Iknowa guywhoknowsaguy dinner discussion about the virtual sprinkle of men who have become stayathome dads This group maybe on its way to becoming a small puddle But lets not pretend that the stayathome dads a large share of which are despite the content of most of most of those trend stories black have become common They are important but remain relatively rareAs Ann Ann Marie Slaughters Atlantic Magazine article and her booklength look at family and work issues have made plain people are struggling and in many cases really distressed by this challenge They are interested in these issues And theres a lot of evidence that as Slaughters book puts it we need to rethink reframe and yes revalue care child care family care family time and relationship building itselfShe said women cant have it all Now shes recommending a revolution in family lifeSomeone is sure to point out that Ryans children are well past the swaddling and wakeupatnight stage Thats true But think long and hard about the implications of that idea particularly if you are someones bossRyan a man in his mid40s has young kids He is part of a younger generation of fathers who while they do not match the time put in by their childrens mothers are spending more time with their kids and doing at least a little more housework than fathers in the past Is that really something to discourageAnd all politics and policy aside anyone who has given the most cursory read to any child development researchknows that children benefit from healthy sustained and reliable contact with both their parents and when possible extended family Certainly Ryan has spent some enough time on Capitol Hill to see the sometimes sad results of another path Is there any other professional community besides perhaps Hollywood where struggles with troubled and outofcontrol children or rocky marriages are the subject of so many knowing jokesMoreover Ryan is a man who came to his family life with a personal history that at the very least has given him real reason to be deliberateRyan found his own father an apparently hardcharging lawyer dead of a heart attack in his bed when Ryan was just 16 At that point as Ryans older brother told the New York Times his older siblings were away at college Ryans mother went back to school And his grandmother who lived with the family had reached the advanced stages of Alzheimers disease Before Ryan even left high school he experienced the toll of a sudden and early death and a slow merciless oneIs it really any wonder Ryans wife said in an August interviewthat Ryans time with his family is his oxygenNow Ryans biggest critics would no doubt argue that Ryans budget ideas havent advanced the worklife balance cause particularly for families with less money than his own But whatever happens the Ryan conundrum should make this much clearIn the United States talent is squandered opportunities are missed and maybe even the common good sacrificed every day because hard choices like Ryans too often have to be made
