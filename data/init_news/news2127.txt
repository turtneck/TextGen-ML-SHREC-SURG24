Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina is blasting CNN for relying in large part on old polling to determine who makes their primetime debate stage next monthThe former HewlettPackard CEO has been rising in the polls since what was widely seen as a breakout performance in the first Aug 6 Fox NewsFacebook debate where lowerpolling candidates squared offBut in determining who makes their primetime debate on Sept 16 CNN plans to count a number of polls from the three weeks before the August debate when Fiorinas numbers were low The calculation could well exclude herIts frustrating to say the least if CNN is putting their thumb on the scale Fiorina told Fox News on FridayCNN plans to take an average of major polls from July 16 to Sept 10 and allow the top 10 on the primetime debate stage in Simi Valley Calif Others will be invited to an earlier debate However the Fiorina camp says because there were far more polls taken in the three weeks before the debate than since CNN will be weighting predebate polls more than three times as heavily as postdebate polls They argue it doesnt make sense to rely so heavily on old pollingIt doesnt seem right to me Fiorina said FridaySince the Aug 6 debate a Fox News poll has Fiorina in seventh place nationally with 5 percent a significant increase from a predebate poll that put her in 12th place with 2 percentA postdebate Rasmussen poll put her in a tie for fourth with 9 percent and this weeks Quinnipiac poll has her in eighth place with 5 percent Some key state polls have her doing even betterIm also comfortably within the top five in virtually every statewide poll that has been taken since that debate Fiorina said FridayA CNN spokeswoman told Fox News that we believe our approach is a fair and effective way to deal with the highest number of candidates we have ever encounteredHowever the Fiorina campaign blasted both CNN and the Republican National Committee for rigging the game to keep her off the main stageFiorina has also nudged CNN to simply take more polls to remedy the situationTo be clear if Carly isnt on the main stage it will not be because her rise in the polls cant overcome lower polling from July but because only two of CNNs chosen polling companies have released polls at all since the first debate a Fiorina campaign aide told Fox NewsAn RNC spokesman told Fox News the party is legally barred from interfering with the medias rulesStill Fiorina told Fox News on Thursday she wants the RNC to take chargeFox News Serafin Gomez and Howard Kurtz contributed to this report
