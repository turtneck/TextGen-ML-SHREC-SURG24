Surprised About Donald Trumps Popularity You Shouldnt BeThere are a lot of surprising things about Donald Trumps campaign He has been atop polls almost constantly for nearly five months Contrast that to GOP primaries of recent past in which a series of frontrunners have come and gone before a nominee was chosenLikewise he seems not only immune to fact checks but is helped when he is perceived to be a victim of media targeting  even when he has made blatantly untrue claims and refused to back downWednesday provided the latest Trump news that shocked shocked many Nearly twothirds of likely GOP primary voters said in a Bloomberg poll that they supported his proposal to block all Muslims from entering the US  a proposal that many legal scholars say would be unconstitutional and that many of Trumps GOP opponents blast as unAmericanBut when you look at Americans attitudes not only on that specific question of Islam but toward politics in general a lot of things that have surprised the political establishment about Trump arent surprising at allLets start with that Bloomberg poll One important caveat of this poll is that its primary voters not all GOP voters Conventional wisdom says that primary voters of either party tend to have more extreme views than voters writ large but they are who pick a nomineeIts true that Americans view Muslims more negatively than they do any other major religious group as Pew found in a 2014 study On a feelings thermometer of 0 most cold or negative to 100 Muslims scored a 40 on par with atheists 41 At the other end were Jews Catholics and evangelical Christians at 63 62 and 61 respectivelyIn addition a majority of Americans  56 percent  believe Islam is at odds with American values up from 47 percent in 2011 according to a recent survey from the Public Religion Research Institute The results are even more extreme on a partisan level with 76 percent of Republicans agreeing with that ideaIn another new PRRI survey 67 percent of Republicans said that US Muslims have not done enough to confront extremism along with 45 percent of DemocratsEspecially in a time when fear of an extremist Islamist terrorist group dominates the news surveys like these show why some people might be particularly inclined to jump onto the Trump bandwagonAs a Trump supporter told a focus group this week We have to do something And Trump has brought forth the biggest somethings of all candidatesTrump may be appealing to people who already have misgivings about Islam or prior to that immigrants but of course its not those attitudes that are driving his campaign After all his popularity has held regardless of which topic he has chosen to focus onRather a bigger phenomenon may be at work in why Trump and his ideas are so popular polarization Its not clear whether Americans are growing more polarized ideologically that is whether their ideas are growing further apart politically What is clearer is that Americans are experiencing more affective polarization  that is regardless of where their views are moving liberals increasingly dislike conservatives and conservatives increasingly dislike liberalsFor a realworld spin on this consider that 30 percent of consistent conservatives and 23 percent of consistent liberals say theyd be unhappy if their children married someone of the opposite party according to a 2014 Pew pollRegardless of whether or not their political beliefs are separate the degree of dislike and distrust between the parties is really high said Adam Berinsky a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies political misinformation Democrats and Republicans live in different worlds So whats Trump tapping into I think its this idea that the world is going badA few things have driven this dislike as polarization expert and Vanderbilt University professor Marc Hetherington told NPR last month the rise of gutlevel issues like terrorism guns and abortion as political topics  the way race helped resort the political map in the past century and  how closely matched the two parties are Think about how much easier it is to hate a sports rival whos a constant threat to your team than one whos way worse or way betterWhat it creates is distrust Americans levels of trust in the federal government are at nearly the lowest levels on record as Pew reported last monthMore polarization begets poor performance which begets worse trust which gives you worse performance which of course gives you more frustration Hetherington saidA Lack Of Trust And A Want For ChangeNotably trust is lower among Republicans during a Democratic administration just as trust is low among Democrats during GOP administrations  and trust is exceedingly low among Republicans right nowAll of that creates a perfect environment for a Trump to arise right now in the Republican Party Lack of trust in government means Americans  particularly nonDemocrats  may be particularly willing to vote for an outsiderSimilarly as Hetherington explained Democrats were willing to vote for the outsider Obama after eight years of a George W Bush presidency Obama and Trumps rhetoric may be vastly different but Americans willingness to vote for change  even if untested  is the common factor herePolarization may also contribute to why Trump seems to have a Teflon skin when it comes to fact checks He has over the years claimed that Obama wasnt born in the US and more recently that there were thousands and thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering the attacks on the World Trade Center He hasnt disavowed those ideas  even given repeated fact checksAnd more important his supporters havent abandoned him In fact theyve become more intensely supportivePolarization once again may be at work When people increasingly dislike their countrymen across the aisle it could reasonably make them more susceptible to motivated reasoning  loosely defined as what happens when ones reasoning process is clouded by emotions such as hatred of the other party and other preexisting biasesMotivated reasoning can happen when new information challenges ones worldview As political scientists from Appalachian State University wrote in a 2012 article When individuals engage in motivated reasoning partisan goals trump accuracy goalsIn these situations people vigorously defend their prior values identities and attitudes at the expense of factual accuracyGetting back to Trump this could lead his supporters to believe some of his more brazen claims about Muslim hatred toward other Americans Sept 11 celebrations blackonwhite homicide rates or immigrants and crimeTo be clear the willingness to believe in unsupported ideas is bipartisan To take an extreme example according to research from Dartmouth College political science professor Brendan Nyhan Democrats were as of 2006 that is during the Bush administration roughly as likely to believe that the Sept 11 attacks were an inside job as Republicans were as of 2010 to believe that Obama wasnt born in the USThe point is that in this lowtrust highly polarized environment when one party is always suspicious of the other things that might have surprised Americans just a few decades ago are commonplace now
