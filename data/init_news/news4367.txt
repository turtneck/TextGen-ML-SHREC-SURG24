WASHINGTON  The US government started keeping secret records of Americans international telephone calls nearly a decade before the Sept 11 terrorist attacks harvesting billions of calls in a program that provided a blueprint for the far broader National Security Agency surveillance that followedFor more than two decades the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed logs of virtually all telephone calls from the USA to as many as 116 countries linked to drug trafficking current and former officials involved with the operation said The targeted countries changed over time but included Canada Mexico and most of Central and South AmericaFederal investigators used the call records to track drug cartels distribution networks in the USA allowing agents to detect previously unknown trafficking rings and money handlers They also used the records to help rule out foreign ties to the bombing in 1995 of a federal building in Oklahoma City and to identify US suspects in a wide range of other investigationsThe Justice Department revealed in January that the DEA had collected data about calls to designated foreign countries But the history and vast scale of that operation have not been disclosed until nowThe nowdiscontinued operation carried out by the DEAs intelligence arm was the governments first known effort to gather data on Americans in bulk sweeping up records of telephone calls made by millions of US citizens regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime It was a model for the massive phone surveillance system the NSA launched to identify terrorists after the Sept 11 attacks That dragnet drew sharp criticism that the government had intruded too deeply into Americans privacy after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked it to the news media two years agoMore than a dozen current and former law enforcement and intelligence officials described the details of the Justice Department operation to USA TODAY Most did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence program part of which remains classifiedThe DEA program did not intercept the content of Americans calls but the records  which numbers were dialed and when  allowed agents to map suspects communications and link them to troves of other police and intelligence data At first the drug agency did so with help from military computers and intelligence analystsThat data collection was one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives the Justice Department said in a 1998 letter to Sprint asking the telecom giant to turn over its call records The previously undisclosed letter was signed by the head of the departments Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section Mary Lee Warren who wrote that the operation had been approved at the highest levels of Federal law enforcement authority including thenAttorney General Janet Reno and her deputy Eric HolderThe data collection began in 1992 during the administration of President George HW Bush nine years before his son President George W Bush authorized the NSA to gather its own logs of Americans phone calls in 2001 It was approved by top Justice Department officials in four presidential administrations and detailed in occasional briefings to members of Congress but otherwise had little independent oversight according to officials involved with running itThe DEA used its data collection extensively and in ways that the NSA is now prohibited from doing Agents gathered the records without court approval searched them more often in a day than the spy agency does in a year and automatically linked the numbers the agency gathered to large electronic collections of investigative reports domestic call records accumulated by its agents and intelligence data from overseasThe result was a treasure trove of very important information on trafficking former DEA administrator Thomas Constantine said in an interviewThe extent of that surveillance alarmed privacy advocates who questioned its legality This was aimed squarely at Americans said Mark Rumold an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation Thats very significant from a constitutional perspectiveHolder halted the data collection in September 2013 amid the fallout from Snowdens revelations about other surveillance programs In its place current and former officials said the drug agency sends telecom companies daily subpoenas for international calling records involving only phone numbers that agents suspect are linked to the drug trade or other crimes  sometimes a thousand or more numbers a dayTuesday Justice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said the DEA is no longer collecting bulk telephony metadata from US service providers A DEA spokesman declined to commentThe DEA began assembling a datagathering program in the 1980s as the government searched for new ways to battle Colombian drug cartels Neither informants nor undercover agents had been enough to crack the cartels infrastructure So the agencys intelligence arm turned its attention to the groups communication networksCalling records  often called toll records  offered one way to do that Toll records are comparable to what appears on a phone bill  the numbers a person dialed the date and time of the call its duration and how it was paid for By then DEA agents had decades of experience gathering toll records of people they suspected were linked to drug trafficking albeit one person at a time In the late 1980s and early 1990s officials said the agency had little way to make sense of the data their agents accumulated and almost no ability to use them to ferret out new cartel connections Some agents used legal padsWe were drowning in toll records a former intelligence official saidThe DEA asked the Pentagon for help The military responded with a pair of supercomputers and intelligence analysts who had experience tracking the communication patterns of Soviet military units What they discovered was that the incident of a communication was perhaps as important as the content of a communication a former Justice Department official saidThe military installed the supercomputers on the fifth floor of the DEAs headquarters across from a shopping mall in Arlington VaThe system they built ultimately allowed the drug agency to stitch together huge collections of data to map trafficking and money laundering networks both overseas and within the USA It allowed agents to link the call records its agents gathered domestically with calling data the DEA and intelligence agencies had acquired outside the USA In some cases officials said the DEA paid employees of foreign telecom firms for copies of call logs and subscriber lists And it eventually allowed agents to crossreference all of that against investigative reports from the DEA FBI and Customs ServiceThe result produced major international investigations that allowed us to take some big people Constantine said though he said he could not identify particular casesIn 1989 President George HW Bush proposed in his first primetime address using sophisticated intelligencegathering and Defense Department technology to disrupt drug trafficking Three years later when violent crime rates were at record highs the drug agency intensified its intelligence push launching a kingpin strategy to attack drug cartels by going after their finances leadership and communicationIn 1992 in the last months of Bushs administration Attorney General William Barr and his chief criminal prosecutor Robert Mueller gave the DEA permission to collect a much larger set of phone data to feed into that intelligence operationInstead of simply asking phone companies for records about calls made by people suspected of drug crimes the Justice Department began ordering telephone companies to turn over lists of all phone calls from the USA to countries where the government determined drug traffickers operated current and former officials saidBarr and Mueller declined to comment as did Barrs deputy George Terwilliger III though Terwilliger said It has been apparent for a long time in both the law enforcement and intelligence worlds that there is a tremendous value and need to collect certain metadata to support legitimate investigationsThe data collection was known within the agency as USTO a play on the fact that it tracked calls from the US to other countriesThe DEA obtained those records using administrative subpoenas that allow the agency to collect records relevant or material to federal drug investigations Officials acknowledged it was an expansive interpretation of that authority but one that was not likely to be challenged because unlike search warrants DEA subpoenas do not require a judges approval We knew we were stretching the definition a former official involved in the process saidOfficials said a few telephone companies were reluctant to provide so much information but none challenged the subpoenas in court Those that hesitated received letters from the Justice Department urging them to complyAfter Sprint executives expressed reservations in 1998 for example Warren the head of the departments drug section responded with a letter telling the company that the initiative has been determined to be legally appropriate and that turning over the call data was appropriate and required by law The letter said the data would be used by authorities to focus scarce investigative resources by means of sophisticated pattern and link analysisThe letter did not name other telecom firms providing records to the DEA but did tell executives that the arrangement with Sprint being sought by the DEA is by no means unique to Sprint and that major service providers have been eager to support and assist law enforcement within appropriate bounds Former officials said the operation included records from ATT and other telecom companiesA spokesman for ATT declined to comment Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge Walsh said only that we do comply with all state and federal laws regarding law enforcement subpoenasAgents said that when the data collection began they sought to limit its use mainly to drug investigations and turned away requests for access from the FBI and the NSA They allowed searches of the data in terrorism cases including the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people in 1995 helping to rule out theories linking the attack to foreign terrorists They allowed even broader use after Sept 11 2001 The DEAs public disclosure of its program in January came in the case of a man charged with violating US export restrictions by trying to send electrical equipment to IranAt first officials said the DEA gathered records only of calls to a handful of countries focusing on Colombian drug cartels and their supply lines Its reach grew quickly and by the late 1990s the DEA was logging a massive number of calls said a former intelligence official who supervised the programFormer officials said they could not recall the complete list of countries included in USTO and the coverage changed over time The Justice Department and DEA added countries to the list if officials could establish that they were home to outfits that produced or trafficked drugs or were involved in money laundering or other drugrelated crimesThe Justice Department warned when it disclosed the program in January that the list of countries should remain secret to protect against any disruption to prospective law enforcement cooperationAt its peak the operation gathered data on calls to 116 countries an official involved in reviewing the list said Two other officials said they did not recall the precise number of countries but it was more than 100 That gave the collection a considerable sweep the US government recognizes a total of 195 countriesAt one time or another officials said the data collection covered most of the countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean as well as others in western Africa Europe and Asia It included Afghanistan Pakistan Iran Italy Mexico and CanadaThe DEA often  though not always  notified foreign governments it was collecting call records in part to make sure its agents would not be expelled if the program was discovered In some cases the DEA provided some of that information to foreign law enforcement agencies to help them build their own investigations officials saidThe DEA did not have a realtime connection to phone companies data instead the companies regularly provided copies of their call logs first on computer disks and later over a private network Agents who used the system said the numbers they saw were seldom more than a few days oldThe database did not include callers names or other identifying data Officials said agents often were able to identify individuals associated with telephone numbers flagged by the analysis either by crossreferencing them against other databases or by sending followup requests to the phone companiesTo keep the program secret the DEA sought not to use the information as evidence in criminal prosecutions or in its justification for warrants or other searches Instead its Special Operations Division passed the data to field agents as tips to help them find new targets or focus existing investigations a process approved by Justice Department lawyers Many of those tips were classified because the DEA phone searches drew on other intelligence dataThat practice sparked a furor when the Reuters news agency reported in 2013 that the DEA trained agents to conceal the sources of those tips from judges and defense lawyers Reuters said the tips were based on wiretaps foreign intelligence and a DEA database of telephone calls gathered through routine subpoenas and search warrantsAs a result the government shortcircuited any debate about the legality and wisdom of putting the call records of millions of innocent people in the hands of the DEA American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Patrick Toomey saidListen to Brad Heath detail his investigation into decades of bulk data collection in the audio player belowThe NSA began collecting its own data on Americans phone calls within months of Sept 11 2001 as a way to identify potential terrorists within the USA At first it did so without court approval In 2006 after The New York Times and USA TODAY began reporting on the surveillance program President George W Bushs administration brought it under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which allows the government to use secret court orders to get access to records relevant to national security investigations Unlike the DEA the NSA also gathered logs of calls within the USAThe similarities between the NSA program and the DEA operation established a decade earlier are striking  too much so to have been a coincidence people familiar with the programs said Former NSA general counsel Stewart Baker said Its very hard to see the DEA operation as anything other than the precursor to the NSAs terrorist surveillanceBoth operations relied on an expansive interpretation of the word relevant for example  one that allowed the government to collect vast amounts of information on the premise that some tiny fraction of it would be useful to investigators Both used similar internal safeguards requiring analysts to certify that they had reasonable articulable suspicion  a comparatively low legal threshold  that a phone number was linked to a drug or intelligence case before they could query the recordsThe foundation of the NSA program was a mirror image of what we were doing said a former Justice Department official who helped oversee the surveillance That official said he and others briefed NSA lawyers several times on the particulars of their surveillance program Two former DEA officials also said the NSA had been briefed on the operation The NSA declined to commentThere were also significant differencesFor one thing DEA analysts queried their data collection far more often The NSA said analysts searched its telephone database only about 300 times in 2012 DEA analysts routinely performed that many searches in a day former officials said Beyond that NSA analysts must have approval from a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time they want to search their own collection of phone metadata and they do not automatically crossreference it with other intelligence filesSen Patrick Leahy DVt then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee complained last year to Holder that the DEA had been gathering phone data in bulk without judicial oversight Officials said the DEAs database was disclosed to judges only occasionally in classified hearingsFor two decades it was never reviewed by the Justice Departments own inspector general which told Congress it is now looking into the DEAs bulk data collectionsHolder pulled the plug on the phone data collection in September 2013That summer Snowden leaked a remarkable series of classified documents detailing some of the governments most prized surveillance secrets including the NSAs logging of domestic phone calls and Internet traffic Reuters and The New York Times raised questions about the drug agencys own access to phone recordsOfficials said the Justice Department told the DEA that it had determined it could not continue both surveillance programs particularly because part of its justification for sweeping NSA surveillance was that it served national security interests not ordinary policing Eight months after USTO was halted for example department lawyers defended the spy agencys phone dragnet in court partly on the grounds that it serves special governmental needs above and beyond normal law enforcementThree months after USTO was shut down a review panel commissioned by President Obama urged Congress to bar the NSA from gathering telephone data on Americans in bulk Not long after that Obama instructed the NSA to get permission from the surveillance court before querying its phone data collection a step the drug agency never was required to takeThe DEA stopped searching USTO in September 2013 Not long after that it purged the databaseIt was made abundantly clear that they couldnt defend both programs a former Justice Department official said Others said Holders message was more direct He said he didnt think we should have that information a former DEA official saidBy then agents said USTO was suffering from diminishing returns More criminals  especially the sophisticated cartel operatives the agency targeted  were communicating on Internet messaging systems that are harder for law enforcement to trackStill the shutdown took a toll officials said It has had a major impact on investigations one former DEA official saidThe DEA asked the Justice Department to restart the surveillance program in December 2013 It withdrew that request when agents came up with a new solution Every day the agency assembles a list of the telephone numbers its agents suspect may be tied to drug trafficking Each day it sends electronic subpoenas  sometimes listing more than a thousand numbers  to telephone companies seeking logs of international telephone calls linked to those numbers two official familiar with the program saidThe data collection that results is more targeted but slower and more expensive Agents said it takes a day or more to pull together communication profiles that used to take minutesThe White House proposed a similar approach for the NSAs telephone surveillance program which is set to expire June 1 That approach would halt the NSAs bulk data collection but would give the spy agency the power to force companies to turn over records linked to particular telephone numbers subject to a court order
