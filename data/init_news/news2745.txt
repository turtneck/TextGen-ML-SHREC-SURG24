PAY TO PLAY  Hillarys Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her 28 Million PAY TO PLAY  Hillarys Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her 28 Million Breaking News By TruthFeedNews October 31 2016 By Richard Pollock  DailyCaller Hillary Clinton did two huge favors for Morocco during her tenure as secretary of state while the Clinton Foundation accepted up to 28 million in donations from the countrys ruler King Mohammed VI according to new information obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Clinton and Environmental Protection Agency EPA chief Lisa Jackson tried to shut down the Floridabased Mosaic Company in 2011 operator of Americas largest phosphate mining facility Jacksons close ties and loyalty to the Clintons were revealed when she joined the Clinton Foundations board of directors in 2013 just months after she left the EPA Jackson is also close to John Podesta  Clintons national campaign chairman Moroccos stateowned phosphate company OCP would ostensibly have benefited from Jacksons move to shut down Mosaic Mohammed donated up to 15 million to the Clinton Foundation through OCP Clinton also relaxed US foreign aid restrictions on Morocco thus allowing US funds to be used in the territory of Western Sahara where OCP operates phosphate mining operations The aid restrictions stemmed from Moroccos illegal occupation of the territory since 1974 Morocco is repeatedly condemned for seizing the territory and for unilaterally extracting the countrys valuable minerals impoverishing whats left of the local Sahrawi Arabs No nation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and the United Nations Security Council legal office and the International Court of Justice both demand that Muhammed withdraw his claim over the territory and end illegal extraction of minerals An email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton while acting as secretary of state negotiated an additional 12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative CGI meeting in Marrakech Morocco Another 1 million payment came from OCP to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting The regulatory assault against the US phosphate industry began in earnest when Jackson launched a barrage of intimidating regulatory initiatives against Mosaic Environmental concerns about phosphates date from 1979 but the EPA did little to address concerns related to phosphate mining until Jacksons 2011 moves The regulatory assault on the US phosphate industry encompassed several agencies including the Department of Homeland Security DHS DHS aircraft flew at low altitudes over Mosaics central Florida operations in search of environmental problems The EPA also threatened large Superfund penalties which could have bankrupted Mosaic Phosphates are essential ingredients in fertilizers used in American farming Closing or reducing Mosaics output would have cost tens of thousands of American jobs and injured the countrys agricultural productivity It also would leave the US dependent upon foreign phosphate producers but particularly Moroccos OCP The only other countries that mine phosphates are Russia China and Saudi Arabia Rep Dennis Ross a Republican congressman who represents the Florida district where Mosaic operates told TheDCNF he now sees why the EPA went after Mosaic The tactics makes perfect sense as to why the EPA under Lisa Jacksons tutelage targeted Mosaics phosphate operations in my district I was never given any answers when I questioned Lisa Jackson about the EPAs deliberate actions against Mosaic Ross told TheDCNF Now I know why An environmental concern never existed This targeting was all done as a payback to Morocco for donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation Ross said An uproar from Florida regulators pushback from the states congressional delegation and the agencys tenuous legal position all forced the EPA to end its threats against Mosaic Rep Marsha Blackburn a Tennessee Republican who is vicechairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a vocal critic of the Clinton Foundation agreed with Ross saying these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more paytoplay activities at the Clinton Foundation It would be especially troubling if the Clinton Foundation was working with the EPA to suppress the American phosphate industry in favor of Morocco The EPA and Clinton Foundation should be forthcoming about their dealings with the Moroccan government and the American phosphate industry Clintons 2012 support of a rider on the US foreign aid bill permitting foreign aid to be sent to the Western Sahara arguably legitimized Moroccan occupation of territory and depopulated the Sahrawi Arabs Native Moroccans were sent into the country by the government to extract the minerals The rider approved by Clinton said that US foreign aid funds may be used in regions and territories administered by Morocco meaning the Western Sahara The Western Sahara is classified a NonSelfGoverning Territory under international law Previously United States excluded Western Sahara from bilateral assistance to avoid seeming to endorse Moroccan control said Eugene Kontorovich a professor at Northwestern University School of Law in a legal review of occupied territories around the world Hans Corell the UN Security Councils UnderSecretary for Legal Affairs said in January 2002 that if further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara they would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to mineral resource activities in NonSelfGoverning Territories A Dec 10 2015 report by the International Court of Justice ruled that the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognized by the European Union or its Member States or more generally by the UN and the absence of any international mandate capable of justifying Moroccan presence on that territory But none of that mattered to former President Bill Clinton who said nothing about the worlds condemnation of Moroccos exploitation of the area for its phosphate industry while speaking at the Clinton Foundations 2015 Marrakech CGI conference Instead he praised it The Moroccans who are here will tell you that in the last several years they have become the Saudi Arabia of phosphates and what they have done with it to diversify their economy and to make it part of a comprehensive strategy instead of another example of resource curse is very impressive indeed Clinton said Hillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money reported Politico the day after the Marrakech CGI conference HT  DailyCaller Support the Trump
