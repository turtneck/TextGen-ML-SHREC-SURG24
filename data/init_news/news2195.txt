The Obama administration has made virtually no progress to increase transparency and accountability for its lethal drone program a new report has concluded with only months left to spare before the White House hands control of the targeted killing apparatus to a successorThe report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center said the administration is failing to release fundamental information about the program or to significantly overhaul it  even after a 2015 strike mistakenly left American contractor Warren Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto deadWe have seen relatively few successes said Rachel Stohl a researcher at the center The administration has been unwilling to provide the number of strikes even in aggregate the number of civilian casualties that they estimate that have occurred because of those strikes the legal justification unless required by court order that allows the program to continue so even on the most basic levels what is the program doing we dont knowA bipartisan task force called on the White House nearly two years ago to reconsider its reliance on targeted killing of suspected terrorists in part because the strikes may be doing more harm than good by fomenting hatred overseas But Stimson researchers said theyve uncovered little evidence anything like that reorientation has happenedA senior administration official told NPR the White House goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid civilian casualtiesThe official added Unlike our enemies which deliberately and pointedly violate the law of armed conflict the United States takes great care to adhere to the fundamental law of armed conflict principle of distinction which requires that attacks be directed only against military objectives and that civilians and civilian objects not be the target of attackAt least nine nations now have weaponized drones and four have used them the report said Its important that the United States establishes good policy and sets an international precedent that demonstrates leadership and responsibility and transparency over the program because other countries are going to follow the US lead Stohl saidUS government officials have walked a fine line on the drone program which is supposed to be secret Former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden addressed the strikes in his new book and an opinion article in the New York Times Sunday when he wrote I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflictDays earlier lawyers for the Obama administration appeared in an appeals court in Washington DC to fight a demand by the American Civil Liberties Union for legal justifications and summary strike data including the numbers and identities of people killed by weaponized dronesJameel Jaffer deputy legal director of the ACLU said the administration cant have it both waysThe law of the drone campaign should not be a secret nor should the CIA be permitted to withhold basic information that would allow the public to understand the implications of the governments policies Jaffer said This is particularly the case since so many senior officials have spoken so freely about drone strikes
