The Perfect State Index If Iowa NH Are Too White To Go First Then WhoEvery four years when the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary roll around the critics and cynics question why such unrepresentative patches of America get to vote first in presidential nominating contests Why is so much political power they complain given to states that are more white and more rural than the rest of the countrySo we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the critique  and try to come up with which states actually were the most representative of the average of the entire country in what were calling the Perfect State Index In creating the PSI we looked at five categories race education age income and religion We explain the methodology how we arrived there and analyze each category in detail further downBelow is an interactive table which you can sort the results by category So which states came out on topMethodology  why we chose these five factorsIts complicated and true our metrics are somewhat arbitrary There are a dozen ways or more you could slice and dice Census data to decide which demographic factors are most important But we felt that in terms of understanding political behavior  these five indicators were the most importantWe ran the data by Bill Frey a demographer with the Brookings Institution and he insisted that of all the factors we were considering race was by far the most important indicator of political behaviorRace is one where theres a sharp divide between how whites vote and how most minorities vote Frey said The race classification  is a really good indicator to understand something about how elections are going to turn outAnd Frey encouraged us to place a higher priority on race because it often correlates with income education and perhaps even religionBy that I mean  in a state like Mississippi which has a relatively high black population that may also have some bearing on Mississippis income rank and on its education rank Frey explained Mississippi has the lowest median household income in the country as you can see from our tableSo with Freys guidance we decided to give a little more power to the race category All the other categories are not weightedFor each of our five indicators we compared every state in the country to either the US median value or the percentage of the national population That allowed us to see how far each state diverged from the quintessential American middleSo for example in the map below youll notice that both California 385 percent white and Maine 938 percent white fared poorly on the race index but for obviously different reasons Our index looks at the absolute value  it doesnt matter whether a state is better or worse than the US average it matters how much a state differs from mainstream AmericaFor each category every state received a ranking from 1 to 50 We then added the individual rankings together to give each state a final scoreBelow youll see which state ranked the highest in the five individual categoriesWe analyzed 2014 US Census data to compare the racial makeup of each state to the country as a whole We included all the categories the Census uses black or AfricanAmerican American Indian or Alaska Native AsianNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Two or More Races Hispanic or Latino and White Alone Not Hispanic or LatinoAnd the reason we used the Census subcategories is that it gives us a more accurate racial portrait of each state If we had only looked at minorities compared to whites we would have gotten a skewed picture For example had we ranked solely based on minority population combining all the racial subgroups Alaska would have ranked near the top But it has a disproportionately large Native American population a group which has a relatively minor voting effect on American politics at a national levelWe wanted to find a state that more closely mirrors the countrys racial portrait  and Illinois does that almost perfectly If you look at every group Latinos Asians blacks  Illinois respective populations are nearly identical to the countrys at largeThat doesnt surprise Frey from Brookings He points out that Illinois has mirrored the countrys historical mass migrationsFirst white ethnic immigrant groups such as those from Polish and Italian ancestry moved to the state Then during the Great Migration of the early 20th century AfricanAmericans from the South settled in Chicago And then in the last 30 to 40 years thousands of Hispanics particularly Mexicans moved to the cityAnd all of that is due to that fact that Chicago has been this kind of central place that has been emblematic of these different kinds of movements Frey explained I dont think theres any other metropolitan area or any other state really that has all of these elements  Different parts of the country have had pieces of these things But Chicago has had them all in different sequences And so right now we have a snapshot of a metropolitan area thats a lot like the US populationAnd as blacks Latinos and Asians diversified the city Frey said old urban white ethnics moved to the suburbs and the rural farmlands He added that the mix of urban and rural coupled with white suburbanization makes Illinois a good bellwether of whats gone on in the United States as a whole in recent decadesWe looked at the percent of the population that was older than 25 in each state with a bachelors degree or higher as tracked by Census data between 2010 and 2014Minorities of all educational levels tend to vote Democratic but as weve written elsewhere there seems to be a growing political educational divide within the white populationIn Delaware 294 percent of the total population has graduated with bachelors degree or higher In the US as a whole 293 percent has at least a bachelors degree Frey said Delawares mainstreamlevel of education may be due to its geographyIts an important state but it is considered to be kind of a suburb of Philadelphia writ large he said and increasingly college graduates have been living and moving to the suburbs and thats part of what Delaware is as wellHe was perhaps more intrigued by the next few highly ranked states You also see in this list states you might not have expected to see there  Montana Nebraska Oregon Frey said It shows this median level of education is pretty pervasive in all different parts of the country not just concentrated in a few placesWe used 2014 Census data to compare the median age in each state to the US median age of 377Its good to know that Virginia is in the middle said Frey but hes skeptical that it means much because there are a clump of states that roughly reflect the US median ageWhats more important are the states toward the bottom of the list What you want to look at  is states that are kind of on the extremes Frey added And when youre thinking of the extremes youre thinking of some of the New England states Pennsylvania West Virginia  those are states that a lot of the young people have left over the yearsAnd that brings us to New Hampshire The early voting state is one of the oldest in the country tied with Vermont for 47th on the age index In fact the aging population has even become a concern for voters in the state At a recent campaign event one woman described New Hampshire as going through a silver tsunamiFor election purposes Frey says the 65 and older population is key Those are the kinds of populations he noted at least in recent elections that have tended to veer more toward Republican candidates in presidential electionsFrey added that a states median age is often indicative of recent regional migration patternsA lot of immigrants have come to parts of the country and made their populations younger he said a lot of it is in the South and the WestAnd indeed immigration may help explain why Virginia did so well in the age category when its neighbor West Virginia did so poorlyThere are lots of different economic indicators we could have used to measure the wealth of a state the unemployment rate the percent of people who own houses or median household income With the advice of our economics editor Marilyn Geewax we opted to go with the 2010 to 2014 median household income in 2014 dollarsFor the country at large that is 53482Income is a tough measure because the cost of living differs wildly from Mississippi to Manhattan But its also an important metric because the economy is so often the most important issue for votersPennsylvanias income levels are so incredibly average that it differed from the US median by less than a percent Frey points to Pennsylvanias geography and mix of urban suburban rural communities as a possible explanation for economic diversityPennsylvania  has the average of those urban areas like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Frey said And then in the inner part of the state its a little more ruralInterestingly the first nominating state of Iowa also ranked high on the averageincome calculator coming in third But Frey thinks Iowa fared well for different reasons  partly because its an overwhelmingly white state and partly because its in the middle of the country with an average cost of livingThe states that did poorly also tell us something important New Jersey and Maryland were 49th and 50th respectively Both states are wealthier and largely overgrown suburbs of New York and Philadelphia in New Jerseys case and Washington DC when it comes to the population center of southcentral MarylandIts suburban New York and suburban DC and some pretty rich suburbs Frey said Some of the richest suburban counties in the country are in New Jersey and MarylandAnd so even though New Jersey and Maryland did well on other metrics such as race or age they didnt do well in the overall PSI because of incomeThere was a fourway tie for first place in the religion index And thats partly because the data isnt as nuanced Statistics for all the other categories were collected and compiled through the Census BureauBut the Census doesnt ask Americans about religion Given the central role of religion in campaign politics and the degree to which religiosity predicts political behavior we thought it was an important metric to includeTo assess religiosity which can often be an amorphous attitude in itself we used data from the 2014 Religious Landscape Study a comprehensive survey conducted by the Pew Research Center which interviewed more than 35000 Americans from all 50 states We looked at a one specific aspect of this study the percent of adults in each state who said religion was very important in their livesIn the US as a whole and in Iowa in particular 53 percent of adults said religion was very important in their lives As Iowa prays so prays the country  apparentlyIowas mainstream status on the religious index might seem surprising given the extent to which the white Christian conservative vote is courted by GOP presidential candidates there But there two things to keep in mindSo while people might think of Iowa as a religious state its only actually as a whole as religious as the country In fact there are many other states that are far more religious Think Alabama where 77 percent of people said religion was very important in their livesNew Hampshire on the other hand is far more secular New Hampshire came in 46th in the category of people saying that religion was very important to them Just 33 percent of adults in New Hampshire said religion was very important to them And 36 percent described themselves as religiously unaffiliated which means they dont identify with any organized religionIts one of the least religious states in the country second only to Sen Bernie Sanders home state of VermontIllinois borders a traditional EastWest divide in the country  the Mississippi River It snakes across the states western edge separating it from Iowa And its a microcosm of the country in nearly ever category Specifically it ranked in the top 10 for race age and religionIts almost comical that the most perfectly average state neighbors Iowa the state that gets to go first in presidential nominating contestsIn many ways Illinois is geographically and demographically similar to Iowa particularly in the southern and western regions of the state The major difference is Chicago  an urban core the kind Iowa just doesnt haveIts as diverse as the country but not overly diverse Frey said Its probably a little more urban than the country as a whole because of the greater Chicago metropolitan area but a lot of that is the suburbs and the suburbs are representative of much of AmericaPlus he added Illinois also has a rural component which is importantIllinois  may not be a swing state Frey said but in terms of its demographics I think people would do well to look at how the voting goes there to get a better understanding of whats going on in the country as a wholeAnd while people might think of Illinois as a blue state it currently has a Republican governor and a Republican senator albeit one who will be in a tough reelection fight in a presidential yearAlso its only fairly recently since 1992 that the state started voting reliably for Democrats in presidential years From 1968 to 1988 Illinois voted consistently Republican In fact Illinois record is more accurate than partisan Throughout the 20th century Illinois voted for the winner in every presidential election with the exception of two Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and Jimmy Carter in 1976If anything Frey says perhaps Illinois is a racial bellwether In 2014 the countrys underage5 population became majorityminority and so in years to come Frey said the racial makeup of the rest of the country is likely going to look more similar to IllinoisA reality check on Iowa and New HampshireIowa the state that goes first in our current political system according to the PSI came in 16th place overallThats not too bad considering it could have been worse New Hampshire for example was 49th nearly dead lastTo be fair Iowa is representative of the country on most of our metrics with the exception of raceA number of states East Coasters derisively refer to as flyover states  Nebraska Kansas Iowa and Missouri  actually all fared quite well on the PSI especially if race was excludedSo in some ways it seems the heartland is a fairly accurate portrait of average America if it was more racially diverse But race is such an important factor that Frey thinks it outweighs Iowas advantages In the race category Iowa was in the bottom 10 finishing 40th with just a 34 percent black population and a 56 percent Hispanic populationNew Hampshire though is even more of an outlier The only state that fared worse overall was West VirginiaBy every measure New Hampshire is horribly unrepresentative of the country  people make too much money theyre graying overeducated overwhelmingly white and not nearly religious enoughThe question of course is whether these two states should continue to serve as litmus tests for candidatesIts for the parties to decide Frey said but I have to say as a demographer the more stock you put into these two states as we become more diverse as a country the more well be out of touch with what the rest of the countrys going to be voting like
