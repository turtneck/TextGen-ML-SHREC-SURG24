Six men in green ties took the stage in the House television studio Tuesday and House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price a slight leprechaun of a man with silver hair and dark eyebrows approached the microphoneGood mor  top o the mornin to ya Price announced Happy St Patricks Day to allIt was altogether fitting that Republicans rolled out their budget during a festival of inebriation in honor of the man who magically and apocryphally banished snakes from Ireland What Republicans have done with their budget is no less fantastic They have employed lucky charms and mystical pots of gold to make them appear more sober about balancing the budget than they actually areWe do not rely on gimmicks or creative accounting tricks to balance our budget the House Republicans say in the introduction to their fiscal 2016 budgetTrue the budget does not rely on gimmicks The budget is a gimmickIt pretends to keep strict limits on defense spending  socalled sequestration  but then pumps tens of billions of extra dollars into a slush fund called Overseas Contingency Operations That means the funds count as emergency spending and not as part of the Pentagon budgetIt assumes that current tax cuts will be allowed to expire as scheduled  which would amount to a 900billion tax increase that nobody believes would be allowed to go into effectIt proposes to repeal Obamacare but then counts revenues and savings from Obamacare as if the law remained in effectIt claims to save 55trillion over 10 years but in the fine print  the budget plans instructions to committees  it only asks them to identify about 5billion in savings over that timeIt assumes more than 1trillion in cuts to a category known as other mandatory programs  but doesnt specify what those cuts would beIt relies on 147billion in additional revenue from dynamic scoring a more generous accounting methodIt doesnt account for the 200billion plan now being negotiated to increase doctor payments under Medicare and to extend a childrens healthcare programThe difficulty concealing all these sleights of hand might explain why Price was in such a hurry to leave his news conference Tuesday His predecessor RepPaul Ryan RWis liked to give lengthy seminars on his conservative budgeting theories but Price took questions for just six minutes before an aide hollered last question The chairman was gone a minute later and reporters gave chase to the leprechaun Can your budget pass one of them askedI think so Price said before locating his confidence Sure AbsolutelyIt was the latest instance of the Republicans discovering how difficult it is to govern now that they have unified control of Congress In the past four years budget debuts were academic exercises because there would never be agreement between the Republican House and Democratic Senate But now the budget might actually mean something and the firebrands elected in the past three elections need to show how they would handle the countrys finances It turns out they govern much like those who came before them  with legislative smoke and mirrorsRep Rob Woodall RGa one of those on the stage observed that folks are playing with the opportunity for the first time in my short congressional career to actually bring a budget to the United StatesPlaying is a good verb for the occasionPrice a Georgia Republican who ran the conservative Republican Study Committee delivered a long statement imparting his assurance that we believe in America At least three times he held up the 43page budget for the cameras But after the 10minute preamble the questioning quickly got tricky for PriceWhy didnt he ask committees to come up with more than 5billion in savingsThats a floor not a ceiling Price said adding something about an opportunity to provide a positive solution that the American people desireAndy Taylor of the Associated Press asked him about the 900billion tax increase and the Obamacare revenues assumed in the budgetBecause we believe in the American people and we believe in growth replied Price predicting higherthanexpected economic growth would boost tax revenuesJonathan Weisman of the New York Times asked Price if he would detail the 1trillion in mandatory cuts that the budget doesnt identifyTake a peek at A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America Price replied holding up the budget again for the camerasIm looking at it Weisman said It doesnt specifyIt didnt  and thats the sort of trick Republicans can no longer get away with now that theyre in chargeRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
