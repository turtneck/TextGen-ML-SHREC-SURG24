Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday endorsed the threeyear expiration date in President Obamas request to Congress to authorize military force against the Islamic State  backing off his position from just last weekThe newly swornin Pentagon chief testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the presidents new proposal for war powers to target ISIS militantsHe said it gives the military the necessary authority and flexibility to wage this campaign and specifically addressed the threeyear sunsetThe presidents proposed authorization affords the American people the chance to assess our progress in three years time and provides the next president and the next Congress the opportunity to reauthorize it if they find it necessary he testified To me this is a sensible and principled provisionBut just last week at a similar House hearing Carter said such a timeline would be politicalHe said the threeyear sunset is not something that I would have deduced from the Department of Defenses necessities the campaigns necessities or our obligation to the troopsHowever he said at the time that he understands why it was included Carter said last week  and reiterated on Wednesday  that he still cannot assure that the fight against ISIS will be over in three yearsCongressional Republicans and other critics of the presidents plan argue that an expiration date on such a military effort tells the enemy the US militarys plans Republicans also have expressed unhappiness that Obama chose to exclude any longterm commitment of ground forces while some Democrats voiced dismay that he had opened the door to any deployment whatsoeverCarter and other top administration officials adamantly defended the terms of the request at Wednesdays hearing Carter said the request does not include a longterm commitment of ground forces because our strategy does not call for themHe spoke alongside Secretary of State John Kerry and Gen Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffCommittee Chairman Sen Bob Corker RTenn said he hopes the hearing would help start a process where both parties can reach agreement on a new authorization to fight ISIS militants who have seized territory across Iraq and Syria Obama sent his draft to Capitol Hill last monthAs we have received that authorization for the use of military force what we have come to understand is that  and this is not a pejorative statement its an observation  we dont know of a single Democrat in Congress in the United States Senate anyway that supports that authorization for the use of military force Corker saidObamas proposal would allow the use of military force against ISIS for three years unbounded by national borders The fight could be extended to any closely related successor entity to ISIS which has overrun parts of Iraq and SyriaThe 2002 congressional authorization that preceded the Americanled invasion of Iraq would be repealed under the White House proposal a step some Republicans were unhappy to see But a separate authorization approved by Congress after the Sept 11 2001 terror attacks would remain in force to the consternation of some DemocratsThe struggle to define any role for American ground forces is likely to determine the outcome of the administrations request for legislation The White House has said that the proposal was intentionally ambiguous on that point to give the president flexibility although the approach also was an attempt to bridge a deep divide in CongressThe Associated Press contributed to this report
