Every GOP presidential candidate most especially in a crowded field with lots of solid contenders needs to answer a single question Why me and not one of the 20 or so other hopefuls who are running We will look at a number of candidates each with a different argument for his or her candidacy We will start today with the candidate who got the most buzz in IowaIn a recent interview Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker made his own case which I think can be boiled down to 10 key points1 Republicans cant win with just Republican votes he says Forget the ones pitching far to the right or the ones with no sell to disaffected Walker calls them discerning Democrats Find someone who can put together an electoral majority as Walker did Three times2 The GOP needs a standardbearer he says with both the courage and the capacity to win and get a conservative agenda enacted It is an uphill climb for senators to make the case although possible He has been among state leaders in Ohio Iowa Michigan New Jersey and elsewhere who won with a diverse electorate and then successfully passed a conservative agenda3 He has done at the state level the things Republicans want to do nationally  cut taxes implement school choice achieve healthcare reform promote business and job growth and defend taxpayers against public employee unions In other words his record is relevant to this presidential election4 He can articulate well a vision that does not appeal only to entrepreneurs As he likes to say every American wants the chance to live his or her piece of the American dream That dream does not necessarily include starting ones own business but can be owning a home sending a kid to college raising a family in a safe city etc5 He understands Republicans want to boldly chart out a vision for the country Conservatives call this painting in bold colors and he surely did that in Iowa6 He is a feisty pol who took on and beat the left three times in four years He says with the right amount of cockiness I wouldnt be betting against me7 On foreign policy he is as fluent at this point in the campaign on national security as any firsttime nominee in recent memory with the exception of Sen John McCain in 2008 and has only begun to talk about the subject Did Bill Clinton know any more in 1992 But a good deal of the issue here is about temperament Walker is neither unpredictably explosive nor excessively excitable That cant be said about a number of candidates The ability to project steely resolve certainly matters here as does his belief in the United States unique role in the world8 There is no obvious flaw The Pawlenty did too argument does not wash former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty did not have the record nor the political chops Walker does The issue here is Who else could appeal to the full gamut of Republicans9 He is a proven winner Call him the unRomney who lost three times once for Senate and twice for president10 He can embrace his ordinariness his modest background and his lack of a college degree He received no advantage from family inherited wealth or extraordinary luck He succeeded by tenacity and desire  the precise qualities he suggests should allow any American to riseAs we go through the campaign we will look at a number of candidates and ask what unique advantages he or she has As for Walker it is hard to argue he lacks the potential to distinguish himself from the rest of the field The question will be whether he successfully does so
