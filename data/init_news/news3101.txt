share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7in10 Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men but younger Democrats a key group for Barack Obamas general election victories are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats Only about onequarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied compared with 40 of those age 50 or olderWhen matched against the top candidates from the Republican field Clinton Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest
