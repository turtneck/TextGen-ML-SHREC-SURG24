The Republican National Committee triumphantly seized control of the debates last year saying it would not allow a repeat of 2012 when the liberal media interrogated our candidates on issues that were often not a priority to most Americans  We need more conservatives  in the moderators chairBut what was a play to keep their candidates safe inside a conservative cocoon now looks like a trap The first Republican presidential debate will air on Fox News and will be moderated by Bret Baier Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallacewho happen to be the same three anchors that have provoked three Republican candidates into embarrassing gaffes this month Turns out Fox News anchors can make Republican candidates look just as bad as MSNBCsThe RNC sought to install more conservatives in the moderators chair because conservatives still are nursing grudges against some of the 2012 primary debate moderators When ABCs George Stephanopoulos pressed Mitt Romney on whether states have the right to ban contraception conservatives blamed the liberal media for asking an irrelevant question When CNNs John King opened a debate by asking Newt Gingrich about allegations leveled by his exwife Gingrich brought the crowd to its feet by chastising King and lambasting the elite media protecting Barack Obama by attacking RepublicansAt least in those instances Republicans could try the blame the media strategy to limit the damage This year when Republicans shoot themselves in the foot on the debate stage they wont have that optionThe recent gaffes on Fox News by Republican candidates are not because Fox News journalists are suddenly out to get Republicans Its because even a softball question can trip up a candidate not ready for prime time Megyn Kellys interview of Jeb Bush was the journalistic equivalent of a warm hug Her simple Iraq questionKnowing what we know now would you have authorized the invasionwas only a couple of notches tougher than Katie Courics What newspapers and magazines did you regularly readAfter Jebs initial answer which skipped past the hindsight premise Kelly conversationally and neutrally asked for a clarification You dont think it was a mistake When Jeb was done she breezily moved on to a new line of questioning wellsuited for Fox Do you feel that Americas place in the world has diminished under President ObamaBut Fox News teased the Iraq clip before the full interview aired sparking a media firestorm Rivals Chris Christie and Ted Cruz both fervent hawks jumped in front of the microphone to proclaim they would not have invaded Influential conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham was incredulous You have to have a nominee who says Look Im a Republican but Im not an idiot  I learn from the pastTrying to clean up his mess a couple of days later Bush ran to what should have been safe ground Fox News Sean Hannity The host functioned less as a journalist than as a friend helping a friend in need He first suggested the media interpreted Bush wrong and so I wanted to see if I could clarify that After Bush failed to actually clarify Hannity threw him a second lifeline So in other words with 2020 hindsight you would make a different decision Bush whiffed the softball saying I dont know what that decision would have beenUnlike the Kelly and Hannity chats Chris Wallaces recent interview with Marco Rubio was truly aggressive He wouldnt let up over Rubios abandonment of the Senate immigration bill for which he voted You bailed on comprehensive immigration reform  Arent leaders supposed to shape public opinion rather than just follow it  Shouldnt you have campaigned for this He also busted Rubio for a dramatic shift in his foreign policy rhetoric backing off his 2012 support for Iran negotiations and forgoing earlier assurances he was not a saberrattling personAnd those barbs were just the warmup for the threeminute raking over Iraq As Wallace bore into Rubios varying responses the unprepared Senate freshman dug himself into a hole by pleading semantic differences regarding questions about whether Iraq was a mistake and whether hed have invaded knowing what we know now Relentless Wallace asked Rubio about seven times Was it a mistake And he refused to let Rubio answer it with caveats cutting him off with Im not asking you thatIf Wallace were not working for Rupert Murdoch the loaded questions opinionated assertions and repeated interruptions would earn Wallace a lifetime membership in the Liberal Media Elite ClubYou can expect Wallace to be similarly unforgiving at the inaugural debate In fact it was four Augusts ago when Wallace was the foil for Gingrichs first public haranguing of a debate moderator He did not care for what he called a gotcha question How do you respond to people who say that your campaign has been a mess so far Gingrich was not alone Wallace dredged up Mitt Romneys record of layoffs and Herman Cains litany of amateurish remarks Candidates who expect to get a free ride from Wallace will quickly become debate roadkill
