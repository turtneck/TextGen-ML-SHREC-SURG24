The Washington Post returned to Wisconsin this past weekend to empty union halls and a depressed workforce The public employee union law  which barred contract negotiations on everything but base wages and limited annual salary increases to the rate of inflation forced most unions to collect their own dues rather than having them deducted automatically by the state and mandated annual recertification of affiliates  has been more successful than even its supporters hopedIn the state where public employee unions got their start public workers see no need to stay enrolled since unions cannot by law effectively advocate on their behalf Membership in the Wisconsin affiliate of the National Education Association is down onethird the American Federation of Teachers dropped by onehalf the state employees union fell 70 percentThere are fewer public employees working too even though Gov Walker claimed that the passage of the antiunion law would save jobs The Wisconsin Budget Project finds that the ratio of public employees to total population is at its lowest level in at least two decadesOverall union membership in Wisconsin has fallen to 117 percent down from 16 percent 10 years ago according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting a spillover into the private sector labor force as well That will only continue if Walker gets his wish to turn Wisconsin into a righttowork state an effort being undertaken right now in the state LegislatureLocal unions are decreasing dues charges and walking doortodoor to persuade workers to return but it hasnt worked so far The tables have been turned from nonunion workers coveting the good pay and decent benefits of their union counterparts to demonizing them as greedy leeches that must get dragged down like everyone else I dont see the point of being in a union anymore one exmember told the Washington PostIn many respects the point of Walkers antiunion crusade was to destroy the electoral muscle of the main opposition to his conservative agenda But the most important impact of the creeping death of public unions in Wisconsin may be on takehome payThe Washington Post didnt take note of this but according to the Census Bureaus American Community Survey median household income in Wisconsin is 51467 a year nearly 800 below the national average And it has fallen consistently since the passage of the antiunion law in 2011 despite a small bounceback nationally in 2013 The Bureau of Economic Analysis puts Wisconsin in the middle of the pack on earnings growth despite a fairly tight labor market with a headline unemployment rate of 52 percentThis actually undercounts the problem a bit because it doesnt cover total compensation For example in the wake of the antiunion law public employees lost the equivalent of 810 percent in takehome pay because of increased contributions to healthcare and pension benefitsMoreover the meager earnings growth that has come to Wisconsin has mostly gone to the top 1 percent of earners Another Wisconsin Budget Project report shows that the state hit a record share of income going to the very top in 2012 a year after passage of the antiunion law That doesnt include the 2 billion in tax cuts Walker initiated in his first term which went disproportionately to the highest wage earners This is precisely the agenda Walker is likely to run on in his presidential campaign The trends mirror those in the country at large where labor has similarly stumbled Real hourly wages fell for almost everyone nationwide in 2014 according to the Economic Policy Institute except for the lowwage sector bolstered by minimum wage increases at the state and local level Wisconsin has not joined that movement with its minimum wage still consistent with the federal floor at 725 an hour You can argue that squashing unions in Wisconsin had no bearing on income stagnation in the state But you would have to ignore how the labor market works If public employees cannot bargain for wages and benefits they stay depressed And employers who compete for welleducated workers like those who take jobs in teaching and government administration similarly dont have to increase wages to attract their services Blunting worker power in one sector has ripple effects everywhere else as Larry Mishel wrote in the New York Times yesterday the erosion of collective bargaining is the single largest factor suppressing wage growth for middlewage workers over the last few decades And Wisconsin provides a salient example of that Collective worker action was behind the biggest wage announcement in the past several years WalMarts move to increase entrylevel pay to 9 an hour this year and 10 an hour by 2016 This will act like Wisconsins wage depression in reverse retailers will be forced to compete with WalMarts slightly higher wages and the entire wage floor will push upward And while an improving economy tighter labor markets and the need to retain personnel may have factored into WalMarts decision you cannot deny the role of the United Food and Commercial Workers campaign to organize WalMart workers This is not an act of corporate benevolence said Marc Perrone president of UFCW in a statement on the WalMart announcement Walmart is responding directly to calls from workers and their allies to pay a living wage In fact the last time WalMart faced significant labor unrest in 2006 it raised wages as a direct result according to Federal Reserve minutes It like most businesses makes changes that benefit workers only when its reputation is threatened and poor publicity ensues That means that worker voices play a powerful role in wage growth Scott Walker has taken that voice away from public unions and effectively the entire Wisconsin labor movement which finds itself crippled That has real consequences for middleclass wages Since Walker wants to bring this policy menu to the rest of the country in 2016 people on Main Streets outside of Wisconsin should take note
