Maryland is on a roll right now when it comes to lawmaking on womens issues passing two major laws in two weeks that advocates for womens economic security have spent years pushing forOn Thursday Gov Larry Hogan R signed an equal pay law that advocates are calling one of the nations strongest It strengthens existing laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender and also includes gender identityIt really makes Maryland a leader in the equal pay movement said Charly Carter executive director of Maryland Working Families in an interview with Vox Carter helped push the bill through the legislature along with other advocatesThe equal pay law comes right on the heels of Hogan signing the Contraceptive Equity Act last week which makes birth control more consistently affordable That law goes further than the Affordable Care Act by forbidding insurers from charging any copays on any federally approved birth control including emergency contraception and vasectomiesIt might seem surprising that Hogan a Republican would be willing to sign both of these fairly progressive bills that feminist advocates have been pushing for And the new equal pay law in particular was a hardfought battle against Republicans who didnt want it passed or who didnt want it to go as far as equal pay advocates did But Carter said its politically smart for Hogan to do so since the measures are so popular with Maryland votersCarter says one part of the law closes loopholes and makes it harder for employers to justify pay disparities between men and womenThe law also says you cannot forbid your employees from discussing their salaries It also makes it much easier for workers to sue if their boss unjustly fires or retaliates against them for discussing their paySome employers either explicitly or implicitly ban the discussion of salaries because theyre afraid of stoking resentments or revealing inequities And advocates say that this lack of pay transparency contributes to the wage gap Unconscious bias means women are frequently offered lower salaries for various reasons and sometimes employers have no idea that theyre consistently paying women less than men until they conduct pay auditsThe way the system is currently set up is also incredibly unfair to lowwage workers most of whom are women Carter said For practical purposes many of them have little or no legal protection against retaliation All they can do is appeal to the National Labor Relations Board NLRB  a lengthy process that not even all workers can avail themselves ofIf youre making minimum wage if youre making 30000 a year you dont have two years and lawyers fees to go after your employer for treating you badly Carter saidA national law thats pretty similar to Marylands the Paycheck Fairness Act is going nowhere in Congress  like most progressive initiatives these days Thats why advocates are turning to the states to try to build momentum for national action and help the workers they can in the meantimeCarter says that now only California has an equal pay law thats stronger than Marylands But both provide excellent models for other states and the country as a whole to followSeveral other states  Illinois Minnesota North Dakota Tennessee and Vermont  also have very strong equal pay laws said Amy Becker political media manager with the American Association of University Women AAUW And Massachusetts may soon pass a bill that would rival CaliforniasMarylands law does have one thing that Californias doesnt  a provision that tries to go after the mommy track where womens careers get systemically stunted after they take some time off to have childrenThe law does this by saying an employer cant offer less favorable job opportunities based on gender or gender identity For instance if you work in a supermarket and the only real way to become a manager is to work the closing shift but you never put women on the closing shift because you think its too dangerous you either have to give women the chance to work that shift or change your promotion criteriaAdvocates in both California and Maryland tried and failed but plan to try again to forbid bosses from asking prospective employees about their salary history before an offer is madeThis practice is a problem since women make less than men across the board even just one year out of college If you start off underpaid and every job pays you based in part on what your last job paid you youll pretty much be screwed until retirement  and youll have less saved up for that to boot Hogan also approved a new staterun retirement savings program though which will especially help women in lowwage and parttime jobs who dont have a 401kEqual pay laws are just one part of a multipronged womens agenda that advocates are pushing at the state level This agenda also tends to include things like paid family leave paid sick days flexible scheduling and affordable child careThese proposals often come in packages because advocates dont want to split them up and dilute their political powerIts easy to get caught up in issue policy silos Vivien Labaton cofounder of the advocacy campaign Make It Work told Vox this month But the issues people fall asleep worrying about arent paid family leave over here affordable child care over there It really is an interconnected set of problems that people deal with on a daytoday basisCorrection This article originally misstated the contents of Californias equal pay law The salary history provision was a separate bill that the legislature passed but that Gov Jerry Brown vetoed We regret the errorUpdate This article has been updated with a comment from AAUWs Amy Becker and a link citing AAUW vice president of government relations Lisa Maatzs testimony before Congress on the effect of salary transparency on the wage gap
