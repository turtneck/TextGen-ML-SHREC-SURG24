You can call Donald Trump a lot of things  and heaven knows almost everyone has  but you cant call him stupid Hes the lead story on every newscast the hashtag of all hashtags on social media And hes gotten there by defying every conventionThe bombastic billionaire has generated controversy and widespread contempt since he announced his candidacy for president in June yet the latest New York TimesCBS News poll gives him 35 percent of the Republican vote  more than double the 16 percent of runnerup Ted Cruz Trump has defied the experts for six months so have no doubt about it He is very very smart He knows exactly what hes doingThe Feb 1 Iowa caucuses and the Feb 9 New Hampshire primary are right around the corner but two months is an eternity in American politics Theres nothing that cant be turned upside down in a few short weeks And thats why every other candidate for president whether Democrat or Republican should be spending a lot less time right now condemning what Trump is saying Instead they should be devoting their time and effort to learning why hes winningAll they need to do is look at the dataPolitics is all about data now and Trump is generating more of it every day than all the other candidates combined in a week But every time he says something provocative  which is pretty much every time he speaks  he creates data that can be captured analyzed and turned against himWe live in a world where data controls everything and I spend all my time studying how and why In my case because Im a physician its health data But the principles are the same and theyre why whoever best corrals the data Trump is generating will be the next president of the United StatesIn an analysis of his strategy on Thursday the Washington Post reported that Trump uses his Instagram account which has more than 650000 followers to deliver snarky messages and short videos of him scowling as he delivers pronouncements from his Trump Tower desk On Twitter  Trump has posted more than 6000 tweets since launching his campaign in JuneTheres your data Trump  realDonaldTrump  has 52 million followers on Twitter Every tweet and retweet every Facebook post and share every Instagram blast every newscast lead every comment on everything  Everyones talking about Donald Trump which means hes generating a trove of data that his opponents should be mining to their advantageInstead of climbing all over each other every day to condemn him the other candidates should lean back take a deep breath and learn from him  because the next president of the United States will be the man or woman who is smart enough to invest in the infrastructure thats needed to organize and analyze the Trump data trove And with Iowa and New Hampshire coming up fast the time to make that investment is nowDoes data analysis really work Ask Barack Obama its why hes been living in the White House for the last seven years He is the master of using data to win elections by analyzing and identifying undecided voters learning everything he could about each and every one of them and then persuading them to vote for him in the final days of the campaign Jim Messina who headed Obamas reelection campaign in 2012 said recently that Every night for 18 months we did 66000 computer simulations of the election and thats how we based our tactics We based it all on big dataObama is the Big Data president and Trump gets that The other candidates think traditional rhetoric and campaign slogans appeal to voters but Trump has tapped into something every TV producer and ad executive knows Times have changed To get the ratings or to make the sale you need to know the audience and make it yoursWhen advertisers want you to buy something they provoke you They grab your attention and use the data on what youre watching to understand your behavior and reel you in The same applies in television Nobodys watching Little House on the Prairie anymore The shows that get the ratings are the ones that are provocative edgy controversialTrump gets that and hes brought it to the presidential race Hes shaking up the electorate forcing them to react You may not like what hes saying but you cant deny that its working Hes been at the top of the polls for monthsBut that oddly enough opens a door for whoever is smart enough to walk through it A savvy opponent instead of jumping on what Trump is saying should be jumping on how people are reacting to what hes saying Trump has opened up a gold mine of data that any of his opponents can analyze to understand what people like  or dont like  and why From Mexicans to McCain to Muslims all the trash talk and all the responses to it create data that a techsavvy opponent should pounce on Its there for anyone who knows how to use itWe spent two years and about 400 million trying to build up a capacity to predict peoples behaviors and match that with social media Messina said reflecting on Obamas reelection The final 96 hours of the 2012 race a majority of Americans for the first time since 1972 went to the incumbent And when you ask them why 76 percent of those said because their friend or family member talked to them on social media and told them why they had to support Barack ObamaAny candidate who wants to be standing when Trump falls should memorize those words Use the data hes generating to learn everything you can about his supporters and then make them yoursTrump is smart To beat him an opponent has to be smart enough to move away from the chorus of critics and use the data hes generating to defeat himKeep your base analyze the data win over his supporters  and the White House will be yoursDr Sreedhar Potarazu is an acclaimed ophthalmologist and entrepreneur who has been recognized as an international
