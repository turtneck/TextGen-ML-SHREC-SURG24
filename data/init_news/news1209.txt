14th Anniversary of His Passing By Joachim HagopianOn October 25th 2002 the last great hero of the common people in the US Senate was very likely murdered by agents of the shadow US crime cabal government otherwise known as the BushCheney regime His wife and daughter and two pilots also died in the air crash Paul Wellstones story deserves to be retold and Americans need to be reminded that criminals in and out of our government still need to be punished for their unindicted crimes This article was written as both a tribute to an outstanding American patriot and a reexamination of his probable assassination by criminals still on the looseMinnesota Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone was a man of integrity who was among the few politicians openly and adamantly opposing the Iraq invasion as well as the creation of the US version of Gestapoland Security As a fearless populist leader hed been a constant thorn in the side ever since then President George H W Bush responding to the junior senators uncomfortable questions at a reception asked Who is this chickenshit Years later as the only senator up for reelection who voted against the Iraq War when Democrats held just a one seat edge over the Republicans in the Senate with one independent caucusing with Democrats his thorny side made him the 1 GOP target  With the Karl Rove led Republican Party just one seat away from gaining Republican control over the US Senate Wellstones death gave his Republican challenger Norm Coleman the 4949 split and as the President of the Senate Cheneys tie breaking vote would deliver the GOP 5049 advantage needed to steamroll yet more tax cuts through for the rich unending bankers wars and a never seen before boom for the militarysecurity industrial complex Again motive and means tilt heavily towards assassination The facts make it more than probableA month prior to the November 2002 election Vice President Cheney had arranged a meeting with Wellstone threatening him with grave consequences should he vote against the preplanned Iraq invasion A few days later speaking to a group of war veterans Wellstone publicly recalled Cheneys threatening words If you vote against the war in Iraq the Bush administration will do whatever is necessary to get you There will be severe ramifications for you and the state of MinnesotaThen just days after that 11 days prior to the midterm election and a year to the exact day after the deadly anthrax pushed Patriot Act victory  on October 25th Paul Wellstone his wife and daughter along with three staffers and two pilots all died in an extremely suspicious plane crashThe FBI was at the crash site within 90 minutes  indicating theyd left their Minneapolis office before the accident at about the same time Wellstones plane was just taking off that morning indicating the possibility of preknowledgeThe authors note that it wouldve taken agents at least three hours to reach the swampy and remote crash site How they got there from the Twin Cities so quickly remains a mysteryAdditionally the NTSB as the national agency that normally takes the lead role investigating all US plane crashes suddenly wasnt The FBI moved in ahead immediately proclaiming just another bad weather accident Yet all on the ground witnesses and reports disagree from pilots landing at the destination airport just two hours prior to the Wellstone flight to the airport manager who less than an hour after the crash was himself flying over the crash site The plane considered a Rolls Royce among small planes was in tiptop shape and the two pilots steeped in skilled experienceAs the feds rogue cops for goto coverups as in 911 and the anthrax attacks the year before and the 1993 World Trade Center and 1995 Oklahoma City bombing s the FBI has a long shady history of leaving its corrupt dirty fingerprints all over these well documented false flag history changing eventsA couple of brave Democratic House members anonymously stated that they believe Wellstone was murdered In one Congressmans words I dont think theres anyone on the Hill who doesnt suspect it Its too convenient too coincidental too damned obvious My guess is that some of the less courageous members of the party are thinking about becoming Republicans right nowAn unnamed CIA source admitted Having played ball and still playing in some respects with this current crop of reinvigorated old white men these clowns are nobody to screw around with There will be a few more strategic accidents You can be certain of thatA number of other Democratic politicians at a 2 to 1 margin to Republicans have also incurred mysterious deaths holding unpopular views just ahead of hotly contested elections Two years earlier while traveling in Colombia Senator Wellstone had already experienced one known attempt on his life when a bomb planted enroute from the airport was discovered Since that plot failed he was then sprayed with the highly toxic poison glyphosateAs a longtime critic of the CIA and covert operations Wellstone was targeted for assassination in both Colombia and in Minnesota by the masters of mayhem murder and deceitful coverups  the FBICIA CriminalsInAction at the behest of mastermind CheneySo far in our twotiered justice system murder pays off for those high up on the psychopath food chain like Cheney the Bushes and Clintons  Renowned investigative reporter Seymour Hersh exposed Cheneys executive assassination ring Cheney used the CIA as well as the military Joint Special Operations Command as his personal army of hitmen reporting directly to him see video belowIf the neocons can live with themselves for murdering 3000 Americans on 911 they certainly never lose sleep over a few more targeted eliminations that include the genocidal 4 million Muslim bloodbath caused by the Bush crime family warsThe heavyhanded BushCheney push for Iraq War and a DHS congressional vote prior to their 2003 invasion cast enormous high stakes in the Senate Then add the known history of contempt from former CIA director Bush the Cheney threat just days prior to Wellstones death a slew of brazenly contradictory crash site anomalies  and the exposed murderous means used to pass the Patriot Act and the 911 false flag tragedy the year prior all of this circumstantial evidence taken together strongly points to yet more diabolical skullduggery perpetrated by Skull  Bones criminals against humanityThe neocons grabbed the Hegelian solution they needed for waging unlimited war in the name of terrorism anywhere in the world while simultaneously at home merging FEMA into their newly created Homeland Security tasked with stripping away the rest of Americas constitutional liberties in the name of national security In its first dozen years alone deep states gluttonously monolithic DHS cancer has metastasized into the third largest federal department boasting near a quarter million fulltime employees By hook crook and murder the CheneyBush gang in 2003 got what theyd been wanting and plotting for years two concurrent neverending wars in the Middle East and the monstrous apparatus Homeland Security whose purpose is making war against the American people Sadly the rest of the Western vassal nations play follow the leaderIf examined according to the Hegelian Dialectic of 1 problem 2 reaction and 3 solution a draconian formula used by deep state to manufacture increased authoritarian control over the US populace Paul Wellstones death can easily be explainedMore than any other single member of Congress the Minnesota senator posed a serious threat as the major opposition leader standing in the way of war criminals Bush and Cheneys Iraq invasion as well as their formation of the Department of Homeland Security two preplanned agendas rooted in the neocon think tank the Project for a New American Century PNAC Prior to their stealing the 2000 election and their PNACs Pearl Harbor event they created called 911 their regime had already called for attacking Iraq for regime change and erection of the DHS cancer The BushCheney reaction to their problem Paul Wellstone was to assassinate him making it appear as an accidentBy murder once Wellstone was out of the way the neocons solution sent a loud and clear message of intimidation and a death threat in order to effectively silence any other potential Congressional opponents to the war in Iraq Wellstones elimination paved the way for the war criminals successful campaign to win national support for the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq That said the month before the invasion on February 15th 1015 million people around the world in over 600 cities assembled in massive protest against the US intervention the biggest one day antiwar demonstration in history But unfortunately once the US military occupation began the antiwar movement gradually fizzled outAnd the PNAC members of PNAC project image left calling for regime change in seven sovereign nations including Iraq within five years was underway The predatory rape and pillaging of Iraq as the worlds second largest oil producer was justified by lies of Saddams nonexistent WMDs and ties to terrorism Sadly the neocons who are still at the helm wreaking havoc in 2016 were able to implement an enormous new Department of Homeland Security monstrosity masquerading as public safeguard against terrorism So without Wellstone and virtually no further opposition in Congress the neocons created their multibillion dollar security state apparatchik promoting and enforcing draconian counterterrorism laws leading to increasing centralized authoritarian government control that is ushering in their New World OrderThis tried and true Hegelian strategy has also been regularly utilized to further identify deep state obstacles as problems based on perceived neocons threats to US global unipolar hegemonyAmerican Empires relentless efforts to isolate weaken and target for global war designated international enemies Russia China and Iran through propagandized demonization and orchestrating fake crises illustrate yet more examples of the Hegelian Dialectic in action And just as the US crime cabal was successful in eliminating Wellstone as their New World Order threat for decades the crime cabal government has been planning its war against identified American dissenters as enemies of the state who object to its heavyhanded tyrannyPaul Wellstones courageous opposition to the powerful Washington establishments evil cost him and his familys life Since we Americans are now in the same crosshairs of the same still entrenched shadow assassins its time to make their arrests for treason and mass murder prior to our own death and destructionJoachim Hagopian is a West Point graduate and
