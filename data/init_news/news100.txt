In 2008 in the highprofile Supreme Court gunrights case called District of Columbia v Heller a brief was filed from the eighth floor of the Price Daniel Sr State Office Building in Austin Texas specifically from the corner office of the man who was then the states solicitor general Ted CruzThe brief took a strong stance on the divisive question of whether the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to own guns or just protects state and local militias The brief argued forcefully for the first view writing that the individual right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right and that an individual right that can be altogether abrogated is no right at all Thirty attorneys general from other states signed onToday with the White House pushing new gun restrictions and Cruzs candidacy riding on next months Iowa caucuses its no surprise that the Texas Republican would embrace gun rights as a defining issue holding an event at a firing range and even raffling off an engraved 12gauge shotgun as a campaign promotionIn 2008 the situation was very different he was wading into a case that had no immediate connection to Texas at all But to see the signature of R Ted Cruz on the brief would not have surprised the nine Supreme Court justices in the least By that time Cruz had been solicitor general for five years and inserting himself into a case of wide prominence and importance regardless of any direct tie to Texas had become part of his playbook He clearly saw the Heller case as a watershed in gun rights writing that it would determine whether the Second Amendment has any modern relevance And he was right The Supreme Court in a 54 decision shot down the Washington DC handgun ban and ruled for the first time in the history of this country that the amendment ensures an individual persons right to have a gun for selfdefense The National Rifle Association recognized Cruzs role with a resolutionAs Cruz climbs to the top of the Republican presidential field the fiveplus years he served as the solicitor general of Texas remain the most important period in his public rsum Theyre the record he ran on when he was elected to the US Senate in 2012and they represent significantly more of his working life than the three years he has served so far in the Senate Theyre also a prime source of fodder for liberal and moderate critics should be become the Republican presidential nomineeA Politico review of Cruzs record as solicitor general shows he used the role in a new and far more ideological way than his predecessors taking a relatively lowprofile job that had traditionally been used mostly to defend the state government and turning it into a stage for pushing national conservative causes Cruz argued eight cases in front of the US Supreme Courtfar more than his predecessors and successorsusing each of them to advance a position endorsed by conservative thinkers He also was the counsel of record on some 70 friendofthecourt briefs or amicus briefs weighing in on cases across the country like Heller in which Texas had no direct stake but which similarly offered a chance to argue ideological pointsHe really turned the office into a platform David Bernstein a George Mason law professor who recently wrote a book about the Obama administration for which Cruz wrote the foreword said in an interviewHe built up the national aura of the office said Tom Phillips who was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Texas at the start of Cruzs run as solicitor generalCruzs zealous work served the ambitions of the conservative movement but he also personally used it to build a bridge between what he was an elite constitutional law nerd to what he is today an ascendant rightwing politician Yet while pleasing to conservatives other aspects of his record are sure to attract critics He argued against leniency for an unjustly sentenced man whose lawyer had made a technical mistake he invoked 13thcentury Saxon law and the practice of cutting off testicles to justify harsher punishments in a rape case and he referred to a lateterm abortion technique as infanticideAlthough little examined in the race so far Cruzs time as solicitor general built him a powerful allegiance among the conservative donors necessary to launch a national campaign Heading into Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina and beyond he has more money at his disposal than any candidate besides Jeb Bush And the way he used that Texas office is part of the reason Toby Neugebauer who wrote a 10 million check to the Cruz super PAC called Keep the Promise II told me the reason he did thatthe single reasonis what Cruz did as solicitor general He said other major donors feel the same wayWere backing someone Neugebauer told me that had a worldview and went out and executed on itCruz took the solicitor job as a reboot of sorts after his initial foray into politics had fizzledAs a debater at Princeton as a law school student at Harvard and as a clerk to thenSupreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist Cruz was widely considered brilliantbut he left his first real job as a promising appellate attorney in private practice in Washington to instead toil in 2000 as a domestic policy analyst in George W Bushs presidential campaign then as a legal hand for Bushs team in the frantic recount in Florida that ultimately won Bush the electionIn return Cruz desperately wanted a senior post in the White House he wrote in his autobiography On the campaign though he had earned a reputation for his outsized ego as much as for his obvious intelligence and the postelection jobs he got were outoftheway roles at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission I just dont like the guy Bush has said since The solicitor general role in his home state of Texas offered to him by Greg Abbottthen the attorney general of Texas now the governorwas a political lifelineFrom the start it offered a chance to turn his legal acumen into political potential because it came with a green light to advance conservative aims in the courts Abbotts directive for the solicitor general of Texas Cruz said in his book was to look across the country and identify chances to defend conservative principlesThis is not the traditional definition of a solicitor generals job which comes with two main duties The first States get sued attorneys general and their staffs respond and some of the cases get appealedand thats where the solicitor general comes in representing the state in higher courts where the cases are the most legalistic and complex The second the writing of amicus briefs in cases elsewhere in which a state believes it has an interest even though its not a partyThe first part can be seen as defense The second part is more like offense selectively advancing the interests of the state The way Cruz did the job Even the defense was offense and the interests being asserted were less those of the state than its conservative leadersTexas is a huge state and theres plenty of work for the attorney generals office to do said Jim Ho an attorney in Dallas who succeeded Cruz as solicitor general and is a friend and supporter Cruz though was not content to simply do what was asked and go homeWhen it came to cases that allowed him to argue for things like the forceful application of the death penalty and expressions of religion in the public arena and against things like abortion and gun control Ho told me Cruz was on constant watch for opportunities to press a conservative vision of the Constitution
