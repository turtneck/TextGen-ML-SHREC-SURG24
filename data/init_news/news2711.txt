Hillary Arrives At Rally Makes One Weird Move That Left Onlookers Puzzled Posted on October 27 2016 by Alisha Rich in Politics Share This As Hillary Clinton makes her last few rounds of appearances before election day the presidential hopeful will feel a little bit of the pressure that the presidency will demand However when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth Florida she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice There have been many questions over the course of Hillary Clintons campaign regarding her health As a result of her age and her lifestyle theres no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging  whether she likes to admit it or not However video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage In fact the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness according to The American Mirror  The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches Although Hillary Clinton insists that her health isnt an issue the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture If you take a close look at the video the aide can even be seen standing behind her reaching for her waist  probably preparing for the event of her falling We have said it time and time again  shes not fit to be president Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person its her disastrous political history that raises even more concerns
