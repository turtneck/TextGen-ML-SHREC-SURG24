Mysterious middleofthenight drone flights by the US Secret Service during the next several weeks over parts of Washington  usually offlimits as a strict nofly zone  are part of secret government testing intended to find ways to interfere with rogue drones or knock them out of the sky The Associated Press has learnedA US official briefed on the plans said the Secret Service was testing drones for law enforcement or protection efforts and to look for ways such as signal jamming to thwart threats from civilian drones The drones were being flown between 1 am and 4 am The official spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to publicly discuss the plans The Secret Service has said details were classifiedSome consumerlevel drones which commonly carry video cameras are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives or a grenadeThe challenge for the Secret Service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the White House or the presidents location then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crashThe Secret Service has said only that it will openly test drones over Washington but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly how many drones over what parts of the city for how long and for what purposes It decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over Paris at night Flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses drivers pedestrians and touristsIt is illegal under the US Communications Act to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agenciesDepending on a drones manufacturer and capabilities its flightcontrol and videobroadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular WiFi and Bluetooth technologies Jamming by the Secret Service  depending on how powerfully or precisely it works  could disrupt nearby Internet networks or phone conversations until its turned off Testing in the realworld environment around the White House would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings monuments or tall treesSignals emanating from an inbound drone  such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot  could allow the Secret Service to detect and track itFederal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the US telecommunications advisory agency the Commerce Departments National Telecommunications and Information Administration That agency declined to tell the AP whether the Secret Service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made publicThe Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed it formally authorized the Secret Service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over Washington The agency declined to provide specifics about the secret programIn January a wayward quadcopter drone piloted by an offduty US intelligence employee landed on the White House lawn At the time the Secret Service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threatThe agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the January crash but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect Previously published reports have disclosed that the Secret Service already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devicesResearchers with the Homeland Security Departments science and technology directorate are working on strategies to interdict an unauthorized drone flying inside security areas The research arm of DHS is trying to balance security concerns of the small hardtodetect devices with the burgeoning commercial use and interests of hobbyists Likewise the National Telecommunications and Information Administration said last week its studying how the US can resolve privacy risks with increasing use of dronesThe Homeland Security Department hosted a twoday meeting last month with industry officials law enforcement and academics to discuss balancing security and commercial interests and establishing security practices Days later the Secret Service which is part of the Homeland Security Department distributed a threesentence press release saying it will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems in the coming days and weeksTrying to keep drones out of a secure area can be trickyThere are basically three ways to stop a drone said Jeremy Gillula a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation block the radio signals linking the drone to its controller hack the aircrafts control signals and trick it into believing it is somewhere else or physically disable it Some drone manufacturers program a geo fence  location coordinates their drones treat as offlimits and refuse to fly past  into the drones programming Police could physically knock a drone out of the air with a projectile or use a net to catch itIf it were me that would actually be the first thing I would think about doing Gillula said You would have to basically encase the White House in this net It sure wouldnt look pretty but in some ways it would be the most effective way
