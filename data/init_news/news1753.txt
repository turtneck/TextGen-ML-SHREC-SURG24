Republicans professed they remained resolved not to fund the Department of Homeland Security without provisions reversing President Barack Obamas expansion of deferred action immigration programs that would allow up to 47 million potential recipients to stay and receive work authorization Democrats meanwhile showed no willingness to soften their insistence on clean DHS funding arguing that Republicans could now pursue their case against Obama in court instead of in CongressWith just 10 days before DHS funding runs out the likelihood of a minishutdown seemed high on Tuesday The congressional recalcitrance wasnt abating and most lawmakers were home in their districts Monday nights decision by a US district judge in Texas appeared not to have altered the odds Behind the public pronouncements however talk was turning to another wayUS District Judge Andrew Hanens preliminary injunction preventing DHS from moving forward on Obamas executive action sparked a bit of chatter Tuesday about a shortterm funding bill for DHS Such a bill would last months as opposed to the end of September would be clean of any policy riders and would allow the lawsuit filed by 26 states against Obamas immigration actions to play out in court before Congress fully weighs inAides on both sides of the aisle were reluctant to discuss such a deal for shortterm DHS funding saying it had not come up in any serious way during party gatherings One Republican aide who like others would only talk on condition of anonymity said such an option would only be negotiated toward the end of the funding deadline if no other solutions are available Even then the aide added it was unclear if the GOP would go for itRight now for many members this is about setting a precedent for how things operate for the next two years another GOP aide said Outside groups on the conservative pole said they agreedI think there is going to be a lot of skepticism about moving a clean shortterm funding resolution for DHS said Dan Holler communications director for Heritage Action for America There is always a promise there will be a fight on something and there is always an excuse to delay that fight We are in the middle of it right now  To lose that momentum and punt for 30 days doesnt seem like the right thing to doCongress has a rich history of kicking cans down the road Thats what representatives have already done with DHS funding separating the agency budget from the rest of the government in negotiations last year to allow for the current debate over Obamas executive action To do it again would be a remarkable example of indecisionBut Hanens ruling and a shortened funding bill may just be the type of offramp that some Republicans have been seeking to get the DHS issue behind them without incurring the wrath of their conservative base As Rep Mick Mulvaney RSC a staunch opponent of Obamas executive actions said last week My objection to the DHS funding is I dont want to do anything that gives the president the ability to fund the executive amnesty If a court issues an injunction then I think it would be appropriate for us to consider the possibility of funding appropriations during the pendency of the injunctionAny shortterm DHS funding bill would inevitably have to win the backing of some Democrats considering how many Republicans would remain in opposition But Democratic aides said on Tuesday that they too werent particularly interested in seeing a standoff extended for a matter of monthsPartially its because the legal case over deferred action will last far longer than that making it unlikely that clearer answers will come in the spring Marshall Fitz vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress said the administrations appeal of Hanens ruling may be decided in several weeks An appeal on whether states have standing to sue the administration however could take up to a halfyear Then there will be separate court proceedings over the legal merits of the executive action provided standing is provenThe fight on DHS is not just about executive action on immigration said a Senate Democratic aide It is do we think Republicans should extract policy concessions for keeping all or part of the government open Our side says absolutely notThe third actor in this saga the White House has so far stayed away from the congressional wrangling over DHS funding except to offer support for Democratic demands for a clean bill Asked about a stopgap option a senior administration official told The Huffington Post that the Hill should pass a bill without riders that funds DHS for the full yearAnything less would go against the public warnings of DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson who has been emphatic that shortterm funding prevents the department from carrying out border security plans hiring more Secret Service agents and funding new grants for state and local law enforcement
