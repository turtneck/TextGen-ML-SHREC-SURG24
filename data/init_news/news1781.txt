Miami CNN Hillary Clinton is poised to reveal her vice presidential candidate Friday in a message to supporters people close to the search say and is planning to make her first appearance with her running mate at a campaign rally in Miami on SaturdaySen Tim Kaine of Virginia has emerged as a leading contender after a methodical search several Democrats close to the campaign say receiving spirited backing from President Barack Obama and former President Bill ClintonIn selecting the battleground of Florida to make her public announcement Clinton is hoping to seize the spotlight from Republicans after their convention in Cleveland She is set to visit Orlando and Tampa on Friday but her new partner is not expected to join her until Saturday at a rally here at Florida International University where the student body is more than half HispanicKaine speaks fluent Spanish and last week Clinton beamed at a Virginia rally as he declared Estamos listos para Hillary or We are ready for HillaryClinton has yet to reveal her choice beyond her tight inner circle fearful of it leaking before a wellorchestrated weekend rollout is set into motion Her campaign looking to build their email and text list has offered supporters the chance to be the first to know their vice presidential pick much like Barack Obama did in 2008The focus of her search in the final days also centers on Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack according to several Democrats close to the process confident either Kaine or Vilsack would fit her chief criteria of being a strong governing partner and ready for the presidencyShes not going to be waffling at the 11th hour like Donald Trump one Democrat close to the process said speaking on condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the selection By now she knows who she wants and will be confident in her choiceShe also was considering Labor Secretary Tom Perez who would be the first Hispanic candidate on the partys ticket or Sen Cory Booker of New Jersey who would be the first AfricanAmerican vice presidential nominee Democrats close to the process said Perez and Booker had considerable strengths far beyond their diversity but their limited experience in national security and government made them less likely to be selectedThe consensus even among several Democrats close to other finalists is that Kaine will be tapped as Clintons vice presidential candidate Yet others close to Clinton still cautioned against counting out Vilsack who has the most state and federal governing experience and the longest personal relationship with ClintonFor Clinton the selection of a running mate opens a new and important chapter in her political lifeHer first presidential campaign ended long before any serious consideration of a running mate began so this phase of her campaign is uncharted terrain a moment where she can choose her own partnerShe was deeply involved in the selection of Al Gore to be her husbands running mate in 1992 but this choice is hers Her husband favors Kaine people close to him say but one added this week He gets a say but doesnt have a vote on thisThe weekend debut of the Democratic ticket is designed to build anticipation for the partys convention starting Monday in Philadelphia After they are formally nominated Clinton and her new running mate are expected to embark on a bus tour to key campaign battlegrounds similar to the First 1000 Miles caravan in 1992 that took the Clintons and Gores to eight states on their way to winning the White House in NovemberFor her part Clinton has intentionally not informed anyone who has gone through the vetting process of her final decision Democrats close to the process said in hopes of keeping her choice a secret until the last possible momentBooker who often fires up audiences for Clinton appeared with other Democrats in Cleveland on Thursday to push back against Trump and Republicans who have spent the week assailing her characterI dont know who the nominee is Booker told CNNs Jake Tapper Thursday The good thing about it is she has tremendous choicesBut two Democrats close to Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and one close to Sen Sherrod Brown of Ohio both of whom were on Clintons list of contenders said Thursday they were all but certain they had not been selectedWarren told Stephen Colbert on CBS Late Show that she thought if it were me I would know it by nowAll the finalists have met with Clinton at different times Democrats close to the process say including Perez Booker and Warren during oneonone meetings last Friday at Clintons home in Washington But this week the Clinton campaign had a meeting with top Warren aides trying to work out a surrogate schedule for her for the rest of the summer and fall leading Warrens team to believe she had not been chosenThe selection of either Brown Warren or Booker would influence the balance of power in the Senate Their replacement would be named at least initially by a Republican governor in their state and Clinton is intent on trying to win a Democratic majority in the SenateClinton started this process before her primary fight with Bernie Sanders ended with what aides described as a fluid list including several potential running mates Several were eliminated including Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and James Stravidis the former supreme allied commander of NATO and a retired fourstar Navy admiral
