CNN The battle over samesex marriage may have drawn to a dramatic close Friday at the Supreme Court But as several justices noted in forceful dissents the war between religious and LGBT rights is far from overIn a landmark opinion a divided Supreme Court ruled that states cannot ban samesex marriage establishing a new civil right and handing gay and lesbian advocates a longsought victoryPresident Barack Obama speaking after the highly anticipated ruling urged those celebrating to keep in mind that many Americans oppose samesex marriage based on sincere and deeply held beliefs Those beliefs he suggested should remain a protected part of the countrys deep commitment to religious freedomStill fierce battles over religious and LGBT rights like the one fought this spring in Indiana seem likely to intensify across the country after Obergefell v HodgesWhile polls show that a majority of religious Americans now support samesex marriage many prominent groups  such as the Catholic Church the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints  do not Leaders from those groups pledged on Friday to seek legal means to shield their beliefs from state interferenceIn his sweeping decision Justice Anthony Kennedy who wrote for the majority briefly mentioned faith groups right to object to samesex marriageThe First Amendment ensures that religions those who adhere to religious doctrines and others have protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths Kennedy saidThe point bears repeating the justice saidIt must be emphasized that religions and those who adhere to religious doctrines may continue to advocate with utmost sincere conviction that by divine precepts samesex marriage should not be condonedBut more conservative justices and a number of religious groups chided Kennedy for failing to mention the First Amendments free exercise clauseReligious rights and rites arent limited to preaching and teaching they argued They also entail individuals and organizations free exercise of faith a wide swath of activities that run from sacred ceremonies to performing charitable works and running businesses according to religious principlesReligious liberty is about freedom of action in matters of religion generally Justice Clarence Thomas said in his dissent and the scope of that liberty is directly correlated to the civil restraints placed upon religious practiceHe dismissed the majoritys nod toward religious liberty as a weak gesture arguing that the ruling could have ruinous consequencesIn our society marriage is not simply a governmental institution it is a religious institution as well Thomas said Todays decision might change the former but it cannot change the latterFridays decision makes it all but inevitable the conservative justice said that competing definitions of marriage will come into conflict Thomas suggested that pastors and churches will be confronted with demands to participate in and endorse samesex marriagesThere is historical precedent for such demands Thomas said citing Virginia laws that once imposed criminal penalties on pastors who presided over mixedrace marriagesChief Justice John Roberts said hard questions will arise when people of faith exercise their religious liberty in ways that conflict with the new right to samesex marriageWhat happens the chief justice asked when a religious college provides student housing only to heterosexual couples Or a faithbased adoption agency refuses to place children with samesex spouses Would both lose their tax exemptionsThere is little doubt that these and similar questions will soon be before this Court Roberts continued Unfortunately people of faith can take no comfort in the treatment they receive from the majority todayThe conservative justice said that Fridays ruling on samesex marriage is not of special importance to meIt is of overwhelming importance however who it is that rules me Scalia said Todays decree says that my Ruler and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coasttocoast is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme CourtArchbishop William Lori of Baltimore the US Catholic bishops pointman on religious rights said Fridays ruling will affect thousands of state and local statutes across the country The archbishop said he could foresee a lot of legal controversies in terms of the way we organize and run our ministriesMost troubling for the Catholic Church Lori said in a conference call with the media is that while ruling recognizes religious groups right to free speech it doesnt acknowledge the right to follow our teachings when we are intersecting with the broader societyEvangelicals too who make up about 25 of the countrys population pledged to fight the legal implications of Fridays rulingWe will not allow the government to coerce or infringe upon the rights of institutions to live by the sacred belief that only men and women can enter into marriageOne of the statements signees Russell Moore president of the Southern Baptist Conventions Ethics  Religious Liberty Commission called religious liberty the next front in the skirmish in American lifeThe skirmish will likely endure for years Moore said at a press conference on Friday with casualties on both sidesOne of the most tragic results we could possibly see is an unrelenting cultural war from progressives toward those who dissent because of deeply held religious convictions
