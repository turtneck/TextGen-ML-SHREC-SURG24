4 Things To Watch At The First Presidential DebateThe first presidential debate tonight is shaping up to be one of the mostwatched political events ever with a potentially Super Bowlsize audienceHere are four things to watch for as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take the stage at Hofstra University on Long IslandDonald Trump won the primary debates by dominating his opponents often by namecalling and bluster This one will be differentInstead of facing multiple opponents he will be doing something hes never done before  face off against just one opponent and in this case an experienced one on a debate stageTrumps goal is to present himself as a plausible president someone voters can imagine as commander in chief And he has work to do since majorities of voters say he doesnt have the judgment or qualifications to be president So Trump needs to show a basic command of policy  and in particular his own policies He has made so many contradictory statements about his plans for Syria ISIS tax reform and crime fighting that he will have a real thicket to untangleTrump wants to reach those voters who wont want to vote for Clinton but are worried about his temperament Does that mean the new teleprompter Trump will show up tonight He has proven that he can maintain a little more discipline in a setpiece speech but there are no teleprompters in a 90minute debateAnd although Trump benefits from low expectations his team isnt even trying to make him out to be the underdog On Sunday morning Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway called him the Babe Ruth of debatingClinton has the much tougher task tonight She has the burden of high expectationsThe former senator and secretary of state who has now been through two presidential campaigns is an experienced debater who knows policy inside and outBut her job is very hard  Clinton has to convince voters who dont want to vote for Trump but havent warmed up to her that she is likeable honest and trustworthy And she has to press her case that Trump is unqualified to be president without being overly aggressive or harshGender communications research shows that debaters who are on offense win and those that are on defense lose But being on offense for a woman is tricky Male debaters who are aggressive are perceived positively female politicians who are aggressive in debates are perceived negativelySo Clinton has to stay on offense without being angry All of that advice about smiling that drives Clintons supporters nuts Its unfair but thats just the way it is says Brett ODonnell a veteran Republican debate coach People like to see a happy warrior Clinton has to look like shes enjoying herself even if shes notBoth campaigns have been working the refs hard Trump has said the debate system is rigged against him and he falsely accused NBCs Lester Holt the moderator for tonights debate of being a registered Democrat Holt is an experienced journalist who happens to be a registered RepublicanThe Clinton campaign on the other hand has complained about a doublestandard It says the media creates a false equivalence between Trumps falsehoods and Clintons even though numerous fact checks have shown that Trump prevaricates many more times than Clinton doesIn the recent NBC commanderinchief forum Clintons top aides said moderator Matt Lauer grilled Clinton a lot more intensely than Trump And they say that for tonights debate the moderator and the TV networks  with the crawl at the bottom of the screen  have a responsibility to factcheck Trump in real timeThere are three phases to a debateFirst the pregame expectationssetting and refereemassaging which has been going on at a furious pace over the past weekSecond the debate itselfAnd third the postdebate spinDebates are not forums to score policy points They are tests of character and demeanor And they are often judged not in their totality but by moments  the zingers and putdowns that the candidates prepare in advance Those moments  Wheres the beef Youre no Jack Kennedy There you go again  help determine who voters think won or lost the debateBut there are many debates that were won in the hours after the candidates left the stage by the campaign that was more adept at getting its narrative into the mediaFollow along with the NPR Politics teams coverage of tonights debate which starts at 9 pm ET at nprorg and on many NPR member stations
