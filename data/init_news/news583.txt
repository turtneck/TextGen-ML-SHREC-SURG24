The other day I spied a high Republican official walking on the street and called out his name He stopped hit his smile app and exclaimed how glad he was to see me What are you going to do about Trump I asked He paused and then uttered the dreaded word unity We have to have unity he said I got his message Hes selling outIn the coming weeks Republicans everywhere will be seeking unity by embracing a frontrunner If that person is Donald Trump they will be ignoring his utter lack of qualifications for the presidency his harebrained schemes for controlling migration his knack for insulting billions people at a time Muslims women the disabled his gaudy womanizing past his lying his exaggerating his enthusiasm for torture and his ingenious view of the Constitution as a lease that can be brokenThat paragraph politically lethal if I were writing about someone else encapsulates precisely why Trump is so hard to stop He is among other things scandalproof At the moment an army of journalists is scouring the land looking for whatever Trump has done that we might not yet know about Trouble is there is little that can be revealed Call him a womanizer and he shrugs Say he lies and he lies by saying he doesnt Confront him with the truth and as he did by insisting on Muslim revelry in New Jersey following the Sept 11 attacks and he just perseveres He cannot be shamedIts trite to liken Trump to a Kardashian but I shall do so anyway What they have in common is the determination to outlast our moral or political revulsion Kim Kardashian hit the big time with a sex tape Revolting Yes But forgotten Mostly What lingers is the nameIt is similar with Trump The shock of his statements  calling Mexican immigrants rapists for instance  has worn off The same with his insult to Megyn Kelly or his mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter All that is now old news blanched of its repellent ugliness by time Oh thats just Trump Hell say anything He doesnt mean itBit by bit Trump will accumulate more endorsements The motley crew that now surrounds him will be supplemented and upgraded by establishment names They will use the same reasoning that Sen Lindsey Graham RSC did last month when he endorsed Sen Ted Cruz RTex whom he hates  a higher purpose In Grahams case it was to stop Trump With others it will be this thing called party unity or its functional equivalent stopping Hillary ClintonBut what is the point of a party that attempts to unify around a candidate such as Donald Trump What then does the party stand for Does the GOP endorse antiMuslim bigotry Shall the party have a plank about Mexican rapists or the physical attributes of women If Trump is its nominee will the party endorse what are certain to be misogynist and personal attacks on Clinton Trumps campaign boasts he has the endorsement of Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick both associated with Bill Clintons sexual rap sheet This could get uglyTrumps message we are incessantly told is that the GOP has doublecrossed its constituency with trade immigration and just about anything else you can name But it will do the Republican Party no good to win back the aggrieved at the cost of everyone else  not to mention what is good for the countryA glance at Trumps endorsees  check his Web page  is an effective appetite suppressant Imagine a Republican National Conventions dais stocked with some of the people who have already endorsed Trump  not just the feckless Chris Christie or the bizarre Sarah Palin but such figures as the disgraced football player Richie Incognito Hulk Hogan and Teresa Giudice from The Real Housewives of New Jersey a fresh alumna of the federal prison system A meeting of Trump supporters might have to be sanctioned by a pro wrestling promoterWhen I spotted that Republican official I did not say what I initially wanted to I wanted to say that we are taking names  we being the American people We will remember who endorsed a man who took American politics lower than it has ever been no doubt extracting promises of good behavior that later will be broken Party unity will not wash The GOP is going to lose the only question is how  with some honor or craven and deservedly mocked by history
