Man with unfashionable front door feared by neighbours 071116 A MAN without a trendy oak panelling front door is a dangerous nonconformist neighbours believe Retail worker Tom Logan has caused concern by having a cheaplooking plastic front door instead of a sleek sturdy modern one Neighbour Donna Sheridan said Most people in the street have got a proper light brown oak panelling door ideally with a vertical silver handle but Logan thinks hes different with his shitty white plastic door that looks like it came out of a skip I dont know what he gets up to in there probably druggie sex parties where they all wear masks to make it extraperverted At least the door will be easy to bash in when the police arrive I just wish a nice family with a normal door would move in although itll be hard to sell the property if there are male prostitutes under all the floorboards Logan said Most evenings I just watch telly or use my vast occult library to open portals to evil dimensions Share
