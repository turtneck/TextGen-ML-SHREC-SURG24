Being Jeb Bush these days means coping with a series of petty humiliationsAt a weekend conference in Miami fundraisers questioned the direction of the campaign and worried its too late for a rebound During a foreign policy speech in Washington people slipped out of the room to go see rival Chris Christie instead The jebbushcom domain was redirected to Donald Trumps website because the Bush campaign failed to lock it downAnd on the campaign trail the press corps following the former Florida governor is dwindling and focused mostly on his terrible polling numbers now mired in the low single digits While frontrunner Trump packs arenas with thousands fifthplace Bush rarely musters more than a couple hundred at any given stopAt an event in Newton Iowa last week Bush sounded almost incredulous at his position in the raceWho has the leadership skills to actually make the tough decisions to fix the things that arent working right now that are holding people back Bush said in front of the crowd of about 100 And who has the ideas going forward that will allow us to rise up as a nationAnd finally he added who can beat Hillary Clinton for crying out loudThe crowd applauded A few minutes later an older gentlemen in the back nodded offIs Jeb Bush ready to embrace his last nameNo presidential candidate named Bush has been in this position before George HW Bush lost his 1980 bid for president but never slipped as low as Jeb Bush has After an early setback in the 2000 New Hampshire primary George W Bush rebounded and cleared the GOP fieldIt doesnt show in the polls but Bush has become a stronger campaigner  maintaining a grueling schedule of early morning coffee meetandgreets interviews with smalltown television reporters and nighttime town halls and speeches And he still has more money than the rest of the field traveling in a packed SUV with a bodyguard a personal aide a press spokesperson and a campaign videographer He seems more comfortable in his own skinBut no matter how hard he tries nothing has helped reverse his slideWe have had success raising money Ive had success connecting with crowds  you guys have been there Im not making this stuff up Bush told reporters last week in Iowa Were garnering support at each and every event Im confident that were doing all the right thingsThen he turned to the Democratic Partys presidential frontrunner who is neck and neck with Bush in many polling matchups In spite of all the pundits saying the end is near which is totally untrue if you look at the headtohead polls where Im headtohead with Hillary Clinton I beat her Bush said Gosh it must not be as bad as you thinkRegardless of how he might fare against Clinton Bush has stalled at around fifth place among Republican primary voters both in national and early state polls He sits between the toptier contenders  Trump Ben Carson and Sens Ted Cruz RTex and Marco Rubio RFla  and the rest of the pack including New Jersey Gov Chris Christie who is enjoying a resurgence in Bushs mustwin state of New HampshireA Monmouth University poll of Iowa released Monday ranked Bush at 6 percent behind Cruz Trump Rubio and Carson In New Hampshire a Public Policy Polling survey released Friday gave Bush 5 percent  for eighth place On the same day a CNNORC poll of Republicans nationally gave Bush just 3 percent nationally  fifth placeBush supporters are hunkering down for a drawnout nomination fight hopeful that he will ultimately emerge as the partys strongest White House contenderSooner or later people are going to have to get rid of the fun and figure out whos best to run the country said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah one of Bushs most prominent supporters And he has to be in there He has to be thereFormer Colorado governor Bill Owens who is cochairing Bushs campaign in that state said the candidate has high name ID an excellent record to run on and is wellfunded He also said Bushs recent emphasis on criticizing Clinton is a wise strategyThe Republican Party has nominated lots of candidates over the years who were great in the primary process but couldnt win the general election he said For Jeb Bush the only thing that matters is winning the general electionCharlie Pelton 75 who heard Bush speak last week in Clinton Iowa said he appreciated the candidates increased focus on foreign affairs and national security He conceded that You dont win elections in Iowa on foreign policy generally but thats what our nation needsBushs diminishment was visible at the Republican Jewish Coalitions allday candidate summit on Thursday precisely the sort of forum where he might have been expected to dominate Right to Rise USA the super PAC supporting his bid held a breakfast for interested donors and Bush held a closeddoor meetandgreetIn the main room Bush earned a standing ovation when he took the stage and gave an energetic speech about his ability to whup Clinton But numerous wouldbe donors sneaked out for a session with ChristieLater that night stuck in traffic because of the White House Christmas tree lighting Bush jumped out of the vehicle and walked to a fundraiser in Dupont Circle When he arrived Bush greeted guests who gave at least 1000 to attend the fundraiser at the home of former Bush administration official C Boyden Gray At another fundraiser at a Georgetown bar Bush snacked on hummus with young professionals Capitol Hill staffers and students Tickets ranged from 50 to 2700Donors who request anonymity to speak frankly about the state of the campaign are mixed on what could come nextThis is always the fundraising quarter to pick your guy and hunker down said a donor who attended a meeting of Bushs top donors in Miami over the weekend We know its a rough patchAnother emerged from the Miami meeting to say hes reenergized and confident that Bush and his team are the whole packageBut a donor who attended the fundraiser at the Georgetown bar said that many supporters are struggling to accept Bushs troubles So how are they copingThe same day Bush visited Washington his older brother George W Bush reunited with members of his administration at the US Capitol for the unveiling of a bust of vice president Richard B CheneyThe last time I was in Washington I was hanged in the White House the former president joked a reference to the unveiling of his official portrait This time Ive returned to find my vice president getting busted in the CapitolHe said that his father had asked his son to Send my best regards to Old Iron Ass  a nickname of endearment the elder Bush once bestowed on CheneyThere was no reference to JebMatea Gold Dave Weigel and Scott Clement contributed to this report
