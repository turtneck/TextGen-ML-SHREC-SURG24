Home  BREAKING NEWS  Report FBI to Move to Likely Indictment Of Clinton Foundation Report FBI to Move to Likely Indictment Of Clinton Foundation Claire Bernish November 3 2016 1 Comment A new report says the FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation has taken a very high priority after dragging on for over a year in its White Collar Crime Division and a preponderance of evidence means a forthcoming indictment is likely Two unnamed separate sources with intimate knowledge of the investigation told FOX News  Bret Baier the FBI is actively and aggressively pursuing this case  even reinterviewing key people for the third time Ironically one of the anonymous sources told Baier the investigation has benefited from ongoing publications by Wikileaks of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podestas emails in that There is an avalanche of new information coming in every day Taken in conjunction with the rapidly approaching presidential election on November 8 it appears Julian Assanges October Surprise could have lasting implications beyond lifting the veil from behindthescenes wrangling by Clinton campaign insiders corporate media and Democratic National Committee However even before Wikileaks began publishing the Podesta Files unnamed law enforcement sources told FOX News  the bureau had collected a great deal of evidence FBI agents have interviewed and reinterviewed multiple people on the foundation case FOX reports which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation Indeed an indictment on the payforplay scandal appears likely barring some obstruction in some way from the Department of Justice Real Clear Politics summarized major points of Baiers revealing report noting the FBIs investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far In fact although previous revelations the FBI had made special side agreements to destroy the laptops of Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson  which prompted scathing criticism and doubts about possible purposeful decimation of evidence  Real Clear Politics notes those computers have not been destroyed and agents are currently combing through them Baier reports As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review We are told definitively that has not happened Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington DC and are being exploited The source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation Further elaborating suspicions about aide Huma Abedins nowestranged husbands laptop causing the FBI to relaunch its investigation Real Clear Politics notes Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clintons secret server on Anthony Weiners laptop They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature While Baiers sources being unnamed are impossible to verify the FOX report comes on the heels of reporting by the Wall Street Journal  also citing unnamed sources familiar with the same investigation  which states Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay Those sources paraphrased by the WSJ  explained Agents using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich Inter and intraagency disputes over the strength of evidence surrounding the paytoplay allegations against the Clinton Foundation left senior officials at both the FBI and DOJ at odds with lowerranking investigators who felt that  in combination with Clinton Cash and the aforementioned recordings  promising leads deserved to be pursued Internal discord spilled into the public arena recently when FBI Director James Comey took the highly anomalous step of publicly announcing the investigation had been restarted  sparking condemnation by President Obama politicians and other officials about potentially influencing the looming election Partly fueling the internal squabble over investigating the foundation are those who blame Comeys secondincommand deputy director Andrew McCabe claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer His defenders deny that and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation the WSJ reports While FBI agents continued making headway in an informal probe to decide whether a full investigation was warranted official in the Justice Department began objecting to their actions under the premise the evidence was flimsy at best  despite further statements from informants and additional information beyond what had been presented in Clinton Cash As the WSJ describes FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly Friction between the DOJ and FBI reached a pivotal point when a senior Justice Department official summoned McCabe to a meeting over the perception agents had rebuffed instructions from superiors not to pursue the investigation further Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation the WSJ quoted McCabe asking the official Of course not the DOJ official is said to have replied Whether or not quashing a deeper investigation into the Clinton Foundation had in actuality been the Justice Departments intent may never be clear  but given the overlapping dates of this bickering and the FOX News report of the yearlong probe it would seem the Clintons are still very much treading water Share
