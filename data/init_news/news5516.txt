Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell  Congress Protects Big Pharma  Fuels Opioid Crisis   Source Claire Bernish Congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs says a former head of the DEA responsible for preventing abuse of medications Joseph Rannazzisi former Deputy Assistant Administrator at the US Drug Enforcement Agency asserts Big Pharma and its lobbyists have a stranglehold on legislators in Congress and have engineered the protection of a 9 billion per year industry over the health of American citizens according to a report from the Guardian  Congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive he said according to the outlet As long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists nothings going to change Rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin  and helped limit the DEAs powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same A pharmacist himself Rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard  publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industrys profits These congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for reelection its a sham he told the Guardian  The congressmen and senators who are championing this fight the ones who really believe in what theyre doing their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence With the unique insight of having been an insider Rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability And he would know According to Rannazzisis LinkedIn profile as Chief of Diversion he had been tasked with oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 16 million DEA registrants but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids the threshold of criminality is raised As the Guardian points out legislation to fight the opioid epidemic Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act  did in fact pass in July  but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth Democrats then issued a report titled  Dying Waiting for Treatment  in response which likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam Indeed the report sharply criticized the bill equating its policies to empty promises for the lack of financial followthrough As the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal pill mills and corrupt pharmacies who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets Headed by Rannazzisi the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets But the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry  fearing a potential significant loss in profits  fought back Hard According to the Post  the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012 concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies That meeting was to chastise me for going after industry and thats all that meeting was about the nowretired DEA official told the Post  Then in 2014 came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act  legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association  the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy An analysis of lobbying records by the Post found the Healthcare Distribution Alliance spent 13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016 Rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014 and recalled telling them This bill passes the way its written we wont be able to get immediate suspension orders we wont be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations Stunned at the massive  and ultimately successful  effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19000 lives every year Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a free pass for legal drug pushers This doesnt ensure patient access and it doesnt help drug enforcement at all he told the Guardian What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process What this bill does is take away DEAs ability to go after a pharmacist a wholesaler manufacturer or distributor This was a gift A gift to the industry he added After heading the diversion office for a decade Rannazzisi retired in 2015  likely disgusted over legislators dedication to the legal drug industry rather than the people whose interests theyre ostensibly obligated to protect The bill passed because Big Pharma wanted it to pass he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyre not going to like being regulated Big Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation As the Center for Public Integrity found  the Guardian noted Purdue Pharma  at the heart of the epidemic for its highlyaddictive drug introduced in the late 1990s OxyContin  spent a breathtaking 740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts However Big Pharmas power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying  the governmentrun Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee IPRCC has been accused by Sen Ron Wyden of being a tool to weaken CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids Wyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with experts with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma including a scientist with a 15 million endowment from Purdue reported the Guardian  Youve got a panel thats certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing Thats something youve got to root out Wyden asserted  The role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests Families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharmas proopioid cash appalling  yet it continues to this day Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap bloodtainted profits Corporations have no conscience Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian  Unfortunately with my job I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible horrible domestic tragedy we have Id bet you theyd change their mind When you sit with a parent who cant understand why theres so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace and why isnt the government doing anything well the DEA was doing something Unfortunately what were trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws Share This Article
