Can Huckabee Overcome The New Car Smell Of Other CandidatesThis post was updated at 1140 am ETThats the message the GOP presidential hopeful is already conveying as he makes another bid for the presidencyWe need the kind of change that really could get America from Hope to higher ground he said officially launching his campaign Tuesday in Hope ArkTo recapture the magic that propelled him to second place in 2008 he needs to reembrace his roots and downplay the political celebrity he has created in the past eight yearsWhat hes got to do is draw a contrast that shows Im not just a talk show host and Im not just a Baptist minister but I governed for over a decade and we achieved results in a very Democratic environment  said Iowa conservative activist Bob Vander Plaats who chaired Huckabees winning 2008 campaign in the first caucus state He is so far undecided this goaroundThat message was also evidenced in the video that Huckabee rolled out last weekThe video was vintage Huckabee harking back to how he took on the Clinton machine of the 1990s in what was then a very Democratic state Thats a valuable weapon he has now that he didnt eight years ago with other Republican candidates now arguing theyre best equipped to take on Hillary Clinton the likely Democratic nomineeHuckabee boasted of his populist record touting his work raising family income and cutting taxes during his decadelong tenure as governorThere were no clips of his eponymous talk show or his 2008 stump speeches except for the address he made to the GOP convention that yearIm not a Republican because I grew up rich he declared at the Republican National Convention in St Paul Im a Republican because I didnt want to spend the rest of my life poor waiting for the government to rescue meHis runnerup slot enabled him to dig out of his humble beginnings A Fox News contract and radio show soon followed and Huckabee and his wife were able to build a 8224 squarefoot Florida beachfront home worth 3 millionJanet and I neither of us grew up thinking wed see salt water in person Huckabee told the Northwest Florida Daily News last year of the mansion he and his wife called home We both grew up dirt poor in Southern Arkansas  For us growing up the thought that we would ever put our feet in salt water no that would never happenThe newfound financial freedom was reportedly one reason Huckabee passed on a 2012 bid despite his rumored disdain for the eventual nominee former Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney In order to do so he would have had to sever his media ties which were his main source of incomeThats why it surprised many when he announced without much warning in January of this year that he would be stepping down from his Fox News Saturday evening show Huckabee But it was also a clear signal to those skeptical he would leave the lucrative private sector to reenter the political arena that he was serious this timeHuckabee was underestimated early on in 2008 in Iowa too He didnt even begin registering in polling there until the summer of 2007 and never surged into the lead until December of that year He ended up winning the caucuses by 9 pointsHe starts off the 2016 cycle not having to go from Pizza Ranch to Pizza Ranch praying supporters will show up as Vander Plaats once recalled their team had to do but with a sure buzz and a reservoir of good feelings once he heads to the state this week He still trails Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker former Florida Gov Jeb Bush and Florida Sen Marco Rubio in the latest surveys but theres no clear frontrunner yetThats both good and bad news for Huckabee There are higher expectations this time around both on fundraising and the crowds he will draw and the poll numbers he can expect as he becomes a candidate yet againWhile people still genuinely like Gov Huckabee and they trust Gov Huckabee Vander Plaats said theres still a certain flirtation with the new car smell of new candidates
