## SHREC's SURG 24' Undergraduate Research Program

This was originally my Junior Design Project, the orginal form can be found in the folder '\ece1895'. The rest of the project is the more throughly researched and worked on system created for my Undergraduate research project the following summer in 2024.

## Junior Design Version: Markov Chain Model
#### folder '.\ece1895'
My attempt in Junior Design was my first try at making a Neural Network scrapped together and trained to a minor extent in just 10 hours to submit for a grade. This was before taking any proper classes on ML or Neural networks and just made on my own.
I made a lot of mistakes, ones that I realized halfway through but could not change due to timing but knew how to fix that I applied in the version I worked on for SHREC's SURG 24' program as a full-time Undergrad Researcher.
For a through report see the file '.\ece1895\ece1895 final.docx' including my full process, examples, runtime graphs, and goods/wrongs.


## Taken Resources
### [Colorama Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-colors-python-terminal/)
From file '.\fun_colors.py', functions for easier printing of colored terminal text for readibility.
This file also has additional functions to help with printing or finding the location of the external drive used to hold the ML data.
