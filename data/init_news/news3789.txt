with a question on the economy and jobs Both candidates answered the question with their ideas to boost the economyDonald Trump says his tax plan may benefit the wealthy but it is also a great thing for the middle class because companies would invest more in building their businesses  He says companies want to create jobs but they often move their money overseas because taxes are so onerousSecretary Clinton directed voters to her website for her economic plan She brought up the site when Trump was hammering her on taxes and regulations He said hes going into cut taxes big league Youre going to raise taxes big league End of story  Clinton retorted that she kind of assumed there would be a lot of these charges and claimsMrs Clinton accused Mr Trump of not paying some of the people who have worked for him through the years She said she is relieved her father a small business man never had to work for him She said Trump stiffed thousands of small business owners and workers through the yearsTrump said tens of thousands of people have worked for him and liked it He defended his businesses saying they have been successful He said hed only not pay someone if their work was unsatisfactoryTrump stated at one point that Clinton didnt have the stamina to be president She suggested he was referring to her gender and reminded viewers of some of his past comments about womenShe also accused Trump of being easily provoked He defended himself saying I have much better judgment than she does I have much better temperamentBoth candidates accused each other of starting rumors claimingPresident Barack Obama wasnt born in the United StatesThey came to somewhat of an agreement on the subject of not making people on watchlists and nofly lists eligible for gunsThe gun debate also centered around ongoing violence between police and minoritiesTrump said America needs law and order especially in inner cities He told viewers that blacks and Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerousBoth agreed something needed to beThe debate could be one of the most watched and even be among some of the highest rated programs everThe 2015 Super Bowl clocks in at No 1 with 115 million viewers The 1983 series finale of Mash brought in 106 millionOne poll estimates Mondays event could rival those numbers topping a hundred million Regardless of the count it will be must see TVWin Thats all I want to do is win Trump saidBut for this outsider winning wont be the result of traditional textbook strategy Instead hes expected to stick with what got him here instinct and boldnessTrump however will need to pass the plausibility test  that is whether voters see him as a presidentMany are evangelicals still trying to decide whether they will pull the lever for Trump or possibly sit this election out But evangelical leader David Barton calls that the wrong approachWe have a very selfish view of what we do with voting and I say that in the sense of that most Christians think that voting is a right Its not Its a duty Barton saidAnd Trumps been rallying the troops in the days leading up to this debateIts appropriate that this first attentiongrabbing debate will be in the New York area Both candidates feel right at home in this familiar territoryTrump Tower is located in Manhattan Clintons headquarters are 20 minutes away in Brooklyn and the debate site at Hofstra University in Hempstead is only about an hour driveAs he has proven Trump enjoys mixing it up and getting feisty at debates But he doesnt typically throw the first punch Instead he waits until hes attacked and analysts say hes one of the best counter punchers out there So how will Clinton get ready to rumbleYou have to be prepared for like wacky stuff that comes at you she told Late night host Jimmy Kimmel I am drawing on my experience from elementary schoolWhile Clintons opponent may be taking a less traditional approach to preparing for the debates she is going by the bookThe Democratic nominee cut back campaigning last week Sources say shes going through briefing books rehearsing and studying clips of Trump from the Republican primary debates taking notes of his style and what gets under his skinI run across people partisans and nonpartisans alike theyll say why are yall working so hard I mean your girls going to be the next president Which my comment is oh contraire Strider saidWe have a very tough race ahead of us and we have two candidates and we have two candidates families that know how to win at the rodeo and its going to be a tough race for both sides and theyre going to go at it Strider warnedClinton has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history But its hard to say how much that experience will help with an unconventional outsider like TrumpClinton is preparing to face some uncomfortable subjects  from her email scandal to Bill Clintons infidelityA campaign insider says her team hopes to come up with a memorable oneliner that will knock Trump off his game and stick in voters mindsRegarding Clinton one of the big dangers to watch for is how she will react to Trumps attacks Shes been known to get agitated pretty quickly so keeping a calm cool demeanor will be vitally important in this debate for the ages
