While the House and Senate GOP budget plans are short on details its clear that spending cuts will be steep probably including lower spending on education and the social safety netIn this Tuesday March 17 2015 photo House Budget Committee chairman Rep Tom Price R of Georgia center holds up a synopsis of the House Republican budget proposal as he announces the plan on Capitol Hill in Washington The GOPled House Budget Committee on Thursday gave partyline approval to a sweeping balanced budget plan but the measure faces a rewrite next week to overcome opposition from the partys defense hawksEven as congressional Republicans pursue deficitcutting budget plans President Obama has been quick to dismiss the new proposals as failing to meet the crucial goal of shoring up Americas middle classTheir budget doles out even more to those who already have the most makes massive cuts to investments that benefit all of us asks middleclass families to foot the bill Mr Obama said in a Cleveland speech on WednesdayThe Republicans in charge of Congress clearly disagree Their budget plans passed out of House and Senate committees Thursday on straight partyline votesSo when Obama says the proposals in Congress would merely pave a path to prosperity for those who have already prospered is he on the markThe short answer is that although its hard to be too definitive about a plan thats lacking in detail the president appears to have good cause to bark up this treeEven some of the Republicans who are potential leading contenders for the presidential nomination in 2016 acknowledge the deep economic anxieties that mainstream Americans feel Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush is focusing on the right to rise in a nod to the goal of upward mobilityYet in the GOP fiscal plans which now go before the full House and Senate the middle class is not front and center Instead the plans emphasize the goal of getting annual federal deficits down to zero by a decade from now They provide little detail on what the spending cuts and tax reforms to reach that goal are  let alone how those changes will affect middle or workingclass familiesWhat Republicans have signaled is that entitlements are on the block including an overhaul of Medicare Both the House and Senate plans call for more than 5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years including a proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act That means cutting spending on Medicaid and on Obamacare subsidies which could leave millions of Americans without health insuranceThe Republican budget doesnt flesh out promised policies to replace the ACA Some in the party have proposed tax credits to help people buy insurance but no money is budgeted for such a planOn the tax front its possible that reform plans could avoid showering new tax breaks on the rich but Obamas skepticism appears justified by recent history The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 served up savings heavily favoring highincome households And more recent Republican proposalshave been open to criticism on this same frontWhile the tax component of the House budget is less detailed than the tax proposals in past House budgets the information it provides strongly indicates that the plan would juxtapose deep spending cuts primarily hitting low and middleincome people with tax changes likely to heavily favor people at the top of the income scale writes Chuck Marr a tax policy expert at the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in WashingtonAt a minimum Republicans have a lot of dots still to connect for them to refute the Obama line of attackThe main argument in their budget plans is that the streamlining of government  lower taxes more efficient spending and lighter debt burdens  will invigorate the economy for all AmericansIf that plays out it may be a case of shortterm sacrifice for benefits that come in future decadesThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office supports the idea that lower federal debt would strengthen longterm economic growth by leaving more funds available for private investment But in the short run the CBO says deficitcutting efforts tend to be a drag on growth Even by 2025 the overall effect of the Republican plan would boost perperson output by only about 15 percent the CBO estimatesBy 2040 though the estimated gains in per capita economic activity would average a more robust 7 percentOur budget calls for fundamental tax reform to help grow the economy and create jobs with a tax code that is simpler and fairer the Republicans on the House Budget Committee say in a fact sheetBoth political parties agree that tax reform could give a modest boost to economic growthOne detailed tax reform plan issued last year by Rep Dave Camp R while chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee took pains to be distributionally neutral  meaning that in simplifying the tax code it wouldnt allow the rich to pay a lighter share of US income taxesAlthough not everyone thought that Representative Camps plan went far enough on fairness it at least showed that conservative tax reform can be mindful of effects on different income groupsRepublicans can also point to their emphasis on deficit reduction as a move that would help the whole economy not just rich people The idea is to put the national debt on a downward path as a share of economic output enhancing the nations fiscal health Without such efforts weathering unforeseen emergencies such as a war or deep recession would be considerably harder to navigateBut the spending cuts implied by Republican budgets would be steep imposing costs on ordinary Americans in the form of lower federal spending on things like education and the social safety netMany of the details of where those cuts will come have yet to be determined On education the House draft for example freezes Pell Grants at 5775 for 10 years On welfare programs the Senate plan outlines federal spending declining by 33 percent a year compared with a currentlaw projection of 35 percent annual spending increasesRepublicans say the cuts can be done in smart ways consolidating duplicate programs or pushing others to the state level so that public needs are still metCritics of the Republican approach say its fundamentally flawed to try to balance the budget entirely with spending cuts especially at a time of rising burdens on entitlement programs to cover aging baby boomers
