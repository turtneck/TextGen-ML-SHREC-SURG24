Paul D Ryan is a bit of a control freak Each day should have a similar rhythm each meeting should begin on time each day should end like the day beforeAll of which makes his new job as speaker of the House overseeing a raucous caucus of 246 Republicans an odd fit for this very Type A personality This past week was an early test Im really kind of into routines so Im still working on getting a routine established Ryan RWis told reporters Thursday in a roundtable discussionRyan 45 whose German mother instilled a rigid discipline in him cant even get over the fact that the speaker by tradition skips most House votes to conduct more meetings in office suites off the chamber floor I just like having routines and I can get more done that wayWith three weeks under his belt as speaker Ryan has learned that the routine business of Congress can turn on a dime for almost any reason Hes aware that his words carry more weight now and hes aware that some weeks hes not going to be able to live up to his promises of letting the House conduct business in a completely transparent fashionOne week he was promoting a wideopen freeflowing system of dozens of amendments for a highway funding plan winning an impressive bipartisan vote The next week brought the exact opposite with a rushed bill to tighten safety requirements for Syrian refugees in the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris No committee considered the legislation no amendments were allowed and the bill was made public about 40hours before it was voted on by the HouseHouse passes bill to tighten flow of Syrian refugees over Obamas objectionThat inflicted whiplash on some lawmakers but it demonstrated that Ryan understands that the ultimate judgment of his tenure will be based on results as much as if not more than the process used to achieve those resultsIn the 35minute session Ryan said that the decision to rush the legislation  which calls for tighter screenings of refugees before they can be admitted  was actually driven by the lawmakers themselves Despite their repeated outcries for an open process once they saw the impact of terrorism in Paris lawmakers reverted to their most basic political instinct and demanded that something be approved before they left Thursday for a 10day recess over the Thanksgiving holidayMost members said we need to act before we leave we need to act before the recess Ryan said People came from intelligence briefings saying You need to do somethingSo Ryan obliged setting up a process he admitted was outside the realm of regular order and scored a big political win getting more than a twothirds majority enough to overrule a presidential veto He said that with so much fear of terrorist attacks the public just needed to see Congress get something doneIf we had a freeforall on the floor who knows what the outcome would be and I think that the country is very worried and the country wants to see us doing something he said But he also ran into some familiar partisan turbulenceDespite Ryans assertion to have consulted Democrats the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee said he had no part in the legislation and described it as a gotcha bill that will not make the nation any saferWe probably say things to get where we are positionwise Rep Bennie Thompson Miss said after Thursdays vote during which nearly 50Democrats rejected White House pleas and voted with Ryan But once we get there its not nearly as easy to govern with new rules as we thoughtThe highprofile victory was an odd one for a new speaker who has staked so much of his reputation on advancing deep policy proposals eschewing socalled show votes that are more designed to protect political flanks back homeEven Ryan said that the real concern for national security was a visa waiver program that lacks proper protocols and the emerging threat of homegrown terrorists inspired by overseas events and that those threats could make their way across the Atlantic OceanCommon sense and prudence dictate that we be on higher alert and that we cannot assume that Paris was a oneanddone event he saidHouse Minority Whip Steny H Hoyer DMd mocked Ryans quick turnaround to flush a bill through the House so quickly suggesting that the increasingly conservative tone of the Republican presidential primary campaign would reflect the congressional dysfunction and boost Democrats in next years elections Some GOP presidential hopefuls called for a full stop of any Syrian refugees while some also called for allowing only Christian refugeesThe speaker said that his motivations were based on what he heard from House Republicans on Capitol HillI dont even know all of their positions to be candid he said of the presidential aspirants Ive been busy doing my jobRepublican candidates move to keep Muslim refugees outThe speakers newly fumigated office  the smokefilled paint left behind by Camelsmoking John A Boehner was chipped off the carpet cleaned multiple times  has proven to be comfortable in the early days It smells better in here Ryan jokedBut once Congress returns after Thanksgiving Ryans routine will revert to what the speaker dismissively calls the chores passing a compromised version of the highway bill through the House and Senate approving a new K12 education program and finally by Dec 11 a massive funding plan for federal agenciesEach of these issues is either many months or many years behind schedule so Ryan views them as cleaning up other leaders messes They will again test his ethos for opening up the House a demand from the conservative flank that so bedeviled Boehner he became only the second speaker to resign midterm in the past 50 yearsHe claims to be one of those farright conservatives that he is of their ilk and not trying to force them to bend to his will You have to understand I come from the conservative wing of the party Im a movement conservative who comes from this part of our party People know that you know So a lot of these guys are pretty good friends of mine he saidIf only he can figure out a routine again he might make it workTime management has always been challenging Its just even more challenging he said shaking his head Im really weird about time management and punctuality and I just want to make sure I can stay on top of those things
