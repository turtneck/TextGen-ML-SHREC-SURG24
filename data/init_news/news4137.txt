Protestants get ready to grovel By Gilad Atzmon Posted on November 9 2016 by Gilad Atzmon This week we learned that Jewish institutions insist upon the Protestant Church apologising for its founders views of the Jews The Jewish Algemeiner writes that the 500th anniversary of the Reformation would be the perfect time for Protestant leaders to recognise and apologise for the horrific antisemitism of their movements founder Martin Luther The truth of the matter is that Martin Luther didnt know about Zionism Israeli criminality Alan Dershowitz Bernie Madoff Jeffrey Epstein or Sir Philip Green but he still had a serious problem with the Jews Back in 1543 he wrote On The Jews and their Lies  a book notorious for its opposition to Jews and their religion Rabbi Abraham Cooperassociate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Centrewants the Protestants to disown the founding father of their church or at least to directly address the issue of antiSemitism in the overall context of what theyre celebrating in terms of this anniversary David Michaels of Bnai Brith insists that the churches reject some of their founders teachings This reality requires committed Lutherans and other Christians to ensure that there is fitting recognition and rejection of Luthers hateful beliefs about Jews wherever these persist The Protestant world is clearly being subjected to an institutionalized assault Judaism But there is one thing the Jewish Algemeiner fails to do It fails to brief us about Luthers argument against the Jews The truth of the matter is that Luthers animus towards Jewry wasnt at all racially driven His arguments against Jews were purely theological rather than biological Thus using the term antiSemitism in reference to Luther is misleading It leaves one wondering whether Bnai Brith and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are lying consciously when they refer to Luther as an antiSemite If they do we may actually need to seek the assistance of Luthers book in order to grasp Rabbi Cooper and Michaels conduct Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician author and political activist His new book The Wandering Who may be ordered from amazoncom or amazoncouk  This entry was posted in Religion  Bookmark the permalink
