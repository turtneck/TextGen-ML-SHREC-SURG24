Less than a week before a bushel of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls square off for the first time in two Fox News debates billionaire businessman Donald Trump is holding firm to his primary lead  while his lowerpolling rivals battle for visibility in hopes of making the cut for the primetime stageTrump seemingly reveling in his role as instigator and bipartisan punching bag opened up a 7point lead over the rest of the field in the most recent national poll Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush also are polling consistently wellRather the 11thhour dash is among those in the middle and back of the pack competing for the last of 10 slots in the primetime event at Clevelands Quicken Loans ArenaThe Aug 6 debate is hosted by Fox News in conjunction with Facebook and the Ohio Republican PartyThe 9 pm ET stage will be open to the top 10 candidates in recent national polls With 17 total candidates now in the race  former Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore was the latest announcing his bid Thursday  not everyone will make the cutThose who dont can qualify for an earlier debate at 5 pm Fox News has eased the criteria for that debate and candidates will no longer have to reach at least 1 percent in the polls to make the stage though there are other criteriaThe only Fair  Balanced App  that gives you the Power to Decide Download the Fox News Election HQ 2016 app for iPhone or Android phoneBut there is heavy competition for the main event the first time leading candidates will face off after seemingly weekly campaign kickoffsTheres too many and so there is going to be a culling of the herd said Mark Jones political science fellow at the Baker Institute at Houstons Rice UniversityWith national poll placement dictating who gets primetime the candidates on the margin are doing their best to boost their visibility including New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Texas Gov Rick PerryPerry challenged pollleader Trump to a pullup contest after a week of pummeling the billionaire real estate tycoon for his comments on Mexican illegal immigrants and Sen John McCainMeanwhile Christie declared war on marijuana this week promising Coloradans they had better enjoy legalized pot today because he will enforce federal laws against it when he is in the White HouseSpeaking with Fox News on Thursday the Garden State guv said were very confident well be at the 900 debateAfter spending the last several months going after Bush  now third in the RealClearPolitics poll average behind Walker  Christie is competing these days more with Ohio Gov John Kasich Christie clocked in at 3 percent in the same RCP average right behind Kasich putting them on the tail end of the top 10Potentially outside the margin but fighting to get in are Perry Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal exHewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Pennsylvania Sen Rick SantorumFormer New York Gov George Pataki and South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham are further behind Each though has been trying to take on Trump in recent weeks with the latter putting out a viral video of himself destroying a cell phone  a response to Trump giving out his number during the McCain flap Graham had lashed out at Trump for questioning his friend McCains heroism triggering Trumps ireI think the top eight candidates are comfortable where they are said Jones The others are pushing the envelope with the goal of rising above the dust that was created when you have 17 candidates runningNot making the primetime cut isnt the end of the road by any means and theres still plenty of time before the Iowa caucusesI dont think being left out of the debate is a death knell said Steve Deace who hosts a conservative radio talk show in the Hawkeye State However he said it can hurt from a momentum standpoint in that it is a spotlight you are not gettingIt will be a huge spotlight and I think for someone who is underfunded and underorganized who is impressive when they are in front of people like Bobby Jindal this is the spotlight they are going to needPerhaps an indication of how comfortable the GOP frontrunner feels right now Trump is in Scotland and attended the Womens British Open at one of his resorts  though he still talked campaign shop with reporters ThursdayBush though is back on the stump stateside on Friday with plans to address the National Urban League along with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson Walker and Christie are campaigning in Iowa Friday as is Kentucky Sen Rand Paul Kasich is in New HampshireFor all the buzz and attention surrounding Trump there is now pressure on him to performHe is clearly the man of the hour from a buzz standpoint Deace said I think with one or two exceptions the goal of the others is to get him to go from zany to crazy to selfimmolateBut that might be difficult considering hes weathered a string of controversies over his blunt remarks since entering the race The worst thing that can happen is for Trump to pull his punches and wimp out Deace said His entire campaign is based on him being a blunt instrument he can get back at Washington with If he dulls those edges that would be the death knell for himDeace said the others though have something to gain by not going for the baitIt will be interesting to see how Scott Walker performs in this environment I think we have to see if this debate diminishes his stature or he is able to craft an everyman persona who is a nice contrast to the bigger personalities he said On the other hand I think Ben Carson has a much more reserved laidback way of communicating than the rest of these candidates Will he bore people or be seen as the adult in the room
