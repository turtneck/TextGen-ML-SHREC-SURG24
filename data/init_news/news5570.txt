Washington CNN President Barack Obamas administration admitted it erred by failing to send a higherranking representative of the United States to the Paris unity march on SundayI think its fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday afternoonHe said Obama himself would have liked to attend the march had the circumstances been a little different But planning began Friday night 36 hours before the event began and there wasnt enough time for the onerous and significant security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit Earnest said He said Obamas presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were thereThat said there is no doubt that the American people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in France as they face down this threat he said And that was evident throughout last weekMore than 40 world leaders including the British German and Israeli heads of state and Russias foreign minister joined at least 15 million people on the Paris streets Sunday for a unity march that became Frances biggestever public demonstrationBut Obama and his administrations top hands were nowhere to be found  an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunityThe United States appeared to have options to send to the march Obama spent Sunday at the White House with no public events on his schedule Vice President Joe Biden was at home in Delaware for the weekend also with a blank public schedule Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder was already in Paris for security meetings  and even recorded interviews with several US Sunday morning programs  but he didnt attend the marchA Secret Service official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to Paris in advance of Sundays marchWe werent asked or notified about a trip the official said But the agency had Secret Service agents on the ground in Paris per its standard operating procedureIt would have been a challenging advance  based on what we know Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said But Leary did not say that such an advance would have been impossibleDuring the White House briefing Earnest suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to Paris But Earnest acknowledged the Secret Service could have pulled it off An agency official noted previous last minute presidential trips have happened during the Obama presidency including a hurried visit to South Africa in December 2013 for the memorial service for Nelson MandelaThe White House noted that it was represented in Paris on Sunday  and has offered support to France in recent daysUS Ambassador to France Jane Hartley was in the march as was assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland At a security summit Holder was joined in those security meetings by deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro MayorkasObama personally visited the French Embassy in Washington last week to offer his supportSecretary of State John Kerry meanwhile will visit Paris on FridayKerry skipped Mondays march because he was in India on Monday for a longplanned event there with new Prime Minister Narendra Modi  a key relationship as the United States tries to improve longstrained trade ties with the countryKerry brushed the criticism off as quibbling saying hell visit Paris on his way back to the United States to make crystal clear how passionately we feel about the attacks and responseThe US has been deeply engaged with the people of France since this incident occurred Kerry told reporters adding that the United States has offered intelligence and law enforcement helpThis is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched our ambassador was there and marched many people from the embassy were there and marchedFrances ambassador to the United States Gerard Araud sought to show there are no hard feelings tweeting on Monday I am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support France has received from everybody here

Obama should have stood with France in person to defend Western values and show support for victimsSen Ted Cruz RTexas wrote for Time Our President should have been there because we must never hesitate to stand with our alliesAnd Sen Marco Rubio RFla said Monday that it was a mistake not to send someoneRubio said on CBS This Morning that he understands that the Presidents security detail

goBritish Prime Minister David Cameron German Chancellor Angela Merkel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were among those who attended along with religious leadersFareed Zakaria host of CNNs Global Public Square called the absence of top US officials a mistakeFrance is the United States deepest ideological ally he said and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member or the President standing shoulder to shoulder with other leadersZakaria noted that security concerns didnt dissuade Netanyahu or Abbas or other leaders from showing up But Obamas absence did show that the struggle against radical Islam is not all about America Zakaria saidMany people have tended to think that Islamic terrorism wouldnt exist without America Zakaria said This is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists Even if you take the US out of it  the civilized world is up in armsTapper not only called out the President and his administration but also prospective 2016 hopefuls from both parties for missing the opportunity to share in the global
