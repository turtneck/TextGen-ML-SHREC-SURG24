In their continuous efforts to create the impression that the government is doing something to keep Americans safe politicians in Washington have misled and lied to the public They have violated their oaths to uphold the Constitution They have created a false sense of security And they have dispatched and redispatched 60000 federal agents to intercept the telephone calls text messages and emails of all Americans all the timeIn the process while publicly claiming they only acquire identifying metadata  the time date location duration telephone numbers and email addresses of communications  they have in fact surreptitiously gained access to the content of these communicationsOn June 1 one of the three claimed legal authorities for all this Section 215 of the Patriot Act expired as Congress was unable to agree on either its reinstitution or the enactment of a substitute At the time that Section 215 was about to expire President Obama Attorney General Lynch and FBI Director Comey warned that the NSAs computers would go dark and the American public would be at the mercy of our enemies Their warnings were nonsenseThe NSA is a military entity that utilizes the services of military computer experts and agents employs civilians and hires companies that provide thousands of outside contractors After nearly 14 years of spying on us  all authorized by a secret court whose judges cannot keep records of what they have ordered or discuss openly what they know  the NSA now has computers and computer personnel physically located in the main switching offices of all telecom and Internet service providers in the United States It has 247 access to the content of everyones telephone calls emails and text messagesThe data amassed thereby is so vast that the government cannot sift through it quickly or effectively enough to stop such notorious events as the Boston Marathon bombings the Ft Hood massacre and the attempted massacre last month outside of Dallas The Justice Department acknowledged this last month when it revealed that all this spying has not succeeded in stopping any terrorist plots and has not aided any federal prosecutions of terrorismThen why do it Because the feds want to calm American nerves by giving the impression that they are doing something  even though we know that they know that what they are doing fails to keep us safe They are giving us a false impression But they owe us the truth not falsehoods designed to make themselves look like they are doing what they claim Their spying has failed to enhance our safetyIt also has failed to protect our freedoms The Constitution requires probable cause as a precondition for all search warrants That is a level of evidence about the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized sufficient to induce a judge to conclude that a crime probably has been committed Without this probable cause requirement nothing would stop the government from searching and seizing whatever it wants Yet that is where we are today The NSAs unconstitutional standard of government need reinstitutes the general warrants  search where you wish and seize what you find  which the Fourth Amendment was written to prohibitBoth the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act the substitute law enacted by Congress do away with the probable cause requirement Both of those laws permit the FISA court to issue general warrants based on the governments needs rather than probable cause It is the governmentneed standard which is no standard at all that has resulted in spying on all persons all the timeWhen Section 215 of the Patriot Act expired the NSAs legal yet unconstitutional authority to spy did not The propaganda that its computers were shut down is false Section 702 of the FISA law and President Bushs October 2001 executive order were and are still valid and both have been interpreted to unleash the NSASection 702 permits warrantless surveillance of Americans who speak with foreigners and the NSA has gotten FISA warrants to intercept the calls of the folks to whom those Americans speak to the sixth degree That alone encompasses all persons in the United States Bushs executive order was given to all military intelligence agencies  of which the NSA is but one It instructed the military to intercept the calls and emails of whatever Americans it needs to listen in upon to enhance safety That executive order still stands This is why the hand wringing and false claims that the NSA computers went dark is untruthful The computers violate our privacy and assault our liberty and fail to enhance our safety but they are not darkLast week one of the prospying politicians was clever even cute when he issued the oneliner You cant enjoy civil liberties from a coffin His statement was a craven articulation of failure The governments job is to keep us free and safe If it keeps us safe but not free it has failed to do its job Today it does neither I suggest to him Patrick Henry on this Give me liberty or give me deathWhich oneliner better embodies American values history and traditionsAndrew P Napolitano a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey is the senior judicial analyst at
