Washington CNN Lindsey Graham is running for president because he says the world is falling apartAnd if Americans are looking for a commanderinchief the South Carolina senator believes hes itGraham who told CNN last month hes been more right than wrong on foreign policy announced his presidential bid in his hometown of Central South Carolina on Monday He hopes that his track record on foreign affairs will give him the advantage in a wideopen primary fightI want to be President to defeat the enemies trying to kill us not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them but defeat them he said at his kickoff eventThe timing could not be better for Graham a national security hawk announcing his candidacy on the day a key provision of the Patriot Act expired in large part because of Sen Rand Paul another Republican running for president He becomes the 9th Republican to enter the fieldPaul and Graham are foils in their party and represent an internal struggle for the soul of the GOPHes banking his longshot bid on his deep well of experience and long history of speaking out on global threats experience that he believes is both unmatched and invaluable in a race where foreign policy is certain to take center stage Of all the nearly two dozen Republicans running or contemplating a run most are governors with relatively little experience in foreign affairs or young senators with a much shorter track recordAnd Grahams hoping that expertise peppered with jokes delivered in an easy Southern drawl will be enough to help him overcome conservative skeptics wary of his willingness to work with Democrats and his moderate position on immigration reformBut for all of McCains chatter Graham has yet to break out in the packHis advisers acknowledge their first and most urgent task is to introduce the candidate to votersWhere Graham needs no catching up on is foreign policy which he and advisers are banking on as the top issue in the raceThere is no one in this race who was the length of experience and the record working on these issues who has been a more stalwart advocate for a strong national defense than Lindsey Graham said Jon Seaton whos slated to be Grahams national political adviser told CNNGraham emerged as one of the Senates leading foreign policy hawks and has the resume to back it up He spent more than six years as an activeduty Air Force lawyer and will retire next month from the Air Force Reserve after more than 30 years of serviceHe currently chairs three military foreign policy and terrorismrelated Senate subcommittees has served on three others in the past and has sponsored dozens of bills on foreign policy Graham has also by his own count traveled to two dozen countries on official business and met with the leaders of many of themGraham was one of the first senators to call for boots on the ground to fight ISIS and is an outspoken defender of government surveillance programs currently under scrutinyHes a loud and persistent critic of what he sees as the Obama administrations weakness globally which he charges has invited foreign threats like Russia and ISIS to take advantageHe supported the troop surge in Iraq has called for sending military aide to help Ukraine stave off the Russian annexation of Crimea and has been sharply critical of the Iran nuclear deal though hes worked to pass a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval for a final dealBut hes already got competition in the foreign policy spaceGrahams advisers nearly universally and without prompting mention Sen Marco Rubio in discussions of their candidates foreign policy chops Its an unspoken acknowledgment that in the absence of a stronger alternative the Florida Republican a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has made strides establishing himself as the most credible Republican candidate on foreign policyBut they expect that to change once Graham jumps inHes a good guy but after doing immigration with him  we dont need another young guy not quite ready Graham said Hes no Obama by any means but hes so afraid of the right and Ive let that goGrahams foreign policy experience may stand on its own But his moderate positions on climate change and immigration reform will need some explaining in a GOP primary fightAs a member of the socalled Gang of 8 that pushed an ultimately unsuccessful immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013 Graham will have to answer for his support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants Unlike Rubio whos shifted on the issue Graham never backed down from the bill and in fact hes gone further supporting access to Social Security benefits for undocumented immigrants in the pastHes also spoken out on climate change calling for soulsearching within the GOP on the issueCan you say that climate change is a scientifically sound phenomenon but can you reject the idea you have to destroy the economy to solve the problem is sort of where Ill be taking this debate Graham promised during a speech this past MarchHis advisers acknowledge hell need to finish in the top three or four in Iowa and New Hampshire to have a rationale for staying in the race when his hometown faceoff comes aroundBut they point to his improbable 2014 reelection win where he easily defeated six conservative primary challengers as evidence his campaigning abilities will help him bring skeptical conservatives aroundFor me to go to the next level Ive got to even go further out of my comfort zone Im going to be in a widely attended primary process if I run and in many ways Ill be the odd guy out on certain issues Graham saidI just gotta stand my ground and take what comes my way he said
