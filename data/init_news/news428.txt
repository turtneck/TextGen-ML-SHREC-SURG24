Tweet Widget by BAR managing editor Bruce A Dixon President Donald Trump How did such a thing happen A competent and purposeful Clinton campaign should have beaten Donald Trump How did Hillary Clinton and onepercenter Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory America Might Not Deserve Trump But Dems and Hillary Deserved To Lose by BAR managing editor Bruce A Dixon Its over The crotchgrabbing racist con man beat the lying corporate warmonger Donald Trump is presidentelect of the US It didnt have to happen that way Trumps winning 58 million votes were a hair fewer than Clintons popular vote a million or two less than Republican losers McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 six and ten million behind Obamas 2012 and 2008 numbers The buffoonish Trump was elected with such a low turnout because Hillary Clintons campaign was even less competent and credible To borrow the condescending language Barack Obama deploys before black audiences Hillarys campaign never gave Cousin Pookie much reason to get up off the couch and vote Republican and Democratic parties are alike owned by their onepercenter investorcontributors Democratic party shot callers decided theyd risk losing with Hillary Clinton rather than winning with Bernie Sanders So Democratic party leadership their media allies and the entire black political class got behind Hillary Clinton and helped collude and conspire to eliminate VT Senator Bernie Sanders the Democrat with the best chance against any Republican opponent Once Bernie Sanders was eliminated Hillary waged a lazy and ineffective campaign playing a hand with just three cards The first was the broken record of how unthinkable and unprecedented a disaster a Trump presidency would be a clownish sexual predator who pronounced climate change a hoax and would criminalize abortion open concentration camps repeal Obamacare legalize stop and frisk build a wall appoint neanderthals to the Supreme Court deport six or ten million immigrants instead of Obamas paltry two million and who might be in hock to the Russians Except for the thing about the Russians its roughly the same picture Democrats have drawn of every Republican presidential candidate since Nixon A story told that many times just gets old Party leaders counted on it anyway and it wasnt enough That was incompetence A second and relatively weak card Democrats played was conjuring up an Imaginary Hillary Clinton a defender of womens and human rights who held hands with the moms of killer cop victims and occasionally mumbled about black lives mattering and the need to reform the criminal justice system But Hillarys decadeslong record as a tool of banksters billionaires and onepercenters was so well established in the public mind that Imaginary Hillary was a difficult sell not credible The onepercenter Democrats third card on which they staked a lot was the early and unconditional endorsement of Hillary Clinton by   and Michelle This had proven effective in Chicago in 2011 and 2015 where Obamas blessings in 2011 and 2015 were key to fastening Rahm Emanuel on the citys jugular vein after a half century of Daley rule The entire black political class got behind Hillary too from civil rights icons who ruminated on how they hadnt seen Bernie Sanders back in the day to some other wise heads who assured us a vote for the Green Partys Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka was an act of  narcissism  or maybe white privilege  But at the end of  s time in office the Obama endorsement didnt carry the clout it used to Thanks to two generations of lazy Democrats who refused to try to consolidate the victory of the 1965 Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court in 2013 nullified its key provisions enabling a constellation of laws and practices aimed at limiting access to the ballot on the part of students minorities the elderly and constituencies likely to vote Democratic In the 2016 election cycle these practices stripped another few million Democratic voters from the rolls All in all Democrats were the authors of their own defeat this presidential election Hillary couldnt campaign against the one percent because her party is a party of the one percent Hillary Democrats including Bernie himself after the convention could no longer acknowledge joblessness low wages lack of housing permanent war or the high cost of medical care or theyd be campaigning against themselves Donald Trump didnt win because of some mysterious upsurge of racism and nativism He won because Hillary Clintons campaign was even less inspiring and less competent than his own and worked hard to snatch its own defeat from the jaws of victory America might not deserve President Donald Trump But Hillary Clinton didnt deserve to win Bruce Dixon is managing editor at Black Agenda Report and cochair of the GA Green Party He lives and works near Marietta GA and can be reached
