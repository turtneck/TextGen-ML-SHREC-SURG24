THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch Doctors talk clinically some say callously about harvesting fetal tissue Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs References are made to its a baby or its another boy The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that for many are inherently uncomfortableThat truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women  as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances  doesnt matter to antiabortion activists Or sadly to the politicians who pander to themPlanned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nations largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue a charge refuted by Planned ParenthoodNone of the videos released shows anything illegal and in fact the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses Indeed the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standardsSuch facts though havent stopped officials in several Republicanled states including Texas Louisiana and Ohio from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood even though affiliates in those states dont facilitate fetal tissue donations In Washington Senate Republicans have fasttracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood with a vote set for Monday Fortunately its unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsibleNo federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions So cutting off government funds mostly through Medicaid and grants would only hurt the thousands of people most of them lowincome women who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control cancer screenings testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas its a myth as Republicans claim that other providers can fill the gap Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control  and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortionsWe are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood Its clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail Consequently its important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services
