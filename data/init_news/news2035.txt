This post has been updatedA day after again declining to apologize for her use of a private email system while she was secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton told an interviewer Tuesday that the arrangement was a mistake and that she is sorry for itAs I look back at it now even though it was allowed I should have used two accounts That was a mistake Im sorry about that I take responsibility Clinton said in an interview withABC NewsThe statement was the furthest Clinton has gone in showing remorse for the arrangement which mingled her work and personal communications and kept them outsidethe regular State Department email system The FBI is investigating whether the system maintained on a privately owned computer server at ClintonsNew York home jeopardized classified informationIn interviews Friday with NBC and Monday with the Associated Press Clinton haddeclined to apologize even as she said the arrangement was a poor choice that she regrets She told NBC interviewer Andrea Mitchell that she is sorry the issue is confusing for people but insisted that she had done nothing wrongShe would not apologize she told the AP because what I did was allowedRepublican critics had begun to use the question of an apology against her undermining the campaigns plan to address thecomplex email issue more directly and with greater humility Questions about the private system have contributed to Clintons slide in the polls with more people saying they do not trust herA Washington PostABC News poll this monthfound that 53 percent of Americans now see Clinton unfavorably That rating rose by8 percentage points since earlier in the summer tipping the balance to a majority of Americans now seeing her in an unfavorable lightClinton turned over copies of roughly 30000 emails atthe State Departments request late last year nearly two years after she left office At the same time she directed that a slightly larger number of emails stored on the server be destroyedbecause she deemed them personal and not part of her government business Initially she refused to turn over the server but did so in AugustClinton told ABC that shedid not send or receive classified material on the account and saidshe is trying to be as transparent as I possibly canLate Tuesday the campaign sent a message to supporters in Clintons name reiterating the apology Donors and activists have been complaining to the campaign headquarters for weeks that the email issue was being mishandled and it largely is their concern and disappointment Clinton is trying to head offI wanted you to hear this directly from me this emailed statement to supporters said Yes I should have used two email addresses one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department Not doing so was a mistake Im sorry about it and I take full responsibilityClinton went on to stress as she regularly does that her personal account was aboveboard and that nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time Despite the campaigns effort to more directly confront its problems stemming from the email saga Clintons own reckoning with it still seemed grudgingIn March she insisted that she had done everything by the State Department book and had nothing for which to answer last month she said that she gets it that voters have questions That was a significant shift  as was the decision to stop insisting the controversy was a manufactured Republican hit jobBut until now Clinton had always said that although she would make a different choice today there was nothing inherently wrong with setting up the system as she didClintons reversal on making an apology echoed the protracted 2008 campaign discussion of whether she would say she was wrong or sorry about her Senate vote in support of the Iraq warIn both cases Clinton adopted a narrow and somewhat lawyerly stance at first then came to a more direct show of remorse
