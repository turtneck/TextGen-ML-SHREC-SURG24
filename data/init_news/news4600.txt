also something else The best fundraiser in the Republican presidential candidates cornerThe senators wife a top executive at Goldman Sachs who is taking a leave to work at campaign headquarters is effectively leading her husbands fundraising operation running some weekly finance calls and pushing major donors to give the maximum theyre allowed under federal lawIts a far cry from the caricatured profile of the behindthescenes wife posing for photos on stage and then receding quickly behind it Heidi Cruz senior campaign aides say has been intimately involved in the process of raising the 14 million that Ted Cruz brags about on the stump often while standing alongside the woman who made that haul possibleTop Cruz advisers and friends describe her as a competitive fundraising dynamo unwilling to leave each night without completing her call sheet and determined to use the Rolodex and business knowhow she built as a Wall Street investorShe works the phones the way she worked them when she was at Goldman said Chad Sweet the Cruz campaigns chairman who recruited Heidi to work at the giant investment bank There are very few spouses who can get on the phone on a cold call to a prospective donor and make a more compelling case in a personal and effective way than Heidi CruzNearly every candidate heralds their spouse as an asset but few significant others in this election season  with the exception of Hillary Clintons  have the same level of political experience as Heidi Cruz A Harvard Business School graduate she helped guide economic policy on George W Bushs campaign  where she met a hardcharging domestic policy aide Ted  and then worked in the Bush White House for four yearsThat makes her husbands bid her second time on the presidential campaign trail Campaign bundlers report up the chain to Willie Langston Cruzs finance chair but fundraisers and advisers say Heidi Cruz is just as much involved in counting the dollars and cents needed to build for the long haulIts a familiar role for Heidi Cruz who the campaign declined to make available for an interview In the final two weeks before her husbands primary in 2012 against David Dewhurst  who would pour 25 million of his own money into his campaign  she agreed to dedicate the couples entire savings to the Senate campaign Cruz writes in his new autobiography And once Cruz and Dewhurst advanced to a runoff Heidi and Sweet led a 60person finance team that raised 60000 each  the 60 by 60 project  that put the campaign back on TV Cruz writesShe would sit down with a call sheet at night and call through 40 50 60 names and get donor after donor to max out on the phone  and be thrilled to do so Cruz recalled in a recent interview with CNN as his campaign bus ambled toward Memphis Tennessee She is disciplined and she engenders trust which is a powerful thing in lifeNow Heidi Cruz has focused her energies on dropoff donors who may have given in 2012 but havent yet ponied up for the presidential run or others on the fence She isnt allowed to actively solicit money from her coworkers at Goldman but advisers say those specific relationships matter less than do her fluency with the language of business and her work ethic that leaves even other aides in awe During the final weeks before the secondquarter fundraising deadline she made about 30 calls a dayBorn in California but raised around the globe by missionary doctors Heidi Cruz also showcases an easy rapport with the less fortunate She gamely donned a neon pink hat offered by a Cruz fan selling paraphernalia in Huntsville Alabama and shared her religious upbringing with fellow Adventists in Franklin Tennessee When throngs of Cruz fanatics mob her husband as he ends his stump speech Heidi Cruz stands in a corner within earshot of her chief of staff taking not just photographs but also business cards from eager backers who want to helpAt Sweet Peas Table in this northern Mississippi suburb last week the 42yearold has one eye on Catherine and Caroline  who are barnstroming the South with their parents  and another on the platform where her husband summons the three Cruz women to meet the teadrinking faithful With one hand clasped in each of her daughters Heidi Cruz leads them off and on stage Then as her husband rails against Obamacare and shouts about Jeb Bush Heidi steps outside where she works the overflow crowd with a pitchmans touch When were you elected she asks one local official Thank you for servingThe sense of genuine concern was elegant said the official Alderman Eddie Nabors of Batesville Mississippi after meeting her here He praised how she meets greets and identifies with those waiting outside I have one afterthought Get her on the podiumCourting local elected officials like Nabors also falls into her growing portfolio which includes closing the deal on local endorsements And the campaign is listening to Nabors advice She is slowly becoming an ambassador for her husband embarking this week on her second solo trip in North and South Carolina much like the other Cruz family salesman his father RafaelShould Donald Trump fall as Cruz allies anticipate Heidi Cruz is expected to be at the forefront of the Cruz campaigns effort to win over disaffected Trump loyalists especially womenContributors advisers and friends describe her as sunny and cheerful but fiercely goaldriven using her personal nudge to make it very difficult for donors to say no to her entreaties Those who have known her longest note how different she is from her husband whose political persona is defined by an unyielding ideology that critics see as arrogant and inflexibleShes not the ideologue that Ted is on so many things And I think she would be the first to say that said Ed Haley a mentor of Heidis since he taught her in collegeLawrence Lindsey an economic adviser on the Bush campaign said that appeal likely made her a better more accessible fundraiser than the
