GOP Presidential Hopefuls Serve Up Ice Cream Cheese And Red Meat To IowansGOP presidential hopefuls spent Saturday night serving up ice cream cheese and political red meat to potential Iowa caucus votersAt the Iowa Republican Partys annual Lincoln Day Dinner fundraiser the first part of the evening was rigid Each of the 11 possible candidates present was given a strictly enforced 10 minutes to make their pitch before later wooing voters at their hospitality suites downstairs with homestate fare in a more relaxed environmentSome candidates served up surprises to the crowd too which could make a critical lasting impression for underdog candidatesSen Lindsey Graham RSC got the most laughs of the evening declaring he was the halftime entertainment as he took the stageThe more you drink the better I sound so keep drinking he joked If you need to go to the bathroom go ahead Wont bother me a bitHe jabbed at Iowa Sen Chuck Grassleys famously frugal ways The one thing I learned about this dinner is it was free for Chuck or he wouldnt have been hereHe also ribbed freshman Sen Joni Ernsts memorable 2014 hog castration ad When I saw that ad with the pigs I made sure Id never offend JoniBut the hawkish senator quickly turned serious taking a jab at his frequent foe Rand Paul the libertarianleaning Kentucky senator Paul who has already officially announced his candidacy had used his own time to reiterate his opposition to the NSAs controversial wiretaps telling voters I want to catch terrorists but I also want to protect the ConstitutionGraham who could announce his 2016 plans June 1 promised that if someone under his watch as president was thinking of joining ISIS or planning a terrorist attack Im not calling a judge to get a warrant as Paul called for Im calling a drone and were going to kill youGraham also gave cover to another potential 2016 rival  former Florida Gov Jeb Bush who fumbled questions this week on whether he would invaded IraqThe former US Air Force JAG Corps lawyer blamed the deterioration in the Middle East on Obamas withdrawal of troops in the region not on former President George W BushIf you fought in Iraq Graham said its not your fault its going to hell Its Obamas faultBut Paul didnt spare Bush that scrutiny Without mentioning his likely rival by name he said the question of whether the Iraq War was a good idea was a valid question Not because were talking about history but because were talking about the Middle East where history repeats itselfPaul said the same question should be asked of Hillary Clinton If she ever takes any questions he quipped He then pivoted to an indictment of Clintons reaction to the 2012 consulate attacks in Benghazi Libya which he said should disqualify her as presidentWhen Bush took the stage he began by acknowledging his family in a nod to the controversy of this weekYou all know me as George and Barbaras boy for which Im proud he said Some of you all may know that Dubya is my brother Im proud of that tooEarlier on Saturday Bush defended his answers this week when he was asked by Fox News Megyn Kelly Knowing what we know now would you have authorized the invasion in Iraq After saying he would Bush tried to clarify the next day saying he interpreted the question wrong before finally fully walking back the answer Thursday saying he would not have gone into IraqI misstepped for sure I answered a question that wasnt asked he told voters at a town hall at Loras College in Dubuque on Saturday morningLater that afternoon when taking questions from reporters in Iowa City he said all candidates were going to make mistakesIf youre looking for a perfect candidate he said he probably existed 2000 years agoAt the Lincoln Dinner Bush took aim at Obamas foreign policy echoing part of his stump speechName a country where the relationship is better than the day that Barack Obama came into office he asked Iran Cuba I rest my caseForeign policy hits against both Obama and Clinton were familiar refrains from other speakers tooIran enemy Israel friend Its real simple said former Sen Rick Santorum RPa who won Iowa in 2012Gov Bobby Jindal RLa assailed Obama for what he saw as not standing up for religious liberty in the face of threats abroad The United States of America did not create religious liberty he said Religious liberty created the United StatesBen Carson who has never held political office but is a Tea Party favorite saw his first lead in a poll of Republican primary voters While our enemies are magnifying and metastasizing were shrinking back said Carson a retired pediatric neurosurgeonFormer Texas Gov Rick Perry tried to offer a hopeful historical reminder We made it through Jimmy Carter Well make it through Barack ObamaHis speech ran long and like a scene out of an Academy Awards ceremony music began to playAnother candidate who got the proverbial hook was Carly Fiorina the former HewlettPackard CEO Her microphone was cut off to the verbal frustration of the crowd She briefly continued to speak while the audience could not hear herHer speech though was well received including getting the loudest applause of the night with this jab recalling how she was asked when she announced her official campaign last week if a womans hormones would affect her ability to do the job as presidentCan anyone think of a single instance where a mans judgment was clouded by his hormones And in the Oval Office she said a notsosubtle shot at former President Bill ClintonFiorina also got applause as she contrasted her own previous meetings with foreign leaders to Clinton Fiorina boasted how she would stand up to Russian and Iranian leaders As shes done in previous cattle calls Fiorina drew notice as the only woman in the field and positioned herself as a natural foil to Clinton the likely Democratic nomineeWhen the formal speeches concluded GOP faithful mingled downstairs meandering from room to room that candidates had set up Some of the longest lines to meet candidates were in the suites of Graham and Fiorina who attracted renewed interest after strong performances The lines for Bush Carson and Walker were winding tooSeveral candidates turned to their home states for inspiration Jindals was Mardi Grasthemed passing out green gold and purple beads and promising bandanas for supporters of local Duck Dynasty star Willie RobertsonClad in a red apron Walker stood behind a table scooping ice cream and serving up Wisconsin cheese A HarleyDavidson motorcycle was on display next to him  a nod to Ernsts inaugural Roast and Ride in a few weeks  while autographed cheesehead hats were on his book table in the crowded roomPerry also served ice cream a nod to the favorite dessert he says he usually grabs at the end of a day spent campaigning And as Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann noted the event and likely caucus lineup offered something for everyone of all palates in the GOPIts like going into BaskinRobbins and not knowing which flavor to take he said at the end of the dinner I want a taste of every single one
