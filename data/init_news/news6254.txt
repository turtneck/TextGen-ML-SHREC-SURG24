But 25 days before the election Trumps path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency is looking more and more impossible by the day as states he once said hed flip from blue to red increasingly slip out of his reach Meanwhile reliably red states threaten to turn purpleTrumps odds of a win were spiraling downward days before the 2005 Access Hollywood recording that surfaced last week and depicted him bragging about his ability to grope women as a perk of his celebrity Since then his support has collapsed  particularly among women A new NBCWall Street Journal poll showed Clinton with a 9point lead and a new national Fox poll released Thursday night that had Clinton at 45 and Trump at 38 in a fourway raceIn the most stunning development of the week Trump and Clinton were tied at 26 in rubyred Utah with virtually unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin closing in on third place with 22 according to a survey from Y2 AnalyticsHes at a point where hes trying to draw an inside straight now by campaigning primarily in Florida Pennsylvania Ohio and North Carolina said veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres He is well behind in Pennsylvania he appears according to the latest polls to be effectively tied in North Carolina and Ohio and hes behind in FloridaDonald Trump said he would put new states in play Ayres said but he noted wryly that he never thought they would be the red states of Utah Arizona and Georgia Clintons campaign has already invested resources in Arizona and is marshaling forces in Georgia as they eye ways to expand the map for downballot races And this is before allegations this week from a growing number of women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances Trump has vehemently denied those accusations and there is no data yet to gauge whether he will suffer further fallout in the polls but its another issue that has knocked Trump offmessage with time running down before Election Day The map looked strong for Clinton at the start of this race and its looking even stronger for her toward the end of it Ayres said If a landslide is winning in the Electoral College by more than 100 votes Clinton is on track to do that now Because of Democrats advantage in the Electoral College Trumps path to the White House relied not only on keeping all the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012 but also seizing Democratic turf in states like Pennsylvania Clinton held a 9point lead in Pennsylvania according to a new Bloomberg Politics poll released Thursday Most striking was her lead in the Philadelphia suburbs  the place where many strategists believe this race will be won or lost A startling 56 of suburban Philadelphia voters said they were supporting Clinton compared to 28 for Trump What female voters in Philly suburbs really think Even if Trump were to win the mighty battleground states of North Carolina where Clinton currently has a 4point lead Ohio Nevada and Florida he would still fall short of the 270 electoral votes that he needs to win That means he would have to make up ground in Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin  all states where he is trailing far behind her according to new polls Democrats have long been confident about their ability to win Colorado where both Trump and Clinton visited recently And they are increasingly bullish about their chances in Nevada another state Clinton hit this week In another blow to Trumps campaign on Thursday Republican sources confirmed that Trump was pulling his resources from Virginia a state that has seen a huge influx in the number of foreignborn citizens and large growth among Asians who have increasingly tilted toward Democrats in recent years Because of demographic changes in Arizona and Georgia those two states appear to be closer this year than in 2012 when Romney won them comfortably Democrats had already made inroads with the large AfricanAmerican population in Georgia and been buoyed by the growing Hispanic population in that state But Clinton has also shown particular strength this cycle among collegeeducated white women voters in the suburbs of Atlanta While campaigning in Colorado this week Clinton urged her supporters to get their friends out to vote in Utah and Arizona We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want a turnout in as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent Many Republican strategists still expect Trump to hold on in Utah and Arizona even if he loses the race But Democrats believe they are laying the groundwork for 2020 and beyond In the same way President Obama helped build up registration in the African American community and among millennials Donald Trump is offering new opportunities for Democrats to make gains said Bill Burton a former Obama adviser Burton noted that in California for example registration among Latinos has grown exponentially and youre seeing that trend across the country Its opening doors that wouldnt otherwise be open Donald Trump is inspiring a whole new generation of voters to go out and get registered and get engaged its really helping Democrats build up our network
