The two presidents stood in the East Room on Tuesday afternoon united in their goal of defeating the Islamic State but separated by a stylistic gulf as vast as the AtlanticOn the left facing the cameras was Franois Hollande war president He spoke of cowardly murderers who dishonor humanity of a relentless determination to fight terrorism everywhere and anywhere of an implacable joint response of hunting down their leaders and taking back the landOn the right stood Barack Obama President OhbummerThats going to be a process that involves hard methodical work Its not going to be something that happens just because suddenly we take a few more airstrikesIts going to be hard And we should not be under any illusionsCould the Paris attacks have been preventedObama in Turkey last week responded to those who believe he isnt tough enough on the Islamic State Some of them seem to think that if I was just more bellicose in expressing what were doing that that would make a difference he saidTough talk wont defeat terrorists  but it will rally a nation Its no mere coincidence that the unpopular Hollandes support has increased during his forceful response to the attacks while Obamas poll numbers are downThe importance of language was very clear at the White House on Tuesday even in translationThere was little difference in their strategies for fighting the Islamic State but Hollande was upbeat and cando while Obama was discouraging and lawyerly It was as if the smokeemout spirit of George W Bush had been transplanted into the body of a short pudgy bespectacled French socialist with wrinkled suitpantsFrom my fourthrow perspective Obama was still and contained while Hollandes sweeping gestures kept setting off bursts of camerashutter clicks The Frenchman brought Mediterranean heat dismantle and destroy while the American was LakeMichigancool There is a potential convergence of interests between the various partiesIts not as if Obama lacks emotion he rubbed his face and appeared to blink back tears as Hollande spoke of the young American woman killed in the Paris attacks or passion he spoke movingly about the need to admit Syrian refugees But when he spoke of war and terrorism it was to play down and reassure My fellow Americans lets remember we faced greater threats to our way of life before he saidObama had moments of loft in his lengthy opening statement He spoke of the murderous Islamic State and the madness of terrorism as a scourge that threatens us all It must be destroyed he said But he turned defensive when he reminded everybody that a 65nation coalition has been fighting the Islamic State for more than a year and he recited its progress Later Obama said the task was to accelerate the success already seen Rather than a new approach Obama said the United States and allies must do even moreHollande  whose capital after all is the one that was just attacked  had a greater sense of urgency The Paris attacks generated a lot of emotion but thats not enough he said We must act And for a number of days now I have been trying to convince convincing all the countries that can act to do so  Today I am here with Barack so that we can act with greater intensity and coherence as wellAsked about Turkey shooting down a Russian military plane the two men had the same response  to avoid escalation  but voiced it in very different ways The cerebral Obama said this underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward The visceral Hollande said The only purpose is to fight against terrorism and the Islamic StateWhen Laura Haim of Frances Canal TV network asked if there was a deadline for ousting Syrian President Bashar alAssad both men had the same policy no timetable But what they said after that highlighted their different stylesHollande spoke of a new era There is a new mindset now Hollande said And those who believed that we could wait now realize the risk is everywhere   We therefore must actSyria has broken down he said And it is going to be a difficult long methodical process to bring back together various factions within Syria to maintain a Syrian stateMaybe you can motivate people when you sound so discouraging But its hardRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
