The scene was Ostroh western Ukraine on the eve of parliamentary electionsA tall figure bounded on to a stage to cheers from a crowd of elderly flagwaving supporters They chanted Yanukovych YanukovychThe man addressing them was Viktor Yanukovych who at this point  autumn 2007  was Ukraines proRussian prime minister Three years earlier he had tried to cheat his way to victory in the countrys presidential election triggering the prodemocracy uprising known as the Orange Revolution which swept Yanukovychs rival Viktor Yushchenko into powerNow barely three years later Yanukovych was back and his Party of Regions was ahead in the pollsThe person who masterminded Yanukovychs unlikely political comeback was not  as might have been expected  a Russian like the advisers dispatched by Vladimir Putin to mastermind Yanukovychs disastrous 2004 presidential bidIt was an American and his name was Paul Manafort  previously a consultant for Ronald Reagan George HW Bush and Bob Dole and today the campaign chairman for Donald TrumpManaforts years in Ukraine have come under renewed scrutiny during the current US presidential campaign On Monday Hillary Clintons campaign leapt on a report in the New York Times that handwritten ledgers found in the Ukraine show 127m in undisclosed payments to Manafort from the Party of RegionsThis is a serious matter and there are real concerns about the proKremlin interests engaged with the Trump team said Clintons campaign manager Robby MookManafort has denied any wrongdoing A source who worked with him in Ukraine said on Tuesday If there was cash I would have known about it and seen it I was going in and out of the Party of Regions HQ every dayEven before the latest allegations Trumps links to Russia have raised eyebrows Manaforts candidate has expressed admiration for Putin encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clintons emails and appeared unaware that Russian troops had seized the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea Meanwhile the Trump campaign was reportedly instrumental in rewriting the new Republican platform to remove calls for the donation of weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian and rebel forcesIt remains unclear how much of this was down to Manafort What is indisputable is that at the same time as he was advising Yanukovych Manafort was also building personal business links with some of the most powerful figures in the postSoviet worldBefore his arrival in Kiev Manafort had long specialised in taking on unsavoury clients such as Ferdinand Marcos the Filipino dictator and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and subtly retooling their public reputations He was recruited to work in Ukraine in the summer of 2005 by the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov  the main financial backer of Yanukovychs Party of RegionsThat autumn Manafort and his team  including longtime aide Rick Gates another future Trump hire  began work for the Party of Regions They rented an anonymous office at number 4 Sophia Street in Kiev opposite the stop for the 16 and 18 trolley buses Typically its white blinds were drawnThe Americans kept a low profile but Manaforts efforts didnt go entirely unnoticed In a 2006 cable to the state department in Washington US diplomats reported that the Party of Regions had undergone a mysterious transformation Long a haven for Donetskbased mobsters and oligarchs it is in the midst of an extreme makeover they observedThe party had enlisted help and advice from veteran K street political tacticians the diplomats said referring to Washington DCs lobbying district Manaforts firm  Davis Manafort  Freedman  was busy nipping and tucking Its goal was to rid the party of its gangster image and to change it into a legitimate political forceI met Manafort in September 2007 on the eve of the Ostroh rally This was just before the parliamentary elections and Yanukovych was frantically touring the regions on a campaign helicopterClose up Manafort looked every inch the classic Washington lobbyist He wore an expensive suit and tie and exuded seriousness He also bore a faint physical resemblance to his client  even their hairstyles were similar Manafort I was told later had instructed Yanukovych to blowdry his hair Manaforts camp denies thisThe American had an interesting story to tell  one which may sound familiar to observers of Donald Trumps campaign  of how his candidate had been almost wilfully misunderstood by the west especially by its mediaThe new Yanukovych was nothing like the old one Manafort suggested He had absorbed the lessons of his previous defeats was studying English  and was even playing tennis with the US ambassadorPeople are still looking at the political system in this country through the prism of 2004 Manafort told me Thats not at all the situation here Yanukovych was no puppet of Putin Manafort said he wanted a pragmatic foreign policy  good relations with Russia and the EUAs a person he Yanukovych is growing Manafort assured me I think the time out of power helped himManafort introduced professional techniques He gathered polling data worked on messaging and distributed talking points His efforts were at least partially successful Yanukovychs Party of Regions won the 2007 parliamentary elections and in 2010 Yanukovych beat his rival Yulia Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff Within a few months it had become clear that he was hellbent on reversing the modest democratic gains of the Orange RevolutionYanukovych moved quickly to consolidate all instruments of power the courts parliament the prosecutors office the media and TV Tymoshenko was charged with corruption and jailed Yankovych repeatedly shrugged off western calls for her releaseIn late 2013 Yanukovych was due to sign an association agreement with the European Union but at the last minute he dumped the plan and instead accepted a 15bn Kremlin bailoutProEU demonstrators flooded the Maidan Kievs main square and protests turned violent after a brutal crackdown by security forcesIn February 2014 riot police shot dead 100 people in downtown Kiev Yanukovych abandoned his palace on the outskirts of town Mezhyhirya  a Versailles of sorts with a piratethemed restaurant and private zoo  and escaped to RussiaPutin exploited this crisis to seize Crimea and launch a covert military invasion of eastern Ukraine The consequences  10000 dead a civilian jet shot down a country chopped up  haunt the region to this day Earlier this month Russia claimed Ukrainian agents had attacked Crimea further fueling tensions in the regionThose who worked with Manafort say that he cannot be blamed for the Ukrainian disaster Oleg Voloshin a former aide to Kostyantyn Gryshchenko Yanukovychs 201012 foreign minister who now works as a political consultant says Manafort urged Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agendaVoloshin still has ties with the exParty of Regions which Manafort rebranded in 2014 as the Opposition Bloc Manaforts consultancy in Ukraine continued until at least parliamentary elections in 2014He suggests that Yanukovych listened to what Paul said between 20072010 but then once he became president stopped listening  with catastrophic resultsManaforts advice was always nonideological Voloshin recalls He would calmly explain These people wont vote for you dont bother with them and then suggest he promote this message promote that message It was a very American approach Do this do that And crucially He was the person dragging Yanukovych to the westAccording to Voloshin Manafort was an advocate of US interests and promoted American oil companies such as Chevron  so much so that the joke inside the Party of Regions was that Manafort was actually from the CIA You can blame him for whatever The only thing you cant blame him for is lack of will in lobbying for American interests in Ukraine in the commercial sphereVoloshin insists that it was Manafort who persuaded Yanukovych to press ahead with the EU integration agenda arguing that it would counter Yanukovychs sagging ratings Manafort also strongly objected to Tymoshenkos imprisonment telling Yanukovych bluntly You are going to have very bad times with the westIts not Pauls fault that Yanukovych didnt listen to him If it werent for Paul Ukraine would have gone under Russia much earlier Voloshin claimsDuring the period that he was advising Yanukovych Manaforts interests in the postSoviet world were not restricted to politicsIn 2007 he set up a private equity firm called Pericles Emerging Partners LPBased offshore in the Caymans the firm had three American partners  Manafort Rick Gates and Rick Davis Davis had cofounded Davis Manafort Manforts lobbying company in Delaware The new firms aim was to make investments in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev Odessa and Mariupol It would acquire small companies consolidate them into larger national enterprises then sell them onOne of those tempted by this prospectus was the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska an aluminum baron and close friend of Putin who stumped up almost 19m Gates Manaforts righthand man sealed the agreement in trips to MoscowWhat happened next was strange indeed Only one investment by Pericles was ever made in a Ukrainian telecoms company called Black Sea Cable According to court documents the cash was funnelled into various offshore companies including one called CardMan ImpEx Corp registered in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands The trail wound through other opaque shell firms including Cascado AG set up by the Panamanian law firm Mossack FonsecaA search of the Panama Papers leak gives a few details Cascado has two Latvian directors Erik Vanagels and Stan Gorin In reality they are mere nominees The pair have been linked on paper to a network of offshore companies and multimilliondollar scams involving Ukrainian state assetsWhen the global financial crisis hit in 2008 Deripaska wanted out  and his cash back In 2011 the Americans emailed to say that it was proving tricky to sell Deripaskas stake because of market conditions Further emails went unansweredIt appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared Deripaskas frustrated lawyers wrote in a 2014 petition to have Manaforts firm wound upIts unclear if Deripaska ever got his money Either way the episode illustrates Manaforts personal links to figures close to PutinLater Manafort introduced Deripaska to Senator John McCain when the oligarch was having problems travelling to the US In 2006 the US had revoked Deripaskas visa citing alleged criminal associations Deripaska denies the allegation and his visa was subsequently reinstatedThis wasnt the only embarrassing legal scrape arising from Manaforts capitalist adventures In November 2011 Tymoshenko unsuccessfully sued him and several of her political opponents in the district court in New York Her lengthy writ alleged that Manafort played a key role in a conspiracy and racketeering enterprise to launder cash for Yanukovychs oligarch friends and invest it in New York real estateIn particular she pointed the finger at Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian businessman whose generous contributions helped Yanukovych Firtash is a shareholder and public face for RosUkrEnergo an intermediary company coowned by Gazprom which imports gas from Russia and resells it to Ukraine Tymoshenko tried unsuccessfully to get rid of itThe RusUkrEnergo scheme was a mechanism for corruption she alleged in legal filings Its real owner she claimed was Semyon Mogilevich a UkrainianRussian mobster and one of the FBIs top fugitives Firtash denies thisAccording to her writ Firtash and his companies and associates were able to skim billions of dollars from gas transactions The cash was laundered through a labyrinth of shell companies It was then returned to Ukraine with the money used to bribe Ukrainian officialsDefendant Paul J Manafort is a wellknown Washington DC lobbyist and political consultant He is the senior partner in the firm Davis Manafort and Freedman Manafort also worked in Ukraine on various political campaigns including the successful 2010 presidential campaign of Victor Yanukovych who is the president of Ukraine at present Manafort played a key role in the defendants conspiracy and racketeering enterprise the writ saidFirtash who declined to be interviewed for this article denies the claims In 2014 a federal judge threw out Tymoshenkos lawsuit saying that she had failed to show that Firtash and other defendants had laundered money in the US to help pay off Yanukovychs supporters in Ukraine The judge also said the allegations were outside US jurisdictionThat same year Firtash was arrested on a US warrant in Vienna accused of bribing Indian officials over a titanium deal But an Austrian judge denied a US extradition request and agreed with Firtash that it was politically motivated The US is appealing and Firtash remains in AustriaFirtash did invest money in Manaforts real estate projects however The two met in 2008 Manaforts plan was to buy the site of the demolished Drake Hotel in Manhattan and to redevelop it at a cost of almost 900m Firtash transferred at least 25m to the project Tymoshenko alleged that the plan was never serious with the cash merely transferred for the purposes of money launderingGroup DF and Firtash never had any intention to purchase the Drake property but instead used the real estate project as a vehicle for investing 25 million in New York bank accounts her writ statedManafort did not respond to a request by the Guardian for comment on Deripaskas loan or the Drake Hotel allegationsIn the runup to Novembers vote Trumps own real estate transactions have been extensively investigated but it remains unclear if any Russian cash has actually been leveraged in these dealsIn a statement on Monday Manafort denied that he had received any irregular payments in Ukraine The simplest answer is the truth I am a campaign professional It is well known that I do work in the United States and have done work on overseas campaigns as well I have never received a single offthebooks cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or RussiaBut Manaforts critics in Kiev are scathing Hes an evil genius Alex Kovzhun who spent a decade working for Tymoshenko beginning in 2001 said He doesnt work statesmen He works dictators and allround bastards He sells the unsellable product If you have a dead horse and you need to sell it you call himHe works bad guys They pay more of courseManaforts specialism according to Kovzhun is running expensive campaigns and targeting the great unwashedIts the same element who voted for Putin supported Brexit back Erdoan and who will vote for Trump Manafort works the lowest common denominator I find him repulsive and his message ugly He leaves destruction in his wakeKovzhun said he recognised the same moves in Manaforts campaigns for Yanukovych and Trump He gets his clients to do corny stuff Kovzhun added with bland political slogans and uncreative Sovietstyle imagery With Yanukovych it was Ill hear everyone With Trump its Make America great againIn contrast Voloshin portrays the decade Manafort spent in Ukraine as a success In 2004 Yanukovych was seen as a Russian puppet He was dead Paul resurrected himCan Manafort work his magic one more time The tougher the client you have the the greater success you get It isnt about the money Its about ambition If he can make Yanukovych president Im sure he can do it with Trump
