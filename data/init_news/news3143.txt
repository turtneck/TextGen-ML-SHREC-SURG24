The one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world and theres some steps we could take not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings but to improve the odds that they dont happen as frequentlyWith respect to Planned Parenthood obviously my heart goes out to the families of those impacted  I say this every time weve got one of these mass shootings This just doesnt happen in other countriesWe are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few monthsYou dont see murder on this kind of scale with this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on Earth Obama speech at US Conference of Mayors June 19 2015At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries It doesnt happen in other places with this kind of frequency And it is in our power to do something about it Obama statement on the shooting in Charleston SC June 18 2015Readers asked us to factcheck Obamas broad statement at the Dec 1 Paris news conference that mass shootings just dont happen in other countries Critics pushed back on that comment immediately noting that Paris  where Obama was speaking  had just experienced a mass shooting Mass shootings do happen in other countries and that statementclearlyis false worthy of Four PinocchiosThen in response to the Dec 2 2015 mass shootings in San Bernardino Calif Obama used more specific language that clarified what he was referring to Indeed he has made versions of this claim after other recent mass shootings So we explored the relevant data and definitions what exactly Obama is referring to and the caveats associated with comparing mass shootings across countriesHeres an important caveat to establish There is no consistent definition of mass shooting or mass public shooting across countries or even among researchers who track them within the United StatesThe FBI does not officially define mass shooting and does not use the term in Uniform Crime Report records In the 1980s the FBI established a definition for mass murder as four or more victims slain in one event in one location and the offender is not included in the victim count if the shooter committed suicide or was killed in a justifiable homicide according to a Congressional Research Service report detailing the definitionsAfterthe 2012 shootings in Newtown Conn Congress defined mass killings to mean three or more killings in a single incident Some media outlets and researchers still use the fourfatality definition and have adoptedthe CRS definitions of mass shooting and mass public shootingOther researchers include injuries in the victim count Some researchers include acts of terrorism drug deals gone wrong or gang conflict in their research Others dontSome media reports such as those of our Wonkblog colleagues and advocates use a broader definition used by the Mass Shooting Tracker maintained via Reddit an online forum In this case mass shootings are incidents in which four or more people including the gunman are killed or injured by gunfire By this count the San Bernardino shooting is the 355th mass shooting this yearIn comparison CRS counted 317 mass shooting incidents from 1999 to 2013An FBI spokesman said such counts of shootings to include injuries would be categorized as a mass casualty eventWhile Obama incorrectly said during the Paris news conference that mass shootings just dont happen in other countries he often has clarified that he is referring to the frequency of shootings in the United States compared to advanced countries And his use of frequency appears to be the actual countof shootings in the United StatesWhite House officials did not say what Obama means by frequency but they sent several news sources to support his claims They noted how the United States has more gun violence in general than other countries as reported by The Washington Post and VoxThe Fact Checker has examinedObamas rhetoric on gun homicides in the pastThe White House also pointed to research by University of Alabama criminal justice professor Adam Lankford who declared mass shootings the dark side of American exceptionalism The paper is not yet published officially but his findings have been covered widely in the newsand have been used to support Obamas argumentLankford ran statistical analyses of the total number of public mass shooters per country from 1966 to 2012 in 171 countries and controlled for the national population sizeHe found that the United States had far more mass shooters 90 shooters in the 46 years than the other countries which averaged 17 public mass shooter per country His research excluded gangrelated shootings driveby shootings hostagetaking incidents robberies and acts of genocide or terrorism Lankford requested we not distribute his unpublished study and declined to provide the underlying data citing ongoing researchLankford said he looked at the actual count of shooters rather than the per capita rate of incidents because mass shootings are rare events and small populations of other countries can inflate the rate He said looking at rates of incidents are wildly misleading  for example due to the Umpqua college shooting in Roseburg Ore the citys public mass shooter rate number of offenders per capita would be higher than most American cities because of that attack But the rate would reflect Roseburgs tiny population and not necessarily mean that Roseburg is at higher risk in the future he saidRates need to be interpreted with caution Lankford said One rate that he calculated was between the United States and the European Union because the populations are so large for each that the rates become more reliable The number of public mass shooters per capita the rate for the US was approximately five times the per capita rate for the European UnionState University of New YorkOswego public justice professor Jaclyn Schildkraut and Texas State University researcher H Jaymi Elsass have been trackingmass shooting incidents in 14 countries from 2000 to 2014 They compared the United States to 11 other countries Canada Finland China Britain Australia France Germany Mexico Norway and Switzerland and found the United States had a lower rate of mass shooting fatalities per 100000 people than Norway Finland and Switzerland Other than China these countries were all member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development the common measure for advanced countries But the actual count of incidents showed the United States had 133 shootings during the period compared to a maximum of six in each ofthe other countriesIn their comparison of the United States to 19 other mostly nonOECD countries Lebanon rated higher than the United States in mass shooting fatality rate They excluded shootings related to gang violence or targeted militant or terrorist activity Their breakdowns are embedded at the end of this factcheckThere are caveats to these data The researchers also looked at mass shootings that resulted in multiple injuries not just fatalities This could have driven the number of shootings up especially for the United States For comparison Mother Joness mass shootings database of four or more fatalities from 1982 to October 2015 lists 72 shootingsPlus the SchildkrautElsass list is not exhaustive they are still compiling the list of shootings in other countries and it does not include all of the shootings that may fit their definitionIts also important to note that Norway Finland and Switzerland all had one or two incidents each that left multiple dead or injured The United States in contrast had 133 shootings that killed or injured multiple victims according to their researchFor example a single 2011 attack in Norway a country of about 5 million people killed at least 67 people On a per capita basis that equates to about 5000 victims in the United States In contrast there were at least four mass shootings that killed four or more victims in the United States in 2011 but it did not add up to the number of people who died in Norway Schildkraut said PolitiFact used this research to rate Obamas claims from June Mostly False The White House sent us an article disputing that ratingSchildkraut said its absolutely not fair to count the sheer number of incidents of shootings which shows the United States ranks far higher than any other country Plus comparing shootings across countries is an applestooranges comparison because gun policies politics and attitudes are unique to each country she saidJohn R Lott Jr a gun rights analyst who has tracked mass shooting rates in the United States and European countriessaid Obamas references to frequency are problematic and inaccurate If you are going to compare the US to someplace else if you are going to compare it to small countries you have to adjust for population Alternatively compare the US to Europe as a whole Comparing to the US to Europe including OECD and nonOCED countries from 2009 to 2015 shows the rate of mass shootings in the United States and Europe are about the same Lott said Lott uses the FBI definition of four or more killings in a public space excludes gang or crimerelated activity and includes acts identified as terrorismAstute readers might notice how Lankford and Lott both compared the United States to groupedEuropean countries but their conclusions are vastly different Lott says the rate is about the same while Lankford says the rate is five times higher in the United States How is this possibleThe researchers are looking at different sets ofyears and different sets of countries Lott looked at Europe as a whole Lankford at the European Union Lott uses a broader measure of mass shootings than Lankford does Lankfordlooksat the number of shooters Lott usesfatalities and shooting incidentsThis is an example of how the data and definition can be adjusted to show different findings aboutmass shootings even using a per capita rateThe most accurate way that Obama has described shootings Lott said was his statement after the Oregon shooting We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few monthsStill Lott added I dont know what sense it makes to say I have an area of 320 million people and Im going to compare it to 8 million or even 40 million people I would expect just out of randomness to have more of whatever event to happen in a country of 320 million peopleBut John Roman senior fellow in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute agreed with the underlying message of Obamas statement regarding the prevalence of mass shooting incidents in the United States Frequency is about how often something happens not about how many people were affected by any single event such as the 2011 Norway shootings he saidYes it does happen in other places But boy does it happen a lot in the US and boy does it happen really frequently Roman said And it happens without cause without reason without some ideological backboneWhenever a mass shooting occurs a flurry of infographics floods social media a range of facts are cited and rhetoric swirls amid developing news It doesnt help that Obama uses inconsistent and sometimes vague language to describe mass shootings in the United States compared to other countriesAt times his description was wholly misleading and inaccurate mass shootings just dont happen in other countries other times his description was quite accurate We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months and other times it seemed to be somewhere in the middle the pattern now of mass shootingthat has no parallel anywhere else in the worldQuantitative measures of crosscomparative crime statistics especially where the crime is not consistently defined ie mass shooting usually end up being applestooranges comparisons We dug deeply into crosscomparative measures of the US criminal justice system to other countries in the world and it wasnt easy Its not just about population size but also about differences in gun culture policies and politics in each country How can one compare Israel where there are governmentissued guns to China with stringent gun laws to the United States with Second Amendment rightsWe are sensitive to the tragedy of each mass shooting Our goal is to provide the underlying data and definitions  which show there are numerous ways to talk about mass shootings in the United States and around the world We urge the president to be more consistent and precise in describing mass shootings in the countryas he did after the Oregon shooting rather than using vague or misleading phrases  which overall earn him Two PinocchiosSend us facts to check by filling out this formFollow
