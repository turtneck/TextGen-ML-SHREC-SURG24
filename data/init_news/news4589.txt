New Reports Link Russia With Donald Trumps Campaign Posted on Nov 1 2016 Donald Trump at a rally in Nevada  Gage Skidmore  CC 20  A trove of new allegations has surfaced suggesting a relationship between Russia and the Donald Trump campaign In this unprecedented election season the Republican presidential nominee has been accused repeatedly of fostering a friendly relationship with forces within the Russian government and an adviser to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton recently suggested that Russia has participated in illicit cyberattacks to further Trumps campaign On Monday Slate added fuel to the controversy by publishing an investigative piece in which journalist Franklin Foer alleged that a Trump computer server was communicating with an elite Russian bank Foer wrote The computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis which they set out to rigorously test If the Russians were worming their way into the DNC they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign including Donald Trumps many servers  The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack The communication wasnt the work of bots The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow It dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank  Tea Leaves a pseudonym for one of the researchers and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline What it illustrated was suggestive The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States Another article written by David Corn at Mother Jones on the same day alleged that a former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency Theres no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spys memos Corn wrote But a Russian intelligence attempt to coopt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking Is there any way to substantiate these claims Voxs Zack Beauchamp argued that while the stories are overblown Russian interference in the current US election is a serious problem Beauchamp explained The problem with these stories isnt just that theyre speculative Its that they obscure and even discredit the more sober evidence about Trumps troubling attitude toward the Russian state There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clintons campaign There is strong evidence linking Trumps foreign policy advisers to Russia and Trumps stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests Beauchamp listed various confluences of interest between the Kremlin and Trump pointing to WikiLeaks release of Democratic campaign emails Trumps proRussia pronouncements and economic ties to Russian interests And NBC reported Tuesday that the FBI has launched a preliminary investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manaforts possible foreign ties with Russia and Ukraine The FBI has not commented and Manafort told NBC that none of it is true Voxs Matthew Yglesias also cautioned against getting too excited about the new influx of allegations writing that Trumps policy views on matters related to Russia are a lot clearer than any of these cloakanddagger allegations Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers of The New York Times asserted in an article published Monday that the FBI has not found any conclusive or direct link between Mr Trump and the Russian government Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr Trumps aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation   Lichtblau and Lee Meyers wrote No evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russias election operations The renewed focus on the Trump campaigns relationship with Russia comes as Clinton is again making headlines for her potential misuse of a private email server On Friday FBI Director James Comey revealed that another round of emails related to the Clinton campaign is under review While the FBI investigation has not been formally reopened many Clinton supporters are outraged at Comeys timing suggesting that his announcement so close to the election violated the Hatch Act  With only a week until Election Day it is unlikely that the accusations on either side will be proven or refuted before voters head to the polls
