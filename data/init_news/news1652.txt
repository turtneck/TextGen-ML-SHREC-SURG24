Speaking at a joint press conference Thursday morning at the White House with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau President Obama makes extended comments regarding the 2016 election and its unprecedented political polarization   I have been blamed by the Republicans for a lot of things the president said But to be blamed for their primaries and who they are selecting is novel  Im not going to validate some notion that the Republican crackup thats been taking place is a consequence of actions that Ive taken he said   I dont think I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate for example he said I dont recall saying Hey why dont you ask me about that  Its not as if theres a massive difference between Mr Trumps position on immigration and Mr Cruzs Mr Trump may be more provocative in terms of how he sighs but says them but theyre not that different
