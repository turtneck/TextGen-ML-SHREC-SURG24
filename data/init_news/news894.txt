While some Justice Department investigations are adversarial a new model of collaborative reform is surprising police in some cities asthey find themselves included as part of the solutionSearching for a framework  to heal Baltimore Mayor Stephanie RawlingsBlake put in a 911 call to the US Department of Justice to ask for a civil rights investigation into the Baltimore Police Departments beat cop tacticsHer call not even a week after a local prosecutor charged six police officers with crimes including murder for their alleged role in the death of Freddie Gray is part of a broader trend of collaborative reform between Washington and local jurisdictionsWhats striking about such investigations is that they dont just slam the police but also aim to help officers stay safe and protect citizens as well as show that they are part of the solutionIn fact following a Baltimore Sun series on police abuses in the city last year Police Commissioner Anthony Batts approached the Justice Department to conduct a collaborative review which had been under way the day Mr Gray died while in police custodySome DOJ investigations are adversarial as police bristle at court orders and federal monitors But a federal investigation into whether Baltimore cops routinely violate peoples civil rights is likely to mirror similar probes in Las Vegas and Philadelphia where police chiefs have been able to use federal findings to gain leverage with elected officials and also use facts to rebut claims by police officers that theyre doing nothing wrong says Sam Walker a criminologist at the University of Nebraska at OmahaTo be sure Mr Walker says its too early to tell whether such interventions can bring the kind of fundamental reforms that Mayor RawlingsBlake is hoping to find in the aftermath of Grays death and injuries to nearly 100 cops during violent riotsBut there is growing evidence that such collaborative efforts can help communities grapple with deep tensions between police and neighborhoods and build trust around common goals like respect dignity and sanctity of lifeAfter Las Vegas police shot a record 25 people in 2010 the city began its own reforms and asked the Department of Justice for help a year later In 2011 the DOJ began the new collaboration program delving deep into practices training procedures and policies to root out where officers were going wrong and where policies failed the peopleAs of 2012 the Las Vegas department had completed dozens of difficult reforms including rewriting its useofdeadlyforce policy to include a reference to officers acknowledging the sanctity of human life as they make critical splitsecond decisions The department added socalled realitybased training to give officers more options than quick deployment of deadly force as they interacted with drugged drunk or mentally ill citizens Since then the number of officerinvolved shootings in Las Vegas has stayed below historical averages year to yearIn March the Justice Department reported back on practices of the Philadelphia Police Department which had seen a stretch of years in which police killed a person nearly every week many of them unarmed The DOJ team which was made up of policing experts and not prosecutors released a string of findings that pointed to problems in both policy and trainingSurprisingly to some many complaints came from officers themselves Among the findings were complaints from officers that they were not properly trained to deal with violent suspects The training needed to be less staged and more realitybased officers said including allowing trainees to grapple with each other to learn tacticsInterview participants generally thought that the defensive tactics training offered at the academy focused too much on legal liability and not enough on teaching practical and realistic methods for surviving a physical encounter the DOJ report stated They did not believe that training sufficiently prepared them for a physical encounterAside from giving leaders hard facts to work with such reports can also help defend police officers Even though many police shootings have a racial backdrop the Justice Department found that Philadelphia police did not have a problem with racial stereotyping In fact unarmed white males were more likely to be shot and killed by Philadelphia police than unarmed black malesI want to express regrets for all who have been shot in Philadelphia civilians or police officers Every life is precious in this city and this country so we need to maintain this level of focus Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in March Were one big city Everyone wants to be safe Citizens want to be safe Police officers want to be safeThe Justice Department has conducted 19 civil rights investigations since 2000 stepping up the efforts in the Obama era with five police departments coming under federal monitoring in 2012 alone Some of those investigations have been scathing including a report in March that documented abuses by the Ferguson Mo Police Department that helped fuel protests in the wake of Michaels Brown death last August at the hands of a police officerSo far Attorney General Loretta Lynch has not replied to the Baltimore mayors request for a separate civil rights abuse probeBut the request makes clear that the citys police probably have problems that go beyond the treatment of GraySince 2011 the city has settled more than 100 lawsuits equaling nearly 6 million in cases where people were bruised and battered by officers only to have trumpedup charges later dropped by a judgeTrue institutional change can be difficult After the Baltimore Police Department promised the courts in 2010 it would curb the large percentage of false arrests in the city by offering better training the department dragged its feet the American Civil Liberties Union has alleged The issue has reared up again in the Gray case since prosecutor Marilyn Mosby has charged that officers falsely arrested Gray for carrying a legal knifeBut so far in Philadelphia and Las Vegas one key to success has been the efforts to engage police officers in the process by showing them that they are part of the solution and that the collaboration isnt about outsiders secondguessing their actions In Philadelphia Commissioner Charles Ramsey sent every officer a link to the Las Vegas report so they could see for themselves that it was more an attempt to help officers stay safe and protect citizens than blaming them for their actionsCops are always leery of something Mr Ramsey told the Baltimore Sun We did as much as we could to alleviate any concerns and fears
