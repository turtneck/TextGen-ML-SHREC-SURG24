Washington CNN Rick Perry the former Texas governor who insisted he learned lessons from his disastrous 2012 presidential campaign dropped his second bid for the White House on Friday after just 100 daysToday I am suspending my campaign for the presidency of the United States Perry said in an address in St Louis that virtually mirrored his standard stump speech until the very end Life is good I am a blessed manThe departure of Perry who had little support in earlyvoting states or among the GOP donor class is unlikely to alter the contours of the Republican race But Perry nevertheless implored his supporters in an email to back a candidate who embodies the principles of conservatismThe conservative movement has always been about principles not personalities Perry said before making a nottooveiled swipe at Donald Trump the GOPs current frontrunner Our nominee should embody those principles He  or she  must make the case for the cause of conservatism more than the cause of their own celebrityFor almost two years the swaggering Texan had prepared and studied for a second shot at the presidency But in a 17candidate field Perry found himself weakened by fundraisers who ditched him for his rivals and by top surrogates who defected as his campaign crumbled He raised only about 1 million in the first fundraising quarter and he never had enough supporters for him to earn a spot in the premier GOP debates Back in Texas he remained under indictment on an abuseofpower chargeAnd as it became increasingly clear that the campaign wouldnt be able to overcome deep financial problems that left him without enough money to win a competitive race he became the first GOP candidate to leave itStill Perrys exit still comes surprisingly early He was scheduled to appear next week at CNNs Republican debate which his allies hoped would be a turning point for his troubled campaign His super PAC sat on more than 17 million that it was investing in Iowa to fill the void created by his Austinbased campaign as its financial difficulties mounted And Perry acted very much the candidate all day on Friday authoring an opinion piece about terrorism in National Review in the morning and sharing his vision for his presidency for a half hour in his St Louis speech in the afternoonSome of his top supporters expressed shock that Perry bowed out so early David Johnson an Iowa state senator and the candidates top backer in the Hawkeye State said Perry may have prematurely pulled the plugPerhaps Governor Perry sees something that I dont Johnson said explaining that he heard about Perrys decision from the other Texan in the race  Ted Cruz I was certainly ready to goPerry was unable to reassemble the Texas political and financial base that made him at one point the partys frontrunner in the last presidential cycle In the 2012 race his campaign was dogged by questions about his readiness punctuated by an embarrassing moment in a debate when he couldnt name the third agency he planned to eliminate as presidentAnd just as in his first campaign the man who was once governor of the largest Republican state for 14 years leaves the campaign trail disappointed and also politically damagedThe second campaign began to unravel this summer with the operation essentially abandoning its efforts in Iowa and New Hampshire Doug Deason the son of a 5 million donor to the Perry super PAC said Perrys campaign had only raised 100000 in the two months since the last reporting period Deason said Perry delivered the news of the suspension to him on ThursdayHe felt it coming He knew theres only so much the super PAC can do explained Deason a powerful Texas donor who is part of the Koch Brothers political network After the word got out they were struggling they did start getting donations in  but it just wasnt enough to really make a differenceDeason expects to get his millions of dollars returned next weekThe beauty of course of investing in a super PAC is you get the money back that doesnt get spent Deason saidBut Austin Barbour the groups top operative said it was not immediately clear if the law allowed the donations to be refundedNevertheless other campaigns Friday evening were moving rapidly to poach top financial and political backers of Perry Deason dined with Cruz a few evenings ago Even while Fridays speech was going on Deason was contacted by Cruz finance director Willie Langston and lieutenants from the Jeb Bush and Scott Walker campaigns Johnson said in the hours after Perrys decision he heard from aides representing Walker Cruz and Rick SantorumWould you consider another Texan for president asked Bryan English Cruzs Iowa state director according to JohnsonThe departure of Perry speaks in part to the limitations of super PACs which had been expected to save the cashstrapped campaign Perrys wellfunded group Opportunity and Freedom PAC depended heavily on a small group of Texas families and the organization had indicated it was willing to hire field operatives and launch an aggressive advertising campaignIn It For The Long Haul Opportunity and Freedom PAC Is Back On The Air In Iowa the group announced at 9 am on FridayWe all felt like we had really turned a corner in the past few days said a disappointed Barbour whose super PAC had knocked on 10000 doors in Iowa so far We wanted to fight We felt like there was path but again its not up to usBut despite the super PACs intentions it cannot pay filing fees in early states or help the candidate raise the hard money needed to travel or operate a headquarters The campaign had only raised 12 million in the first three months of the campaign Deason saidEarlier this week Perry shuttered his South Carolina campaign headquarters in the capital city of Columbia And field staffers in Iowa and New Hampshire went without pay this month as the campaign tried to salvage its operation About a month ago Perrys campaign announced that it would no longer be paying staff across the countrySome Perry staffers had remained loyal to the campaign and his super PAC was expected to play a growing if not unprecedented role in resuscitating the official campaign Perrys support barely registered in polls but his departure will likely create an intense fight for the dollars that have flooded his bigmoney group which must spend the money independentlyIt is unclear which candidate or candidates will inherit the support of Perrys backers In the past Perry has repeatedly gone out of his way to lavish praise on another candidate with Texas roots businesswoman Carly FiorinaSoon after Perry announced the end of his bid a flood of warm wishes came from his nowformer GOP presidential rivals on Twitter  perhaps in an effort to court his support or that of his backersGovernorPerry is a terrific guy and I wish him well I know he will have a great future tweeted Trump who has made antagonizing his GOP rivals including Perry a hallmark of his campaignCruz said he donated to The Lone Survivor Foundation and the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation two of Perrys favorite charities and praised his onetime bossThe entire GOP field was unquestionably made stronger by the experience  wisdom GovernorPerry brought to the race he tweetedGovernorPerry has dedicated his entire life to his family friends and Jesus Christ Florida Sen Marco Rubio saidBush praised Perry for his commitment to conservatismAmen God bless Rick Perry for his continuing commitment to that cause Bush saidGovernorPerry getting to know you and Anita has been a great joy for our family Thank you for your service friend Santorum tweetedOther candidates like Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal and Kentucky Sen Rand Paul who have feuded with Trump used Perrys departure to mock the GOP frontrunnerrealDonaldTrump Attacked him one day Praised him today Sounding like a typical politician Rick is a better man than youll ever be Jindal tweetedWhat does it say about GOP when a 3  half
