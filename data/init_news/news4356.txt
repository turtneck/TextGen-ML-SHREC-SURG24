Washington CNN The US government on Monday found itself with fewer tools to investigate terrorism  at least temporarily  after the Senate let provisions of the Patriot Act expire Sunday nightWhile officials warned of national security risks it is clear that the lapse will not come close to debilitating counterterrorism effortsThe Senate entered a debate period late Sunday on the Patriot Act that pushed beyond the midnight deadline effectively ending three provisions of that law including the National Security Agencys bulk data collection programThe lapse was a huge victory for privacy hawks who have called for changes to that program and others under the Patriot Act since Edward Snowden first blew the lid off the NSAs domestic surveillance programs in 2013The National Security Agency officially shut down the bulk metadata collection program officially at 744 pm Sunday night a senior government official told CNN Officials had previously indicated they would shut the program down around 8 pm to ensure all procedures were in place before midnight military timeThe Senate is expected to restore the expiring authorities midweek but heres what we know will change between now and thenWhat counterterrorism tools does the US loseThe government loses authorities under three Patriot Act provisionsThe biggest and most controversial is the governments sweeping powers under Section 215 that allow the NSA to collect telephone metadata on millions of Americans and store that data for five years That is for the time being goneLaw enforcement officials also wont be allowed to get a roving wiretap to track terror suspects who frequently change communications devices like phones Instead they will need to get individual warrants for each new deviceAnd third the government loses a legal provision allowing it to use national security tools against lone wolf terror suspects if officials cant find a connection to a foreign terror group such as ISIS for example But that provision has never been used the Justice Department confirmedThe House overwhelmingly passed a bill the USA Freedom Act that would make big changes to the first but leave the latter two provisions intactThat bill would have the telephone companies hold Americans telephone metadata and require the government to get a specific warrant to seize any telephone metadata  and not on millions of people but instead on specific individualsSo those tools are now completely goneFBI and NSA officials are allowed to continue using Section 215 and the roving wiretap provision in investigations they began before the June 1 expiration dateAny new investigations will have to go without the roving wiretaps and the ability to petition the secret FISA court for warrants to seize business records like telephone metadata in terrorism cases That court was established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide warrants in national security casesThe NSAs bulk metadata collection program was actually slated to end at 8 pm ET Sunday to ensure the government is in compliance with the deadline by midnight in military time as wellThe process of winding down that program was ongoing last week and the NSA was slated to cut off its connections to telecommunications companies starting at 4 pm ET SundayWhy is it such a long processOfficials said the government began winding down the bulk data collection program during the week leading up to the deadlineA US administration official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information said taking down the system involves shutting off inputs between telecom companies and US intelligence bringing down servers and configuring our monitoring software to keep officials from accessing any data at telecommunication companiesWe lock the system down so that there is no chance that data comes or data could be accessed during that time frame the official saidAnd the Department of Justice spent last week communicating the potential changes to its authority to collect data to telecommunications companies according to a Justice Department official and a telecommunications company official familiar with the processReally its about just letting them know that on midnight on the 31st theyre not going to be able to provide the legal documents and the warrant and were not going to give them anything the telecommunications company official saidThe Justice Department official pointed to legal and technical processes that need to occur for the program to shut downSo could America be less safeDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement on Friday the United States would lose entirely an important capability that helps us identify potential US based associates of foreign terroristsBut opponents arent convinced Instead theyre determined not to let fears over national security trump civil liberties and privacy concernsThe American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday that efforts to shortcircuit reform efforts should not be allowed to succeedAllowing the provisions of the Patriot Act to sunset wouldnt affect the governments ability to conduct targeted investigations or combat terrorism the ACLU said The government has numerous other tools including administrative and grand jury subpoenas which would enable it to gather necessary informationWhat are the facts on the expiring capabilitiesAs it stands several official review boards  including a presidential review group and a government privacy oversight board  found that the bulk metadata collection program was not essential to thwarting a single terror plotThe Obama administration endorses the plan under the USA Freedom Act to transform that programThe roving wiretaps provision that can be used in terrorism cases is used less than 100 times per year but officials could be in a bind when it comes to new investigationsAuthorities could still obtain standard wiretaps on a suspected terrorists phone but a new phone requires a new warrantJustice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said the topsecret nature of the investigations make even that a challengeWhen were chasing a terrorist or a spy almost everything we have is highly highly classified Normal courts are not set up to handle that he saidOfficials say the rising threat of lone wolves  including those inspired by ISIS but not ordered  raises the need to maintain that provision of the Patriot ActBut they concede the provision had not been used even as the FBI has increasingly focused its efforts on lone wolves
