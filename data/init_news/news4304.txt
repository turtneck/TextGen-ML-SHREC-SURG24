Copenhagen Denmark CNN Open a newspaper on any given day here in this small Europe nation known for high taxes generous government services and its stubbornly happy citizens and youll almost certainly find a story about the US presidential electionThe Danes are following the race with an astounding level of enthusiasm and interest in part because Bernie Sanders one of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination wont stop talking about themSanders has proudly adopted the label of a democratic socialist and he has pointed to Denmark as a model for his vision of an ideal American futureIn Denmark there is a very different understanding of what freedom means they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurityAt a presidential debate hosted by CNN in October Sanders brought up Denmark and the surrounding Scandinavian states when asked to describe what democratic socialism means to himI think we should look to countries like Denmark like Sweden and Norway Sanders said and learn what they have accomplished for their working peopleWe are not Denmark Hillary Clinton respondedIn Denmark there is a very different understanding of what freedom means Sanders wrote arguing the US could learn from the way the Danes have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurityInstead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all  including the children the elderly and the disabled Sanders addedWhile the Danes are flattered by all the attention they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesnt confuse people into thinking they describe themselves socialists too Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as socialist in the traditional sense of a purely governmentcontrolled economy But that hasnt stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own systemI would like to make one thing clear Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvards Kennedy School of Government Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy Denmark is a market economyBut it is a market with many differences from the United States All Danish citizens have access to child care stateguaranteed medical and parental leave from work free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment free health care and a generous pension all of which Sanders supportsFree is actually the wrong word to describe these services Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world including a 25 tax on all goods and services a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60 The top tax rate in the US by comparison is less than 40But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders policy platform As a small country heavily reliant on trade Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods Businesses here are only lightly regulated The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States which has one of the highest in the world Theres not even a minimum wage in Denmark although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions And in the past few years Danish voters elected a rightofcenter government which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the longheld safety netThe recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world Over the past few years studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation Wall Street Journal the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actually more economic freedom than the United StatesIn terms of pure semantics few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as socialisteven a democratic socialistas Sanders does The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decadesWhen I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist its a little bit 1970s said Lars Christensen a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homelands model The major political parties on the centerleft and the centerright would oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftistCould the US adopt the Danish modelAs even Sanders has conceded the differences between the United States and Denmark are striking In many ways Denmarks success depends on its small size The country has a population of just 56 million  about the same as Minnesotas  and its territory makes up just 16000 square miles about half the size of South Carolina By comparison the United States has a population of more than 300 million and encompasses 38 million square milesUnlike the United States diverse population of immigrants Denmark is ethnically homogenous  nearly 90 are of Danish ancestry according to The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration  making political consensus easier than in the United StatesI think this system is only possible because we essentially are all the same said Christensen Maybe if you wanted to introduce such a scheme in Utah you could do that But doing it across the US I find it completely and utterly impossible just for the mere fact that Americans are all so differentDanish citizens also seem to have a higher comfort level and trust in government than in the United States One would be hardpressed to find a mainstream Danish politician who would agree with Ronald Reagans axiom that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are Im from the government and Im here to helpWhile Americans have a deepseated distrust of government that was imprinted on the nations soul in the Bill of Rights the Danish just dont view their governments size as a recipe for tyrannyThe question is not how much tax you pay or how big your government is its whether it works Lidegaard said Its whether you get return on your payment We pay a lot of taxes but we get a lot in returnThe Danish also participate in the democratic process on a scale unheard of in the United States More than 85 of Danish citizens participated in the nations general election in 2015 Only 55 of Americans went to the polls in 2012Sanders would also probably have concerns with the way Denmark has handled the European migrant crisisFearful that the thousands of refugees pouring in the European Union from Iraq and Syria could threaten their society the Danish government has gone to great  and controversial  lengths to dissuade migrants from settling in their countryThe most problematic move came when the government passed a law that would grant the state the right to seize possessions worth more than the equivalent of about 1500 from refugees settling in Denmark who seek aid from the government The law includes a carveout for items of special sentimental value but the critical reaction from human rights groups was swift and punishingThe law also increases the number of years refugees would have to wait to bring family members into the country and it made it more difficult for them to obtain permanent residency Its passage comes amid the rise of the rightwing Danish Peoples Party which has made combating immigration a chief priorityThere is an inherent contradiction between a welfare state where all your life you pay taxes to have coverage  health social costs etc  and then being in the country as a migrant only part of your life said Lidegaard The problem with the law  and there is one  is that its trying to send a signal Immigrants in Europe dont go here Dont come to Denmark The signal sent that way is a stupid signal to send Thats the purpose of the law Its not a practical measureBefore the law passed Denmarks Ministry of Immigration Integration and Housing published ads in Arab and Englishlanguage newspapers in Lebanon where more than 1 million Syrian refugees live warning immigrants that Denmark will be an unwelcoming place for themThe fear generally is that the foreign culture brought by the refugees would not align with traditional Danish customs and disrupt the recipe for what makes the welfare state possibleThere is a limit to how many immigrants we can take in from a different culture who dont speak the language and how fast we can turn them into becoming citizens that are part of society that are able to function and contribute to the wealth of our society said LidegaardSo we have a lot of focus now on how we integrate newcomers How we turn immigrants into citizens who are part of production part of taxpaying part of paying the billThe Danes are watching usEven though Danes are eager participants in their own elections the amount of time they spend watching and discussing our elections is a phenomenon to beholdAmerican politics is really really popular in Denmark said Anders Agner Pedersen a Danish journalist who edits Kongressen a news outlet that exclusively American politics for a Danish audience It basically is in the news every dayPedersen who has to stay up all night to watch American presidential debates and state primary returns from Denmark is swamped with bookings on Danish television and radio programs to explain the election process and analyze the daily horse race He recently hosted what he thought would be a small salon session to discuss the primaries at a Copenhagen restaurant and was shocked when more than 100 Danes showed up to get their American political fixYou guys do quite a good show he said of the American election processSanders isnt the only candidate the Danes are talking about Donald Trump is a source of constant fascination  and perhaps even a little terror  in the Nordic region In January when three young children who call themselves the USA Freedom Kids dressed up in red white and blue and performed a songanddance number about Trump at one of his rallies in Florida the video skyrocketed throughout Danish social mediaAnd just this month Ted Cruz set Danish media aflame when he suggested that Donald Trump was so unhinged hes liable to drop an atom bomb on Denmark The Danes were bewildered Why usAs the campaign marches on with Trump still riding high in the polls his ongoing success is starting to become a concern hereIn the beginning I thought it was a joke Then we realized people were voting for Trump Jonas Pedersen a medical student at the University of Copenhagen saidAnother medical student Helena Boegh said That some people would actually vote for Donald Trump and in the same country would vote for someone who likes the system we have in Denmark  that really says something about America
