I can guarantee that Obama answered when asked by Fox News Chris Wallace if he would direct the Justice Department to treat Clinton as the evidence showsThat is institutionally how we have always operated I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations We have a strict line he saidWallace asked Obama if he can still stand by his previous claims that the emails did not jeopardize national securityI continue to believe that she has not jeopardized Americas national security Obama said Now what Ive also said  theres a carelessness in terms of managing emails that she has owned and she recognizes But I also think it is important to keep this in perspectiveThe President tried to distinguish between different levels of top secret  or classified information  as a means of defending Clinton What I also know because I handle a lot of classified information is that theres classified and then theres classified he said Theres stuff that is really top secrettop secret and theres stuff that is being presented to the President or the secretary of state that you might not want on the transom or going out over the wire but is basically stuff that you could get in open source Obama said his former secretary of state saying she would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy This is somebody whose served her country for four years as secretary of state and did an outstanding job and no one has suggested that in some ways as a consequence of how shes handled emails that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties he said Obama was also questioned by Wallace on criticism to his personal responses to terrorist attacks citing the President calling the November terrorist attacks in Paris a setback There isnt a president whos taken more terrorists off the field then me over the last seven and half years Obama said defending himself Im the guy who calls the families or meets with them or hugs them or tries to comfort a mom or a dad or a husband or a kid after a terrorist attack So lets be very clear how much I prioritize this This is my No 1 job and we have been doing it effectively he said
