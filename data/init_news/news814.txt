parallel event at a different location raucous proCastro crowds disrupted a gathering of nonprofit and civil society groups blocking Cuban dissidents from participating and denouncing the events

said it cannot envision having full diplomatic relations with a country that has charged it with supporting overseas terrorism In many ways the US designation first imposed in 1982 is a Cold War relic
