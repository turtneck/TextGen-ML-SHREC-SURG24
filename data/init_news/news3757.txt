House Republicans and President Obama joined forces for the final push for votes to keep the White Houses trade agenda alive unveiling the latest version of fasttrack authority overnight Tuesday and setting up a possible Friday vote on the measureGOP leaders hoped to allay Democratic concerns about a minor Medicare provision in the sweeping legislation but the issue remained unsettled after two closeddoor party caucuses Wednesday morningUnion officials in a pair of strongly worded letters accused their regular ally  Obama  of having marginalized labor views and asked Democrats to vote against a program designed to help laidoff workers in a manner that would kill the entire trade legislationComplicating the issues even further is the parliamentary morass House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio has charted for the next few days giving opponents multiple avenues for defeating ObamaIf Boehner and Obamas advisers are not confident in the outcome the vote could be pushed into next week but leading Republicans particularly Rep Paul Ryan Wis have been pushing to hold the vote before allowing lawmakers to leave for the weekend  and another round of hometown opponents pushing House members to vote noRep Gerald E Connolly DVa who is supporting the trade proposals and accompanied Obama to Europe last weekend said the administration has a quiet confidence that it can winthevote with a strangebedfellows coalition consisting of roughly 195 Republicans and25 to 30 Democrats They know its going to be close but they see a path to passage Connolly said after the trip which included two long discussions with Obama and a marathon dinner with his chief of staff Denis McDonoughThe Senate on a large bipartisan vote approved Trade Promotion Authority last month It would give the Obama administration a more certain process for finalizing a large 12nation deal to expedite commerce across the Pacific Ocean At a meeting of the White House Export Council on Wednesday US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the other 11 nations would not put their best final offers on the table until the fasttrack issue is resolved in CongressTheyre only willing to do that if they feel like weve got the political support here to move that forward Froman saidThe TPA bill includes new funding for a program designed to help US workers who lose jobs because of international competition known as Trade Adjustment Assistance which has broad Democratic support but faces some GOP opposition from Republicans who consider it a form of welfareOpponents kicked off their final push to defeat Obamas top remaining legislative priority by latching onto a relatively small cut in Medicare that was meant to offset increased funding for worker trainingWe are going to vote against anything that will cut Medicare Rep Rosa L DeLauro DConn said at a rally outside the CapitolThe DemocratonDemocrat tension has risen to levels not seen in the Obama era Rep Brad Sherman DCalif accused Obama of living in a cloister where only captains of industry get to air their views to himIn the fivepage missive sent Monday AFLCIO President Richard Trumka accused Obama of mischaracterizing labors stance on the emerging TransPacific Partnership TPP You have repeatedly isolated and marginalized labor and unions as the only opponents of fast track and TPP Trumka wrote according to acopy obtained by The Washington Post I am sure you are aware however that the critics of the current TPP encompass a broad deep and intellectually impressive swath of public opinionRepublicans plan to hold several votes on the legislative package  including separate votes for the trade authority and for the worker assistance If both of those passed they would be reattached and then sent to the White House for Obamas signatureThe expectation is that all the Democrats would vote for the TAA legislation along with a few dozen Republicans from districts where manufacturing jobs have been hurt by global trade then a huge bloc of Republicans  along with a couple of dozen Democrats  would support TPABut labor officials are urging Democrats to sabotage the piece of the legislative jigsaw puzzle that requires huge Democratic support TAAs workerretraining funds even though it is for a cause they ideologically support If they take down that vote they would torpedo Obamas entire trade agendaBoehner and Ryan chairman of the Ways and Means Committee do not want to alter the delicately balanced TPATAA package because that would require sending it back to the Senate for another vote and potentially several more weeks of debate there They worked to avert this issue by advancing a separate piece of legislation that would replace the roughly 900 million cut in Medicare slated for 2024 with some stricter enforcement of tax laws He told reporters Wednesday that he would allow that legislation to be voted on first so that Democrats could vote for TAA without fear of retribution from their allies for supporting even a modest cut in the popular entitlement programThat solves the problem Boehner said Now if people are looking for an excuse to vote no I guess they can always find an excuse to vote noHowever in the closeddoor huddle of Democrats Pelosi characterized that plan as unacceptable because it left the language of the Medicare cut in the legislation and said that no matter if it were never going to be enacted into law Democrats could not support such a plan according to a handful of lawmakers in the roomAt the moment Democratic opponents expressed confidence that they would have the numbers to defeat the vote for TAAIve been whipping on this and my sense is that we have mostly no votes said Rep Jan Schakowsky DIll I havent personally come across anybody who said they were going to vote for it
