Clinton certainly has the resume to be a strong presidential contender two terms as the first lady during her husbands popular administration eight years as a US senator from New York and four as a widelyacclaimed secretary of state under President Barack Obama Not to mention that she has already mounted a presidential bid once before during the 2008 Democratic primary With quite a following among Democrats  particularly women  and an expert campaigner as a husband Clinton is one of the frontrunners for the 2016 nomination In fact if the Iowa caucuses were held today a Public Policy Polling survey found she would win 58 percent of the vote outstripping the runnerup Vice President Joe Biden by a margin of 41 percent Now the question is whether or not Clinton will decide to throw her hat in the ring in 2016 After her term as secretary of state ends this year she has declared her intention to take a year off from politics entirely And after that Clinton says that she does not want to run in 2016 but that hasnt quashed hopes to the contrary  Sarah Bufkin
