Sure We Want An Honest And Trustworthy President But Its ComplicatedAmericans say they like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton the most for president but they dont think theyre honest and trustworthySuch a lack of trust according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll might be astonishing if we were not already accustomed to hearing about it  about our politicians in general and about these two candidates in particular But the new polls shows one of the starkest divides yetPolling at 27 percent Trump is at least 10 points ahead of any of his many rivals among registered Republicans Clinton is the choice of 60 percent of Democrats with Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders a rather distant second at 30 percentYet 60 percent of poll respondents said they did not find Clinton honest and trustworthy Fiftynine percent said the same of TrumpTim Malloy assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll said this anomaly has been apparent over months of pollingWeve always found bad numbers on honest and trustworthy for both Clinton and Trump but good numbers for both on leadership Malloy saidIndeed Clinton scored exactly as well on strong leadership qualities in this poll 60 percent agreeing as she did poorly on honest and trustworthiness And Trump by the same token got similar numbers for strong leadership 58 percent yes 39 percent noThe one judgment seems to eclipse the other said Malloy I mean what else could it beThe preference for strength as the premier quality in a leader has a long history both in the US and around the world In times of stress in particular many countries have turned to leaders regarded as tough and decisive  even if those same politicians were also controversial and distrusted by manyIn terms of the whole sample this does appear to be the case But the apparent contradiction between leading the pack and failing the trust test seems less pronounced upon closer inspectionWith their own supporters Trump and Clinton were rated as honest and trustworthy Among those planning to vote for Trump next year 90 percent said he was honest and trustworthy while only seven percent said he was not Among those planning to vote for Clinton 84 percent said she was trustworthy while and 13 percent disagreedThere are of course reasons someone might vote for a candidate without entirely trusting that person It could simply reflect a preference for them over the other available alternativesIn Clintons case Democrats might see her as the partys most electable candidate even though the Quinnipiac poll finds Sanders runs better against some Republicans in hypothetical matchupsIn Trumps case the willingness to back him despite controversy and doubts may indicate the absence of any other consistent GOP rival whos been able to challenge him Trumps closest competitor to date has been neurosurgeon Ben Carson but this poll shows Carson fading as many of his former supporters are split between Sens Ted Cruz and Marco RubioWe also need to remember that Trump and Clintons frontrunner status in the candidate preference numbers reflects only the choices within their respective parties Quinnipiac talked to 672 Republicans and 573 Democrats but the bad numbers for both Trump and Clinton on whether they are honest and trustworthy were based on the responses of all 1453 registered voters surveyedAmong Republicans Trumps trust number was much higher 58 percent than it was from all people in the survey Among Democrats it was just 12 percent while independents gave him 36 percent nearly matching the 35 percent average for all respondentsSimilarly among Democrats Clinton has a much higher trust number 73 percent With Republicans it was just seven percent and among independents it hit 26 percent leading to an overall average among all respondents of 36The news in this poll may be more worrisome for Clinton if only because her trust number among independents was 10 points lower than Trumps marksWhile many numbers in the poll could be cautionary for her backers a remarkable 63 percent of all respondents and 60 percent of independents said she had a good chance of beating the Republican nominee whomever that might be That measure was the highest figure in the hypothetical general election test for any candidate in either partyMeanwhile only 46 percent of all respondents believed there was a good chance of Trump beating an unnamed Democratic nominee next November with independents split evenly on the questionThe poll was conducted nationwide using live interviewers calling both land lines and cell phones from November 23rd30th after the November 13th Paris attacks The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 26 percentage points for the whole survey sample and plus or minus 38 points for the Republican sample and plus or minus 41 points for the Democrats
