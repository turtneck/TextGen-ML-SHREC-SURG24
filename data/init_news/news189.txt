By now everybody knows the injuries that contributed to Freddie Grays death Baltimore authorities and representatives for Grays family agree that the 25yearold sustained fatal trauma to his neck and spine at some point while in police custody following his arrest on April 12 Although a full autopsy hasnt yet been released the family has said that Grays spine was nearly severed and that his doctors had attempted to repair three fractured neck vertebrae and a crushed voice box Last week The Baltimore Sun spoke to medical experts who said that Grays injuries were in the papers words comparable to those seen in victims of highspeed crashesWhile this may end up being a significant detail of the investigation much is still unclear about the circumstances of Grays death including how Grays head might have hit the wall of the van hard enough to kill him Over the past few weeks Baltimore police have provided few answers about how Gray went from seemingly healthy enough to flee police on the morning of April 12 to dead on April 19 after a week in a coma On Wednesday April 29 hours after stating that they would not give the public their forthcoming internal report on Grays death police leaked a different document to The Washington Post It was the first new piece of information from police in nearly a week But instead of clarity it offered more confusionIn its reporting of the incident The Baltimore Sun found witnesses who refuted Millers account to the court In an April 25 article Sun reporter Kevin Rector wrote Kevin Moore a 28yearold friend of Grays from Gilmor Homes said he rushed outside when he heard Gray was being arrested and saw him screaming for his life with his face planted on the ground One officer had his knee on Grays neck Moore said and another was bending his legs backward They had him folded up like he was a crab or a piece of origami Moore said He was all bent up Others claimed to have seen officers beating Gray with batonsAt one point during the arrest according to the police commissioner an officer pulled out a stun gun Moore claimed to have seen this as well According to the Sun police investigators failed to obtain footage from a convenience store surveillance camera that may have captured the incident more clearly Instead the officers found that the moment in question had been taped over by the time they got there This was a common theme throughout the investigation as officers reportedly failed to obtain footage from other cameras that may have recorded key moments in Grays subsequent ride to the police stationA third perspective on Grays arrest was added to the mix on Wednesday when CNN interviewed an anonymous relative of one of the arresting officers The woman said the officer believes Gray was injured outside the paddy wagon though she expressed personal concern that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie GrayThis is the critical question and there is still no clear answer Witness video shows Gray screaming at the time he was loaded into the vehicle According to the official police timeline the van made its first stop four minutes later so that officers could shackle an irate Gray He was removed from the van and was placed in leg ironsPolice and witnesses then agree that Gray was returned to the van in both hand and leg restraints Officers have admitted they didnt buckle Grays seat belt a violation of police department policy that has led to suggestions that Gray may have been the victim of a rough ride  an illegal but not uncommon technique in which officers drive vans in such a way as to cause injury to detained passengersAt 859 am about 15 minutes after Gray was first put in the van the vehicle stopped for a third time after the driver asked an officer to perform a check on Gray This had previously been explained as the second stop and exactly what happened there was reportedly a key part of the investigation Batts has said that responding officers had to pick Gray up off the floor and place him on the seat and that Gray requested a medic at this time He was ignored againThe fourth and final stop was made minutes later to pick up another prisoner At this point its unclear what state Gray was in Davis has suggested that Gray was again found on the floor but responsive enough to make another request for a medic If this request was indeed made it was evidently denied Other reports suggest that Gray may have already lost consciousness when this second person was picked upDetails of Allens account conflict with earlier reports on Grays time in the van including reports from police officials themselves According to the Post Allen told investigators that Gray was banging against the walls and intentionally trying to injure himself But Allen later told WBAL When I got in the van I didnt hear nothing It was a smooth ride We went straight to the police station All I heard was a little banging for about four seconds I just heard little banging just little banging
