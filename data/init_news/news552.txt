21st Century Wire says Yesterday WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew  that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White Houses claim of the US election process being hacked by the Russian government was a desperate work of fiction Not content with that fish tale Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the Russians The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  Its time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia httpstcoD8oSmyVAR4 pictwittercom07dRyEmPjX  Hillary Clinton HillaryClinton October 31 2016 Apparently Hillary Clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the Clinton campaign which ran on a questionable proDemocratic Party online news outlet On Monday the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named Franklin Foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night just evaporated John Roberts from Forbes explains The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season As for Foer he says on Twitter a follow up piece is in the works Roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word RETRACTION CYBER FEUD Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession During his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker John Pilger when asked what he thought of Hillary Clintons shrill antics Julian Assange said  I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess Still Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZstyle tabloid sting That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season Assange was right Clinton the Democratic Party and their surrogate are eating themselves Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT 21st Century Wire 2016 Files SUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE  BECOME A MEMBER 21WIRETV
