A series of legal setbacks have halted the governments intensive preparations to move forward with President Obamas executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation even as community organizations continue a rapid push to get ready for the programs according to US officials and immigrant advocacy groupsSince a federal judge first blocked the new programs in February the Department of Homeland Security has suspended plans to hire up to 3100 new employees most of whom would be housed in an 11story building the government has leased for 78million a year in Arlington Va That building in the Crystal City area is now sitting mostly unused DHS employees sayYet inside and outside the Beltway community groups are mobilizing educating immigrants and training volunteers to help them apply for relief even though it remains unclear whether the program will ever begin Most recently a foundation headed by billionaire George Soros undaunted by the court rulings pledged at least 8million to that effortWere full speed ahead said Josh Hoyt executive director of the Chicagobased National Partnership for New Americans acoalition of proimmigrant groups that have held more than 700 information sessions on the new programs and trained more than 2000 volunteers to aid immigrants in applying for themObama announced in November that up to 5million illegal immigrants would be eligible to be shielded from deportation  including undocumented parents of US citizens and legal permanent residents  as long as they met certain criteria One of the signature initiatives of his presidency the plan also expands a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of more than 600000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and has granted most of them work permitsBut after Texas and 25other states sued the administration calling the moves unconstitutional a federal judge in Texas in February put them on hold until the case is resolved A federal appeals court recently upheld that injunction with legal observers now saying the court fight could last until late in Obamas term The 2012 program remains unaffectedThe legal battle highlights the explosive nature of the immigration debate which has emerged as an early issue in the 2016 presidential race even as immigration legislation remains stalled in Congress The fate of Obamas executive action benefiting immigrant parents known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents or DAPA will resonate into the next administration Most Republican presidential candidates have pledged to overturn Obamas immigration actions while leading Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has strongly endorsed themAs soon as Obama took his actions on Nov20 US Citizenship and Immigration Services immediately began efforts to implement those initiatives said Marsha Catron a DHS spokeswoman The next day the agency leased a 280000squarefoot building on Crystal Drive in Crystal City to house DAPA employees according to DHS documents sent to CongressThe building came fully furnished but required about 26million in startup costs including 27million for workstation and desktop equipment documents show Those costs were to be funded with fees collected from immigrants who had applied for other government programs and DHS says DAPA would have no impact on any existing programsCitizenship and Immigration Services which is part of DHS is central to managing the nations immigration system and processes more than 6million citizenship and other applications and petitions each yearThe plan also called for 1000employees mostly new hires to start up DAPA in Crystal City and 400staffers at other service centers nationwide to process applications for the expanded 2012 program for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children That program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACAOver time however Citizenship and Immigration Services projected that a total of 3100 new employees might be needed for the two programs which were expected to cost up to 484million per year and be paid for by the 465 application fees required for each applicantBy midFebruary DHS was days away from beginning to accept applications for the expanded DACA program with the first DAPA applications to follow in MayBut on Feb16 US District Judge Andrew Hanen in Texas issued his ruling temporarily blocking both Citizenship and Immigration Services immediately took steps to ensure the agency ceased its preparations said Catron who added that DHS is disappointed by that decision as well as the May26 one by the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upholding itSince then everything is on hold said Kenneth Palinkas president of National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council 119 which represents about 12000 Citizenship and Immigration Services employees Current employees who had been offered jobs in Crystal City have had the offers put on hold or rescinded he saidAs for the Crystal City building only the first floor is being used to train employees about 30 at a time on various aspects of immigration law said Palinkas who recently toured the facilityFederal contractors some of whom were also slated to work in Crystal City have also been affected DHS has canceled a request for proposals for a new mail and file room operations center to be staffed by about 400contractors documents saidIts kind of come to a screeching halt said Marielena Hincapie executive director of the National Immigration Law Center which helps immigrants with legal and other issues She said the Obama administration is being very cautious  They feel that injunction was very clear that theyre not able to do anythingBut immigrant advocacy groups feel differently she said because activists are confident that the administration will eventually prevail in the courts There is a sense of being undeterred that we are going to continue planning she said We need to make sure that the infrastructure is in place and ready to goAcross the nation immigration advocacy organizations and other community groups are training people who will act as navigators  helping immigrants determine whether they are eligible for DAPA  locate key documents such as school transcripts and fill out the application Activists describe the training as similar to that for another key Obama initiative the Affordable Care Act which also used navigators to help people enroll for health insuranceThe reality is you cant turn on a switch in peoples lives and all of the sudden 5million people pour into the gates of DHS and move into the application process said Ken Zimmerman director of US programs for the Open Society Foundations of which Soros is founder and chairmanZimmerman said the 8million the organization is making available will go to a variety of community groups and will fund things such as new computer software to help them process applications He said the foundations may donate moreIn the Washington area CASA  a Marylandbased immigrant advocacy group  is continuing the DAPA informational sessions it has been holding in Maryland Virginia Pennsylvania and Delaware since Obamas announcement in NovemberAt first hundreds and hundreds upon hundreds of people showed up said George Escobar CASAs senior director of human services Since then he said obviously interest has waned a little amid frustration over the legal setbacksOur job is to keep people motivated added Escobar who believes it is highly likely that DAPA will survive the court challenge We will continue to prepare for it he said
