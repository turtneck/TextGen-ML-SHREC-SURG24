The 81yearold Supreme Court justice who has attained somewhat of a cult following for her stance on gender equality told a gathering of law students Wednesday that people often ask her when she thinks there will be enough women on the courtAnd my answer is when there are nine she said as if the question even needed to be askedGinsburg also spoke about the difficulties she faced attaining a job in the legal fieldIn those days in the Southern District most judges wouldnt hire women In the US attorneys office women were strictly forbidden in the Criminal Division There was one woman in the Civil Division she saidAnd the excuse for not hiring women in the Criminal Division was they have to deal with all these tough types and women arent up to that And I was amazed she added I said have you seen the lawyers at legal aid who are representing these tough types Theyre all womenIn what is sure to further her Notorious RBG status the justice later also delivered this gem of a quote If I had any talent in the world any talent that God could give me I would be a great diva
