Nine in 10 Native Americans say they are not offended by the Washington Redskins name according to a new Washington Post poll that shows how few ordinary Indians have been persuaded by a national movement to change the football teams monikerThe survey of 504 people across every state and the District reveals that the minds of Native Americans have remained unchanged since a 2004 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found the same result Responses to The Posts questions about the issue were broadly consistent regardless of age income education political party or proximity to reservations12 Native Americans talk about the furor over the Redskins nameAmong the Native Americans reached over a fivemonth period ending in April more than 7 in 10 said they did not feel the word Redskin was disrespectful to Indians An even higher number  8 in 10  said they would not be offended if a nonnative called them that nameThe results  immediately celebrated by team owner Daniel Snyder and denounced by prominent Native American leaders  could make it that much harder for antiname activists to pressure Redskins officials who are already using the poll as further justification to retain the moniker Beyond that the findings might impact the ongoing legal battle over the teams federal trademark registrations and the eventual destination of the next stadium The name controversy has clouded talks between the team and the District widely considered Snyders desired destinationNative Americans indifference on Redskins name could reset DC stadium talksThe Washington Redskins team our fans and community have always believed our name represents honor respect and pride the owner said in a statement Todays Washington Post polling shows Native Americans agree We are gratified by this overwhelming support from the Native American community and the team will proudly carry the Redskins nameBut Suzan Harjo the lead plaintiff in the first case challenging the teams trademark protections dismissed The Posts findingsI just reject the results said Harjo 70 who belongs to the Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee tribes I dont agree with them and I dont agree that this is a valid way of surveying public opinion in Indian CountryTwo other key leaders in the namechange movement did not challenge the validity of the poll and instead issued a joint statement calling the responses from Indians encouragingNative Americans are resilient and have not allowed the NFLs decadeslong denigration of us to define our own selfimage wrote Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter and National Congress of American Indians Executive Director Jacqueline Pata However that proud resilience does not give the NFL a license to continue marketing promoting and profiting off of a dictionarydefined racial slur  one that tells people outside of our community to view us as mascotsHow The Post conducted the survey on the Redskins nameSince the nearly halfcenturyold debate regained national attention in 2013 opponents of the name have won a string of highprofile victories garnering support from President Obama 50 Democratic US senators dozens of sports broadcasters and columnists several newspaper editorial boards including The Posts a civil rights organization that works closely with the National Football League and tribal leaders throughout Indian CountryIn response Snyder vowed never to change the moniker and used the 12yearold Annenberg poll to defend his position Activists however have argued that the billionaire must act if even a small minority of Indians are insulted by the term They have also maintained that opinions have evolved as his unyielding stance has been subjected to a barrage of condemnation by critics ranging from South Park to the United Church of ChristBut for more than a decade no one has measured what the countrys 54million Native Americans think about the controversy Their responses to The Post poll were unambiguous Few objected to the name and some voiced admirationIm proud of being Native American and of the Redskins said Barbara Bruce a Chippewa teacher who has lived on a North Dakota reservation most of her life Im not ashamed of that at all I like that nameBruce 70 has for four decades taught her communitys schoolchildren dozens of whom have gone on to play for the Turtle Mountain Community High School Braves She and many others surveyed embrace native imagery in sports because it offers them some measure of attention in a society where they are seldom represented Just 8percent of those canvassed say such depictions bother themA brief history of the word redskin and how it became controversialEven as the namechange movement gained momentum among influential people The Posts survey and more than two dozen subsequent interviews make clear that the effort failed to have anywhere near the same impact on IndiansAcross every demographic group the vast majority of Native Americans say the teams name does not offend them including 80percent who identify as politically liberal 85percent of college graduates 90percent of those enrolled in a tribe 90percent of nonfootball fans and 91percent of those between the ages of 18 and 39Even 9 in 10 of those who have heard a great deal about the controversy say they are not bothered by the nameWhat makes those attitudes more striking The general public appears to object more strongly to the name than Indians doIn a 2014 national ESPN poll 23percent of those reached called for Redskins to be retired because of its offensiveness to Native Americans  more than double the 9percent of actual Native Americans who now say they are offended by itA 2013 Post poll found that a higher proportion of Washingtonarea residents  28percent  wanted the moniker changedColumn In complex Redskins name debate poll should give both sides pauseHalbritter a key figure and financier in the fight against Snyder has described the issue as one of the most important facing his peopleIt is critical he wrote in a 2013 Post oped Indeed precisely because it is so critical this campaign is not going away no matter how much the NFL or Snyder wants it toBut an overwhelming majority of Native Americans disagree with just 1 in 10 saying they consider the issue very importantI really dont mind it I like it  We call other natives skins too said Gabriel Nez a 29yearold Navajo who left his reservation last year to study criminal justice at a college in New MexicoThe name is nothing to me said Jarvis Michael Horn a 39yearold member of the Winnebago Tribe who works at a corner grocery store in IowaFor me it doesnt make any difference said Charles Moore a 73yearold Oneida of Wisconsin who as a physician treated patients for four decades before retiring in MinnesotaThe poll which has a 55 percentagepoint margin of sampling error was conducted by randomly calling cellular and landline phones It asked questions only of people who identified themselves as Native American after being asked about their ethnicity or heritageThose interviewed highlighted again and again other challenges to their communities that they consider much more urgent than an NFL teams name substandard schools substance abuse unemploymentLets start taking care of our people and quit worrying about names like Washington Redskins said Randy Whitworth 58 who lives on the Flathead Indian Reservation in MontanaBut Harjo questioned the validity of the poll results and said they do not reflect what she has seen during her decades of involvement with the issueI dont accept selfidentification People say theyre native and they are not native for all sorts of reasons she said Those of us who are leaders in Indian Country know who we are representing We also know if we are representing a minority view And this is not the case here Our experience is completely the opposite of the Annenberg poll and this one I just reject the whole thingOthers including Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid DNev Rep Betty McCollum DMinn and veteran NBC broadcaster Bob Costas said The Posts findings would not alter their view that the name is offensiveIt remains uncertain how the poll will affect either the stadium discussion or the trademark caseAlthough the Redskins have a lease at FedEx Field in Landover Md until 2027 team officials have acknowledged that they hope to relocate well before thenMaryland Gov Larry Hogan R Virginia Gov Terry McAuliffe D and Washington Mayor Muriel E Bowser D have all expressed interest in making a deal with the team Hogan has defended the moniker while McAuliffe has avoided criticizing it Bowser and some DC Council members have publicly condemned it as racist and derogatoryOn Thursday a spokesman for the mayor told The Post that the concern about the team name is well documented and far reaching  from the Oval Office to the halls of Congress to the DC Council chambersBut news that such a large percentage of Native Americans do not care about the name could provide the necessary political cover for District leaders to welcome Snyders club to return to the site of RFK Stadium where the Redskins used to playThe federal government however would also have to approve because RFK stands on National Park Service land controlled by the Interior Department The current secretary Sally Jewell has echoed Obamas opposition to the nameAttorneys for the Redskins and Native American activists declined on Thursday to discuss the polls potential impact on the trademark case Some experts say the surveys results could help the team but others argue that the data cannot be admitted as evidence because the case is no longer at the trial levelLower courts have said that Indians opinions on the term matters only between 1967 and 1990 when the teams trademarks were registeredTwo years ago the US Patent and Trademark Offices appeal board ruled that Redskins offended a substantial number of Native Americans at the relevant time violating the Lanham Act which bars potentially disparaging names from trademark protection A federal district judge upheld the order last summer Now the Redskins have petitioned the Supreme Court to weigh in arguing that regardless of whether the name offends Native Americans the Lanham Act violates the teams freespeech rightsAmid the legal maneuvering and namechange push some Indians interviewed by The Post voiced resentment toward the activists A small percentage of their community had in their minds spoken for the majorityIts 100 people okay with the situation and one person has a problem with it and all of a sudden everyone has to conform said New York resident Judy Ann Joyner 64 a retired nurse whose grandmother was partShawnee and partWyandot Youll find people who dont like puppies and kittens and Santa Claus It doesnt mean were going to wipe them off the face of the earthBut an important question remains Is it appropriate for the name of a professional sports team to insult any percentage of a population that has historically been so mistreated by this countrys majorityTara Houska a tribal attorney who lives in the District and has organized protests against the name argued that neither a majority opinion nor a fans passion should matter if the imagery hurts the psyches of young natives  and research shows that it doesA tomahawk chop and a bunch of people wearing redface does not honor me in any sense of the word and it certainly does not honor Native American children said Houska a member of the Couchiching First Nation To me it doesnt matter if my feelings are hurt Yes it is offensive and I dont like seeing it everywhere But what really matters is how this affects our youthNowhere are the nuances of this complex debate more apparent than in a mobile home amid the mountains rivers and forests on Montanas Flathead Indian Reservation where Rusty Whitworth lives with his wife AnitaWhitworth is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes A laborer who has worked on ranches most of his life he said he does not mind the nameJust let them keep it he said of the team It aint hurting nobodyAnita Whitworth 62 also belongs to the confederation A mother of five who worked for years as a chemicaldependency counselor she hates the nameShe views it much the same way that many activists do They argue that the central problems ravaging native communities  poverty violence and addiction  can only be fixed if young people take pride in who they areHer youngest Whitworth said is a darkskinned 13yearold who attends an almost entirely nonnative school in a region long plagued by racial tensionWhen she looks at him Whitworth thinks back to the years of disparagement shes enduredShe has seen store employees follow her because they suspect she will steal something She has heard derogatory comments in restaurantsShe has also been called a RedskinI dont want to ever have my son experience anything like that she said Its time to change Its time to move onIan Shapira Emily Guskin Jonathan OConnell Aaron C Davis and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report
