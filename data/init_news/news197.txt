Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Washington Home Depot store receives order for fivethousand gallons of gold exterior paint The Washington DC branch of the famous chain of home improvement superstores received an unusual and baffling phone call late last night Store manager Chuck Williams told reporters We received a telephone call just before closing last night from a very excited gentleman placing an order for over 120000 worth of gold concrete paint He continued It was quite a hurried conversation and I couldnt catch everything he said but I did hear the caller say something cryptic about turning a white house gold I honestly have no idea what he could have meant perhaps it was a riddle And weirdly he kept referring to himself in the third person At first we thought it might have been a hoax or someone out of their head on mindaltering substances but we have checked our account and the money is already there so we will start fulfilling the order immediately When pressed by reporters Mr Williams was reluctant to give further details for fear of breaching customer confidentiality but he did confirm that the order was for a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC 20500 He added I dont know who this caller who referred to himself as The Big Cheese could be but he sure loves gold Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday for FREE There are currently
