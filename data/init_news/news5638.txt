Today the White House will hold the annual Easter egg roll Kids will roll their eggs along the lawn hunt for eggs and enjoy other fun activities Its a benign heartwarming eventSo where did this lovable tradition come from It all started when Congress made kids get off its lawnThe Easter egg roll goes back a long time  some say Dolley Madison began the tradition though thats probably just legend There are reports of various egg rolls occurring throughout the mid1800s but by the 1870s there werent a lot of places for kids to have fun in Washington DC The city was very much under construction  the Washington Monument had been left halffinished for 23 years  and contained a lot of dirt and mudThat led a lot of kids to play near Capitol Hill The only problem Their presence uprooted some of the tender grass that was just starting to grow near the Capitol Building The annual Easter egg rolls they held there upset the national landscapingSo on April 21 1876 Congress passed the Turf Protection Law which banned Easter egg rolls on Capitol Hill In 1877 bad weather kept the Easter egg roll from happening and 1878 didnt look much better In the days leading up to Easter the Washington Post warned kids not to roll their eggs on the Capitols lawn or theyd encounter the large Capitol police forceThings looked bleak for the Easter tradition until the president stepped inAt some point in April 1878 a child from the neighborhood saw President Hayes on a stroll He asked Hayes when hed allow kids to roll eggs on his new White House lawn Hayes looked into it and told the guards that if any kids showed up to roll eggs on the White House lawn it was fineIts tempting to interpret the egg roll as a political battle After all the leader behind the Turf Protection Law William Holman was a Democrat and that party regularly called Hayes Rutherfraud because of his disputed election in 1876 So perhaps Hayes was just trying to show up DemocratsMore likely it was that the president wanted kids to have fun Nancy Kleinhenz is the communications manager at the Rutherford B Hayes Presidential Center where theyve been recreating the egg roll for years She says it wasnt politics but fatherly instincts that inspired Hayes to save the day After all Hayes had two children who were still young Scott and Fanny who were 10 and seven Politics wasnt a factor Kleinhenz says He was a dad Since then the Easter Egg Roll has become a tradition at the White House with only brief pauses during wartimeThe Easter egg roll probably isnt a story about partisan battles But in Washington everything becomes political when federal resources are involved  and that includes which lawn gets trampled by children playing with eggs
