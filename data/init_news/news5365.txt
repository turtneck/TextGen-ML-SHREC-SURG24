Mainstream Presidential Polls Fuel Illusion That Voters Are Stuck With Only Two Choices   By Meleiza Figueroa go digital  CC BYSA 20 Editors note Meleiza Figueroa is the press director for the Jill SteinAjamu Baraka campaign and a PhD candidate at the University of California Berkeley She is a longtime activist and organizer in California Corporate media are focused on Donald Trumps accusations of oversampling on the part of Democrats against Republicans Hes half right because polls do oversample declared Democrats by up to 14 percent in polls that compose the RealClearPolitics average  The deeper story is that mainstream polls skew against youth and independents who are undersampled in most polls up to a whopping 30 percent A recent CNN poll sampled few people under the age of 50 Not one major poll lists alternativeparty identification in the breakdown of its sample The first problem with sampling involves definitions Most polls sample likely voters with a bit of expansion to count for a smattering of registered voters So who are likely voters Voters who 1 consistently votewhich automatically excludes people ages 18 to 22 who have no voting history 2 identify with either of the two major parties and 3 say that they intend to vote in the next election Registered voter polls dont count firsttime voters not yet registered to vote so forget about the opinions of those college students who are signed up in enthusiastic campus getoutthevote drives   The questions asked in the polls reinforce established dualistic views of the political spectrum The presidentialpreference questions in polls that deign to include Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson dont ask Who is the candidate you want to vote for or Which candidate is most aligned with your positions and values Nearly all the polls frame the presidential question as If the election were held tomorrow who would you vote for In a media landscape where we are toldthrough unbalanced news coverage  controlled debates and ceaseless cultural propaganda down to the red and blue cups at 7Eleven stores during election seasonthat only the Democratic and Republican candidates are considered viable most people will of course hold their noses and vote for the lesser of two evils Its telling that the very next followup question reads If the election were ONLY held between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton who would you vote for You might as well reword the questions to 1 Which candidate do you think will win and 2 Which of these two candidates do you hate the least Neither of these questions address the issue of who people want to be their next president The rest of the questionnaires wipe alternative candidates off the map completely Thirdparty candidates are treated as if they dont existwhile the approval ratings for the two parties in government and Congress as a whole are hovering around historic lows  What we can glean from the polls is that its clear people want change but what kind of change they want is of no concern to the pollsters We did get a sample of the earthshaking hunger for change during the 2016 primaries when the votes for Bernie Sanders turned the polling orthodoxy upside down The most famous example was Sanders 21point polldefying upset in the Michigan primary  The wild cards in this case wereyou guessed it independent and young voters  who turned out in droves in Michigan Wisconsin New Hampshire and other openprimary states to deliver a giant middle finger to the establishment candidate No one really knows how large the Bernie or Bust crowd is but what we do know is that the floodgates opened during the tragic circus of the Democratic National Convention and progressive Berniecrats began to burn Green Demexit became a trending hashtag on social media and a recent nationwide survey of Sanders delegates found that 33 percent intend to vote for Stein  Everywhere the SteinBaraka campaign goes we find an evergrowing base of supportnot just among former Sanders supporters but also among those unlikely voters who are underrepresented in polls young people Independents and people of color These are all the demographics when broken out in mainstream polls that go about 4 percent to 10 percent higher for Stein These voters compose a potentially gamechanging awakening sleeping giant that has the establishment working overtime to impose a media blackout on a thirdparty alternative The corporate media have shown themselves willing to lock out alternative parties In fact a recent video of a CNN focusgroup taping caught them in the act When a fair number of participants identified their preferences as Johnson or Stein the scene was promptly reshot to exclude these choices portraying these voters as undecided In this election yearwhen the largest voting block of registered voters are independents  and many people especially millennials lowerincome voters and people of color are fed up with the twoparty systemthe means of taking a temperature check on the state of our democracy denies a voice to those who choose to reject the establishment duopoly Only 9 percent of Americans chose Clinton and Trump to be the majorparty nominees which puts a whole lot of people in a big margin of error A voter revolt could be happening right under our noses but the establishment and their pollster apparatchiks dont want you to notice They want to maintain the illusion that voters are stuck with only two choices a trap that the majority of Americans who want another major party are trying to escape
