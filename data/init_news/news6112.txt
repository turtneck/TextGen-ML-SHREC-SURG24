groups surge in West AfricaIn Mali Fridays attack underscored how vulnerable the West African country remains even after French forces and a small number of US troops helped unseat Islamists from their northern stronghold in 2013 Before that campaign militants appeared to be gaining ground moving closer to the capital seizing on the chaos caused by a 2012 military coup The current government still has only tenuous influence in parts of the country and the remaining French forces in particular are considered targetsThe gunmen stormed the hotel early Friday sending some of the 170 guests
