by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente  Tomorrow election day will be only one week away In this post I want to talk about two distinct subjects First I want to talk about the sort of calculation that a Martian might make when confronted by the choice we will face in the voting booth Then Id like to paint a brief picture of what election day would look like in a world where I didnt want to claw out my eyeballs A Martian Looks at Election Outcomes in 2016 I say Martian because a Martian is so detached that the 30000foot view looks like a closeup and I think in this election detachment is a virtue see above at claw out my eyeballs So a Martian would feel that despite the all the sound and fury the numbers have not been that crazy assuming one trusts them Among registered voters Emphasizing how remarkably stable the 3916 race has been  going back to Sept 2015 httpstcoodFykkIm8m pictwittercom2CKuS9Qi9G mdash Mark Murray mmurraypolitics October 31 2016 RealClearPolitics has a similar chart averaging all the polls with a vertical scale that makes the swings a lot bigger To me the pattern of the race is that Clinton starts out with and retains a natural institutional advantage of around four points Again from the headtohead RCP chart Trump has closed and then pulled even six times September 2015 December 2015 February 2016 May 2016 July 2016 and September 2016 And each time either Clintons institutional advantages have reasserted themselves or Trump has shot himself in the foot take your pick Trump is closing now Can he pull ahead and close the deal Unknown Based on past performance no Then again as I remarked before the latest email eruption a week is a long time in politics Wikileaks has yet to drop its final shoe and each campaign probably has a garbage truck full of oppo fired up and ready to go Paradoxically Martians are not warlike since the thin air small population and harsh conditions on Mars make war a speciesthreatening event For the same reason Martians prize the deep memories of elders while treating every child as precious And Martians resist Marsization because the one time there actually was a single Marswide cosmopolitan class of elite overlords they tried to invade the Earth and who knows where that would have led So if you were a Martian and you believed that Clintons election would lead to a new war  and you believe that endorsing BowlesSimpson and hemispheric trade in a speech at Goldman Sachs mean a Grand Bargain and TPP passage respectively then you might look askance at a likely Clinton victory What do do If you had a Martian friend who followed American elections obsessively  this is similar to Southeast Asian countries where people obsessively follow English Premier League football  this is what your friend might tell you The last thing you want is for Clinton to be able to enact her real private agenda Sure she might make some small good changes but if you throw war a Grand Bargain and the surrender of national sovereignty with another socalled trade deal on one side of the scale its hard to see what outweighs them on the other at least in terms of concrete material benefits1 So working on the assumption that Clinton will win what you need is A Republican House  Here the checks and balances built into the American system favor gridlock and gridlock is your friend since little legislation will get passed Whether the House Republicans impeach Clinton if the Senate is in Democrat hands is an open question but with Clinton having privatized the email server for her public office and the shenanigans at the Clinton Foundation  the Clinton administration will provide a targetrich environment I woudnt put it past them to try to take Clintons security clearance away A Democrat Senate  The emergence of leftish party barons with independent power bases is the untold story of election 2016 Warren is at least sound on banksters and financial power and Sanders while not a Bolshevik is well to the left of the Democrat mainstream Thats a Good Thing Both are prolific fundraisers who dont need the DNC If the Republicans hold the Senate the tendency will be for Democrats to stick together If the Democrats do then Baron Warren and Baron Sanders and allies like Sherrod Brown  will feel more free to drag the party left A close race  If Clinton wins shell claim a mandate if the margin is a tenth of a percent But in the same way that anybody can print money but the trick is getting other people to accept it others will be less likely to accept her claim the closer the result is I think the result would have to be better than the four points Obama beat Romney by  511 to 472  and as of today Clintons margin is 28 in RCPs fourway average  Of course Bush claimed a mandate in 2004 too  true story I managed to Googlebomb Bush mandate to Mandate magazine back in the day when Googlebombing wasnt hard  and proceeded to try to gut Social Security whereupon the Democrats promptly gutted him and went on to win the 2006 midterms But why make it easy So thats the Martian perspective on the race Surprisingly or not the personal characteristics of puny Earthling candidates are not a factor Nor are cultural or class markers Elections on Mars Here is how Election Day works on Mars Again because of planetary and cultural characteristics Martians reserve tricky and complex electronic devices for important things like distributed Martian parallel chess or space operas They are also convivial and they hate to be manipulated by large and opaque forces that time the Jovians invaded Obviously I cant provide links for most of this  the Uniform Resource Locator is a global standard not an interplanetary one  but in short form 1 On Mars Election Day is a national holiday Thats because Martians unlike American Earthlings think that everybody should have an equal opportunity to vote Voting is equally easy for almost every Martian whether they work or not 2 The Martians use handmarked paper ballots handcounted in public This is remarkably similar to international standards on Earth which the United States does not use Last March the countrys highest court found that secret computerized vote counting was unconstitutional Unfortunately the country was Germany and the Constitution violated by evoting systems was the one that the US wrote and insisted Germans ratify as part of their terms of surrender following WWII Paul Lehto a US election attorney and Constitutional rights expert summarized the German courts unambiguous landmark finding  No specialized technical knowledge can be required of citizens to vote or to monitor vote counts There is a constitutional requirement of a publicly observed count The government substitution of its own check or what wed probably call an audit is no substitute at all for public observation A paper trail simply does not suffice to meet the above standards As a result of these principlesall independent observers conclude that electronic voting machines are totally banned in Germany because no conceivable computerized voting system can cast and count votes that meet the twin requirements ofbeing both observable and also not requiring specialized technical knowledge Handcounting paper ballots is no good at all argue critics unless you really want to know who the actual winner of the election was After the verdict in the case  filed by a computer expert and his political scientist son  Lehto wondered how it could be that open observable democracy is seemingly an inviolable right for conquered Nazis but not apparently for citizens of the United States 3 The Martians throw a big party at the precinct after the paper ballots have all been handcounted Thats partly because Martians are convivial but also because the Martians think that democracy is important and ought to be celebrated Again because the Martian population is small they wish to begin the conciliation process between winner and loser immediately lest fratricidal violence result and theres no better way to do that than over food 4 The Martians regulate all forms of political advertising for size small and frequency not often whether for candidates or policies Thats because the Martians wish to minimize manipulatio by encouraging facetoface forms of persuasion and deliberation in public venues wherever possible 5 The Martians ban published polling data thirty days before the election Thats because Martians believe that they each should vote for their own reasons and that elections unlike markets are not manipulative beauty contests Conclusions Crazy Martians What are they thinking NOTES 1 Sadly the time for an allout assault on Republican obstructionism was 2009 when all the stars had aligned The Republicans had no credibility and the Democrats had the House the Senate the most powerful orator of our time so it was said in the White House and a mandate for hope and change Of course Obama assuming good faith squandered this opportunity starting with his inaugural speech if not before APPENDIX And then theres Evan McMullin doing well in Utah  I havent seen any actual evidence that hes Mitt Romneys straw in case of some kinda electoral college debacle 0 0 0 0 0 0
