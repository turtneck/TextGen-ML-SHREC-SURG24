One might have expected theninth Republican presidential debate to be a cut above the earlier edition With Chris Christie out of the race and Ben Carson present but basically out of the running it was a chance for the race to get serious for the five candidates who could potentially win this thing to make their cases without much distraction from the B playersInstead Donald Trump accused Jeb Bush of threatening to moon the kind people of New HampshireIt was an anarchic evening where even disciplined moderators had trouble keeping things on track Thats par for the course for these things at this point but the particular kind of chaos this time around was different and didnt always play to the favor of Donald Trump lord of chaosWe wont know who really won until poll results trickle in But in the meantime here are the candidates who ended the night better off than they started it  and the ones who slippedAfter a long campaign in which his name has become almost synonymous with failure and pathos Jeb finally  finally  had a good nightIt may not have come to him entirely fairly The whole debate he appeared to have the support of the live audience who even raucously applauded his characteristically dull and platitudinous closing statement This makes sense Apparently only 600 of the 1600 tickets to the event were given to the candidates and the state and national party controlled most of the rest The result was an enthusiastically proJeb crowdBut whatever the reason for their Bush love it worked Trump was frequently booed  and when he tried to argue the audience was stacked against him he was booed even harder And Jeb was given the chance to throw red meat not to GOP base voters but to typical GOP establishment typesThat distinction is crucial Defending the Iraq War is not something that say Tea Party activists are all that excited about doing But its something longtime Republican activists who were involved in the South Carolina state party in the 2000s had to do all the time George W Bush was their guy for eight years They stood by him They knew all the attacks about him and recoiled at each oneSo when Trump decided to attack the Iraq War and point out that the president who presided over 911 cannot reasonably claim to have kept us safe the crowd took it personally And booed And applauded when Bush fought backApplause applause applause The Republican base might have moved on from George W Bush but the professional party operative class in the audience in South Carolina has not and gave Bush one hell of a moment which likely helped him with viewers in the state without that emotional attachment to the Bush legacyEven better he didnt have to answer for his flipflop on whether Iraq was a mistake even as Trump pressed him to do so And best of all Marco Rubio Jebs main rival for the establishment vote helped Bush out declaring I just want to say at least on behalf of me and my family I thank God all the time it was George W Bush in the White House on 911 and not Al GoreJeb also did something hes been hesitant to do for much of this campaign He embraced being a Bush This is clearly part of a broader strategy what with W coming back to campaign for his brother in South Carolina But its a smart strategy Bush was never going to win by hoping that people forgot hes related to one of the most controversial figures in Republican history But there is some residual goodwill in the party toward W especially on national security and Bush is uniquely positioned to exploit that at a moment when ISIS has made terrorism and Islamist radicalism much bigger issues than theyve been for yearsJeb is still languishing in fourth in South Carolina polls Its too soon to declare he has momentum But he gave about the best performance he couldve hoped for which should give him a decent chance of outpacing Rubio and maybe even Cruz too in the stateThe longer the bloodier and the sillier this campaign season is the better it is for the eventual Democratic nominee And it doesnt get much longer bloodier or sillier than the debate tonightHeres some stuff that actually happened tonight After a campaign thats mostly involved candidates falling over themselves to show their commitment to screwing over Latino undocumented immigrants Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio started arguing over who spoke better Spanish  in SpanishDonald Trump the GOP frontrunner who won New Hampshire in a landslide and will almost certainly win in South Carolina too stuck up for Planned Parenthood To repeat Less than a year after doctored undercover videos made the organization anathema to all Republicans and its defunding a key priority of the congressional GOP the Republican frontrunner for president praised itAnd Trump accused Jeb Bush of threatening to expose his buttocks to crowds of voters an accusation that is amazingly not entirely without meritIf it had been scripted it wouldve been the greatest surrealist masterpiece this side of Luis Buuel but to any general election swing voters watching it was just a clown show The most reasonable person onstage was defending the Iraq War at great length Thats bananasWorse still for Republicans it left the race still largely unsettled Probably the best hope for a swift end to the primary is for Trump to just keep winning everything  but Trump had one of his worst nights to date Probably the best hope for an establishment contender to win is for John Kasich to realize he cant do well outside New Hampshire and drop out for Rubio to acknowledge that hes toast and do the same and for Jeb to rise up and save the day But while Jeb had a good night it wasnt a sogoodheknockedouthisrivals nightAnd Ted Cruz gave a perfectly fine performance that should keep him firmly in second place or even give him the potential to repeat his Iowa victory over Trump a few more times and throw the race into still further chaosThe takeaway from tonight was that this race will last a long time it will involve a lot more ridiculous debates like this and it will continue to make the Republican party look like a silly mess Thats all great news for Hillary and BernieNo moderator couldve completely contained the madness that was tonights debate Jeb and Trump were too committed to going after each other as were Rubio and Cruz for them to respect time restrictions or refrain from demanding a right to respond when their names were so much as mentioned in passingBut CBSs John Dickerson nonetheless did a fine job asking productive followup questions and with a couple exceptions like a question about Trumps profanity mostly sticking to the substance His backandforth with Ted Cruz pointing out that Anthony Kennedy was confirmed for the Supreme Court in an election year earned him boos from the audience who saw him as nitpicky and eager to defend Obamas nomination But he was right and he was keeping Cruz to the facts  which is crucial for a moderatorAnother highlight was Major Garretts questioning on Cruzs tax plan Garrett took it for granted that Cruz is proposing a valueadded tax  which Cruz has denied but which isabsolutely true if you look at how its structured Cruz denied it but Garrett pressed himBut perhaps the best question went to TrumpTrump just didnt answer the question even after Dickerson pressed him The upshot was clear Trump isnt capable or isnt willing of conceding literally any error He really is exactly as arrogant as you think he is And Dickerson demonstrated this not by saying it or arguing it but by having Trump show it for himself Thats moderating at its finestAnd he mostly got booed for having a point He attacked the audience as stacked to be proBush  which it appears to have been He defended Planned Parenthood as doing important work besides abortions  which it does And he attacked George W Bush for launching a war in Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction and for failing to prevent 911  both totally legitimate criticismsBut they are not criticisms you make in a Republican debate Trump has strayed from party doctrine before but when hes done so its been on issues where the GOP is in a very different place from the establishment He opposes cutting Social Security and Medicare which enrages libertarian economic types within the party but delights actual voters especially elderly ones He wants big tariffs on China which freetraders in the party hate but white workingclass workers who actually vote for the party loveHere though hes on his own Theres not a huge Republican constituency for the idea that the Iraq War was not just bad but built on a lieNow the general point here is true Bush and Dick Cheney made claims about WMD and Iraqs relationship with alQaeda that werent just false but which they knew to be false given the intelligence they had at the time or for which they had no evidence at all But its something that youd expect a Democratic primary contender to say not a Republican And throwing in they knew there were none is even a bit far for a Democrat Trump is allowed his heterodoxies on some issues but accusing the most recent Republican president of deliberately misleading the nation into a war is unlikely to appeal to just about any GOPerSame with his claim on 911 Here Trump isnt merely critiquing Bushs Iraq policy something thats a bit more acceptable within the GOP Hes critiquing Bushs terrorism record in general  and implicitly the overall Republican foreign policy consensus that the correct way to fight terrorism is through overwhelming force Thats a consensus thats lasted since Bush left office and isnt really challenged by any other candidateTrumps Planned Parenthood comments are perhaps most baffling at all There really arent that many prochoice Republicans out there or even many prolife Republicans open to the aggressive promotion of birth control through groups like Planned Parenthood And however many there were before the organization became a rightwing media boogeyman last year there are almost certainly fewer now Theres no reason for an undecided prolife activist to watch that exchange and come away preferring Trump to his rivalsAll of this is bad for Trump on his own but its especially bad given that Trump was unabashedly liberal before 2011 or so He said in 2008 that Bush deliberately lied to start the war in Iraq and attacked congressional Democrats for not impeaching him over it In 1999 he told Tim Russert he was strongly for choiceRepublican rivals have tried to attack him for this before mostly without success Voters saw Trump as authentic now whatever his past beliefs why not believe the message But seeing elements of the old more liberal Trump sneak through might give that critique new forceTrump is still winning this primary He will probably win in South Carolina and the rest of the field remains scattered enough that he stands a good shot of winning a majority of states in the SEC primary on March 1 But tonight more than any other debate felt like a momentum where the tide could shift against himIf his name werent Marco Rubio this guy wouldve dropped out by now Think about it If say Chris Christie had gotten third in Iowa and then fifth in New Hampshire and totally botched the preNew Hampshire debate would anyone look at him and think Yeah this is a guy with a plausible path to the nomination Of course not But because Rubio has been the one true hope of the Republican establishment for most of this cycle hes been given something of a passBut he still needs a way to take advantage of that lenience He needs a way to beat back Bush and Kasich and emerge once again as the natural establishment rival to Cruz and Trump And he needed tonight to overcome his last disastrous debate performance and prove to the establishment that he wont fail them againWhat happened instead was a basically fine debate performance devoid of any obvious gaffes that nonetheless was woefully insufficient to turn around his dying campaign His decision to attack Cruz more than Trump might have made strategic sense but in practice it mostly gave Cruz a chance to remind voters once again that Rubio favors letting some undocumented immigrants become citizens And every minute Rubios immigration views are the topic at hand he losesAnd when it came time for Rubio to attack Trump he  defended Jeb Bush I just want to say he declared at least on behalf of me and my family I thank God all the time it was George W Bush in the White House on 911 and not Al Gore That is a great thing for a Bush surrogate to say so as to build up the family reputation and give Jeb a hand Its a gracious but tactically baffling thing to say if you are trying to defeat Jeb BushRubio wasnt a disaster But he didnt need notadisaster He needed a blockbuster performance that got him back to where he was immediately postIowa with strong momentum and a media narrative of Rubio rising He didnt get that and its difficult to see now how hes ever going to put himself back in contention
