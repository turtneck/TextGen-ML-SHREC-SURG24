As the deadlines near for Iran and world powers to reach an agreement on the countrys nuclear program  the first on March 31 for a basic political framework  negotiations are focusing on what kind of program Iran can have How much uranium and plutonium can it have How many centrifuges can it use to develop more fuel How long will restrictions be in placeTheres one fact though that is taken as assumed Iran very badly wants a nuclear program So badly that it has been willing to press ahead with the program secretly as well as overtly despite Western and UN sanctions that have crippled its economy and despite repeated US warnings of possible military actionIran claims its program is entirely peaceful but there are major reasons to doubt this and it is generally taken as a given by analysts that the country has at least taken justincase steps partway toward building a bomb Some facilities seem to servelittle plausible function beyond nuclear weapons capability though a point that Western intelligence agencies have made in the past is that building the capacity for making a bomb is not the same as deciding to make a bombWhatever Irans intentions though the countrysdedication to nuclear enrichment even at such enormous costs can seem bizarrely counterproductive So why is Iran so set on its nuclear program There is no one dominant answer but rather a few plausible explanations some of which go against the most common Western perceptions and misperceptions of how Iran works There is probably some truth to all of themConsider Tehrans view for a moment Israeli and American leaders have been talking for years about bombing Iran or invading it outright The Bush administration named Iran part of its axis of evil alongside Iraq which it invaded months later For much of the last decade the US has had thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan both Irans neighborsIranian leaders appear to sincerely believe that the United States is bent on their governments destruction For example the United States helped Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in his brutal yearslong war against Iran in which he killed thousands of Iranians including with chemical weapons It is difficult to overstate how traumatic the yearslong war was for Iranians how badly they want to prevent another such war And nothing deters chemical weapon attacks like a nuclear weaponYou will hear Iranians frequently mentionIran Air flight 655 a civilian airliner that the US military accidentally shot down in 1988 killing 290 civilians In Iran this is still frequently viewed as deliberate Imagine youre an Iranian leader seeing all this You might want a nuclear deterrentAlso consider the timing of the program When the ayatollahs came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution they at first cancelled the countrys nuclear program but then restarted it after Saddam invaded in 1980Tehran wanted to guard against a future surprise analogous to Iraqs repeated use of chemical weaponswritesShahram Chubin of the Carnegie Endowment More recently Iran has been embroiled in lowlevel proxy conflicts with Israel and Saudi Arabia and with what it sees as a defensive conflict against the hostile WestIts important to remember that Iran sees itself as isolated in the world despite intimations of occasional Russian or Chinese support Save for proxies such as Hezbollah and the Syrian government it sees the Middle East as largely aligned against it It is also important to remember that its leaders in power only since 1979 feel weak and isolated Current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in particular has never been very confident in powerThat sense of insecurity feeds into a rational desire for deterrence against external threats but it also creates a less rational belief in antiIran conspiracies or an impending American invasion When the US threatens to bomb Iran to stop a nuclear program Iranian leaders can misread this as a desire to destroy the Iranian state itself which would make them more likely to want a nuclear deterrent which only makes the US threaten more strenuouslyIrans national pride runs deep and with good reason It has been an active center of cultural scientific religious and political thought for many centuries Its also still upset again with reason about decades of Western interference during the 19th and 20th centuriesThe nuclear program is a way in which Iran affirms to itself and to the world that it is an advanced and sovereign nation Its a way of saying we are not inferior to the world powers even though you treat us that way but are in fact equalsIts also a way of defying what Iran sees as continued Western efforts to control exploit or weaken Iran The more that the world tells Iran it cannot have a nuclear program the more important building such a program becomes for the cause of Iranian nationalismThis is part of why Iranian leaders so often state that they want world powers to affirm Irans right to enrich uranium and to respect Irans dignity  a word that top officials use frequently This isnt posturing  they really mean itIn November 2013 as nuclear talks got underway Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifreleased a video articulating Irans position He spent very little time talking about actual nuclear policies  the meat and potatoes of the negotiations  and lots of time saying things like We expect and demand respect for our dignity He frequently mentioned phrases such as equal footing and mutual respect The video was taken as bizarre and inexplicable by Americans because they could not see that this demand for respect was not a side issue  it was central for IranThere was a brief moment after the US invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 both Irans neighbors where Tehran seemed eager to strike a deal with the West over its nuclear program There are many reasons that fell apart  Dick Cheneypersonally worked to torpedo any communications for example  but a crucial one was Iranian politicsIrans antiUS hardliners took the parliament in 2004 and the presidency in 2005 with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad The hardliners turned the nuclear program into something of a partisan wedge issue using it to weaken reformers and moderates who wanted to compromise the program to soften relations with the WestBoth Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used the nuclear issue to stigmatize reformists depicting them as defeatists willing to negotiate away Irans interests Chubin writes Their use of the nuclear issue as an instrument of partisan politics ended the phase when the nuclear program was supposed to be a national issue And debate was actively discouragedThis was great politics for Ahmadinejad and other hardliners But it made it much more difficult for him or other Iranian leaders to compromise on the program They were too invested in the program politically to back down  even if backing down would have been in Irans national interestsBy 2010 Chubin writes the divide over Irans nuclear program had more to do with domestic politicsand very little to do with what many of the key players actually wanted to see happenAhmadinejad is out of power but the hardliners are still powerful They have particular influence over Khamenei who as supreme leader is the ultimate decisionmaker Because of the way Khamenei came to power  his religious credentials are weak and his political credibility never as strong as predecessor and national founder Ruhollah Khomeini  hes long caved to hardliners who he fears could turn against himSince Iran become the Islamic Republic in the 1979 revolution it has seen the Middle East as a battleground for its influence This is meant as both defensive and offensive ever since Saddam invaded Iranian leaders have feared that hostile Westernbacked Arab leaders could do them terrible harm And Tehran sees proAmerican Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia as inherently hostileBut Iran is also expansive and aggressive in the region supporting proxy terror groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah both as a deterrent against American or Israeli threats and as a way to project its power In the context of this regional struggle for power a nuclear weapon starts to make a lot more sense Not as something that Tehran would want to actually use but as a way to get away with other sorts of troublemakingClifton W Sherrill of Troy Universityexplained in a 2012 issue ofNonproliferation Review how Iran could use a nuclear weapon as not just a deterrent but a way to give itself cover for bullying its neighbors and generally projecting more power in the region where competition for influence is already high and the stakes are enormousThe regime believes nuclear weapons would deter foreign military strikes targeting the Iranian homeland making the Iranian use of conventional military force abroad less risky Sherrill writes At a minimum possession of nuclear arms would allow Iran greater policy flexibility in the Middle EastThat likely means using proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon even more aggressively to threaten and bully other countries in the region That also means pushing harder to support proIran militant groups in countries such as Syria and Yemen where Iran sees itself as competing for influence The idea is that Iran can be more brazen and aggressive with these nonnuclear threats because its nuclear weapon would scare other countries out of retaliatingThat bullying could also have implications for energy politics Iran might feel it could force demands in the Persian Gulf regarding disputed islands or natural gas fields or desires regarding production quotas within OPEC Sherrill warns And he points to nucleararmed Pakistan as an example of how this all can happenDespite widespread misconceptions to the contrary in the US  often pushed by politicians who wish to play up the Iranian threat for political gain  there is no reason to believe that Iran wants to launch an offensive nuclear strike against the US Israel or any other countryThe wellestablished logic of nukes would make any war against other nuclear powers a loser for Iran This is because powers such as the US and Israel have what is called secondstrike capability meaning that even if Iran got off a nuclear strike the country would still be destroyed by the retaliation There is no costbenefit calculation by which an offensive strike would make sense for IranAs Sherrill explained It is highly unlikely that the Islamist regime plans to actually detonate a nuclear weapon in an offensive attack Both of the obvious targets the United States and Israel have a secondstrike nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the Islamist regimes survivalSome argue that Irans leaders are inherently irrational because of their religion and would be willing to launch a suicidal war against the US or Israel As Newt Gingrich once put it for example Its impossible to deter them What are you going to threatenThe seemingly sole piece of evidence that Irans leaders have spent the last 36 years secretly plotting a suicidal war is the idea that their interpretation of Shia Islam foretells of a messiah who will return on the apocalypse While Ahmadinejad did reference this idea many times he was alone in this as Matt Duss of the Foundation for Middle East Peace explains and was widely rebuked by Shia scholars and his own countrys political and clerical establishmentsActual readings of Irans official Shia theology by actual religious scholars Duss finds reach the opposite conclusion that Newt Gingrich did Iranian leaders see it as their religious duty to preserve their system not destroy it in a fiery war with Israel As scholar Mehdi Khalaji told Duss As the theory of the guardianship of the jurist requires the most significant task of the Supreme Leader is to safeguard the regime even by overruling Islamic lawMeanwhile there is ample evidence that Iranian leaders are just as rationally invested in selfpreservation as anyone else You cant hold up a political system as complex and besieged as Irans without being shrewdly selfinterested If Irans Islamic regime were really looking for a suicidal war in which to martyr itself the eightyear war with Iraq offered many such opportunities none of which they tookThere are a number of reasons that Iran wants a nuclear program and has taken steps toward a nuclear bomb Some of those reasons are rational and others are not But a desire to launch an offensive strike against another country is not one of them
