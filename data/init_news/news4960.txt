Daisy Luther Lets talk about Wikileaks First of all the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006 Their website explains what they are all about WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war spying and corruption It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses In the 11 years that theyve been publishing documents they have not been disproven a single time Their record for authentication is perfect Learn more here and here  So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton the Democratic Party the Clinton Foundation and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton that unfortunately no one is reporting on in the mainstream In the interest of brevity each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak In no particular order John Podesta the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik one of the top officials in the Department of Justicethe day after the Benghazi hearing  Kadziks son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign and the icing on the corruption cupcake Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillarys interrogation about Emailgate  source  We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money and now theres proof Zero Hedge writes todays Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation Bands firm Teneo Consulting and the Clinton familys private business endeavors A pundit called this leak The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation meaning that with this document all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated  source  Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on  Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because shed be without one And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case  surprisingly it isnt related to her health  source  The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment Brian Fallon the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign wrote  Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President  universal background checks of course but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability  According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold  source  The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity Bill Cosby  Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions  How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did Is his conduct relevant to your campaign You said every woman should be believed Why not the women who accused him Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies  source  Clintons campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuitclad Bernie Sanders to the press ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street Perez Hilton wrote  Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Marthas Vineyard pool summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists   source  Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to GoldmanBlack Rock in 2014 And I am not taking a position on any policy but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged And I never had that feeling when I was growing up Never I mean were there really rich people of course there were My father loved to complain about big business and big government but we had a solid middle class upbringing We had good public schools We had accessible health care We had our little you know onefamily house that you know he saved up his money didnt believe in mortgages So I lived that And now obviously Im kind of far removed because the life Ive lived and the economic you know fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy  but I havent forgotten it  source  She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau  My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders  some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere  source  In a leak of yet another paid speech this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013 Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey  cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if you know jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees Meanwhile if Clinton has her way  we will be warmly welcoming 65000 refugees a year which makes Obamas 10000 a year look like small potatoes  source  Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didnt exert some control over North Korean aggression  So China come on You either control them or were going to have to defend against them  she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013  source  In May 2015 Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco The implication from the leaked emails was that a 12 million donation from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit Human Abedin usually loyal to her boss had concerns   If HRC was not part of it meeting was a nonstarter She created this mess and she knows it Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email Incidentally Clinton didnt attend Bill and Chelsea went instead and the 12 million donation was not forthcoming source  Podesta attacked Clintons primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement  Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it  said Podesta  source  Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria   My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene she told employees of the bank in South Carolina which had paid her about 225000 to give a speech We used to be much better at this than we are now Now you know everybody cant help themselves They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else Look what were doing and I want credit for it  source  There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Whos Who in American Media  Dan Merica from CNN Haim Saban of Univision John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times Rebecca Quick of CNBC Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico John Harris of Politico Donna Brazile formerly of CNN Roland Martin of TVOne Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe and Louise Mensch of Heat Street  source  As everyone knows the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination  Bonus Wikileaks also released some of the DNCs voicemails on the topic  There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRCs puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros  The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory  it really exists and Hillarys job is to keep George Soros happy  source  Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to twofaced treachery In them she clearly points out that sometimes you need to lie If everybodys watching you know all of the back room discussions and the deals you know then people get a little nervous to say the least So you need both a public and a private position  source  Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her impromptu CNN Town Hall questions  source  The campaign got to approve articles in influential publications like NY Times HuffPo CNN NBC CBS NYT MSNBC and Politico showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRCs abysmal candidacy  source  Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all spoiler basket of deplorables basement dwellers and right wing conspirators  source  President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta W e need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov  You see Obamas emails all have to be fromwhitelistedaddresses So someone somewhere added her nonsecure email to his whitelist  source  And finally heres the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics And let me tell you it isnt because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself emphasis mine At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein who quipped that you go to Washington to make a small fortune Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government  There is such a bias against people who have led successful andor complicated lives  Clinton said
