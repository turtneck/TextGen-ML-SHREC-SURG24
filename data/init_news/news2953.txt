A nasty feud that escalated Thursday between Donald Trump and his chief Republican rival over their wives set off a new wave of alarm among establishment Republicans who fear that the GOP frontrunner would drive away female voters in a generalelection fight with likely Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonTrumps gender problem flared again this week as he and Sen Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults while Cruzs wife Heidi became the target of vitriol on social media from Trump and his supporters At one point the real estate mogul retweeted an unflattering image contrasting Heidi Cruzs appearance with his wife Melania a retired modelThe images are worth a thousand words read the caption on the photo that Trump retweeted to his 72 million followersThat message and others have prompted an outcry among Republicans and Democrats alike while Cruz said Thursday that real men dont bully womenOur spouses and our children are offbounds Cruz told reporters while campaigning in Dane Wis It is not acceptable for a big loud New York bully to attack my wife It is not acceptable for him to make insults to send nasty tweetsThe altercation underscores the striking nastiness of the GOP primary race and the uncomfortable gender politics surrounding Trump who has a long history of making incendiary remarks about women and their appearance Trump has shown little reluctance in attacking his female rivals  or some of his rivals spouses  in ways that strike many as sexist or demeaning and many fear that the insults are a harbinger of the gutter rhetoric to come if he faces Clinton in NovemberTrump has called Clinton very shrill belittles her for a lack of stamina and energy and late last year jabbed her and husband Bill Clinton for the latters marital indiscretions while he was president In another instance Trump said Hillary Clinton got schlonged in her 2008 primary fight against thenSen Barack ObamaI have some very real concerns should he become the nominee I think it would be catastrophic for our party said GOP strategist Katie Packer who leads the Our Principles PAC an antiTrump super PAC Half of the reason why Im fighting so hard to stop Donald Trump is because I think hes a walking talking stereotype of a sexist misogynistic pigPolling shows Trump sliding among women in recent months hurting the GOPs already shaky position with that demographic Trumps favorability numbers have decreased 10 points among women nationwide since November to 23 percent while his unfavorable number among women has jumped to 75 percent from 64 percent according to a Washington PostABC News poll taken this monthThe changes among men have been less pronounced with 37percent now favorable and 59percent unfavorable In the states that have voted so far Trump received an average of 41percent of the male vote and 34percent of the female voteThe fight with Cruz began earlier this week when Make America Awesome an antiTrump super PAC circulated ads on Facebook featuring a risque photograph of Melania Trump from a 15yearold British GQ photo shoot It was part of a concerted push to diminish the billionaire among values voters in UtahThe GOP  and its big funders  scramble to insulate Congress from TrumpMeet Melania Trump Your next first lady Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday the ad readTrump who went on to lose the Utah caucuses excoriated Cruz and issued a threat via Twitter Be careful Lyin Ted or I will spill the beans on your wifeTrump  who wrongly alleges that Cruz was behind the ad  defended the tweet Wednesday on Fox Business Network saying it was a disgraceful and terrible thing that demeaned his wife avery very successful modelThen came Wednesday night when Trump retweeted the unflattering image of Heidi Cruz setting off a fresh series of condemnationsTo Trumps critics the attacks on Cruz are just the latest in a troubling pattern of reducing women to their physical appearance and disparaging them in exceptionally personal waysExhibit A is the longrunning onagain offagain feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly whom Trump called crazy and average in so many ways in a series of tweets last week Fox News said the namecalling is part of a sick obsession that is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidateSen Lindsey O Graham RSC a former presidential candidate and an outspoken critic of Trump said Thursday on MSNBC Im worried that young women think that the standardbearer of the Republican Party believes that Megyn Kelly is a bimboGOP strategists fear that Trump clinching the nomination could present an opportunity for Democrats who are poised to choose the first female presidential nominee and who in past elections have accused Republicans of waging a war on women over access to affordable womens health care abortion rights and pay equityTrumps treatment and views of women have been a central issue throughout his presidential campaign At the first GOP debate in August Trump berated Kelly for asking him about past insults of women and singled out actress Rosie ODonnell as the specific woman he referred to as a fat pig A month later Trump criticized the appearance of rival Carly Fiorina the only woman who sought the GOP nomination Look at that face he told Rolling Stone magazine Can you imagine that the face of our next presidentMarcy Stech communications director at Emilys List which has endorsed Clinton said the Republican base might find this amusing but the reality is that these are just the kinds of misogynistic and outrageous comments that will cause lasting damage with women votersShe added Well have plenty of opportunities to remind women voters of this moment even after todays news cycle has blown overPacker said Trumps standing with female voters could also endanger the GOPs hold on the Senate or even the House At the same time Packer said she thinks the antiTrump movement could prevent the party from being branded by Trump aloneHillary Clinton is very very vulnerable among this group of women that she needs to have as her base independent women and soft Republican women Shes very vulnerable with them today Packer said Should we nominate Donald Trump they will flock to her because they see him as someone whos repulsive And its not just about socalled womens issues its about how he values women and about how hes willing to make women feel to benefit himselfFor months Trump has defended himself against accusations of being offensive to women saying that he hits all his challengers equally He labeled former Florida governor Jeb Bush low energy and sought to diminish Sen Marco Rubio of Florida with the nickname Little MarcoId hit you the same way Trump told NBCs Chuck Todd in February when pressed on the issue I mean you are the perfect one to ask that question  you have been you know under fire from me for a long time and you are far from a womanI think there are some women  theres one sitting right over there in the beautiful red dress You see that woman over there I have great respect for that woman over there he said as Todd clarified to viewers that Trump was talking about veteran reporter Andrea MitchellI
