Senate solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOPs establishment He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23These are all of our stories Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia These are who we are as Americans And yet for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distantBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White HouseSo ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again Trump told the crowd at his announcementIn the scenario that appears most likely to emerge from the primary contests Clinton tops Trump 52 to 44 among registered voters That result has tilted in Clintons favor since the last CNNORC Poll on the matchup in JanuaryBut when the former secretary of state faces off with either of the other two top Republicans things are much tighter and roughly the same as they were in January Clinton trails against Rubio with 50 choosing the Florida senator compared to 47 for Clinton identical to the results in January Against Cruz Clinton holds 48 to his 49 a slight tightening from a 3point race in January to a 1point matchup nowSanders  who enjoys the most positive favorable rating of any presidential candidate in the field according to the poll  tops all three Republicans by wide margins 57 to 40 against Cruz 55 to 43 against Trump and 53 to 45 against Rubio Sanders fares better than Clinton in each matchup among men younger voters and independentsThe race for the presidency hits its primary season peak as 78 of voters including almost the same share among Democrats Republicans and independents who say that the nation is more deeply divided on major issues facing the country than it has been in the pastThe survey asked voters to choose which of all the remaining top candidates regardless of party they trust most to handle seven top issues Trump tops the list on the economy terrorism and immigration while Clinton is the top choice when it comes to health care race relations and foreign policy Voters are about evenly split between Trump and Clinton on gun policyAdding up all the candidates from each party Republicans have the edge on the economy terrorism immigration and gun policy while more voters choose one of the Democrats candidates on race relations and health care with about an even split between the two parties on foreign policyVoters choices broken out by party provide an interesting window into areas where Trump might hold crossparty appeal Though the share of leaned Republicans choosing Clinton on any of the tested issues tops out at 8 on health care Trump is the most trusted for 15 of leaned Democrats on terrorism 14 on the economy and 13 on immigrationAs noted above Sanders holds the most positive favorability rating of any of the top candidates for president 60 of registered voters view him positively 33 negatively He is the only candidate seen favorably by a majority of voters and one of four who are seen more positively than negativelyThe two frontrunners Clinton and Trump are seen unfavorably by majorities of voters Almost 6in10 have a negative view of Trump 59 with 38 favorable and 53 have a negative view of Clinton 44 see her positivelyCruz also has a net negative rating while impressions of Carson Rubio and Kasich tilt positiveThe economy remains far and away the countrys top concern as the election campaign rolls on with 47 calling it most important as they decide how to vote for president followed by 19 citing health care 14 terrorism 10 foreign policy and 8 illegal immigrationShould Michael Bloomberg the independent former mayor of New York City throw his hat into the ring as an independent candidate his candidacy would do more harm to Clintons bid to beat Trump than it would to Sanders effortAll told though few say they would consider backing Bloomberg if he did run Interest is strongest among political independents and just 49 of them say they would definitely or probably consider voting Bloomberg for presidentThe CNNORC Poll was conducted by telephone February
