Time Investigating Hillary is an Attack on All Women November 1 2016 Good morning Its Tuesday Whos up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman This gem comes from Robin Lakoff a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading Hillary Clintons Emailgate Is an Attack on Women Its not about emails its about public communication by a woman I am mad I am mad because I am scared And if you are a woman you should be too Emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not Hillary Clinton Its us The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female Can you imagine this happening to a man His name was General Petraeus Thank you Have a nice day Clinton is guilty of SWF Speaking While Female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere There is so much of that going around That escalated quickly And incoherently Also Im pretty sure its not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling But yes Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman It has nothing to do with anything else That must be why Albright and Rice werent in the center of similar scandals If the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal Those very ideas would be absurd Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech In theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory Emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech Its illegal for both public officials of both genders But heres Hillary Rodham Clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women Here are her emails And since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something Illegally emailing classified information
