CNN Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday notching seven victories  four more than his closest competitor  in states from Georgia to Massachusetts on a day that marked a turning point in his quest for the White HouseOn the morning after one thing is clear the Republican Party is at a crossroadsMany party leaders and establishment Republicans see two paths ahead One is to accept what appears to be the increasingly likely outcome in the 2016 race  that Trump will soon clinch the GOP nomination  and offer the New York businessman their blessing The second is a path of a historic rebellion rejecting the GOP frontrunner and the values and principles he stands for and pledging to oppose Trump  even if he emerges as the partys nomineeFormer Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty who ran for president in 2012 described this moment as an inflection point in the 2016 race and for the Republican PartyThe party is fractured which isnt unusual for political parties and they almost always come back together But this could test the outer limits of that tradition Pawlenty who endorsed Marco Rubio told CNN If the Republican Party were an airplane and youre looking out the window youd see some pieces of the surface flying off And youd be wondering whether the engine or a wing is nextWith Trump adding delegates to his quickly growing stash Tuesday political veterans suspect the GOP presidential race could reach a moment of unambiguous clarity in the next two weeks That point could come on March 15 when Florida and Ohio vote If Rubio the Florida senator and John Kasich the Ohio governor lose their home states their campaigns would be doomedFormer Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott put it this way By March 15 Republicans will know whether it is time to throw up our hands in despair and panicWeve now backed ourselves into a corner here  and its not very pretty said Lott who is supporting Kasich Super Tuesday Lott added is not the final blow but we will know in the next two weeks whether this is a done deal or notIn recent days there has been a flurry of discussions among top Republican strategists and insiders about how to distance the party from Trump His heated rhetoric about minority groups and immigrants is deeply troubling to party leaders who have spent years trying to make inroads with Latino and other minority constituencies Also of grave concern are the downballot candidates who would face tough elections in November with Trump at the top of the ticketDisaffected Republicans are discussing everything from skipping the Republican National Convention in July to running a conservative candidate as an independent or thirdparty candidate  with the ultimate goal of denying Trump the presidency One of the names frequently mentioned in this hypothetical is Mitt Romney the 2012 GOP presidential nominee even though he has shown no desire to run another campaign but has shown a zest for attacking TrumpTrumps dominance on Super Tuesday caps the GOP frontrunners remarkable rise as a firsttime presidential candidate His initial surge in the polls months ago was widely dismissed as a shortlived phenomenon His divisive and inflammatory rhetoric on everything from immigration to women drew fierce scorn from fellow Republicans and Democrats alikeBut Trumps candidacy has proven shockingly durable and his supporters exceptionally loyalHis dominant night comes just days after another development shocked the party to its core New Jersey Gov Chris Christies bombshell endorsement of the billionaire last week Christie ended his own presidential bid last month and the unexpected decision from the former chairman of the Republican Governors Association to back Trump  the ultimate antiestablishment candidate  added a critical sense of credibility to the businessmans candidacyChristies endorsement was quickly followed by the backing of Maine Gov Paul LePage and Alabama Sen Jeff SessionsFormer House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich who has no plans to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary said he was shocked by Christies decision and that the slew of new endorsements have irreversibly changed perceptions of Trumps candidacyTrump is putting together a very unique coalition thats rattled a lot of people who have made a living out of trying to win within a Republican structure which is now increasingly obsolete Gingrich said A lot of people smugly said when we get down to reality he is not going to be the nominee because in the end people arent going to vote for him Well guess what  hes almost certainly going to be the nomineeAs Trump has started to pick up endorsements from serious conservative leaders including a handful of members of Congress a fierce antiTrump movement has started to pick up steamRepublican operatives party leaders and conservative thinkers are increasingly warning that Trump is not a true conservative and that his penchant for offensive language proves that hes an entertainer who should have no role shaping the future of the Republican Party These rumblings turned into a movement on social media marked with the hashtag NeverTrump  a vow to never back Trump even if he becomes the nomineeBut these lastminute strategy sessions underscore the fundamental lack of a coordinated effort in the party to derail Trumps campaign Many are simply resigned to accepting that this far along in the election and considering the delegate math no amount of money or antiTrump messaging can slow the frontrunners momentumOver the weekend Trump only fueled the anger directed at his campaign when he failed to denounce white supremacist groupsI dont know anything about David Duke OK Trump told CNNs Jake Tapper when asked whether he would disavow the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who is supporting Trumps campaign Pressed several times Trump insisted he didnt know anything about white supremacistsIm not going to vote for Hillary Clinton and given what we know about Donald Trump I cant vote for that guy either the firstterm senator saidBut the antiTrump campaign is also angering some party elders They say rejecting the GOP nominee is tantamount to handing the election to the eventual Democratic nominee widely expected to be Hillary Clinton who had a strong night on Super TuesdayFormer Wyoming Sen Alan Simpson who supported Jeb Bushs failed White House bid told CNN that these rebelling Republicans may as well be casting their votes for Clinton He also expressed deep frustration at the party for failing to rally around a single alternative to Trump like Bush or Kasich early enough in the electionJust go ahead and support Hillary and forget it said Simpson They may not like Trump  they didnt like Bush What the hell was wrong with Bush What the hell is wrong with KasichGingrich who pledged to back the partys eventual nominee predicted that many of his fellow Republicans who now say they could never support Trump will eventually change their mindsThe absence of voting for the Republican nominee is functionally a vote for Hillary Gingrich said Its a crossroads for the Republican Party and its a crossroads for America
