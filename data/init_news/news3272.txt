New Jersey Gov Chris Christie thinks parents should be able to choose whether to vaccinate their children Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well he told reporters MondayNo they shouldnt Parents shouldnt have much matter of choice in vaccinating their children because people like Livia Simon dont have a matter of choice in the issue eitherSimon is a a sixmonthold infant in California Babies her age dont have strong enough immune systems to handle the flu vaccine So Livia depends on me and you and everyone around her getting vaccinatedthe point of vaccination isnt to stop you from getting disease its to stop spreadMore specifically she depends on something called herd immunity a firewall that stops a disease from bouncing from me to you and eventually to sixmonthold Livia Herd immunity matters the most for those with compromised immune systems like infants the elderly and some autoimmune disease patients some people who have AIDS for example cant get the measles vaccineThe point of getting vaccinated isnt to keep you from getting the flu or measles mumps or whooping cough Its not as Christie seems to frame it a decision about keeping your kids safe from disease Its to keep you and your kids from spreading all those diseases to people like Livia  people who dont have the option to get vaccinatedthis year we screwed upThis year we screwed up Because some people didnt get vaccinated more than 80 people caught measles in an outbreak that started at DisneylandAt least six of them are infants who are less than 12 months oldWe nearly screwed it up for Livia too As her mother Jennifer told the Washington Post earlier this week Livia had to spend the last month in quarantine because an unvaccinated child who visited her pediatricians office may have exposed her to the diseaseThis is very risky approximately 1 to 2 of every 1000 children infected with measles will die from the disease Luckily very few people get infected with measles these days thanks entirely to the vaccine but when it strikes measles will killSome parents see it as a personal choice like homeschooling Jennifer told the Post But when you choose not to vaccinate youre putting other children at risk Youre putting your child above other peoples childrenEach day we make dozens of decisions that directly relate to our health We decide to wear a seatbelt on our way to work or we dont And sometimes we choose the riskier path for reasons of convenience or comfort or pleasure We might not wear a bike helmet or we might have a second drink at happy hour Or a third Or a fourthThese are decisions about the amount of risk that we want to take on as individuals and we accept the risks of our own decisionsDeciding whether or not to get vaccinations  or to get our children vaccinations  is not one of those decisions Vaccination is not a personal decision It has the potential to affect hundreds maybe thousands of other peoplevaccination is a decision that Affects hundreds maybe thousands of other peopleObjections to vaccination among those healthy enough to get immunized those of us over the age of one essentially typically just arent good enough to justify the riskMuch of it revolves around the safety of the vaccine Even in the Amish community in Ohio it wasnt a religious belief that caused low vaccination rates  and laid the groundwork for a huge outbreak Instead it was news of two nearby children suffering complications from the shots that turned the community against vaccinationSo lets clear that fact up here right now the measles vaccine is without a doubt safe Study after study after study confirms this The study that suggested the measles vaccine was not safe  and had possible links to autism  was retracted by the academic journal Lancet in 2010 The researcher who published the study Andrew Wakefield was stripped of his medical license in BritainNot only is the measles vaccine safe its also incredibly effective Ninetyseven percent of people who get two doses of the measles vaccine will not catch the disease compare that to this years flu vaccine which reduces the risk of catching the disease by 23 percent This means that measles is an entirely preventable illness  if all of us get our vaccinesYes in the literal sense parents ultimately get to decide whether to optout of vaccination  and thankfully the vast majority of them choose to vaccinate their childrenWhat gets lost in much of the chatter around the current measles outbreak in California is that the vast majority of people do make the right decision on vaccination About 92 percent of the American population is immunized against measles for example The rate of vaccine exemptions is very lowBut research published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the rate of nonmedical exemptions increased from 098 percent to 148 percent between 1991 and 2004 Even those tiny upticks in optouts matter  especially for measles which is so infectious that it requires nearuniversal vaccination to stop its spread A study in Scientific American published data showing that most states are now below the threshold for herd immunity on measles those are the states with red bars belowFor measles  one of the most infectious diseases known to man  the bar for herd immunity is high Scientists estimate that about 92 to 94 percent of the population needs to get vaccinated to sufficiently protect vulnerable groups from the diseases spread Measles is viciously contagious as my colleague Julia Belluz reported earlier this week when one Amish missionary brought it back to his community with low vaccination rates it quickly spread to 382 people and took months to containThere are some fluctuations Cristina Cassetti program officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Wired and if vaccination levels dip down a little you get a situation like DisneylandVaccination is not a personal decision and doctors know that better than the general public Last fallPew Research Center asked both the general public and members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  the countrys largest trade group for scientists  whether parents should be allowed to decide not to vaccinate their childrenIf vaccination levels dip a little you get something like disneylandThirty percent of parents thought yes it should be a parents decision Among scientists though the number was much lower 13 percent thought parents ought to make the call on vaccination A much larger majority didnt think it should be a parents choiceYour vaccination makes it harder for other people you come in contact with to catch the disease This isnt only important if you interact with infants the elderly or people who have compromised immune systems Its also important if you interact with anyone else who interacts with infants the elderly or people who have compromised immune systemsThe decision not to vaccinate is not about health We have the facts to prove thats just not right It is a decision that is at its root about selfishness putting beliefs not supported by science ahead of Livia and 4 million other babies born in the past year These are real risks and in deciding to skip vaccines you are absolutely making them worseWATCH Vaccines do not cause autism they save livesUpdate Christie issued a statement after his Monday remarks that said he supports some not all vaccines being mandatory
