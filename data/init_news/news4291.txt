By Rmuse   757 pm If the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half I think its going to be just catastrophic   The following is an opinion column by R Muse It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer Donald J Trump However much Trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded Trump supporters the real instigators are the Koch brothers Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself The tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A Boehner out of Congress morphed into the inaptly named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job although that is high on the Trump supporters todo list As noted in Wednesdays New York Times  Mr Trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that Mr Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  The rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat issued a warning to establishment Republicans  Theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to DC Leadership comes and smacks our guy Thats where youre going to put down a marker Really And the American people are just scratching their head saying Really Thats rich  Brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton Donald Trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump In fact besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy And during an interview with Reuters he complained that  The people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top  Win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a Herculean task to save the party This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign The chairman of Breitbart News Stephen Bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise And uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the Koch brothers vision of American libertarianism Dont believe it Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks  have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting Over the past few days leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the House something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome According to the chief executive of Heritage Action Michael Needham there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump Mr Needham said  If the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half I think its going to be just catastrophe  Another conservative extremist House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needhams sentiment and said  You cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  The dilemma for Republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party That doesnt seem likely because if Trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump If Trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8 it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by Donald Trump the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party
