Matter and antimatter simultaneously By BEC CrewAlmost 80 years ago an Italian physicist proposed that a particle could exist as both matter and antimatter at the same time Called the Majorana fermion this mysterious state of matter set off a decadeslong hunt with scientists finding the first real evidence of its existence earlier this year And now physicists in China have discovered that an elusive type of quasiparticle can behave just like a Majorana fermion and it could help us to finally understand this incredibly weird phenomenonIf youre not familiar with the Majorana fermion  it was first proposed by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937 He predicted that a type of particle called a fermion could act as its own antiparticleIn the standard model of physics every particle has an antiparticle These antiparticles are usually an entirely separate particle with the same mass but opposite charge of their partnerEven electrically neutral particles have antiparticles such as the neutron which is made of quarks and the antineutron which is made of antiquarksIn very rare cases a particle with no mass and no charge can act as its own antiparticle and weve only identified a few examples of these so far  photons light particles hypothetical gravitons  and WIMPs Majorana fermions if they exist fall into this final category and if we can find them and harness them it would change everything about how we record and process information in the next generation of quantum computersThe search for this particle is for condensedmatter physicists what the Higgs boson search was for highenergy particle physicists physicist Leonid Rokhinson from Purdue University noted back in 2012  It is a very peculiar object because it is a fermion yet it is its own antiparticle with zero mass and zero chargeUnlike regular computers that use bits of 0 and 1 quantum computers use quantum bits that can exist in a state of 0 1 or a superposition of bothThe problem with building a computer out of quantum bits or qubits is that its incredibly difficult to make a record of what state they previously held once theyve been switched and theres no point having a computer that cant retain informationBut physicists think Majorana fermions could be the key to solving all of thatInformation could be stored not in the individual particles but in their relative configuration so that if one particle is pushed a little by a local force it doesnt matter said Rokhinson As long as that local noise is not so strong that it alters the overall configuration of a group of particles the information is retained It offers an entirely new way of dealing with informationIn April this year a team from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee discovered the first real proof of the existence of Majorana fermions in something called a quasiparticleUnlike a regular particle which is a physical object that makes up an atom a quasiparticle is an entity that has some characteristics of a distinct particle but is made up of a grouping of multiple particles instead Finding a Majorana fermion quasiparticle is one thing but the real goal is finding a Majorana fermion particleFastforward to now and physicists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences say theyve identified another type of quasiparticle that behaves just like a Majorana fermion called Majorana zero modes MZMsThe team was able to synthesise these quasiparticles inside a quantum simulation and manipulate them in ways that would work within a quantum computer system Most significantly they showed that they could retain information encoded in their Majorana zero modes even when errors and noise were applied to the systemWe demonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero modes against local errors through the simulator they describe in their paper published in Nature Communications If the teams simulation can be replicated in experimental conditions it means we could have another candidate for Majorana fermionlike behaviours on our hands and another shot at something to build the quantum computers of the future withIn the meantime heres more on those elusive Majorana fermionsSource Science Alert
