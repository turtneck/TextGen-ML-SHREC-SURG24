At Mondays presidential debate Hillary Clintons asserted that Alicia Machado a former Miss Universe was victimized about her weight by Donald Trump Her remarks have perhaps rightfully given some women pause So lets reflect a moment and add some context to this allegation Heres where Ive come downLike many young girls of my era I grew up watching the Miss America Pageant My friends and I would get together root for the young woman from our state or pick another favorite if she didnt make the top tenWe held our breath as some of them struggled to answer the interview question and discussed our own answers regarding world peace We clapped for the pianist and giggled at the fiery baton twirler It was reality TV before reality TV And who knew that years later I would be friends with some of those same young women as they went on to have laudable careers in law and broadcasting The women I know were then and remain today smart and gifted women of noble characterFast forward to today and somewhere along the way pageants fell out of favor Perhaps it was second wave feminism of the 60s and 70s or perhaps we just got bored with them Regardless in 2004 the ABC television network dropped the shows coverage due to record low ratings but CMT picked it up and there remains a smaller following Most of us were done with Miss America However her more racy sisters Miss USA and coowned Miss Universe were by this time split off and vying for our attentionUnlike Miss America these pageants make no pretense of being anything more than a beauty pageant They have no talent competition and award no scholarshipsIn fact according to Bustlecom the entire reason for the split was because Miss America 1951 Yolande Belbeze refused to be photographed for a newspaper wearing a swimsuit One of the shows sponsors Catalina swimwear retaliated by creating its own show and thus we have Miss USA and Miss UniverseOf course there are some smart talented women who have chosen to participate in the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants but lets be honest its not why they winThe women who participate voluntarily don a bikini and walk in front of judges to be well judgedThe participants are competing for a job based on their bodies and good looksTheir worth is based almost solely upon those things and for one year they are to represent the company with the asset of conventional beauty Not brains not talent just beauty Quite literally their bodies are their money makersHeres a little known fact even the US government recognizes this arrangement I am told by friends who have modeled that they are able to write off of their taxes anything they do to keep their assets looking good All the things women spend money on  hair makeup gym memberships and even Botox  is a write off Even Uncle Sam gets the joke Their bodies are their small businesses I supposeSo heres the deal Logically I cant get to victim when I think of Alicia Machado Name calling is never nice and  shocker  Donald Trump isnt diplomatic in giving criticismHeres the irony Regardless of how much Hillary Clinton wants Ms Machado to be the poster child for misused women she doesnt fit the narrative Lets be honest a woman who voluntarily puts on a bikini and literally asks people to judge her based almost solely on her body cant be mad when they doMs Machado was being paid to look perfect and when she couldnt  or wouldnt  live up to the standard she had asked to be measured by she caught criticismMaybe shes also smart and kind Who knows But that was not why she was chosen to serve as Miss Universe for one yearAt this point in my life I feel conflicted about pageants Women I love have done them and will do them CWAs Young Women for America boasts more than one pageant winnerAs logical women however we cant pretend that Alicia Machado was misused There are millions of women across this nation who are objectified abused victims of sexism and misogyny Lets work to protect them instead of inventing new onesPenny Young Nance is president and CEO of Concerned Women for America the nations largest womens public policy organization She is the author of the forthcoming book Feisty and Feminine A Rallying Cry for Conservative Women Zondervan 2016
