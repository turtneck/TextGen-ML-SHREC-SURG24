Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is close to ensuring that Donald Trump cannot win the GOP nomination on a second ballot at the partys July convention in Cleveland scooping up scores of delegates who have pledged to vote for him instead of the frontrunner if given the chanceThe push by Cruz means that it is more essential than ever for Trump to clinch the nomination by winning a majority of delegates to avoid a contested and drawnout convention fight which Trump seems almost certain to loseThe GOP race now rests on two cliffhangers Can Trump lock up the nomination before Cleveland If not can Cruz cobble together enough delegates to win a second convention vote if Trump fails in the firstTrumps path to amassing the 1237 delegates he needs to win outright has only gotten narrower after losing to Cruz in Wisconsin and other recent contests and it would require him to perform better in the remaining states than he has to this pointIn addition based on the delegate selections made by states and territories Cruz is poised to pick up at least 130 more votes on a second ballot according to a Washington Post analysis That tally surpasses 170 delegates under less conservative assumptions  a number that could make it impossible for Trump to emerge victoriousThat is why the race centers on the fevered hunt for delegates across the country The intensity of the fight has sparked another round of caustic rhetoric  including allegations from party leaders that Trump supporters are making death threatsIts unfortunate politics has reached a new low These type of threats have no place in politics said Kyle Babcock a Republican delegate from Indianas 3rd Congressional District He received an email from a Trump supporter who warned Think before you take a step down the wrong pathThe art of the steal Dealmaker Trump struggles with the GOP delegate raceCruzs chances rest on exploiting a wrinkle in the GOP rule book that delegates assigned to vote for Trump at the convention do not actually have to be Trump supporters Cruz is particularly focused on getting loyalists elected to delegate positions even in states that the senator from Texas lostOn Wednesday in Indiana for example Republican leaders were finalizing a delegate slate that will include party activists unlikely to vote for Trump in the states primary next month Cruz also is poised to sweep Wyomings 26 delegates this weekend in a state where Trumps campaign did not seriously compete In Arkansas Cruz supporters are exploring ways to topple Trump when delegates are chosen next month And Sen Marco Rubio RFla has refused to release 171 delegates he won when he was in the race signaling that he may contribute to the antiTrump push in ClevelandCruz said this week that he thinks the odds of a contested convention are very highIn Cleveland I believe we will have an enormous advantage he told radio talkshow host Glenn BeckTrump has a commanding lead in total delegates and the overall vote total but he has complained that Republican leaders are conspiring against him in a bid to silence his supportersThe RNC should be ashamed of itself for allowing this to happen Trump said Tuesday night while campaigning in Rome NYPaul Manafort a senior adviser to Trump said in an interview that he is confident Cruz will never have a chance to convert Trump delegatesJust because Cruz has won some delegates in a state where we have the delegates voting for us is not relevant until and unless theres a second ballot Manafort said Theres not going to be a second ballotTrump team vows to win delegate majority as rivals prepare for open conventionAs the battle for delegates has intensified so too have emotions Craig Dunn who was elected Saturday as a Republican delegate from Indianas 4th Congressional District said he has received several threatening phone calls and emails after criticizing Trump in recent news reportsWhen they reference burials and your family in the same email and telling you that youre being watched thats concerning he saidIn Colorado Republicans are planning a rally Friday to call attention to threats made against GOP chairman Steve House He said his office received 3000 phone calls with many being the trashiest you can imagine after a state party convention last weekend awarded all 34 delegates to CruzShame on the people who think somehow that it is right to threaten me and my family over not liking the outcome of an election he wrote on FacebookCruz told Beck on Tuesday that threats made by Trump supporters including those made by the businessmans longtime confidant Roger Stone are the tactic of union thugs That is violence It is oppressiveStone recently told an interviewer that Trump supporters would track down delegates at their hotel rooms in Cleveland if they break away from TrumpManafort said that its certainly not part of our policy to threaten violence but accused abusive Cruz supporters of confronting Trumps backers at party meetings nationwideWhen the presidential nomination vote is held at the convention 95percent of the delegates will be bound to the results in their states for the first vote giving Trump his best shot at securing a majorityBut if Trump falls short the convention will cast a second ballot in which more than 1800 delegates from 31 states  nearly 60percent of the total  will be unbound and allowed to vote however they want By the third round 80percent of the delegates would be free sparking a potential freeforall that could continue for several more roundsThat is the crux of the statebystate battle that is playing out over the next two months as Republicans gather at the precinct county congressional district and statewide levels to choose convention delegatesIf we go into a contested convention were going to have a ton of delegates Donald is going to have a ton of delegates and its going to be a battle in Cleveland to see who can earn a majority of the delegates that were elected by the people Cruz told a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas on SaturdayHe predicted that the first ballot will be the highest vote total Donald Trump receives And on a subsequent ballot were going to win the nominationWith an Orthodox focus Ted Cruz reaches out to Jewish donors and votersIf Cruz prevails it will be because of what supporters are doing for him nationwide with what they say is little direct input from his campaign headquartersIn Arkansas Republicans will not meet until next month to finalize their delegate slate but state lawmakers who probably will win a position are talking about voting for Cruz on the second ballotFor the vast majority of Cruz voters Rubio was their second choice and for the vast majority of Rubio supporters Cruz was their second choice So when youre going to pick delegates it just makes sense that we would work together said state Sen Bart Hester who backed RubioIn Iowa Cruz won 11 of the 12 delegates assigned last weekend  meaning that he probably will have their support in later rounds of balloting That same day in South Carolina Cruz secured three of the six delegate slots assigned by two congressional districts that Trump had easily wonTheres nothing underhanded going on said Elliott Kelley one of the Cruz supporters who won in South Carolinas 3rd Congressional District Delegates are being appointed from the local level The Trump team just doesnt have people involved at the local level and theyre not getting delegatesCruz supporters also won two of the three delegate slots from Virginias southernmost congressional district even though Trump won there handily One of those Cruz supporters is Kyle Kilgore 22 who said he would vote for Trump on the first ballot as requiredI would have a hard time voting for Trump on the second ballot he saidIn Indiana Dunn will be required to initially vote for whoever wins his congressional district in May If Trump fails in the first round Dunn said he probably will vote for Ohio Gov John Kasich on a second ballotIll be looking for the candidate who I think has the best chance of beating Hillary Clinton in November Dunn said And if the person I want doesnt get it I wont take my marbles and go home I will support the nominee of the Republican PartyAlice Crites Jose A DelReal Sean Sullivan and Katie Zezima contributed to this
