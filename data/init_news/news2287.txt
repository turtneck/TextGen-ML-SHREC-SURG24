Washington CNN The Republican Party is waking up  but it might already be too lateDonald Trumps stroll toward the GOP presidential nomination is starting to turn the denial evident for months among key party power brokers to desperation The mood of some in the party was aptly summed up Thursday by Republican lobbyist and former congressman Vin Weber on CNNs The Lead with Jake TapperAll of a sudden everybody is saying Oh My God  the house is burning down we should have done something before it got this far said Weber who is supporting John Kasich in the presidential race and is calling on the party to unite behind the Ohio GovernorSen Marco Rubio who pulled out of the presidential race on Tuesday after failing to take down Trump had a grim assessment of the Republican Partys state of play on his first day back at work in the Senate on ThursdayHopefully theres time to still prevent a Trump nomination which I think would fracture the party and be damaging to the conservative movement Rubio told reportersAntiTrump forces are getting a sense of the backlash theyd face if they deny him the nomination Trump warned earlier this week on CNNs New Day that the convention could deteriorate into a riot if he is blocked from powerAnd on Friday a top Trump aide threatened to give up his credentials as a convention delegate and leave the Republican Party in a stark warning to the GOP about the consequences if Trump is blocked from the nominationI will tell you this if the Republican Party comes into that convention and jimmies with the rules and takes away the will of the people the will of the Republicans and the Democrats and Independents who voted for Mr Trump I will take off my credentials I will leave the floor of that convention and I will leave the Republican Party forever Sam Clovis a national cochair for Trumps campaign said Friday on New DayThe deepening anxiety in the GOP was underscored by a meeting in Washington Thursday of prominent conservative leaders dedicated to finding a way to prevent Trump from securing the 1237 delegates needed for the nominationTrumps failure to win Ohio on an otherwise successful night of primaries Tuesday opened a narrow window for opposing forces in the Republican Party to wrest the nomination from him because it lengthened his odds of winning a majority of delegates If he does fall short Trump could face an acrimonious contested convention in Cleveland in JulyConservative activist Erick Erickson raised the specter of a unity ticket to stop Trump in a statement he issued after the meeting noting that the partys revered icon Abraham Lincoln was not nominated until after the third convention ballotWe believe that the issue of Donald Trump is greater than an issue of party the statement read It is an issue of morals and character that all Americans not just those of us in the conservative movement must confrontOne person at the meeting Deborah DeMoss Fonseca a former aide to late Sen Jesse Helms said that there was definitely a consensus of not wanting Donald TrumpI think theres still several scenarios that could play out And I think this particular group will look for whatever it is thats going to do it she saidThursdays meeting was especially intriguing because it appeared to be the most concerted effort yet by the conservative movement many of whose adherents view the New York real estate mogul as a political apostate to stop TrumpBut it remained unclear whether the initiative would be any more successful than previous attempts by the Republican establishment to thwart TrumpAfter all a scorching speech by former GOP nominee Mitt Romney did nothing to slow the outspoken businessman Nor did an extraordinary indictment by National Review which devoted most of an issue to debunking Trumps conservative bona fides And Trump boasted at his victory party on Tuesday night in Florida that he had won the Sunshine State despite a multimillion dollar negative ad blitz attacking himAnd every candidate who tried to destroy Trump by hammering him on policy his past business deals or his sometimes vulgar outbursts  including Rubio Jeb Bush Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal  only succeeded in sinking their own presidential prospectsThe conservative uprising on Thursday was not the only eyeopening example of the Stop Trump movementFormer GOP candidate Lindsey Graham who once said choosing between Trump and Cruz would be like picking between being shot and poisoned made his choice The South Carolina Senator told CNNs Dana Bash that he was now lining up behind the Texas Senator and would help raise money for himGraham admitted that Cruz was not well liked among his peers on Capitol Hill but implied he was the lesser of two evilsI have doubts about Mr Trump Graham said I dont think hes a Republican I dont think hes a conservative I think his campaigns built on xenophobia racebaiting and religious bigotry I think hed be a disaster for our party and as Senator Cruz would not be my first choice I think he is a Republican conservative who I could supportThe most fundamental weakness in any organized effort to stop Trump in the remaining contests in the Republican nomination is the math after more than half the states have votedThe billionaire only needs to win 555 of the remaining delegates to be awarded according to a CNN estimateAlthough he has only won 47 of the delegates awarded so far the field now consisting of just Trump Cruz and Kasich is much narrower than before and some contests are now winner take all affairs and do not hand out delegates proportionally as was the case in many previous contestsRepublican political strategist Phillip Stutts said the next six weeks will be crucial in defining whether any attempt to deprive Trump of the nomination would even be possibleIf Trump is not slowed down there is not a convention fight to be had Stutts said pointing to a set of northeastern primaries on April 26 in Connecticut Delaware Maryland Pennsylvania and Rhode Island as critical to foes bent on stopping TrumpAnother complication for the antiTrump forces is that the billionaire could be the strongest force in a string of coming primaries To slow his march Kasich must show he can harvest more than the single victory he has so far  on his home ground of OhioAlternatively Cruz who is Trumps closest rival with 418 delegates to the billionaires 678 according to a CNN estimate would have to show an appeal outside conservative heartland states that he is yet to demonstrate on a large scaleThe strength of Trumps position has some of his allies warning that any attempt to snatch victory from his grasp would not just be unfair it would be futileHopes that a compromise candidate could emerge at a contested convention also took a blow on Thursday when House Speaker Paul Ryan ruled himself out  though he admitted that a delegate showdown was becoming more likely in ClevelandAs the idea of the first contested convention in decades is gathering steam the institutional leadership of the Republican Party finds itself in an unenviable positionAny attempt to deprive Trump of the nomination would not just cause uproar in a year in which establishment politicians have been toppled It would effectively mean the disenfranchisement of 75 million voters who have backed Trump in the primary process so far  voters who the GOP can ill afford to lose at a time when national demographics give Democrats an easier route to the White HouseThats why officials like Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer say that the process of selecting a nominee must be inviolate if a candidate reaches the magic number of 1237 delegatesOur job is to wait until the voters decide who that nominee will be Spicer told Wolf Blitzer on CNNs The Situation Room calling on Republicans to unite to fight for the bigger prize  depriving the Democrats of the White HouseIf the latest attempts to thwart Trump fail and party power brokers decide they cannot stomach the Republican nominee there may be a third option by embracing the final stage of grief  acceptance  and trying to limit the damage that they believe having Trump at the top of their ticket would unleashThat could mean striving to ensure that even if Democrats win the White House they are unable to boost an incoming president by making significant gains in CongressKeeping the majorities in the Senate and the House is for us where the donors should be putting their money said Stutts
