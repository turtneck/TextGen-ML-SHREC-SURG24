Pundits and politicians have been shocked by the Trump phenomenon startled that so many Americans could be so enthusiastic about his antidemocratic style proposalsBut Trump is not that original His actual proposals are in keeping with longstanding trends in US history and society with the rejection and nativism that have erupted after each immigration wave His style is reminiscent of populist and fascist leaders whove succeeded both in Europe and Latin America during periods of economic stress including such recent champions as Hugo Chvez and Silvio Berlusconi authoritarians who elevated themselves and their supporters rather than building party structures or democratic institutionsSome observers believe  or perhaps hope  that Trumps followers misunderstand or dont believe in what he represents Theyre wrong We will explainThe Trump movement cannot be dismissed as one of frustrated moderatesSome observers including President Obama suggest that his voters are misguided Here in the Monkey Cage Doug AhlerandDavid Broockman argued that Trump is a textbook example of an ideological moderate Still others portray Trump followers as workingclass outcasts of the changing economy that see his candidacy as a way to channel their frustrations And many US punditssuch as George Packer in The New Yorkerexplain all this by saying that voters on left and right are angry with Washington and that both Trump and Sanders represent a new wave of populismBut Trump and Sanders must not be conflated Sanders wants to politicize inequality Trump rather is advocating for antipolitics by which we mean that Trumps language and his followers celebration of his speeches primarily express a rejection of politics in a democratic key Trumps stance represents the antithesis of Sanderss call for political change Trumps narrative insists that he is above the fray of politics This is of course an ideological and political claim Returning America to national and international antidemocratic traditions it is just a different kind of politicsAnd Trumps followers explicitly agree with what he says In December seven out of 10 republicans believed that Trump tells it like it is As Sarah Palin suggested when she endorsed Trump in Iowa Trump stands against politics as usual as represented by establishment candidates who are wearing political correctness like a suicide vest And enough is enough While the establishment hears random insults his followers hear a list of the enemies of a homogeneous AmericaMany studies have revealed the link between resentment toward blacks and immigrants on the one hand and support for Trump on the other In other words his supporters like Trump not despite his antidemocratic qualities but precisely because of them His campaign rallies often include incidents of physical violence against perceived outsiders At a rally in Las Vegas according to NBC News one man shouted Sieg heilWe believe racism and charismatic leadership bring Trump close to the fascist equation but he might be better described as postfascist which is to say populistFrom our research lets take a definition of populist postfascism This is a political style which has an extremely sacralizing understanding of politics The leader understands politics as a theology in which he or she is the only who knows what is best for the nation Populists consider people as formed by those who follow a unique vertical leadership political antagonists are conceived as enemies who are potential or actual traitors to the nationPopulists want leaders to be charismatic embodiments of the voice and desires of the nation as a whole They argue for a strong executive and the discursive and often practical dismissal of the legislative and judicial branches of government Toward that end they engage in radical nationalism and emphasize popular culture as opposed to other forms of culture that do not represent national thought Finally populism is an authoritarian form of electoral democracy that nonetheless rejects dictatorial forms of governmentModern populism arose from the defeat of fascism as a novel postfascist attempt to bring back the fascist experience to the democratic path creating in turn an authoritarian form of democracy that would stress strong leaders and caudillos such as General Juan Pern in Argentina and Hugo Chavez in VenezuelaIn populism political democracy is strained but never eradicated as it had been with fascism Modern postfascism pushes democracy to its limits but generally without breaking it Trumps vision of America is the latest example of this attempt to redefine democratic theory and practiceUnlike Hitler and Mussolini Trump does not have a real party He wants to be the Republican candidate but party officials and ideologues reject him In contrast fascist leaders were often founding members of movements and then emerged as their leadersAs we mentioned earlier Trumps leadership is more akin to that of Hugo Chvez and Silvio Berlusconi While Chvez  who started his own government reality show  invoked a vague ideological platform to gain power in practice he centralized decisionmaking attacked freedom of speech and dismantled the division of powers always by invoking an external threatBerlusconi denigrated institutions used his billionaire status to prove he was a political outsider and channeled the new European populisms antimigrant sentiment to hold powerTrump uses antiimmigrant sentiment more often than Berlusconi and other leaders like Chvez successor Nicolas Madurobringing his rhetoric closer to that of other postfascist politicians like Marine Le Pen in FranceThe Republican leadership rejects Trump Indeed many conservatives call him a fascist But Trump embodies many of the partys views on immigration Islam climate change womens roles minority voting and so on Trump and his followers differ not in kind but in the clarity and radical way in with which they express some of the extreme consequences of the tea party agendaIf we consider a longer historical process in which the Republican Party in particular has been traveling steadily farther toward populism Trump and his followers might very well be showing us the future of US rightwing politicsFederico Finchelsteinis professor of history and department chair at The New School in New York and author among other books of The
