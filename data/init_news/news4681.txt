After Donald Trump had himself a fine time ripping the sleazy media Hillary Clinton did a Trumplike thing she called into two cable news showsShe was asked about Trumpbut didnt make much news And therein lies the heart of the problem for a news business that is supposed to be dedicated to fairnessOne candidate is openly hostile to the press but does all kinds of interviewstelevision radio newspapers magazines websitesday after day The other candidate is privately hostile to the press but also very selective in doing interviewsand hasnt held a news conference in monthsOf course theres an imbalance in the coverage and its about more than ratingsthough attracting more eyeballs and clicks is clearly a factorThe New York Times in a piece on this very subject offered an exampleLast week none of the three major cable news networks  CNN Fox News or MSNBC  carried Mrs Clintons speech to a workers union in Las Vegas where she debuted sharp new attack lines against Mr TrumpInstead each chose to broadcast a live feed of an empty podium in North Dakota on a stage where Mr Trump was about to speakSo AWAITING TRUMP PRESSER is deemed more newsworthy than the presumptive Democratic nominee actually speaking And that does not speak well of the mediaClinton tried copying a Trump tactic by calling into shows on CNN and MSNBC that afternoon It took a reporter to shame him into actually making his contribution and getting the money to veterans she told Jake TapperBut that meant she was in reactive mode rather than generating headlines on her ownClintons spokesman Brian Fallon told the Washington Posts Greg Sargent that the judge of whether were able to build a positive narrative around her is not whether we are getting 10 hours to his eight during cable day programming We can do that on a statespecific level where local coverage departs from what may be the feel of the campaign if youre only watching cable networks Also we can build a positive narrative about her based on her standing up and condemning the very things that he is saying and doing that are commanding all that media attentionTheres a conventional wisdom settling in that visibility on daytime cable equates with him having political strengthWell maybe But so far Trump is sucking up most of the oxygen even while ripping those who provide it as sleazebagsThere is another thread here that goes beyond Trump having endless atbats while Clinton mainly sends in surrogates from the dugout The Donald when he engages in verbal fisticuffs seems to be enjoying himself while Hillary seems like shes enduring an unpleasant ritualIn New York magazine liberal writer Rebecca Traister sees a pervasive defensiveness that gets in the way of her projecting authenticity an intense desire for privacy that keeps voters from feeling as if they know her  especially problematic in an era in which social media makes personal connection with voters more important than ever Clintons wariness about letting the world in is in part her personality and in part born of experience A lifetime spent in the searing spotlight has taught her that exposure too often equals eviscerationIf Clinton suffers from a kind of political PTSD that makes her overly cautious and scripted and closedoff then its primary trigger is the press corps that trails her everywhere she goes Clinton hates the press A band of young reporters follows her thanklessly from event to event and she gives them almost nothing Unlike other candidates she does not ride on the same plane with them though this may change once the general election starts and the traveling group gets bigger Every once in a while she has an offtherecord drink with them but without the frequency or fluidity of her husband whose offtherecord conversations with the press were legendarily candidClinton hates the press So says a sympathetic writer So of course does Trump which may speak volumes about my profession but also about this era of hyperpartisanshipAnd yet voters tend to prefer candidates who come off as happy warriors On that score Trumps overt hostility is playing betterand is more entertainingthan Hillarys covert hostilityHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
