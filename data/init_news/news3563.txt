A militia protesting the tyranny of the federal government seized the headquarters of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon on January 2 and in a video posted to Facebook called on patriots from all over the country to come to the refuge with their guns to join their fightOn January 26 six members of that militia including leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy were arrested on charges of conspiracy to impede federal law enforcement officers from their official duties The arrests happened after a shootout in which one militia member was killed and another injuredAmmon Bundys father Cliven Bundy became a Fox News star in 2014 for his armed standoff in Nevada with the federal government over cattlegrazing rights On the surface the 2016 wildlifereserve occupation is about a father and son from Oregon who were ordered by the court to return to prison to serve additional time for a 2012 arson on federal land But as with Cliven Bundys standoff the antigovernment militiamen driving this crisis believe its about standing up to a tyrannical federal governmentThe apparent goal of the takeover is ultimately to induce the federal government to turn over governmentowned land to local ranchers loggers and miners for their use Here is Ammon Bundy one of the militia leaders explaining it in his own wordsBut the men involved in the takeover  including Ammon Bundy Ammons brother Ryan Jon Ritzheimer Blaine Cooper and Ryan Payne  are not locals Rather they are a small group of individuals who travel around the country attaching themselves to various local fights against the federal government usually over land rights Several of them were involved in Cliven Bundys 2014 standoffNow they have latched onto the cause of two local ranchers from Burns Oregon Dwight and Steven HammondDwight Hammond age 73 and his son Steven age 46 are scheduled to report to federal prison on Monday Dwight the father faces nearly five years in prison son Steven faces up to four years The Hammonds were convicted of arson in 2012 for setting fire to public land adjacent to their ranch land They have already served prison sentences for their crimes but they now must return for an additional term after federal appellate judges said they had been illegally sentenced the first timeBut the Hammonds political cause isnt primarily about sentencing Rather its about federal land use  and opposition to what is seen as an intrusive or outright illegal federal governmentFederal agencies own and regulate huge chunks of land in western states like Oregon and Nevada As such those with antigovernment views particularly in western states often focus on the federal government s landuse policies Hence the significance of the Hammonds case  and the change to their sentencing which just further fed into views of a tyrannical federal government out of controlHere again is Zaitz the Oregonian journalistOn Saturday members of the militia attended a demonstration in Burns that had gathered to protest the Hammonds case After the protest the militiamen drove to the wildlife refuge and took it overIt seems that the militiamen may have initially planned to seize the wildlife refuge headquarters in order to establish a sanctuary where the Hammonds could go to evade prisonAs Ammon Bundy sees it the locals are not strong enough to stand up for themselves so the militia must act as the tip of the spear and lead the fight on behalf of the localsThus Bundy and his fellow militiamen have seized the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  located in a remote area some 50 miles southeast of the city of Burns  in hopes of creating a base where patriots like themselves can come with their guns to live and make their stand against the tyrannical federal governmentNo For one thing it turned out that the Hammonds dont actually want the militias help  or at least not anymoreAt first according to the Oregonian the Hammonds accepted the militias offer of help to avoid prison But they changed their minds after being warned by federal prosecutors to stop communicating with the militia and have now professed through their attorneys that they had no interest in ignoring the order to report for prisonAmmon also tried to recruit residents from the surrounding area reportedly meeting with 10 or so locals but they all turned him downThe Oregonian interviewed some locals who expressed sympathy for the Hammonds and for the militias constitutional arguments but ultimately rejected the militia for its extremismThe militia the local fire chief told the newspaper seems like a bunch of people ready to shoot I dont want that in my countyA local rancher woman said Were not from the militia Were not going to come in with guns and overthrow the governmentOn January 26 law enforcement officials arrested six of the militia leaders  including Ammon and Ryan Bundy  after an encounter with law enforcement resulted in a shootout One militia member was killed and another was injured and is recovering in a local hospital No lawenforcement agents are reported to have been killedAs of Tuesday night it is not clear whether the other militia members are being ordered to leave the refuge or will leave of their own volition  or whether the standoff will continue after the leaders arrestIt has been unclear throughout the occupation exactly how many militia members are inside the occupied building and what kind of weapons they may have As reported by theOregonianA reporter for the Oregonian also tweeted thisAs mentioned earlier several of the men behind this takeover were also involved in the standoff in Nevada in 2014 which very nearly ended in bloodshed as hundreds of heavily armed militia members stood off with federal agents Thankfully disaster was averted when federal authorities made the decision to pack up and leave without any prior announcementThat may not necessarily be the case this time around In fact at least one militia member seems to be expecting things to go very differently this time Jon Ritzheimer the former US Marine whose antiMuslim rhetoric and activities raised alarms with the FBI in November 2015 posted a video to YouTube on December 31 in which he seemed to be saying goodbye to his family and explaining the reason why he felt compelled to fight the US government in Oregon Heres the video
