prayers for your support  because I have decided to run for president of the United States Kasich told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State UniversitySen Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOPs establishment He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23These are all of our stories Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia These are who we are as Americans And yet for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distantBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White HouseSo ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again Trump told the crowd at his announcementClinton reveled in her win which broke Bernie Sanders string of successes in the West and MidwestThe victories pushed both candidates much closer to their parties nominations leaving their opponents no room for error if either is to be stoppedHere are five takeaways from New Yorks primaryNew York truly is Trump territoryOn stage at Trump Tower the Republican frontrunner surrounded himself with some of his highprofile business friends to cap what he called an amazing weekAnd he set up the Republican contest as one that would have to be taken from him  unfairlyWe dont have much of a race anymore based on what Im seeing on television Trump said Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminatedThe good news for Trump shouldnt stop April 26  the next Super Tuesday  features Maryland Pennsylvania and other northeastern states that should also be friendly to the frontrunnerClinton gets the resounding win she wantedIts a sure sign that Clinton is expecting to celebrate when her campaign announces shell deliver a speech on the night of a big electionThis one Clinton told supporters is personalHer commanding victory helped Clinton build on her pledged delegate lead and it denied Sanders a win that could have changed the dynamics of the Democratic raceThose advantages have been enough for Clinton so far  and they dont bode well for Sanders in states like New Jersey and California where hed need to crush Clinton to have any chance of catching her in pledged delegatesSanders hoped hed win New York In fact as a proClinton group gleefully pointed out Tuesday hed said at least 27 times that he expected to win For two weeks hed practically moved back to his hometown of BrooklynThe closed primary Sanders said Tuesday evening in Pennsylvania as the crowd booed New Yorks laws is wrongThat has got to change in future elections he saidSanders though will face the same problem next Tuesday when Pennsylvania Maryland Connecticut Delaware and Rhode Island vote Of those five states only Rhode Island allows independents to vote in the Democratic primaryIf Sanders couldnt improve his performance with AfricanAmericans in New York its not clear that he ever willIn Philadelphia on Tuesday night Cruz spoke before New Yorks polls closed  sparing him for the moment the awkwardness of addressing his thirdplace finish and his zero delegate haulHe didnt say anything about the contest at all aside from noting that its not surprising for a candidate in this case Trump to win his home state Hed already campaigned in Maryland on Monday and is fighting for conservatives in a districtbydistrict bid to deny Trump delegatesEverything Cruz did on Tuesday night  from the location of his event to the 830 pm ET timing  reinforced that he wasnt holding his breath for a good night in New York Aides said if he could hold Trump under 90 of the states 95 delegates even that would count as an acceptable resultWere going to be deadlocked going into the Republican National Convention Kasich said Tuesday night in Maryland Then what delegates are going to do is do something crazy  consider who can win in the fallThe Democratic contest has become increasingly heated and personal in recent days  but even as Sanders amps up the attacks and Clintons campaign frets over the potential impact the partys primary voters dont seem worriedSixtyseven percent of Democratic voters surveyed in early exit polls said the campaign between Sanders and Clinton has energized the party while just 29 said it has divided the partyIn the short term the extended primary is frustrating Clintons camp Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri called Sanders campaign destructive to the point that Sanders continuation in the race is not productive to Democrats and not productive for the countryBut in the long run Democratic voters engagement and interest in the contest could help Clinton who will need to consolidate Sanders supporters if she clinches the nomination  and could find it easier to do that if theyre not turned off by an extended intraparty battleAmong New York Republicans its a different storySixty percent say the GOP campaign has divided the party compared to 36 who say it has energized itThat could have something to do with the states leading candidate Trump consistently declaring the nominating process rigged against himThe numbers show that Republicans could have the tougher challenge in bringing the party together behind its eventual nomineeTrumps Tuesday rout punctuated that reality His victory made clear that no other Republican stands a chance of catching him at the polls  even as party members fight to deny him delegates
