Predators by and large do not attack the strongest prey in the wild They instead target the vulnerable the very young and the very oldthe prey that is least able to defend itself Trump University the defunct realestate education program created by presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump pursued a similar approach according to its former employees in legal documents unsealed Tuesday The Art of the Upsell How Donald Trump Profits From Free Seminars Based upon my personal experience and employment I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money said Ronald Schnackenberg a sales manager at Trump University in 2006 and 2007 Those declarations and other internal Trump University documents depict an aggressive ethically dubious business model that targeted potential customers financial fears and socioeconomic anxieties and offered Trumps personal brand as the solutiona strategy later echoed in his presidential campaignIn his declaration Schnackenberg recounted meeting a couple after a live event in New York City in 2007 Apparently swayed by the presentation they expressed an interest in purchasing a 35000 Trump Gold Elite program the most expensive tier available I did not think it was an appropriate program for them because of their precarious financial conditionthey had no money to pay for the program but would have had to pay for the program using disability income and taking out a loan based upon equity in his apartment he testified Trump University reprimanded me for not trying harder to sell the program to this couple A different salesperson closed the deal with them I was disgusted by this conduct and decided to resign Schnackenberg said Schnackenberg made the declaration in September 2012about three years before Donald Trump announced his presidential bidas part of a classaction lawsuit against the businessman by former Trump University customers The declaration and other trial documents remained under seal until Tuesday after federal judge Gonzalo Curiela newfound target of Trumps stumpspeech angerordered many of them to be made public Friday in response to a publicinterest motion by the Washington Post For a Trump University employee failure simply meant the abstract loss of potential profit For a Trump University student however failure could mean financial ruinOfficial scripts and guidelines in Trump Universitys sales playbooks harnessed this fear to drive prospective buyers towards the product During oneonone sessions after the 1500 secondtier seminar the playbook encouraged salespeople to assess each customers fears goals and financial status then close the deal on the next tier of seminars When you introduce the price dont make it sound like you think its a lot of money if you dont make a big deal out of it they wont the playbook advises If they can afford the gold elite dont allow them to think about anything besides the gold elite The Trump Gold Elite package which included a series of retreats a threeday infield mentorship and a free trial on foreclosuretracking software cost 35000 If the customer hesitated the playbook offered a sample text to push them out of their comfort zone by criticizing their financial status Its time for you to be 100 honest with yourself the suggested text read Youve had your entire adult life to accomplish your financial goals Im looking at your profile and youre not even close to where you need to be much less where you want to be Its time to fix your broken plan bring in Mr Trumps top instructors and certified millionaire mentors and allow us to put you and keep you on the right track Your plan is BROKEN and WE WILL help you fix it The playbook also includes rebuttals to common concerns about spending up to 35000 on a series of seminars For example if customers want to try realestate investing on their own salespeople were told to pepper them with technical questions about their business plan apparently to undermine their selfconfidenceHow are you going to locate the properties How are you determining ARV All cash offer Where is your financing coming from How will you negotiate price Terms What about exit strategies the playbook offers as suggested dialogue One mistake on any one of these and youre broke beaten and worse off than you are now You can ask them questions so they realize they dont have a chance for long term or short term success the playbook then reminds the employee Amidst this sea of imagined dangers the salesperson would then pivot to pitch Trump University as a lifeboat The risk isnt spending 35K  its entering into the world of REAL ESTATE without specialized knowledge guidance and trained professionals in the field holding your hand the playbooks rebuttals said WE are the safe decision The playbook frequently tells Trump University employees to lean on the instructors and mentors wisdom as a selling point But Jason Nichols a Trump University sales executive who worked for the company in 2007 challenged this depiction in his declaration to the court The Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke Most of them were not experts in real estate and did not have experience in the real estate techniques they were teaching Nichols said They were unqualified people posing as Donald Trumps righthand men They were teaching methods that were unethical and they had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals It was a faade a total lieOther rebuttals suggested by training materials likewise appealed to customers insecurities while invoking Trumps success What if customers say they want to invest that 35000 fee in property instead You have no specialized knowledge or system to fall back on the playbook suggests Mr Trump doesnt use his own money to invest and look at his success Or a customer might say they have enough information to invest on their own But what were offering is a proven system from Mr Trump to help you close multiple deals every month with a millionaire mentor by your side making sure you dont make any mistakes and creating the most amount of profit per deal the playbook counters Let me ask you a question are you capable of making one or two mistakes on your own In parentheses the salesperson is instructed to smile while saying these lines The scripts and rebuttals emphasize the risk of not taking part in the program while evading its inherent risks What if the customer doesnt want to go into debt by purchasing the seminars Every single company goes into debt when they are first starting out EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS the playbook says The profits pay off the debt and before you know it your new realestate business will start making amazing returns Corinne Sommer the former manager of Trump Universitys events departments recalled how instructors in the secondlevel seminars which cost roughly 1500 to attend would ask customers to call their creditcard companies to triple or quadruple their credit limit and max out their credit cards for realestate investmentsWhile Trump Universitys advertisements claimed it wanted to help consumers make money in real estate in fact based upon my experience I believe that Trump University was only interested in selling every person the most expensive seminars they could possibly buy on credit Sommer testified I recall that some consumers had showed up who were homeless and could not afford the seminars yet I overheard Trump University representatives telling them its ok just max out your credit card Not everyone proved unhappy the filings also included testimony from many graduates of Trump University who professed themselves delighted with the decisions theyd made Trump University came to an end five years before Trumps presidential campaign officially began But both products rely on a similar threepart strategy The first part is an emphasis on insecurity For Trump Universitys sales team that meant focusing on the customers personal financial shortcomings when closing a deal For Trump himself it manifests as stump speeches bemoaning the decline in American manufacturing the peril of illegal immigration the rise of China and ISIS and how we dont win anymore These insecurities may or may not be grounded in reality But the solutions to them often arent Trump University promised an easy path to wealth and success in the realestate market just as the housing bubble was about to burst Lets get you enrolled today so you can start building a real estate empire reads one suggested line from the playbook Trumps campaign solutions are even more grandiose ranging from a giant wall on the USMexico border to a military so large and strong well never have to use it The third part is Trump or perhaps more accurately Trumps personal brand in all its coiffed and gilded glory Decades of effort invested in making a surname synonymous with business acumen and extravagant wealth imbued Trump University with a legitimacy it could not otherwise acquire Trump himself also relies on this on the campaign trailnot the name recognition but its association with winning For both Trump and Trump University the goal is for prospective customers and potential voters alike to think his success can rub off on them too But that payoff may never come I do not believe that Trump University taught Donald Trumps investing secrets one former Trump employee testified Donald Trump came from a wealthy family and had resources at his disposal to purchase real estatethat is the secretone the average consumer could not replicate
