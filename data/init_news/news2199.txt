Ben Carsons debate night in Houston can be summarized in one line Can somebody attack me pleaseOkay his fruit salad line was pretty good too but it was his plea for negative attention that perfectly captured his irrelevance He was so desperate for a chance to speak that he figured a verbal assault from one of his opponents  which by rule would entitle him to a response  might be the only way hed get to talkCNN which broadcast the debate and supplied the moderator Wolf Blitzer didnt even pretend that the retired neurosurgeon is still a factor in the Republican presidential nominating contest Carson received just six questions in more than two hours and got only 11 minutes and 10 seconds of speaking time roughly half the allotment of Ted Cruz and about a third of Donald Trumps share according to a tally by PoliticoWhy is Ben Carson still running for presidentManaging talk time is always difficult especially in a debate as fractious as Thursdays Trump Cruz and Marco Rubio bickered interrupted and shouted over one another constantly But its philosophically challenging too Should a moderator try to grant equal time to every candidate or focus more heavily on the leadersIt depends In November when I interviewed Fox Business Network anchors Neil Cavuto and Maria Bartiromo before they moderated a GOP debate featuringeight candidates they acknowledged some imbalance is inevitable but said they would attempt to dole out time more or less evenlyTheir efforts made sense at that stage of the race  three months before the start of primary balloting a point where polls arent very good predictors On the day of that debate Nov 10 Trump and Carson were in a virtual tie atop the Republican field according to the Real Clear Politics national averageCarson of course has plummeted since then it was just too early for moderators to judge who was or was not legit and to hand out speaking time accordinglyBut by now its very clear that Carson has no shot to be the Republican nominee While each of the other remaining candidates has managed to finish second or better in at least one of the first four primary states Carson hasnt placed higher than fourth Those are real results not polls He hasnt done well in the Midwest Northeast South or West He has a very small constituency that is sticking by him but there is zero reason to believe hes got a shotIts hard to understand why hes still in the race in factDebate moderators should be slow to dismiss candidates allowing for the possibility of an improbable comeback Perhaps thats why John Kasich whose own viability is in serious doubt got almost exactly as much speaking time as RubioBut Carson is so far out of the running that it would have been difficult to justify giving him much air This was the last debate before Super Tuesday The purpose was to help voters in the upcoming states  and elsewhere  choose among the candidates who could actually represent the Republican Party in the general electionCarson just isnt one of them And every minute devoted to him was a minute deducted from a real contender This kind of thing is a judgment call and CNN got the judgment right
