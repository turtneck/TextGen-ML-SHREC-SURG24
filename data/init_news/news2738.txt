Several Republicans started the House Freedom Caucus earlier this year to push House leadership to fight harder Theyre feeling emboldened at a crucial momentRep Jason Chaffetz R of Utah hopes to be the choice of conservatives in his run for House speaker in a longshot challenge to majority leader Kevin McCarthy of CaliforniaWhen the House broke for its August recess Republican Rep John Fleming went home to Louisiana to connect with voters He got an earfulHe traveled the state and whether he spoke with a lowly company employee a middle manager or a business owner they all said the same thing They are very disappointed in how we Republicans are doing in Washington says Rep Fleming a physician elected in 2008Fleming says his constituents see a GOPcontrolled Congress failing to check President Obama even as federal regulations are hurting them personally It doesnt matter to them that the president has veto power or that Democrats can still block Republicans in the GOPcontrolled SenateThey just dont want to hear that Thats an excuse to them he says in an interview They at least want a fightFleming is doing his darndestIn January he and eight other hardline Republicans formed the House Freedom Caucus to challenge the GOP leadership which they claim is not fighting hard enough for Republican priorities Nowtheyre bigger and theyre emboldened They just succeeded in driving out Speaker John Boehner R of Ohio who recently stunned Washington with the news that he will retire from Congress on Oct 30In the weeks ahead the Freedom Caucus will have plentiful opportunities to push the fight further  from the speakers race to a combustible mix of fiscal deadlines this fall Though members say they have not yet settled on a strategy one thing is certain They are not afraid of government shutdowns fiscal cliffs or any other hardline tactics that typically made Boehner winceRepublicans have not gotten what they wanted they say not because these gambits failed but rather because leadership didnt commit to them heart and soulAnd they want that to end nowFor this invitationonly group of about 40 members which meets regularly at a Capitol Hill restaurant called the Tortilla Coast the fight starts with the GOPs election for the speakership and other GOP leadership offices which will take place in a secret ballot on ThursdayMr Boehner said he wanted to spare his members and the institution the turmoil of an expected attempt to oust him But to many conservatives like the members of the Freedom Caucus turmoil is not the problem They want real change in the topdown way the House is run and are making demandsThat pressure bubbled over Sunday when Rep Jason Chaffetz R of Utah suddenly joined the race challenging Boehners presumed successor Rep Kevin McCarthy R of California Congressman Chaffetz says he was recruited as an alternative to majority leader McCarthy He doubts Boehners righthand man can get enough conservatives to win a final floor vote for speaker without having to rely on Democrats That vote will occur at the end of the monthYou dont just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership team Chaffetz said on Fox News Sunday Voterswant us to take that fight to the Senate They want us to take that fight to the presidentBeyond the race for the speakership the House has a todo list chock full of pressure points for the Freedom Caucus including debt budget and tax deadlines Many in Washington are quaking over the deadlines They remember previous cliffhanger negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress They wonder whether the Freedom Caucus will trigger a government shutdown over federal funding for Planned Parenthood the way hardliners did over Obamacare in 2013Caucus members see the coming weeks as an opportunity Exactly what their fight will look like is kind of fluid says Rep Matt Salmon R of Arizona another caucus founder But as we go forward were going to consider anything and everything he said last weekWhether Republicans are fighting hard enough for their priorities is a matter of opinion and forms a dividing line in the party that runs from voters to Congress to the presidential raceSixty percent of Republican voters say they feel betrayed by their political party according to a September Fox News poll Twothirds of GOP primary voters do not believe Republican majorities have done enough to block Obamas agenda the poll findsIts somewhat subjective Did you fight hard enough for your priorities With Boehner the answer is No you didnt  says Matt Kibbe the former head of the tea party advocacy group Freedom WorksMr Kibbe is the kind of person Boehner means when he rails against false prophets who gin up the base with unrealistic promises The speaker blames outside groups such as Freedom Works and Heritage Action for egging on the 2013 shutdown a strategy he says was doomed to fail He and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell R of Kentucky have since vowed not to repeat a shutdownBut Kibbe says it is Boehner who is the false prophet promising in the 2010 GOP Pledge to America to roll back spending to 2008 levels and to repeal Obamacare if the Republicans won the HouseYou have to believe that they never meant it says Kibbe who is now a senior adviser to Concerned American Voters a super political action committee for GOP presidential candidate and libertarian Sen Rand Paul of KentuckyThis idea that shutting down the government is a fundamental loser for Republicans  I just dont buy it Kibbe continues He notes that it was only after the shutdowns of 1995 and early 96 that Republicans under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich were able to strike a deal on welfare reform with President ClintonClinton took Gingrich seriously Obama has never taken Boehner seriouslyFleming couldnt agree more He points to the stunning midterm election of 2014 which returned a historic number of Republicans to the House and handed the Senate to GOP control  despite the shutdown the year beforeRepublicans rarely put a bill on the presidents desk that he doesnt like Fleming complains Indeed the president has only vetoed four bills in his seven years in office  though hes made plenty of veto threatsWe could be getting more than were getting now Fleming says By raising the white flag before the discussion debate even begins weve already lostOther Republicans  hardly moderates  dont see it that wayTake Grover Norquist founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform Hes famous for his Taxpayer Protection Pledge to oppose tax increases Most Republicans in Congress have signed itIdeologically Republicans are more united today than ever he says What Republican is for Obamacare Or for tax increasesUnder Boehners leadership he notes the House scrapped earmarks Republicans negotiated permanent tax cuts for most Americans They got budget caps and the first real spending cuts since the end of World War II They reformed a part of Medicare in whats known as the Doc Fix They even sued the presidentPeople take progress for granted says Mr Norquist What you would like is not the question I would like rubies and diamonds Its What can you accomplish In Congress a backlash may be building against Freedom Caucus hardball tactics Last month a caucus member quit saying tactics were harming not helping the GOP cause Over in the Senate Republican colleagues shouted down tea party favorite Sen Ted Cruz R of Texas last week over his procedural move related to spending and Planned ParenthoodTheres a lot of frustration In some sense this group treats Republicans like theyre their enemy says Rep Tom Cole R of Oklahoma a Boehner supporter Its always inappropriate to try and blackmail your teammatesThe Oklahoman understands the anger of Freedom Caucus members The political roadblocks to the GOP agenda frustrate him too but anger clouds their judgment he says The caucus pursues things that demonstrably dont work such as threatening to shut down the Department of Homeland Security over the presidents immigration policyCole hopes that a new speaker can help calm the waters I think weve got an opportunity for a little bit of a new beginning
