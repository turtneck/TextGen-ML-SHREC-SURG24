Taming the corporate media beast BRICS Do Not Lack Mortar What Detractors Should Know In a world of uncertainties and crumbling western economies the fivemember BRICS group is more  not less  relevant   Russia  India Report A lot of people want to see the BRICS fail Western nations in particular the United States and Britain are prime suspects However there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the Wests hands Each year as the BRICS summit draws near the cacophony from these haters grows louder Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media During the buildup to the Goa summit this year the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the IndiaChina rift over Pakistanbacked terrorism would derail the summit However the predicted outcome of an implosion didnt materialise and on the contrary with India and Russia inking the S400 missile deal  Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event Since many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators  who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year  heres a ready reckoner on the BRICS group So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing dont lose sleep over the issue World needs BRICS Most of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant The IMF and the World Bank for instance were founded during the closing years of World War II In geopolitical time thats ancient history Similarly the G7 appears to be on life support and the OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is no longer a leading organisation With the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the Wests decline Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades Beijings growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but thats enough to add the equivalent of Hollands national income to the Chinese GDP Bottom line without the BRICS the world economy will experience 1929 all over again BRICS slowdown not a meltdown Uday Kotak executive vicepresident of Kotak Mahindra Bank feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies His view has been echoed by several socalled experts But curiously have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey According to the USbased Centre on Global Interests  You can look at the BRICS from the financial markets point of view or from a geopolitical point of view But whichever lens you view it through what you see is the same despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core Their economies have scale Their decisions can move financial markets They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions And in terms of foreign policy they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels It adds In both of these regards  economics and foreign policy  the BRICS are alive and kicking In fact they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001 when Jim ONeill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become Bilaterals cant bring down the BRICS If the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues the international body is considered a failure But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics The primary role of the fivemember group is to remove the Wests grip from the levers that control the world economy By establishing their own New Development Bank the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the worlds lenderoflastresort In this backdrop fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless Take Goa 2016 While the Goa Declaration mentions terror the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all Sure Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan describing it as the mothership of terrorism and China defended its ally by saying it had made great sacrifices But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors To be sure politics can be tabled if its a side dish  like Syria was a couple of years ago  but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS Critics of the BRICS often point to the IndiaChina border issue as evidence of serious problems But this misses the point There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries  just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members BRICS are not united but it doesnt matter Unlike NATO or the European Union where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock each of the BRICS countries is different However their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal  development As emerging countries they are focussed on raising their standards of living The fact that they are united as a group despite such stark differences in national goals opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities points to the viability of the BRICS
