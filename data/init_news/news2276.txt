Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko called Wednesday for an international peacekeeping mission in his nations wartorn east a stark admission that his nation can no longer fend off proRussian rebels after a major battlefield defeatAny international force on the ground would harden the battle lines after 10 months of fighting forcing Ukraine to give up for now its attempts to reunify the nation But it would also halt Russianbacked rebels from pushing onward toward KievThe suggestion came hours after thousands of Ukrainian troops fled the encircled railway hub of Debaltseve where fighting only intensified after a ceasefire ostensibly took effect Sunday Nearly a year after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula the fresh loss threatened tough political consequences for Ukraines proWestern president amid questions of how the troops became surrounded in recent weeksSoldiers described a chaotic nighttime retreat over eastern Ukraines frozen steppe with shells raining down on them from two sidesThe prospects for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine were not immediately clear Any UN Security Council mandate would be subject to a possible Russian veto Poroshenko said he hoped for a European Union police mission although what such a plan would entail on the ground remained unclear Any EUonly plan appeared likely to be rejected by Russia which has said that it views NATOs encroachment on its borders as a security threatI invite you to discuss an invitation to a UN peacekeeping mission Poroshenko told a latenight meeting of his top security advisers according to Ukrainian news outletsThe violence may increase pressure on President Obama to supply Ukraines military with weapons a decision he said would be made only after the peace effort EU leaders meanwhile said they would consider more economic sanctions against RussiaElsewhere in Ukraines wartorn east violence was abating as rebels announced that they had begun pulling back heavy weaponry in accordance with the ceasefire agreement But the advance on Debaltseve suggested that the Russianbacked rebels had the strength to push forward when they wishedPoroshenko has staked his office on reuniting Ukraine and quelling Europes bloodiest conflict since the Balkan wars in the 1990sEarlier in the day he called the retreat a planned and organized withdrawal of certain units from DebaltseveThe defeat was sure to stir a political cauldron over the prosecution of the war in Kiev where charges of incompetence and even betrayal were lobbed at Ukraines military brass in the aftermath The thousands of Ukrainian troops who were in and around Debaltseve represented a significant portion of the nations battleready soldiersUkraines flatlining economy is fueling even more anger toward Ukraines leaders Natural gas prices are set to nearly triple under the terms of a bailout plan from the International Monetary Fund sure to be politically radioactive Ukraines currency fell to record lows on WednesdayOne of Poroshenkos coalition allies in parliament called for criminal charges to be lodged against top military leadersThere were enough forces and equipment The problem is coordination and command Semen Semenchenko a lawmaker who is also a volunteer militia commander wrote on Facebook The head of the General Staff should be brought to liability PeriodWestern officials said Wednesday that the fighting called into question the viability of the peace deal reached in Minsk Belarus last week between Russian President Vladimir Putin and European leadersThe situation in Debaltseve is a massive violation of the ceasefire a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel Steffen Seibert said in Berlin It is a heavy strain on  the hope for peace in eastern Ukraine in general He said Germany was poised to push for further sanctions against Russia if fighting escalatesNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said he was deeply concerned about the fightingRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the fighting was inevitable after Poroshenkos insistence at last weeks peace negotiations that the troops were not surrounded But he said it must stopLast weeks peace deal left a 60hour window before the ceasefire was set to go into effect That stipulation almost certainly led to an increase in fighting as both sides sought to maximize their positions before the truce No official explanation was given for the delay although Ukrainian and European officials said at the time they were ready to have an immediate ceasefire The window for continued fighting has led to speculation that rebels may have been seeking to seize Debaltseve before the truce took effectSix Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the pullout according to Poroshenko although the real number seemed likely to be significantly higher based on Ukrainian soldiers accounts of sustaining heavy fire during the latenight retreat Many said they had only 10 minutes notice to grab what they could carry and flee piling onto tanks armored personnel carriers and trucks as they sped toward the staging city of ArtemivskIt was not immediately clear how many troops escaped and how many remained in and around the town Top military officials said that 85 percent of the troops had escaped as of Wednesday evening Others may still be in hiding or were killed or captured they said Some soldiers said that many corpses were left behindFrontline troops questioned on Wednesday why it took so long for the retreat to be ordered saying that their situation had long ago become hopelessIts not about Debaltseve as a city its about Putin showing he can do what he wants said Lt Viktor Kovalenko the acting deputy commander of the battalion that had been charged with protecting railroads into Debaltseve He said several people in his convoy were killed during the retreat which began at 3 am Wednesday and that at least 50 troops were captured as they tried to fleeKovalenko said supplies had run so low that one Ukrainian position was captured earlier this week simply because it ran out of ammunitionAnother soldier described a harrowing early morning escape speeding over pitchblack fields that had been hardened by frostWe came under shelling and we prayed to God to let us get out There are a lot of wounded and killed people said Ihor Sevastyan 47 who drove out of Debaltseve Wednesday in a green radio truck The vehicle was riddled with large bullet holes and one of the tires had been shot out They kept pushing forward using the trucks rimOther than in Debaltseve both sides said Wednesday that they were holding to the agreement Rebels said they had begun to pull back heavy weaponry from the front lines as stipulated by the ceasefire deal and relatively little fighting was reported elsewhere in the
