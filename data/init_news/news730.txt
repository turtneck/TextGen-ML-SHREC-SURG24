BERNIES SWAN SONG BEGINS In Sen Bernie Sanders address Thursday he said a lot of things except that he would concede his bid for the Democratic nomination But on the heels of his meeting with Hillary Clinton subsequent matching statements and his promise that he would do everything he could to defeat Donald Trump the signs that the end is near couldnt be clearer  So why not drop out now  Well there are two schools of thought on that  One is that Sanders is trying to hold on to as much leverage as he can to make his policy positions part of the party platform and institute changes in the primary process The idea is that the longer he remains in the race the more Clinton and the party will concede for the sake of the much coveted word this cycle unity  But that theory has some holes in it  A prolonged holdout by Sanders actually weakens his hand Supporters like Rep RalGrijalva DAriz the first member of congress to back Sanders have started to throw their support behind Clinton The small donations that once poured in have dried up And the muchreported massive rallies have dwindled with time and are now absent  All this to say Sanders momentum doesnt look quite as threatening as it did back in March or even May Any hope that Sanders could win or pose some sort of mathematical challenge based on delegate count ended with the California primary 10 days ago  Not to mention President Obamas endorsement for Clinton this week  Which is exactly why those in the second school of thought believe Sanders remaining in the race is a strategy to benefit Clinton and the Democrats more than anything else  In this notion the longer Sanders remains in the more his fire continues to burn out on its own leaving Clinton in better graces with his supporters than if she appeared to force him out while he still had momentum Clinton appears as the magnanimous candidate letting her challenger run his own course instead of the political powerhouse choking the competition and Sanders doesnt look like he cut and ran Everyone wins  The cordial meeting the two candidates had this week seems to show that is exactly whats happening Since Clinton has officially secured presumptive nominee status Sanders is no longer a distraction from her general election strategy or a threat of division within the party His presence in the race doesnt hold the same ire for her it once did  But remember Sanders is not a dyed in the wool Democrat and he doesnt feel obliged to abide by any partys rules Although his campaign has said theyre no longer recruiting superdelegates it doesnt mean the independent socialistturnedDemocraticchallenger will bow out quietly  So however long he remains in the race how he bows out will be on his terms regardless of party unity or strategyTIME OUT On this
