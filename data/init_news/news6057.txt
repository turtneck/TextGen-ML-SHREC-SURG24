The US and Cuba normalized relations one year ago Thursday Small changes have begun to percolate but theres debate over whether thats progressHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueLos Angeles Dodgers player Yasiel Puig from Cuba holds a young baseball player as he poses for photos before giving a baseball clinic to children in Havana Cuba WednesdayWhen Yasiel Puig the Los Angeles Dodgers rightfielder and Cuban defector was able to return home for a baseball goodwill tour this week without fear of detention by Cuban authorities it was a sure sign of progress a year into the normalization of relations between the United States and CubaSo is the expanded public Internet access that Cubans now enjoy something the Cuban government agreed to as part of the deal struck between President Obama and Cuban President Ral Castro a year ago ThursdayAnd so too is the agreement the two governments reached this week to resume direct commercial airline flights between the two neighboring countries for the first time in decadesBut for all that has changed in a year between the two longtime antagonists much remains the same both supporters and detractors of Mr Obamas opening to Cuba sayThe fivedecadeold US economic embargo on Cuba remains with little prospect of Congress lifting it anytime soon while critics of normalization say the policy has yielded no improvement in the Communist governments respect for human and political rightsCertainly it was a big step forward and there was reason for the great elation last year when President Obama and Ral Castro announced their intention to normalize relations and we do have positive results to see from that says Wayne Smith a former US diplomat in Cuba who is now a senior fellow of the Center for International Policys Cuba Project in Washington However its been something of a disappointment as well he adds mainly over the inability to lift the embargoNot just the embargo but the status of the US military prison at Guantnamo Bay in Cuba and the resolution of property claims between the two sides dating from the Cuban revolution also loom as stumbling blocks Mr Smith says These big complex issues have us somewhat stymiedFor their part opponents of renewed relations say the Cuban governments continued disregard for human rights and political freedoms is the strongest argument against closer ties  and proof that no amount of concessions will prompt the Castro regime to changeWhat weve seen instead of improvements is a huge spike in repression and in violence against the political opposition repeated arrests of the same dissidents and churches being shut down says Ana Quintana a Latin America policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Washington Because the Obama administration awarded these renewed relations without demanding anything in return she adds the US has lost its position of leverageObama continues to call for an end to the embargo which he considers a Cold War relic but no one expects the Republicancontrolled Congress to oblige him  particularly not in an election yearAs a result analysts like Smith say they expect official change to continue slowly  even as a transformation in the relationship between the two countries accelerates as peopletopeople contacts expandA Congress rushing to lift the embargo isnt going to happen Smith says but already weve seen a notable impact on the personal relations between Cubans and Americans and thats going to continueMore Americans are traveling to Cuba  although the embargo still prevents them from visiting the island and spending money simply as tourists Academic exchanges and educational tours are quickly expanding At the same time the improved public WiFi availability in Cuba and eased travel restrictions for CubanAmericans mean that contact between the island and Cuban communities in the US now is much like that for other immigrant communities from around the hemisphereSome members of Congress marked the first anniversary of Obamas opening to Cuba by hailing the impact of the small steps that Cubans and American have taken toward each otherAs American business leaders scientists academics and artists are increasingly engaging in purposeful travel to Cuba they are forging important new relationships with the Cuban people and supporting the countrys rising entrepreneurial class said Sen Ben Cardin of Maryland the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee in a statement ThursdayHe called on Congress to take steps to make the Obama administrations advances permanent and lift all restrictions on American citizens traveling to CubaThere is also evidence that the normalization of bilateral relations has prompted a surge in Cubans migrating to the US A widespread fear in Cuba that normal relations will prompt the US to soon drop the special immigration status for Cubans reaching the US has led nearly 50000 island residents to leave for the US this yearCubans who reach US soil are allowed to stay and are granted residency while those who are caught at sea are turned back The number of Cubans arriving this year is more than double last years total  and about five times higher than in 2011Senator Cardin said the normalization of relations has resulted in small but important changes on the island But he noted that the government continues to jail political activists and restrict the emergence of a free press and he called on the Cuban government to make meaningful progress in the second year of renewed engagementCritics say theres no reason to expect Cuba to changeA year of steppedup attacks on the Cuban peoples freedoms should not leave anyone thinking that somehow there will be a positive transition in the second year of renewed relations says Ms Quintana of HeritageAs for the power of peopletopeople engagement Quintana says she doubts it can have much impact in the case of Cuba where she says a fearful government does its best to limit contact between average Cubans and visiting AmericansSpending time with Americans is considered subversive activity so anyone who does it in an unofficial setting is suspect she saysBut there is one American she would like to see visit the island Barack ObamaPresident Obama says he hopes to visit Cuba in 2016 and Im all for it  if he insists on meeting and marching with the dissidents she says Thats the kind of personal engagement that could be a transformative moment in this relationship
