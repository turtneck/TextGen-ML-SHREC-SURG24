authorities and are ready to help with the investigationDanish authorities called on Germany and Sweden to be on the lookout for the suspect at their borders with Denmark Authorities initially thought two people were involved in the shootingPolice said the apparent target of the shooting was Lars Vilks 68 who has endured several attempted attacks and death threats since he depicted the founder of Islam as a dog in 2007Vilks escaped unharmed after a bodyguard shoved him into the cafe kitchen when the gunfire erupted around 4 pmWhat other motive could there be Its possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo he said referring to the Jan 7 attack by Islamic extremists on the French newspaperAt first there was panic People crawled down under tables Vilks said My bodyguards quickly pulled me awayI heard someone firing with an automatic weapon and someone shouting Police returned the fire and I hid behind the bar I felt surreal like in a movie Niels Ivar Larsen one of the speakers at the event told the TV2 channelThe dead victim was identified by police only as a 40yearold civilianFrancois Zimeray the French ambassador to Denmark was in the cafe at the time but was not hurt Bullets went through the doors and everyone threw themselves to the floor he told the AFP news agencyThe Danish Security and Intelligence Service described the gunman who was carrying a black machine gun as tall with an athletic build It said he had an Arabic appearance but with lighter skin than normal and black straight hairHe wore a black or dark blue ski jacket and matching pants possibly with gloves the security service saidThe gunman did not get into the main room where the event was being held but fired into it according to several media accountsPolice later found the getaway car abandoned near a metro station and promptly shut down the transit line between two stations to search for the suspectDanish TV2 reported that about 30 bullet holes hit the window of the cafe and that at least two people were taken away on stretchers including a uniformed police officerHelle Merete Brix one of the organizers of the event told TV2 that Vilks ran to the nearby kitchen when the shots rang outHe was very cool she said We stood and told each other bad jokes His bodyguards did a tremendous jobShe told the TV station the attack was a clear assassination attempt of Vilks who receives police protection when he is in DenmarkFrank Jensen Lord Mayor of Copenhagen said he was deeply horrified by the shootings which appeared to be a violent crackdown on freedom of expressionUnfortunately there are people who react with violence when their entrenched mindset meets with the free debate and freedom of speech Jensen wrote on his Facebook page We must stand firm on the values our society is built on and never give in to fearLast year a Pennsylvania woman received a 10year prison term for a plot to kill Vilks In 2010 two brothers tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden and were imprisoned for attempted arsonAfter Islamist militants attacked the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris last month killing 12 people Vilks told the AP that even fewer organizations were inviting him to give lectures over increased security concernsVilks said he thought Swedens SAPO security service which deploys bodyguards to protect him would step up the security around himThis will create fear among people on a whole different level than were used to he said Charlie Hebdo was a small oasis Not many dared do what they did
