First of all poor Melania She was just trying to do her part and get the hell out of there She deviated not a word from the teleprompter except when thrown by unfamiliar wordslike when adversaries came out as advisories Hey theyre similarSecond of all how the hell does this even happen Watch the video of Melania and Michelle Obama superimposed upon each other and you get a sense of how audacious the theft was and how perfectforTV this brouhaha is If someone wrote the speech for Melania how did that person get hired And if Melania wrote it herself who let that happen Rule for first gentlemen and first ladies do not pick your own wordsIn case you missed it Im referring to the MelaniaMichelle plagiarism flapthat Melania lifted some paragraphs out of Michelle Obamas 2008 convention speech It is a major embarrassment to the Trump campaign and without doubt to Melania That said lets not exaggerate its importance Writing in The New Republic Brian Beutler called it incredibly damagingwhich seems over the top Its devouring the oxygen right now In 24 hours it wont beEvery scandal has a halflife The worst scandals brand you forever and keep unfolding forever The least serious get forgotten fast and run out of gas in a day I think Melanias is of the latter sortTo brand you forever a scandal needs to reveal something hugely distasteful This wasnt that big a deal Shes Donalds wife not Donald To keep unfolding forever a scandal needs to have an interesting mystery This isnt that interesting or mysterious The question of how this blunder happened is worth a story but not a lot of storiesContrast this with the scandal of erstwhile Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski who allegedly yanked a female reporters arm in a boorish manner That kept going and going because the allegations were very distasteful assault and the mystery was interesting did he really do it as claimed Every couple of days or so it seemed a new video emerged It was an excellent dumb scandalPlagiarism is one of those sins that doom journalists but not politicians or their wives In 1987 when running for president Joe Biden plagiarized vast passages from Labour Party politician Neil Kinnock which made for humiliating coverage In 2008 Barack Obama lifted passages from Massachusetts thengovernor Deval Patrick a misstep that Obama smoothly batted away by saying Patrick had suggested the lines because of the two mens shared philosophy Both men did okay in the long runSo this will damage Trump a little but not much The pearlclutching is taking place in newsrooms not in Americas living rooms Its embarrassing but it plays into no popularly accepted narrative That Trumps campaign is bumbling and chaotic in its operations is known to political buffs but not the broader public Tomorrow well be arguing about some other snafu And the way things are going well have more than a few to choose from
