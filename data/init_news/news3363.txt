 Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his governments repeated affronts to the White HouseIn the past weeks alone defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last years nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact which bolstered Hitler and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the ethnic cleansing of JewsAmerican president Barack Obama meanwhile hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is antiIsrael The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton the Democratic partys candidate to succeed Mr Obama in Novembers electionIn reality however the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour Israeli expectations of a 45bnayear deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran dealIn fact Israel already receives roughly 38bn  if Congresss assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in Notably Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra fundsThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollars depreciation against the shekelA bigger blow still is the White Houses demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industryNonetheless Washingtons renewed military largesse  in the face of almost continual insults  inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog Even The New York Times has described the aid package as too bigSince the 1973 war Israel has received at least 100bn in military aid with more assistance hidden from view Back in the 1970s Washington paid half of Israels military budget Today it still foots a fifth of the bill despite Israels economic successBut the US expects a return on its massive investment As the late Israeli politiciangeneral Ariel Sharon once observed Israel has been a US aircraft carrier in the Middle East acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit WashingtonAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraqs and Syrias nuclear programmes A nucleararmed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later USbacked moves at regime overthrow as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenalIn addition Israels USsponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry the countrys most powerful lobby Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers That in turn serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catchup in the rest of the Middle EastThe first F35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December  their various components produced in 46 US states  will increase the clamour for the cuttingedge warplaneIsrael is also a frontline laboratory as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend that develops and fieldtests new technology Washington can later use itselfThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome  which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation  it largely paid for Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyberwarfare such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Irans civilian nuclear programmeBut the clearest message from Israels new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehoodSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat an initiative unveiled shortly before he leaves office that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peaceHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid dealIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu he would have used the aid agreement as leverage Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West BankMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal  he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity See more at httpwwwjonathancooknet20160919palestiniansloseinusmilitaryaiddealwithisraelsthashfL4Eq28Ndpuf Can US Elections Really
