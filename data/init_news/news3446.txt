Montana birth certificate says she was born to two people who say they are Caucasian She is seen as a teenager at left in an old family photo and in a more recent picture from Eastern Washington University where she teaches classes related to AfricanAmerican cultureFor the family one comment stung especially hard I havent had a DNA test Dolezal said Theres been no biological proof that Larry and Ruthanne are my biological parentsLarry and Ruthanne are the Montana couple who helped drive this story telling reporters that Rachel is their estranged daughter Ezra Dolezal is himself biracial and one of four children adopted by the Dolezals  unlike Rachel his older sister by 15 years he saysI guarantee that she is not going to take a DNA test to prove that Larry and Ruthanne Dolezal are not her parents Ezra Dolezal told CNNs New Day on Wednesday Because they are and she doesnt want to be caught going back on her story againOver the years several reports have come out identifying Rachel Dolezal as transracial multiracial or black She hasnt corrected them  in part because it seems she feels connected with the AfricanAmerican experience a link she claims began as early as age 5 when she drew selfportraits in brown instead of peach crayon and with black curly hairThis selfassessment though has bothered some  including AfricanAmericans who feel that Dolezal advanced as an activist by misrepresenting herself and by claiming personal injustices that werent legitimate coming from a woman who could decide any day to present herself as white againShe has had her defenders too with some pointing to the good shes done as an activist and saying she shouldnt be faulted for her tight bond with the black communityShes too nervous to admit the truth brother saysFor all the Internet outrage though the ones most directly affected by all this are the Dolezals And they couldnt be further apartIt has been years since Rachel Dolezal talked with her parents Theyve been on opposing sides of one custody battle which ended with Rachel taking in one of Larry and Ruthannes four adopted children as her own And Rachel who attended historically black Howard University and until very recently had taught classes on AfricanAmerican culture at Eastern Washington University has claimed she felt her connection with the black experience was stifled when she was growing upI felt very isolated with my identity virtually my entire life that nobody really got it and that I really didnt have the personal agency to express it she told NBC I kind of imagined that maybe at some point Id have to own it publicly and discuss this kind of complexityYet her parents have challenged her assertions including that she identified with AfricanAmericans as a youngster or was held back in any way Theyve challenged her integrity and even questioned her mental stateEzra Dolezal backed his adopted parents Wednesday while ripping what he called a web of lies  a web that he said is growing bigger by the dayI think  shes too nervous to just admit that shes not been telling the truth he said That is why she keeps on making up more and more lies to help fit the story as it goes
