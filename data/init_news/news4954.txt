Washington CNN Mitt Romney is eyeing another shot at the White House but many Republicans including those who admire and respect the partys most recent nominee are wondering exactly what rationale he has for mounting another campaign in 2016After all in 2012 Romney lost all but one of the battleground states trailed President Barack Obama 332206 in electoral votes and Republicans panned his gaffeprone campaign chaotic convention and creaky tech operationOne working theory behind Romney 30  he thinks he got it right on the big issues that decided the last election and that voters have got buyers remorseHe is been proven right on so many of the issues certainly domestic policy but also foreign policy He almost looked prophetic there talking about Russia and talking about the war on terror said Utah Republican Rep Jason Chaffetz on CNNs State of the Union on SundayAides have told reporters including CNNs Gloria Borger  that Romney sees vindication in a world tipping into chaos and an economic recovery that left the middle class behindAt the GOPs winter meeting in San Diego on Friday Romney said he has given serious consideration to a new run for the presidency and his lacerating criticism of Obama suggested he believes he has earned his chanceSo how do Romneys critiques and promises stand up as he yet again sets foot on the road to the White HouseRomneys best case for proving he was right may lie overseasNot even the most committed Obama supporter could convincingly argue that the world is more stable than in 2012Its only two years since the President brandished his own first term record of ending wars and killing Osama bin Laden to pound Romney as heir to a disastrous Republican foreign policy legacyBut assumptions underpinning Obamas statesmanship have started to fray The rise of ISIS has raised questions about his decision to pull all troops out of Iraq and his reluctance to plunge into Syrias civil war The standoff with Vladimir Putin has left his reset of relations with Russia looking naiveThe results of the Hillary ClintonBarack Obama foreign policy have been devastating Romney said Friday arguing that terrorist attacks in places like France and Nigeria proved the world is not saferAble leaders anticipate events prepare for them and act in time to shape them Romney wroteSome simply cannot envision the future and are thus unpleasantly surprised when it arrives Some simply hope for the best Others succumb to analysis paralysis weighing trends and forecasts and choices beyond the time of opportunityMany Romney aides believe Russia proves his pointIn the 2012 campaign long before Putin annexed Crimea the Republican said that Russia is without question our No 1 geopolitical foeObama reacted with derision The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold Wars been over for 20 years he crowed in the third presidential debateBut time hasnt been kind to that zingerWhile there is a debate whether Washington and Russia are really locked in a true Cold War the Kremlin is doing a passable imitation of the Soviet Union Russian aircraft are buzzing NATO planes in Europe and Russia stands accused of incursions in Ukraine Moscow rewrote the borders of Europe by biting off Crimea and Putin warns the West wants to chain the Russian bearWhile Romney predicted Moscows belligerence its impossible to know whether tougher US rhetoric would have changed Putins calculations  or antagonized him even moreAnd the administration argues that far from being the actions of a geopolitical foe Putins nationalism represents the thrashings of a weakened and desperate regime that hardly poses a threat to the United States And Obama might have adopted a tougher approach to Russia himself had he not had to coax along European nations who were more reluctant than Washington to impose sanctionsSome of Romneys other 2012 foreign policy bets are yet to play outHe said that Irans nuclear program is potentially the longest term threat to the United StatesIf we reelect Barack Obama Iran will have a nuclear weapon he said in a Republican debate in 2011So far Iran has not gone nuclear Obama says an interim deal has frozen Tehrans atomic advances and a final pact is being sought to stop the Islamic Republic short of the bombOn Iraq Romney hammered Obama in 2012 for not reaching a deal with Baghdad to leave a residual force behind after the warObama pounced saying that meant his opponent wanted to keep US troops in the country Two years on the tables have turned and Obama has dispatched up to 3000 troops to train Iraqi forces to take on ISIS  though the administration insists that they will not be doing any fightingRomney was also spot on when he warned the next few years would bring more chaos and tumult in the Middle East and that jihadists would continue to spread But given the regions agonized history it hardly takes a strategic genius to make such a predictionRomney argued in 2012 that Obamas economic policy led to an anemic recovery from the worst recession in 70 yearsHe complained Obama broke his promise to cut the budget deficit in half and cited Congressional Budget Office CBO figures projecting trillion dollar deficits for four years following 2014While Romney was wrong about that the latest CBO estimates do offer some support to his wider point The nonpartisan body expects the deficit to only be around 500 billion in 2015 but sees a rising trend with trillion dollar deficits in 2022 through 2024 owing to higher health care costs and rising interest payments on federal debtRomneys critique of the uneven economic recovery is also accurateIf you are elected president we will continue to see a middle class squeeze with wages going down he said in the first debateHe warned that if Obama got four more years in the White House the national debt would approach 20 trillion The figure is now 18 trillion But Romneys claim the US economy is on the road to Greece was always hyperboleRomney also underestimated the pace of the recoveryYoure going to get a repeat of the last four years he said at the second presidential debateHe promised to get unemployment under 6 or lower in his first term Consider that promise beaten  by Obama In December the jobless number was 56 Romney also promised to create 12 million jobs In the first two years of Obamas second term the economy has pumped out 52 million jobs and could approach Romneys target before he leaves office Last year was Americas top year of job growth since 1999 But Republicans still call this the slowest economic recovery on recordNowhere was the 2012 debate more intense or more dripping with spin and falsehoods than Obamacare  on both sidesIn almost every campaign rally Romney claimed the average American family would see health costs rise by 2500 annually because of the presidents reformsStatistics dont yet offer a full picture of Obamacares impact on costs  and the law has so upended the health care industry it is difficult to draw firm conclusionsBut a Kaiser Foundation survey found that health care costs for family coverage in employersponsored plans rose 3 in 2014 well below Romneys figureIn the wider marketplace the picture is complicated because some people who did not have health care before can now get it under ObamacareOthers have chosen better plans now available which may cost more And some patients who bought Obamacare are now paying less for health care Total spending for health care in the nation rose 36 in 2013 slower than the 41 rise the year before according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Growth in private health insurance premiums meanwhile grew at 28 in 2013 compared to 40 the year before But Republicans point to extra costs  claiming for instance that many people now face higher deductablesRomney was correct to say however that millions of Americans would lose their insurance policies under Obamacare rejecting the presidents health care whopper If you like your health plan you can keep your health planBut thats only half the story While many people lost plans  some because they did not reach quality thresholds set by Obamacare  the White House says millions also signed up to new policiesStatistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bear out that claim finding that in the first half of 2014 122 of Americans had no health insurance compared to 173 the year before
