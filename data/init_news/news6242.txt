During the 1864 presidential race between Abraham Lincoln and George McClellan The New York Times published an article that contained this sentence We have had many important elections but never one so important as that now approaching Though there may have been some truth in this claim three years into the Civil War means the Times was probably one election too lateIn any event every candidate or publication thats made comparable declarations since that time regarding the presidential contest being the most important election of their lifetime or their generation or in history or ever is completely full of itThat goes for Gerald Ford who in a debate against Jimmy Carter claimed that the 1976 election was one of the most vital in the history of America As it turns out that was a contest between an accidental president and a highly ineffectual future president And it wasnt even the most important election Carter would participate inIt also goes for Walter Mondale who in 1984 told a crowd This is the most important election of our lives Ronald Reagan lost a single state to Mondale and the outcome was never really in doubt It goes for John Kerry who in 2004 said My fellow Americans this is the most important election of our lifetime It goes for Joe Biden and Barack Obama both of whom claimed that 2008 was the most important election in my lifetime It goes for Newt Gingrich who said it in 2012 It goes also for the media that acted as if what they said were trueIt certainly goes for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump neither of whom possess the requisite talent vision or charisma needed to destroy this country in a mere four years Yet on Tuesday in Dade City Florida Clinton finally stated what many in her party from the president to students to 96yearold Roger Angell have been saying for months I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes For her yes For the rest of us not so muchJudging from the histrionic rhetoric we hear daily most people believe this is the most important election ever Did you see the meltdown leftist media had after Clintons ethical tribulations again threatened her chances at the White House Youd think attacking Clinton were tantamount to attacking the very foundations of democracyPartisans always seem to believe that everything that happens to them right now at this very moment is the most important thing that has ever happened or will ever happen to humanityYes governments increasing involvement in the economic and moral lives of citizens has made political stakes high Its true that 2016 features the two suckiest candidates probably ever Its also true that our collective vision of the American project has frayed perhaps beyond repair With the intense scrutiny of contemporary political coverage more people are invested in the daily grind of elections which intensifies the sting of losing This anger compounds every cycle although winning brings its own disappointment with its unfulfilled promisesThats not to say our constitutional republic isnt slowly dying It probably is This condition isnt contingent on an elections outcome but on widespread problems with our institutions politics and voters Whatever you believe the future of governance should look like one election is not going make or break itIn fact when it comes to policy its far more likely that very little will change over the next four yearsperhaps even less than changed with the election of Obama who had two years of oneparty rule before Republicans took back Congress Last year Bloomberg Businessweek ran a column headlined Why 2016 May Be the Most Important Election of Our Lifetime Like many other similar pieces it argues that as our politics become more polarized our elections become correspondingly more significant But our growing divide might be exactly why 2016 turns out to be one of the least important elections in our lifetimeIf providence or dumb luck takes mercy on the Constitution Washington DCs gridlockan organic reflection of the nations dispositionwill remain the status quoActually what am I talking about Thats exactly what the Constitution was built to do in a divided nation The situation will render the next president weaker than most and somewhat contain his or her authoritarianism and poor judgmentThis kind of frustrating environment is likely to cause more recrimination and unfortunately abuses of power that are meant to circumvent the congestion Still overall its better than partisan unilateralism The situation will not change until we find competent people to put into the White House or politicians with ideas that have some crossover appeal That time is not nowOf course none of this is to completely diminish the importance of the presidential election Obviously voters are making a decision about the future of governance Judges are at stake Foreign policy is made There are consequences But if the republic cant survive a bad executive then its already dead
