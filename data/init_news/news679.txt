Share This Today we call it the status quo or endless war or we just dont bother to notice it Indeed now more than ever we dont notice it Its barely part of the 2016 election even though were engaged in active conflict in half a dozen countries toying with a relaunch of the Cold War with Russia and of course hemorrhaging as always more than half our annual discretionary budget on defense World War II has been going on for seven decades now and has no intention of ever stopping    of its own volition But this years rocking electoral craziness  not just Hurricane Donald but the unexpected staying power of the Bernie Sanders campaign  may well be the harbinger of transcendence Apparently theres another force in the universe capable of standing up to the American indeed the global militaryindustrial status quo Slowly slowly this force is organizing itself and taking human shape This isnt a simple process After all the game of empire  the game called war the game of domination  has been coalescing political power for several thousand years now But our current military budget was birthed by the wars of the 20th century William Hartung  writing recently at TomDispatch shows the fascinating connectedness of the wars that followed VE and VJ Days as the corporate beneficiaries of the Big War aligned with mainstream politicians of both major parties and coalesced into the Washington consensus Over the decades they have engaged in an ongoing struggle to maintain military spending at breathtakingly high levels and avoid any sort of transition to something called peace The two pillars of this consensus as Hartung points out are the ideology of armed exceptionalism that a shifting array of enemies are out there itching to destroy us but we will persist in our mission to maintain order in every corner of the planet and the strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and Congressional districts ensuring entrenched political power for the arms lobby So World War II initially as we know morphed into the Cold War Americas crusade against communism which was set into motion in 1950 by a longclassified report NSC68 prepared by the State and Defense departments and the CIA urging the vigorous containment of Soviet expansion and the development of the hydrogen bomb President Truman was somewhat taken aback at the costs associated with the reports recommendations according to historycom  and he hesitated to publicly support a program that would result in heavy tax increases for the American public particularly since the increase would be spent on defending the United States during a time of peace Peace What a nuisance But Thank God Korea came along as an aide to Secretary of State Dean Acheson put it at the time The Korean War gave the militarists the enemy they needed and the nuclear arms race and so much else was born The military budget was set for decades As Hartung points out the next terrible hurdle the budget boys faced was in the wake of the Vietnam War which ended in 1975 That war and the universal draft that essentially pulled the whole country into a frontrow seat for it spawned a passionate antiwar movement and ultimately a moldering national disgust for war known as Vietnam Syndrome The Cold War continued but the US military was confined to proxy wars for a while and had to rethink its strategy Two things happened The universal draft was ended removing most of the American middle class from a lifeanddeath stake in our military operations and Saddam Hussein our ally was recast as Adolf Hitler And in 1991 President George HW Bush embarked on a month of war with Iraq known as Operation Desert Storm Not only did the USwin this war and kill over 100000 Iraqis and ultimately cause hideous health problems for American soldiers but perhaps most importantly By God weve kicked the Vietnam Syndrome once and for all So the president proclaimed Unfortunately for the war consensus the Soviet Union dissolved a short time later and the Cold War ended    and a peace dividend loomed Hartung notes that Gen Colin Powell then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed the situation thus Im running out of demons Im running out of villains Im down to Castro and Kim Ilsung Would military spending be diverted to infrastructure repair free education universal health care Well no The Bill Clinton presidency found a few new demons It fought a war in Kosovo and on the domestic front vastly expanded the prisonindustrial complex Meanwhile the neocon think tanks cogitated and one of them the Project for a New American Century reflecting the fact that geopolitical thinking had stopped with World War II decided that what America needed was a new Pearl Harbor  And then came the presidency of George W Bush 911 and the Global War on Terror And the US military budget was carved seemingly in stone Barack Obama was elected president in 2008 on the promise of serious change but any hope that he intended to upend Ws wars was soon dispelled He dumped the name but kept the wars essentially settling for a noname global war Hartung writes He would shift gears from a strategy focused on large numbers of boots on the ground to an emphasis on drone strikes the use of Special Operations forces and massive transfers of arms to US allies like Saudi Arabia    One might call Obamas approach politically sustainable warfare And here we are immersed in a noname global war that has no logical end and few serious critics in the world of mainstream media and politics But maybe the American democracy is not the closed system its supposed to be For instance John Feffer  director of Foreign Policy in Focus points out that Donald Trump in all his funhouse recklessness is shaking up the consensus Democrats and Republicans disagree about many things But with a few exceptions they all support an enormous military budget an expensive overseas expeditionary force and unilateral acts of force when necessary to protect US national interests understood broadly Its an odd paradox that Trump who blathers on about making America great again departs from this consensus He wont win and he shouldnt win for a million reasons but in his recklessness he has touched the raw anger of a sizable chunk of the American electorate Sanders speaking with compassion and integrity and delivering a far different message managed to tap the same well of public outrage And as Feffer noted the mainstream is worried that the political parties will realize that the bring the war dollars home message can win a national election and disrupt the comfortable revolvingdoor consensus And World War II will finally end Not this year but maybe four years from now if we refuse to let the war consensus have any peace in the interim Robert Koehler is an awardwinning Chicagobased journalist and nationally syndicated writer His new book Courage Grows Strong at the Wound is now
