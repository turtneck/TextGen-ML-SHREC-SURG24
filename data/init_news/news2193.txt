Trump and Sanders get all the attention for their passionate support But supporters at a Hillary Clinton rally are passionate too  in their own wayAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealRetired deputy sheriff Debbie Boyd wears her support for Hillary Clinton at a rally at the University of California Riverside on WednesdayThe retired deputy sheriff wears a white straw hat on which a miniature Hillary Clinton doll sits surrounded by flowers and little American flags Red white and blue peace signs clatter around her neck and Hillary stickers adorn her cheeks She even carries around a picturebook biography of Mrs Clinton that she hopes to get autographedShe sends a message to little girls about what it means to be a leader says Ms Boyd a mother of two when asked what excites her about her candidateFew others standing in line for the Clinton rally at the University of California Riverside on Tuesday wear their support as overtly as Boyd a former Republican who switched parties to vote for Barack Obama in 2008 The orderly almost quiet scene outside the venue seems to illustrate one of the most persistent criticisms leveled against Clinton her lack of likability expressed in part by a relative disinterest among her supportersAnd when placed beside the more outspoken advocates for Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders  some of whom came to the Tuesday rally to protest Clintons candidacy  or the outrage that marks followers of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump Clinton voters do appear almost dispassionateBut none of that means the former secretary of State fails to inspire her supporters say To them the ability to excite and rile up a crowd is less important than experience a sense of respect and the skill to negotiate ones way out of a problem These voters say they choose to show their enthusiasm in less sensational ways whether its donating to Clintons campaign or encouraging others to educate themselves and turn out to voteIm not looking for someone to entertain me says Boyd as she squats on the grass to add tinsel to her Hillary poster Im looking for someone to lead this countryWhich isnt to say passion doesnt exist among Clinton supporters Inside the Johnson Family Practice Center at UCRiverside a current of anticipation runs through the gathering  an intimate affair that is typical of Clintons rallies When she at last appears just after 6 pm the crowd cheers waving campaignissued balloons and postersWe are very enthusiastic says Sebastiano Grasso a local artist dismissing any suggestion that Clinton is unable to galvanize her supporters Were just not punching people yelling at peopleOthers like Carrie Lucas say they show their enthusiasm with actions not words Ms Lucas a ballroom dancing instructor from Corona Calif says she donates to the Clinton campaign with every paycheckI put my money where my mouth is she saysDenise Davis a school administrator at the University of Redlands defends Clintons ability to move her constituencyIf youve ever seen her live in person shes completely energizing Ms Davis says recalling how she managed to convince her mother to vote for Clinton over President Obama in the 2008 Democratic primariesShe went to see Hillary speak and thats what swayed her decisionBut Daviss support for the former secretary of State goes beyond optics To her Clintonembodies progress that is earned over decadesShes very much interested in progressive social change and shes in a position to make that change happen Davis says She would be the first female president  thats huge in itself But she has the best ability to make change happenThats what fires me about herLikability was not always a criterion for electability Indeed the Founding Fathers would be horrified by the modern presidential campaign Slates John Dickerson noted in 2012In their day he wrote no man worthy of the presidency would ever stoop to campaigning for itParticularly since the advent of television however the charm factor has haunted many a losing candidateTheres an assumption that the candidate you want to win is the candidate you prefer to hang out with says Jennifer Lawless director of the Women and Politics Institute at American Universitys School of Public Affairs in Washington It becomes a cue for whether or not you trust this person whether theyll understand people like you whether theyll have your interests at stake whether they get what its like to be a real American living in this country right now Its all rolled up in this term called likability I dont think Hillary Clinton  comes off as a warm and fuzzy person you want to hang out with after work she saysAnd it shows at least in the polls As of midMay only 402 percent of Americans saw Clinton as a favorable candidate according to the Huffington Post which tracks data from more than 400 surveys nationwide Mr Trump is doing just worse with 387 percent of voters viewing him as favorable in the same period The figures represent some of the lowest favorability ratings for presidential candidates in American historyFor Clinton the problem is that its hard from the outside to think of any noncareer or precareer aspect to her life writes New York Times columnist David Brooks Except for a few grandma references she presents herself as a rsum and policy brief Its hard from the outside to have a sense of her as a person she is a roleYet the folks at the Clinton rally on Tuesday applaud her rational approach saying they support her precisely because she is about her work and not her celebrityShe has done so much for this country says Earlene Freeman a retired registered nurse as she leans on her walker She will better represent the values that I have she wants people to reach their potentialAnd its time for a woman to be president she saysClintons younger supporters seem to be thinking along similar linesHer approach is very analytical says Callie Scoggins a senior at Redlands East Valley High School about a halfhour drive from Riverside She wont be quick to do something without considering the consequencesWhat it comes down to adds Tyler Washington a new graduate at Riverside is that the other candidates are like the tooth fairy or Santa Claus offering magical rewards Clinton is like the mom telling you to eat your vegetablesThat may not make her likable he says but those thinking with their brains understand whats more importantWe dont need a slogan adds Mr Grasso the artist We need solutions
