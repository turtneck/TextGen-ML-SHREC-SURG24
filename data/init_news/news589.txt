First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matterAfter bombshell does the remarkably stable 16 race stay stableTheres no hyperbole in stating that the 2016 Hillary ClintonvsDonald Trump presidential race has been the craziest weve covered Consider all of the jawdropping moments Mexican rapists WikiLeaks Vladimir Putin The Access Hollywood video Alicia Machado Trumps visit to Mexico Basket of Deplorables Birtherism And the debates  all of them Despite them all however the race has been remarkably stable Just look at the national NBCWSJ poll numbers since Sept 2015But does that stability change after FBI Director James Comeys bombshell Friday that his organization learned of the existence of new emails that appear pertinent to its previous investigation into Clintons email practices One the one hand the polling weve seen  so far  suggests that voters remain in their partisan corners According to this weekends Washington PostABC poll 63 of voters said the FBIs review makes no difference And among the 34 who say it makes them less likely to back Clinton those voters are disproportionately Republicans and GOPleaning independents Whats more the postComey polls weve seen here and here havent really budged at least not yet On the other hand it has never been a positive for Clinton throughout this entire presidential race when the focus has been on her especially on the subject of emails Eight days to goThe latest developments in the Comey SurpriseMeanwhile here are all of the latest developments in the Comey Surprise The FBI obtained a warrant to search emails related to the probe of Hillary Clintons private server that were discovered on excongressman Anthony Weiners laptop Also on Sunday Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections Former Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a scathing oped condemning FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI And NBCs Ari Melber has a piece concluding that newly discovered emails  even if they contain classified information  would unlikely change the earlier conclusion not to charge ClintonFBIs review of the emails could be quickAdditionally NBCs Pete Williams reports that its possible the FBIs review of the emails could end quickly  now that the FBI obtained a warrant to search them Theyll narrow them down to look at just those dating from the time Hillary Clinton was secretary of state Then theyll weed out any that are not about government business Agents will use automated software to search whats left for duplicates theyve already found during the investigation of the Clinton email server Any that remain will be checked for classified information Williams reported on Today this morning Officials say theres no way to tell how long that will take But they say if it goes quickly and nothing classified is found the FBI could say so within the next few days It largely depends on how many of the emails are duplicates and how many are new to the investigatorsNBCWSJMarist polls Clinton up in

other events Still dont miss this Washington Post piece into Trumps charitable giving or lack thereof For as long as he has been rich and famous Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away It was in large part a facade A monthslong investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trumps boasts about his philanthropy Instead throughout his life in the spotlight whether as a businessman television star or presidential candidate The Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given  or had claimed other peoples giving as his ownHow violence and retaliation are constant themes in Trumps rhetoricAlso do read NBCs Benjy Sarlin on how violence and retaliation are common themes in Trumps rhetoric and in his events In his eyes the world is an unforgiving place where cities are war zones where rapists are streaming across the border and where jealous rivals are hatching plots to humiliate America and Trump personally To prevail in such an environment he suggests the response to any slight must be swift and overwhelming Dwelling on limits imposed by law or tradition is usually a secondary concern This framework has expressed itself in policy in which Trump has extolled the use of torture threatened reprisals against the families of terrorists and pledged to jail Clinton a former senator and secretary of state It has expressed itself rhetorically in vicious insults against critics and in his encouragement of violence by supportersFirst Reads downballot race of the day Florida SenateMarco Rubio rode to Republicans rescue
