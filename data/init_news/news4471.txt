Seeking to put the most difficult stretch of his campaign behind him Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump used a major economic speech Monday to reach out to two voting blocs that remain critical to his faltering chances of winning in November traditional fiscal conservatives and disaffected bluecollar workersBut Trump faced a new round of resistance from within his party that threatened to stall his effort to move beyond the uproar he caused last week In an opinion column published by The Washington Post late Monday Sen Susan Collins Maine became the latest sitting Republican senator to declare that she will not support Trump In addition dozens of national security officials who served in GOP administrations signed a letter saying that he is not qualified to be presidentReading from a teleprompter at the Detroit Economic Club and pausing calmly when protesters interrupted him Trump assailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and cast himself as the only change candidate on economic issues He did so in part with taxcutting regulationcurbing plans that are squarely mainstream in his party and in part with his nowfamiliar attacks on the forces of globalization that have unnerved many workers He took swipes at freetrade deals championed by GOP leaders and attacked immigrants and refugeesThe Republican nominee shared few new policy details and continued to offer no specifics for how he would pay for tax cuts or spending increases large enough to balloon the federal budget deficit He promised more clarity in coming weeksTrump proposed a new set of individual income tax rates higher than he previously suggested but he also promised to bring rates lower than they were even during the George W Bush administration He was vague in other areas including a promise for major federal infrastructure spending and another the only new policy proposal in the speech that would allow working families to deduct child carecosts from their federal income taxesThroughout his address Trump took sharp aim at Clinton He held up Detroit which has been devastated by manufacturing job losses as the living breathing example of her failed economic agendaI want to jumpstart America It can be done And it wont even be that hard he saidAt a rally in St Petersburg Fla Clinton assailed Trumps plan as an outdated replica of previous Republican pitches saying it would give superbig tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy and basically just repackage trickledown economicsShe added You know that old saying Fool me once shame on you Fool me twice shame on meJust imagine Donald Trump in the Oval Office facing a real crisis she said What happens when somebody gets under his skin I dont know if the United States can afford that kind of riskOn income taxes the business mogul said he would work with House Republicans to implement the three brackets they have proposed 12percent 25percent and 33percent The move puts Trump in line with Speaker Paul D Ryan Wis with whom Trump has had a tense alliancePreviously Trump proposed tax brackets of 0percent 10percent 20percent and 25percent He continued to call for a 15percent corporate income tax rate for all businesses which is lower than Ryans proposed 20percent corporate rateTrump also promised to end some special interest tax breaks but named only one the carried interest provision that many investment fund managers use to reduce their tax liability Experts cautioned though that Trumps plan would still deliver a windfall to such investors because it would reduce income and corporate ratesLacking more details from the campaign it is difficult to say how much Trumps revisions to his tax rates would alter the cost of his economic plan which analysts had previously estimated could reduce federal revenue by 10trillion over the next decade Equally difficult to measure are the benefits the plan would deliver to taxpayers across income levelsIt seems very likely that this version of the plan will lose less revenue than the last version because it will contain relatively smaller tax cuts for individuals Scott Greenberg an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation said in an interview A key question he added is the level at which various marginal tax rates begin to take effect A tax plan where the 33percent rate kicks in at 250000 and one where it kicks in at 750000 are two very different tax plansTrumps economic focus followed a week in which he stoked tensions with party leaders by initially declining to endorse Ryan and Sen John McCain Ariz in their primaries this month Trump also drew widespread ire for criticizing the Muslim parents of a US Army captain who was killed in Iraq and he fell dramatically behind Clinton in public pollsThe measured prewritten remarks in Detroit on Monday were intended to steady a listing campaign and conservatives received the calls for tax and regulation cuts positively But most reaction to the speech even among conservatives was mixed In the end Monday served as a reminder that many Republicans remain highly skeptical of TrumpLanhee Chen who was the policy director for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 called the speech a mixed bag He praised the details on taxes as a nod to more orthodox Republican views but he said Trumps main challenge now is to prove to voters that he is as serious about policymaking as he is about picking fights with criticsOne speech is not going to change a narrative Chen saidAlso Monday a group of 50 former national security officials who served under Republican presidents signed a letter warning that Trump would be the most reckless President in American historyThe letter was signed by Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge former secretaries of homeland security Michael V Hayden a former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency and John D Negroponte a former director of national intelligence and deputy secretary of state among othersFormer GOP national security officials Trump would be most reckless American president in historySeparately Wadi Gaitan the chief spokesman for the Florida Republican Party announced that as a result of differences with Trump he is leaving his job to join a conservative organizationIm thankful for my almost two years with the Florida GOP however moving on gives me a great new opportunity to continue promoting free market solutions while avoiding efforts that support Donald Trump Gaitan who is Hispanic said in a statementIn Detroit protesters sidetracked Trumps speech repeatedly Unlike in large rallies where Trump often calls for demonstrators to be removed riling up the crowd he waited patiently as they were escorted out Monday At one point he remarked calmly This is all very wellplanned outHis speech outlined a plan designed to accelerate economic growth largely in classic conservative fashion by reducing taxes and regulations on businesses and by opening vast new swaths of federal land and water to drilling He said that as president he would sign an executive order creating a temporary regulatory moratorium on new agency regulationsI am going to cut regulations massively he said MassivelyFreezing all pending federal regulations would include many Wall Street regulations created by the DoddFrank legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis Trumps energy agenda would open new sections of American coastal waters to offshore oil drilling and sweep away the Obama administrations efforts to fight climate change Both moves have frequently found widespread support among Republican lawmakers and in conservative policy circlesIn other areas he skirted or defied Republican orthodoxy Trump made no attempt to propose spending cuts or other measures to offset his proposed taxrate cuts or begin to reduce the national debt as he has promised to do in the past His childcare expense plan could increase the debt even further unless it were offset by spending cuts or a rapid increase in economic growth So could an infrastructure spending plan that he has said could cost more than 500billionIvanka Trump champions working moms  except the ones who design her clothesThe plan also promises to increase growth by reducing the United States trade deficit with China and other trading partners in part by levying tariffs on imported goods from those countries Some economists including Trump adviser Peter Navarro say that reducing the trade deficit would boost growth Others including Mark Zandi of Moodys Analytics warn that a tariff war could push the United States and much of the world into recessionTrump has adopted hardline opposition to sweeping trade agreements arguing that they have hurt American workers He reiterated his commitment to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and withdrawing from the TransPacific Partnership He singled out President Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA and accused the accord of moving US jobs abroad He said a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPPThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States Trump saidAs secretary of state Clinton praised TPP But in the Democratic primary she abandoned her support for the agreement Most congressional Republicans support the multination pactAnne
