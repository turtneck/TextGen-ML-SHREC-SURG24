The United States and Cuba have taken major steps to end their 50 years of hostility and some researchers think Americans could reap an unexpected benefit better access to Cuban medical innovationsThe US may be the world leader in basic cancer research biotechnology and treatment explained Marga Gual Soler who studies science diplomacy But Cuba has built a universal free and public health care system and has the highest number of medical doctors per capita in the world a robust biotechnology industry developed with very low resources and guaranteed access to drugs and advanced diagnostics for the populationOne of the first diplomatic exchanges involved Cimavax a lung cancer vaccine first developed in Cuba But it doesnt work for prevention like a traditional vaccine instead it stimulates the immune system in a different way to stop cancers from growing in people who already have the disease Researchers down there found that the vaccine increased survival rates and had few side effects in patients with latestage diseaseTheres reason to be cautious US studies will need to replicate these findings in order to meet federal regulatory standards And its still a long way from clinical trials to being widely available for patientsFor now scientists are excited about the possibility  and the exchange raises questions about how a political shift might spur medical innovationTo learn more I spoke to Dr Kelvin Lee of Buffalos Roswell Park Cancer Institute Lee helped lead Americas collaboration with Havanas Center of Molecular Immunology which discovered the vaccine Here he explains why he thinks Cimavax is particularly promising and why hes so enthusiastic about more CubaUS medical exchangesJulia Belluz How did your exchanges with the Cubans change how you think about medical innovation coming out of thereKelvin Lee Everybody believes Cuba is this country stuck in the 1950s without realizing that the reason Cuban biotech is so innovative is because Cuba as a country has put a very high priority on health care The public health care metrics are comparable to the US in terms of longevity and infant mortality Cuba punches way above its weight Because it is economically constrained it has to be extraordinarily innovativeMany people think what Cuba has to offer the US is rum cigars and baseball players They have two other anticancer vaccines in addition to Cimavax that are equally exciting but earlier in development They also have a monoclonal antibody called Nimotuzumab to treat brain cancer The US has monoclonal antibodies that target colon and lung cancers However those antibodies cause a fair amount of toxicity Nimotuzumab does not have those side effects so its applicable for pediatric patients Theyve used it in pediatric brain cancer We dont have anything we can give to kids safely Thats another drug wed be very interested in seeingJB So how did the warming of relations between the US and Cuba impact bringing Cimavax hereKL We got the license to import it but what we needed were manufacturing documents from the Center for Molecular Immunology that described how the vaccine was manufactured what quality control measures were taken etc This is 1000 pages the FDA needs to reviewA trade mission last year allowed us to go down there and sign the agreements to move the documents forward So the mission finalized the last piece and allowed us to march into clinical trials This was one of the biggest obstacles for us Many people think what Cuba has to offer the US is rum cigars and baseball players Through the trade mission many realized the biotech sector in Cuba is really remarkableJB This vaccine is being called a revolutionary lung cancer vaccine But its actually more a treatment than what we typically think of as a vaccine Can you explain exactly what Cimavax doesKL This vaccine has been developed by the Center for Molecular Immunology in Havana Theyve been developing it since the late 1990s and have done a lot of interesting clinical trials including a large phase 3 randomized controlled trial in 405 patients in Cuba The patients had advancedstage lung cancer primarily because thats their No 1 cancer burden in Cuba and they dont have anything else other than firstline chemotherapy Now it has been approved by the Cuban FDA for the treatment of lung cancerThe vaccine is made out of a manmade protein that is called epidermal growth factor This is a protein your body normally produces and it helps support the growth of normal cells like skin cells It can also help cancer cells grow In those cells that become cancerous this vaccine initiates an immune response against the epidermal growth factor protein thus depleting an important thing the cancer needs to grow and survive So the cancer cant grow anymore  JB Could this method be applied to vaccines for other types of cancers or used for cancer preventionKL Our Cuban colleagues have not tested that because theyre economically constrained Theyve only tested it in the No 1 cancer burden in Cuba lung cancer and they havent had the resources to do clinical trials in other types of cancer Well study thatCan it be used in prevention We already know patients that have earlystage lung cancer can get their cancers removed We also know many are smokers who have damaged their lungs all over the place and have precancerous lesions all over their lungs They have a very high risk of relapse with a second lung cancer We think the real potential for this vaccine is we can reduce the risk of relapse in this patient populationOne can think even further If we develop an algorithm to predict a persons lung cancer risk we could potentially vaccinate the very highestrisk cohorts to try to reduce their risk of lung cancer That patient population is potentially in the millions especially if you go worldwideJB How far are we away from this vaccine reaching the USKL Cuba has done the phasethree studies the final preapproval phase studies to confirm safety and effectiveness and there are other phase 3 studies going on internationally in lung cancer But there has been no experience in the US because of embargo issuesSo we are predicting that the FDA is going to ask for a phase 1 study which will test the drug in healthy people to confirm its safe in the US just to replicate the safety data that our Cuban colleagues already reported Once we get through that we anticipate we wont see very much toxicity or anything different from whats been reported After that phase 1 study well move on to other phase 1 studies in prevention and potentially in other cancersWe will be filing an investigational drug application with the FDA Hopefully we can get that document together and submitted this springOn a parallel track we have two clinical trials that are in the institutional approval process here at Roswell Park We are hoping to get those approved within the same time frame That would mean we have trials here opening at the end of this year
