The British security firm Serco has moved a step closer to entering the controversial but lucrative immigration detention market in the US as the company successfully lobbied public officials in a small Texas county near the Mexico border to propose that the federal government open a family detention centre in the jurisdictionThe billiondollar company implicated in numerous immigration detention centre scandals in the UK and Australia has been lobbying the US government for more than a year in an effort to win detention contracts sparking sustained criticism from immigrant rights groupsThe firm is now proposing that a shuttered nursing home in Jim Wells County Texas be reopened as a family detention centre which could hold up to 600 detainees and would become the third privately managed centre in the United StatesThe Obama administrations use of family detention centres that hold children and mothers has become one of the most contested elements of Americas border protection programSerco representatives first approached officials in the county last month as the company ramped up its lobbying efforts following an open pitching invitation announced by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ice in April On Monday following a closeddoor session between Serco lobbyists and the countys five commissioners the local government body voted to partner with Serco and pitch the proposal to IceThe company has employed a number of experienced lobbyists in America including a former senior Ice staff member Kate Mills and has already listed a job opening for a communications and logistics staff member close to the proposed centre in the event of a contract awardJudge Pedro Trevino Jr the presiding member of the Jim Wells commissioners court told the Guardian that Serco indicated up to 200 local jobs could be created at the centre The county with just over 40000 residents has had a spike in unemployment following the decline of the oil and gas industry in the region with the poverty rate climbing to 20 according to census dataPeople are most interested in the jobs it would create said Trevino of the countys reaction to the proposed deal adding that county attorneys were continuing to research the proposal wary of the controversy it could bringWe know family detention centres are highly controversial and we want to put all our ducks in a row and gather facts before we make our final decisionAlthough Ice opened an information pitching round designed for market research purposes it has not yet confirmed if it will move on to receive formal proposals from potential family detention contractorsThere are several formalities that have to transpire with the request for proposals before we can begin to discuss an Ice public affairs officer told the GuardianAbout 38000 people were apprehended crossing the USMexico border in April alone including more than 10000 unaccompanied children and family units according to US Customs and Border Patrol This is the highest number since a surge in arrivals in June 2014 and will add pressure to the already strained detention networkReports have also indicated that the Obama administration is planning raids that could lead to the detention and deportation of more Central American mothers and children who entered the country illegallySerco has operated the Yarls Wood immigration removal centre in the UK since 2007 and endured a string of abuse allegations including that members of staff sexually assaulted female detainees In Australia where Serco operates all of the countrys mainland immigration detention facilities under a multibilliondollar contract the company has suffered sustained criticism after riots have broken out in centres on Christmas Island dozens of detainees have selfharmed and others have made sexual assault allegations against staffTheir actual track record is very different to what they say to people here in the US said Mohammad Abdollahi director of advocacy for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services notforprofit group in Texas There is no right way to detain families but they have shown around the world everything that is wrong with how you do itSerco has international experience of managing immigration facilities We are committed to looking after all those in our care with trust and respect said a US spokesman for the company in an emailed statement that confirmed Sercos presence in Jim Wells CountyThe centre would be the corporations first in the United States completing a triangle of family detention centers in south Texas where Geo Group operates the 679bed Karnes County Residential Center and Corrections Corporation of America runs the 2400bed Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley The only family facility outside of the state is a 96bed facility in Pennsylvania that is operated by Berks County under an agreement with IceMost of the women and children held at the three facilities are seeking refugee status and asylum amid a humanitarian crisis in El Salvador Guatemala and HondurasLutheran Immigration and Refugee Services which operated a pilot alternative to detention program last year says it found that housing the families in a less restrictive setting was a more costeffective way to ensure they attended their immigration court hearingsWe saw that people seeking asylum have a huge stake in finishing the process that could give them a chance to potentially rebuild their life and live here in safety said Brittney Nystrom LIRS director for advocacy We are creating additional trauma and pouring money down the drain
