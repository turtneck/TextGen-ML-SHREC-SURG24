reasons were for throwing rocks at police but I know all of this affected himAmong the similarities between Ferguson Missouri and Pasco are racial disparities between the citys residents and local government Pasco is nearly 56 percent Hispanic but its local government isnt representative of the citys racial makeup the New York Times reportedThe same was true in Ferguson following the August 9 police shooting of Michael Brown The St Louis suburb is 67 percent black but at the time of the Brown shooting the mayor and police chief were white just one of six city council members was black zero school board members were black and only three out of 53 commissioned police officers were black according to the Los Angeles TimesThe ZambranoMontes shooting fanned tensions between the local Hispanic community and city government Hundreds of protesters marched in the week following ZambranoMontes death with some voicing concerns that their own children could be killed by police In response the Pasco Police Department claimed its working to recruit more Hispanic officersSimilar protests now under the banner of Black Lives Matter came about following several police killings of black boys and men in 2014 In Ferguson former police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown an unarmed 18yearold In Ohio police killed 22yearold John Crawford and 12yearold Tamir Rice in two separate shootings after mistaking toy guns for actual weapons In New York City NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Eric Garner by putting the unarmed 43yearold black man in a chokeholdThe most reliable data on police shootings gathered by the FBI through local and state agencies is extremely limited  to the point that some criminal justice experts disavow analyzing it altogether  since its based on voluntary selfreporting But the data is especially limited for Hispanic victims of police shootingsSamuel Walker a retired criminal justice professor from the University of Nebraska at Omaha said theres no research on how many Hispanic victims are left out of police shooting data but he has reason to believe theyre undercountedWalker pointed out that other parts of the criminal justice system sometimes classify Hispanic people as white likely overestimating the number of nonHispanic white people shot and killed by police and underestimating Hispanic victims In many cases determinations of race and ethnicity are made by lowlevel officials potentially leading to even more errors based on perceptions and prejudices regarding raceFlorida the state with the third largest Hispanic population is entirely excluded from the FBIs national tally of police shootings further skewing the numbersIn short Walker wrote in an email we have no reliable data on HispanicLatino people shot and killed by the policeTwo Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s Tennessee vs Garner andGraham v Connor set the legal framework for determining when deadly force by cops is reasonableConstitutionally police officers are allowed to shoot under two circumstances David Klinger a University of MissouriSt Louis professor who studies law enforcement officers use of force said in August The first circumstance is to protect their life or the life of another innocent party  referred to as the defenseoflife standard by police departments The second circumstance is to prevent a suspect from escaping but only if the officer has probable cause to think the suspect poses a dangerous threat to othersThe logic behind the second circumstance Klinger explained comes from Tennessee vs Garner That case involved a pair of police officers who shot a 15yearold boy as he fled from a burglary Hed stolen 10 and a purse from a house The court ruled that cops couldnt shoot every felon who tried to escape But as Klinger said they basically say that the job of a cop is to protect people from violence and if youve got a violent person whos fleeing you can shoot them to stop their flightwhat matters is the officers objectively reasonable belief that there is a threatThe key to both of the legal standards  defenseoflife and stopping a fleeing violent felon  is that it doesnt matter whether there is an actual threat when force is used Instead what matters is the officers objectively reasonable belief that there is a threatThat standard comes from the other Supreme Court case that guides useofforce decisions Graham v Connor This was a civil lawsuit brought by a man who survived his encounter with police officers but was treated roughly had his face shoved into the hood of a car and broke his foot  all while suffering a diabetic attack The court didnt rule on whether the officers actions had been justified but said police couldnt justify their conduct solely based on whether their intentions were good They had to demonstrate that their actions were objectively reasonable given the circumstances and compared to what other police officers might doWhats objectively reasonable changes as the circumstances change One cant just say Because I could use deadly force 10 seconds ago that means I can use deadly force again now Walter Katz a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies said in AugustIn the case of ZambranoMontes the legal questions are whether he was actually fleeing after he turned around and whether he posed an imminent threat to the officers or others which police could substantiate if he was throwing rocks at officers as they allege
