First we were told that a Russian hacker had broken into the Democratic National Committees computers and gotten hold of its oppo file on Donald TrumpNow someone who goes by Guccifer 20 a nod to the shadowy Romanian hacker is claiming credit for putting the Trump file out there Gawker and the Smoking Gun both published the report yesterdayBut what I find so amusing is that the opposition research file is hardly filled with secret stuff the product of private eyes digging up dirt or hiredgun sleuths poring over documents This supposed treasure trove submitted in December consists mainly of published articles and televised segmentsIn other words its all out there You can Google it Any reasonably sentient media consumer would know this stuff Its what we in the journalism racket call a clip jobTrump is Loyal only to HimselfTrumps Business Have Gone into Bankruptcy Several TimesHe Has Devalued and Demeaned Women Repeatedly Throughout His CareerOut of TouchHandOuts for the Wealthy at the Expense of the Middle ClassAnd the sources Wall Street Journal AP Politico Washington Post Forbes etcTrump for his part isnt buying the DNC explanation that this is the work of some nefarious outside hacker Much of it is false andor entirely inaccurate he says in a statement We believe it was the DNC that did the hacking as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader Too bad the DNC doesnt hack Crooked Hillarys 33000 missing emailsNow that sounds farfetched as well Not only is there nothing new here but no one can absorb 200 pages at once Why not dribble out the attacks package them as talking points put them in attack ads rather than create a bogus hacking story and dump it all out there Or dress it up with some narrative and release it as a reportWhat we have here whether it was done by Guccifer 20 or whoever is a 21stcentury Watergate Instead of burglars breaking into DNC headquarters a crime that led to the downfall of Richard Nixons presidency we have cyberwarfare against DNC computers only aimed at the de facto Republican nominee and winding up in the nowbankrupt sextapepublishing Gawker rather than the Washington PostSimply vacuuming up negative material on a candidate doesnt work in todays cluttered media environment Trump has been awash in negative media reports since he got into the race one year ago The trick to getting traction is by packaging some of the stuff in a way that it sticksas the Democrats successfully did to Mitt Romney and the Republicans to John KerryInstead the oppo file itself has become newsin a fleeting way that guarantees it will quickly become nonnewsHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
