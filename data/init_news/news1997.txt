Of course all the contenders genuflected at the memory of Reagan while trashing President Obamas Iran deal  yet nobody mentioned Reagans role in bolstering the Iranian hardliners by violating an embargo to sellthem arms in exchange for help to the Nicaraguan contras and a possible hostage releaseWe learned as well that when it comes to Donald Trump vs the right wing media its Trump 2 conservative media personalities 0 Just like Trump got Fox to bow to him after he savaged Megyn Kelly following the last debate he humiliated radio host Hugh Hewitt  unbelievably a panelist at this CNN debate  by getting Hewitt to say that it wasnt Trumps fault that he confused the Kurds with the Quds force It was my fault Hewitt told MSNBCs Morning Joe and he seconded that Thursday nightHewitt also lobbed a softball question to Trump which he actually kind of flubbed giving him a chance to blast President Obamas Syria policy and some of his 2016 rivals for not supporting military intervention in 2013 It looked as if Trumps campaign against Hewitt as a thirdrate radio host asking gotcha questions  backed by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter  actually workedOh if youre waiting for me to tell you definitively who won the debate and who might begin to rise or fall in the polls as a result Im sorry I really have no idea Dr Ben Carson looked like he confused his OneADay vitamin with Lunesta he was barely able to keep his eyes open and talked in sleepy nonsequiturs But I thought Carson blew the last debate and he rose in the polls So what do I knowJeb Bush clearly had another mediocre night which he cant afford He came out kind of peppy  even Trump praised his energy  and accused Trump of exactly the kind of special interest lobbying he rails against saying the real estate mogulgave him money back when he ran for governor and then unsuccessfully lobbied to place casinos in Florida But Trump denied it and loudly talked over Bush there was brief confusion about whether the former governor was telling the truth PolitiFact later confirmed it and the moment fadedLikewise Bush was later given a chance by CNNs Jake Tapper to call Trump out on a Twitter insult to Bushs Mexicanborn wife Columba Bush started strong demanding an apology but then faded again as Trump filibusteredBut Bushs worst moment was when Hewitt asked him  in another kindness to Trump  about the fact that a lot of his foreign policy advisors worked for his brother the last GOP president who got us into disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Trump then jabbed Bush  Your brother and your brothers administration gave us Barack Obama  which led Bush to retort My brother kept us safe As if he didnt remember his brother was president during the Sept 11 attacks It was that kind of night for JebTrump didnt have a great night either but he has one thing in common with Reagan  so far hes seemed to share an impermeable outer political coating with the Teflon president He engaged in a juvenile spat with Rand Paul early on that ended in his insulting Pauls looks and looking kind of silly Carly Fiorina absolutely owned him when she was asked about the episode when Trump clearly insulted her appearance  Look at that face he told Rolling Stone Would anyone vote for that  then insisted he was actually talking about her personaWomen all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said Fiorina shot back I think shes got a beautiful face and I think shes a beautiful woman Trump countered with characteristic sexism but looking uncharacteristically sheepish This was an establishment crowd heavy on donors and they were tougher on Trump than the Fox audience was Perhaps most damaging Trump himself seemed relatively lowenergy  his constant jibe against Bush He told reporters later that it was his attempt at looking presidential but whatever he was much less a factor than in the last GOP goround Still pundits have predicted Trumps decline before including after his boorish performance in the last debate and theyve been wrong Trump himself crowed about a Drudge Report poll showing him the winner of the debate again That poll was right last time so who knows Once again lots of the punditocracy claimed Sen Marco Rubio was one of the debate winners but thats crazy The young Florida senator fell flat on his face with an early joke about the California drought I brought my own water he said with a big dumb smile That was a twofer He made fun of a local tragedy on a day when the death toll of the states droughtfueled wildfires continued to mount and he reminded everyone of his humiliating biggulp moment when he got to reply to Obamas State of the Union address two years ago When Trump dinged Rubio  accurately  for having the worst absentee record in the Senate Rubio essentially defended it by saying Congress isnt getting anything done So he stopped doing his job because it was frustrating In the real world hed get fired Score one for Trump Anyway lots of smartish folks thought Rubio did well in the last debate to0 but he went nowhere in the polls Fiorina probably had the best night  if you dont fact check anything she said She flat out lied about what the doctored bogus Planned Parenthood videos showed claiming they featured a still living intact aborted fetus killed for its organs when they did no such thing When she insisted shed call Irans Supreme Leader to call off the recent nuclear deal on her first day as president the CNN moderators missed a chance to ask her why as CEO of Hewlett Packard she skirted antiIran sanctions rather like the nights patron saint Ronald Reagan  and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment to the antiUS regime She was allowed to misrepresent her awful HP record and inaccurately trash Hillary Clinton on Benghazi and her controversial email practices Still shes a poised practiced debater and she may get another small bump in the polls I dont think any of the rest including the occasionally statesmanlike John Kasich did enough last night to significantly change their campaign standing Gov Scott Walker was a bit more energetic but probably didnt make enough of an impressionto reverse his sinking fortunes Sen Ted Cruz and Gov Mike Huckabee continued stridently narrowcasting to the farright evangelical community which might matter if Trump suddenly left the field But the twice divorced libertine billionaire and bornagain Republican is leading among that group too Whoops I havent mentioned the pumped up inauthentic Its not about me guys flailing New Jersey Gov Chris Christie Oh well Now I have At any rate theseemingly interminable threehour debate  I accidentally typed threemonth debate because thats how it felt  worked against anyone who had a good moment or two Still remember that most postdebate predictions were wrong last time Once again we learned that the GOP has moved far to the right of Ronald Reagan  but little else
