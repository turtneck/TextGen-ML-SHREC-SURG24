WASHINGTON  The audience should have belonged to Sen Rand Paul After all the thousand or so cleancut millennials in the DCarea ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty a student group founded by Pauls father former Rep Ron PaulThe kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart collegedormroom disdain for government But he didnt fire them up Neither did Utah Sen Mike Lee the thoughtfulsounding son of a Reaganera US solicitor generalThe man who got them cheering who got them going who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was Sen Ted CruzStriding the stage like Elvis if Elvis had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law Cruz was the firebrand whom the conservageeks wanted to either meet or becomeThat was more than a year ago when the firstterm senator from Texas was still in the hardright afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain in both senses attempt to stop ObamacareBut the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the SystemAnd it is that emotion  acrosstheboard opposition to every liberal idea that exists and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations  that Cruz hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidencyUncorked anger doesnt usually win presidential nominations let alone presidencies People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage The president is the person who is supposed to make things workTo some the 44yearold Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace For now as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities such as Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and former Florida Gov Jeb BushThe first is that his angry approach may fit the times Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics  perhaps for that very reason  their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lowsCruz beat the establishment in Texas like a drum They hate him for it but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in yes TexasHe is as pure an acrosstheboard conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics culturally fiscally in monetary policy in foreign policyCruz is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues antiabortion a globalwarming megaskeptic to the right of Likud on Israel antiimmigration to the max big on defense spending etcHe is a libertarian traditional conservative war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castros Cuba There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Cruzs construct but he ignores them all
