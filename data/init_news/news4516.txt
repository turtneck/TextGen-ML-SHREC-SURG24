Six weeks before he was set to open Floridas first charter school Jeb Bush had yet to recruit a principal Then he met Katrina WilsonDavis a 32yearold social studies teacher with no management experience but a positive spirit that gave him hopeWe need someone who carries a knife in her teeth and can swing through the vines WilsonDavis recalls Bush telling her on that summer day in 1996Recovering from an egobruising election loss Bush was looking for chances to soften his image as a callous Republican who proclaimed he would do probably nothing as governor to help African Americans As a private citizen likely to run for governor again in 1998 Bush created the Liberty City Charter School as a way to educate black children from Miamis poorest neighborhoods The school would give him a way to mend ties with the black community while testing a controversial conservative education theory that was drawing the ire of teachers unionsMy friends told me I was being used WilsonDavis remembered She figured it was worth a try I said So Everyones being usedAs he runs for president nearly two decades later Bush points to his time working on the school as evidence of his early commitment to a reform agenda He has said the experience still shapes the way I see the deepseated challenges facing urban communities today He points to the schools opening as one of the happiest proudest moments of my lifeBut for WilsonDavis and others who walked the halls of Liberty City that happy moment has been obscured by the complicated years that have followedOver time Bushs tightknit relationship with the school and his handpicked principal fizzled After he won election as Florida governor in part by touting the school Bush stepped down from the board  a move his aides say avoided any perceptions of favoritism He was unable to help the school overcome steep debt or help it resolve a dispute with the buildings landlord By 2008 the year after Bush left office local officials voted to close the schoolAs Bush campaigns in Florida today to revive his struggling presidential campaign many in this beleaguered community wrestle with his legacy in their lives There are feelings of adoration and feelings of abandonment Many here wonder Why couldnt a man so well connected and powerful help raise money or strike a deal with a local landlord How could he step away from a cause that was so dear to himA project that intended to close the chasm between Bush and the black community ended up broadening the distance between themBushs presidential campaign  in which he has promised to broaden the Republican Partys appeal to minorities while on one occasion appearing to suggest that Democrats win black votes by offering free stuff  serves as a reminder of the two sides of the man they knewIts like Im reliving the sadness all over again WilsonDavis saidEveryone wants me to bash Jeb she added I cant just bash Jeb He did so much for me He introduced me to so many good people white people who cared about our communityBush in a recent interview said he could not have saved the school He had helped negotiate with the landlord early on but he said little could be done about the landlords desire to kick the school outThe problem is that they didnt own the school They tried to own the school Bush said But you cant operate a school if you dont have the real estateThe idea for a charter school in Liberty City stemmed from a new kinship between Bush and T Willard Fair a local black activistIn Fair head of the Urban League of Greater Miami Bush found his first full ally within Miamis black community Fair had been swayed by the probably nothing remark because he long believed black people needed to rely more on themselves not the government for their uplift It took only 90 minutes for them to agree to start the charter school which would be privately run but publicly fundedBush attempted to get another prominent local black activist to serve as principal school board member Frederica S Wilson She rebuffed his efforts but recommended WilsonDavis who always dreamed of being a principalI knew I could educate those children WilsonDavis said I know these children I was one of themIn an hour they agreed to work togetherBush knew he was asking WilsonDavis to take on a difficult task that would put her at the center of a intense political debate over the future of public schools But he had confidence in herShe had a heart for these kids he saidThe young black schoolteacher  granddaughter of sharecroppers and daughter of a cafeteria worker and a truck driver  gained a mentor and powerful friend who introduced her to the upper echelon of American politics and wealth The privileged white politician got a charismatic leader for his school who taught him to use bits of slang like off the chain He also got a useful anecdote for his next campaign and he doubled his share of the black voteSoon WilsonDavis was going to fancy parties with the son of a president Hillary Rodham Clinton first lady at the time invited her to the White House for a forum on education Youre now swimming with big fish WilsonDavis recalled someone telling her at a fundraiser for the school after which she wondered What have I gotten intoBush too was acclimating to a different kind of pond On Saturdays he drove from tony Coral Gables to a neighborhood of scraggy lots barbedwire fences and malls scarred by riots from nearly two decades beforeAt first Fair recalled Bush looked uncomfortable when he met young mothers in subsidized housing who were interested in his schoolIt was an extraordinary experience Bush saidSixty students enrolled in the school when it opened in August 1996When Bush would visit he would pat students on the head and call them by name They would try to scare him with pictures of alligators they drew and he dressed up as Santa Claus at Christmastime His mother Barbara Bush came to read Goodnight MoonTV cameras and reporters captured Bushs big experiment Educators and donors wanted tours The school was mocked by the teachers unions when it performed poorly on tests praised in the papers when it performed well The attention helped the school with its fundraising even as WilsonDavis tired of being a tour guideShe was more focused on intensive reading and math instruction and weekly positivereinforcement assemblies When she heard students arguing about whether zebras were donkeys with painted stripes she arranged a trip to the zoo Many children were being raised by their grandparents so WilsonDavis started a quilting night to connect the communityDont let me call your mama became one of WilsonDaviss bestknown threats to the students About a dozen former students contacted by The Washington Post recalled how she offered Jolly Rancher candies when students visited her office and kept a small mattress there in case anyone needed a napIt was really this custom education that was developed for the kids at the school that made us able to succeed said Maurice Jackson now 22Jackson who interned this summer at the White House said his views on school turned around after WilsonDavis placed him in moreadvanced classesBush was in the background as much as the foreground He was a strict taskmaster who could not stomach seeing so much as a wad of paper on the groundTrina he would say to WilsonDavis she recalled poor doesnt mean dirtyThe school received the same perpupil funding as traditional schools but additional expenses such as rent meant that teachers at first were paid less Bushs fundraising prowess helped but he warned that it would not last foreverHes a fiscally frugal guy so the goal was you have to learn how to operate with what the state gives you each year WilsonDavis recalledWhenever she asked for money she said Bush would lean in He would cross his legs look into her eyes and ask her whyHe taught me to trust myself WilsonDavis said He would say you can make mistakes but just not a lot of them because success was the only optionAs he walked through the school hall on the day after his successful 1998 election the cheerleading squad yelled Give me a B Give me a U Give me an S Give me an HI used to love seeing him and he was there so much said Michelle Turner now 25 who was captured by news photographers hugging Bush on that day in 1998But then Turner and others recall something changedIn later years I dont remember him being there at all Turner saidBush had left the board by 2000 two years after being elected governor but WilsonDavis continued to reach out to him often using email He would respond with brief words of encouragementI hope that you will find time to come by the school and see the children WilsonDavis wrote in July 2001i will try to make it Bush responded There was no indication whether he paid a visitIn January 2002 WilsonDavis bragged to him that the school was operating entirely from its state allotment after many years of prudent and fiscal conservatismBy 2006 though trouble was mounting The school incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt The growing importance of highstakes standardized tests pushed by Bush led to the school spending more on new textbooks And a devastating hurricane season in 2005 left the school with a leaky roof that she said the landlord was slow to fixYou know that I dont run to you for everything because I know that you have a whole state and the country to contend with WilsonDavis wrote to Bush on Oct 13 2006 I am in a position where I need some intervention and direction from YOUBush wrote back telling WilsonDavis that I will work on both issues He told her that as a public school you should receive the same benefits  that all public schools receiveBush attempted to connect her with FEMA according to emails that have been released publicly But WilsonDavis said she worried the process was moving too slowly Fearing for her students safety she used the schools money to fix the roofThe landlord Patrick Beauregard sued The repairs violated the lease and he wanted the school out Beauregard did not respond to several phone calls from The PostFair and WilsonDavis wondered Is it time to get Bush more involved Fair opposed the idea His reasoning Beauregard was black as were Fair and WilsonDavis Some racial lines he felt could not be crossedThere was nothing in the marrow of my bones that could allow me to ask some white man to bail me out for what a black man did Fair saidWilsonDavis reached out to Bush anyway She recalled Bush telling her that his hands were tied The 500000 debt was too much for him to recoup The legal fees continued to mount and debt grew to 1million Parents held walks and protests to generate attention but their efforts were futile They wondered what happened to their powerful founderAfter Bush left office in 2007 he made a lucrative reentry into the private sectorAsked at the time about the schools difficulties Bush told the Miami Herald I am not aware what this is aboutIn 2008 the county school board shut the school downWilsonDavis was so distraught she said that she could not bring herself to find work for two years One day she got a phone call from a concerned Wilson the former school board member who introduced her to Bush Wilson who was Bushs most ardent opponent when she was in the state legislature and today is a congresswoman had a new recommendation Grab your purse and start working againAs she discusses her experience with the school WilsonDavis likes to focus on the successes She estimated at least 85percent of her students graduated from high school and 40percent went on to collegeI dont think Bush was a racist or tried to pimp out these children that wasnt his heart WilsonDavis said But I think its a fair question for a community to want to hold him accountableEven so WilsonDavis retains warm feelings for Bush The last time WilsonDavis texted Bush was in 2011 She hoped to catch up with him during his trip to a majorityblack high school in Florida that was excelling on standardized testsThat day Bush was sitting in the front row of the auditorium with President Obama Security stopped her outside The room was so crowded with so many wellwishers that his past protge couldnt get inEd OKeefe Steven Rich and Alice Crites in Washington contributed to this report
