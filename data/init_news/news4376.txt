If Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump wind up in the general election we certainly will have a contest  for the lesstruthful and lessintouch candidate This weekend was a perfect example of two candidates who live in their own realityHillary Clinton in the debate Saturday night argued that Donald Trump was becoming ISISs best recruiter She insisted They are going to people showing them videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists There is no such video and her statement has been rated false by fact checkers Nevertheless her campaign team insists this is soNot to be outmatched in the fantasy department Trump is still insisting thousands of Muslims were celebrating 911 in New Jersey This too is false and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie has repeatedly said it did not happenScarily these candidates larger worldviews are at odds with reality as well Trump basks in the compliments of Russian President Putin and  incredibly  claims there is no evidence suggesting Putin killed journalists But in all fairness to Putin youre saying he killed people I havent seen that I dont know that he has Apparently he will buy into the notion that thousands of Muslims were celebrating 911 but insists on Putins fingerprints on the gun before acknowledging Putins hand in the deaths of scores of journalists Someone should tell Trump thatPutins regime also kills businessmens lawyersTrumps world is not so different fromthe farleft world in which the United Stateshas been the troublemaker Well take a look at  take a look at  excuse me take a look at the rampage all over the place and civil rights atrocities in dictatorial regimes around the globe are no big dealThen there is Hillary Clintons worldview in which the ObamaClinton foreign policy is a success Shes insisted the Russian reset worked In Saturdaysdebate she proclaimed We now finally are where we need to be We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS which is a danger to us as well as the region and we finally have a UN Security Council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria In its own way this is as stunning as Trumps nonfacts The presidents military advisers and secretary of defense acknowledge that the Islamic State is not contained Innocents have been slaughtered in Paris and San Bernardino Calif Russia and Iran are backing Bashar alAssad And the administration has stopped saying Assad must go The bloody civil war rages on Our Sunni Arab allies do not trust us We have helped revive the Iranian economy and in turn allowed Iran to redouble its support for Assad Hezbollah and others If she thinks a UN resolution is going to make things better she truly is in her own universeYes siree we are right where we want to beWe can only hope one or both parties finds someone to nominate grounded in reality For seven years we have had a president who imagines the world is as he wishes it to be who thought among other things The world would be improved if the United Statesreceded we shouldnt rock the boat by backing the Green Revolution there was a fatwa against nukes in Iran and without the United Statesas the dominant presence the Middle East we would do just fine Picking someone equally if not more delusional than President Obama will have serious implications for the United States and the world
