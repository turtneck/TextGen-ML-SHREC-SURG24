What Does Trumps Victory Mean For NATO NPR Charles flags the close which is an unusually pointed admission of the basis of our imperialist project Brexit Turkey is swiftly heading towards a regime of terror Bangkok Post furzy Trump Transition I am trying and hope you will help in comments in pulling the noise out of the signal regarding what Trump will actually do when he becomes President and whether it will succeed success consisting first of it being implemented and second making him and his Administration appear to be legitimate as in keeping campaign promises delivering tangible benefits to voters or powerful interest groups he needs on board Despite all the changes in messaging over the course of his campaign Trump was consistent on immigration trade and lack of infrastructure investment and depicted all three as ways to improve conditions for workers And political scientist Tom Ferguson says that the data shows that the propensity to vote for Trump was highly correlated with voters giving negative answers to questions like whether the economy or the job situation had gotten better Trump and Sanders found power lying in the street by virtue of both parities abandoning high employment levels and wage growth as major policy goals But if Trump is to deliver on his promise of delivering on those goals he is at odds with much of his own party which is keen to keep workers weak and preserve free trade the corporate Republicans particularly ones whose constituents include globalized businesses like autos for the obvious patronage reasons libertarians out of ideology Given that trade policy and immigration enforcement are areas in which the President has considerable latitude whether and how he engages in these fights will be early tests of whether he intends to and is able to execute Finally bear in mind that Trump not only has a thin bench staff wise but also intellectually Many of his sources of advice are ideologues who like the Brexiters in the UK may cheerily recommend changes which might sound ducky to them without having the foggiest clue that the operational implications are nightmarish For instance Im told the Trump transition team on policy is apparently planning on recommending that the US exit Nafta and the WTO on the first day of the Trump presidency Pray tell have they looked into what this means for US customs and for US exporters dealing with foreign customs In other words the right wing think tank types that the Trump team is relying on runs the risk of being as clueless about issues of organizational capacity as the Greeks were who thought they had a trump card pun intended in a Grexit for those new to Naked Capitalism we had an extensive series of posts on this topic see here  here and here for some examples So for instance see this BBC story Trump likes main Obamacare provisions very much  specifically covering preexisting conditions and letting children up to age 26 The story describes how the Republicans might oppose Trump Complicating the matter is that a revise and reform effort may not fly with Mr Trumps ardent supporters and the cadre of archconservative politicians in Congress who want to tear up the law root and branch Mr Trump often broke with Republican orthodoxy while campaigning and didnt pay a political price He may learn that as president he wont get far without his party establishments help In WSJ Interview Trump Says He Is Willing to Keep Parts of Health Law Wall Street Journal Note the heavy emphasis on job creation This had been the Democratic party lode star through the Carter era He also defines Pences job which is to help on health care and sell Trump policies to Congress This is similar to the role Joe Biden played And he rejected the Administration find those moderate Syrians strategy
