Admittedly the question is speculative but not without meritDuring the debates and in the heated final days of the campaign Donald Trump vowed to assign a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary and send her to jailIt was easily the highlight of the entire campaignBut when you talk about apology I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33000 emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missingAnd Ill tell you what I didnt think Id say this but Im going to say it and I hate to say it But if I win I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies so much deception There has never been anything like it and were going to have a special prosecutor When I speak I go out and speak the people of this country are furious In my opinion the people that have been longterm workers at the FBI are furious There has never been anything like this where emails  and you get a subpoena you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33000 emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say very expensive processSo were going to get a special prosecutor and were going to look into it because you know what People have been  their lives have been destroyed for doing onefifth of what youve done And its a disgrace And honestly you ought to be ashamed of yourself  source But now that victory has set in and the election is officially over can anybody expect that he will actually do itCertainly we must wait until he is inaugurated and has a chance to show what kind of president he will beHowever Trumps victory speech gives good reason to doubt the prospects for his actually assigning a special prosecutor against Hillary ClintonHe opened the speech with praise for Clinton and a call for unity  certainly a different chord for nowpresidentelect TrumpTRUMP Ive just received a call from Secretary Clinton APPLAUSE She congratulated us  its about us  on our victory and I congratulated her and her family on a very very hardfought campaign I mean she  she fought very hard Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country APPLAUSE I mean that very sincerely APPLAUSENow its time for America to bind the wounds of division have to get together To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united peopleCertainly there is something to be said for being a gracious winner  and for Trump proving to his critics that he wont be their worst nightmareBut what really accounts for the shift in toneLate in the evening John Podesta  top aide to Hillary thoroughly implicated in wickedness by Wikileaks  announced in essence that the campaign would not concede that they would wait until every last vote was countedClearly Team Hillary was fully prepared to challenge a recount to take it to court in every venue possible Al Gore did so and with good cause and she could tooHillary and her campaign had every opportunity to deny Trump easy victory even when there was no real chance left for herAnd yet shortly after Podestas announcement Trump gave his victory speech noting a call from Hillary Clinton herself in which she conceded  but on what termsThough it is admittedly speculative  can anyone else claim to know what was said during that call  it is entirely possible that the primary demand for her swift admission of defeat was that any and all possibility of prosecution and investigation for her sordid and illegal activities be taken off the tableDid Hillary make THAT call Did Trump essentially grant her immunity from his own special court in exchange for the win he otherwise already earnedOnly time will tellBut it STILL seems that Hillary knows something that we all do not  because she has said all along that it is not going to happen that there isnt even the slightest chanceHillary Clinton Criminal Indictment Not Going to HappenHILLARY CLINTON INDICTMENT FURY  Hillary Claims Indictment Not Gonna HappenSo is she right about thatWhat will Trump do in the first 100 daysDont be surprised if campaign rhetoric ends up being just all talk For Trump supporters who were above all opposing Hillary Clinton and urging her being prosecuted and held accountable  dont hold your breathRead more Trump Calls Out Hillary at Debate You Should Be in Jail Ill Call A Special Prosecutor 5 Wikileaks Revelations That Shouldve Tanked Hillarys Campaign Where Are The Handcuffs This Video Blows The Doors Open On Hillarys Corruption Obfuscations and Outright Lies Emails Reveal Hillary Literally Read Up On How to Delete Something So It Stays Deleted
