CNN ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack outside a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas  and warned of more attacks to comeIn a broadcast on its official radio channel Tuesday the group said two Al Khilafa soldiers opened fire outside the event in Garland a Dallas suburb Al Khilafa is how ISIS refers to its soldiersCNN cannot confirm the claim and ISIS offered no evidence the gunmen were affiliated with the terror organizationThe gunmen Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi  wounded a security guard before police shot and killed themNadir Soofi left and Elton Simpson were the two gunmen in the Garland Texas shootingThe ISIS radio announcer also referred to Simpson and Soofi as the terror groups brothers The announcement ended with this warningWe say to the defenders of the cross the US that future attacks are going to be harsher and worse The Islamic State soldiers will inflict harm on you with the grace of God The future is just around the cornerWhile ISIS claimed responsibility two days after the attack there was no immediate indication that the terror group in Iraq and Syria had contact with Simpson or Soofi who both lived in PhoenixThey may not have had formal contact with ISIS They may have had email communication or read communications from ISIS but I dont think they were directed by ISIS Clemente saidI think its the other way around  they were kind of applying for membership into ISIS And so they were doing this act sent out the tweet in advance because if they know theres a possibility theyre not going to make it out of this then they cant give recognition to what they were trying to do after the factOn Tuesday White House spokesman Josh Earnest described what happened as an attempted terrorist act that was foiled US authorities meanwhile are still looking into what links  if any  Sundays shooters had to international terrorismBut there are clues that one of the gunmen was an ISIS sympathizerMoments before the attack Simpson posted a tweet with the hashtag texasattack May Allah accept us as mujahideenThe tweet also said he and his fellow attacker had pledged allegiance to Amirul Mumineen which means the leader of the faithful CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that likely refers to ISIS leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadiEarlier Simpson had asked his followers on Twitter to follow an ISIS propagandistAfter the shooting the propagandist tweeted Allahu Akbar 2 of our brothers just opened fireBoth Twitter accounts have been deactivatedOne US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the shooting was certainly more than just inspiration by ISIS but that assessment does not mean the terror group gave the gunmen specific instructionsA law enforcement official told CNN the attack does not appear to be a clearcut case of a lone wolf nor a pure case of someone directed by others to act Rather the official said it appears to be something in between the two extremesThe attack fits a wellknown pattern of ISIS recruitment and incitement encouraging sympathizers via a sophisticated social media campaign to join the fight in Syria or if they cannot to carry out terror attacks on their own at home US officials said TuesdayIn 2011 Simpson was convicted of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism Prosecutors said he told FBI agents he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in violent jihad  when in fact he had according to an indictmentSimpson was sentenced to three years of probation court records showSoofi on the other hand was relatively unknown to federal investigators a law enforcement official told CNNAuthorities knew of no indication the pair planned to launch Sundays attack another law enforcement official saidTwo law enforcement officials say that its believed Simpson and Soofie drove from Phoenix Arizona to Garland but officials did not specify the exact timeline of when the trip was madeA separate law enforcement source said the two long guns and four handguns found in their car were bought legallyThe FBI searched the apartment Simpson and Soofie shared and found it to be relatively barren one of the law enforcement officials said Authorities retrieved a hard drive which is being analyzed the official saidInvestigators are trying to ascertain whether the two gunmen had any associates in Phoenix or across the United States who share their ideology The FBI is scrubbing the deceased attackers electronics and interviewing friends in a bid to draw possible connectionsThe two assailants drove up to the center and started shooting striking a security guard in the ankle But Garland police returned fire killing the gunmen before they were able to enter the buildingPolice faced death headon and with incredible skill and bravery were able to save a lot of people said Zach Horn an attorney for the officersThe shooting stirred memories of other attacks this year in France and DenmarkIn January gunmen attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo a French satirical magazine that has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed and killed 12 peopleIn February a gunman attacked a free speech forum in Copenhagen Denmark featuring artist Lars Vilks who infuriated al Qaeda with his depictions of Mohammed
