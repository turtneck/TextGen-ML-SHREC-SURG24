Peter Bergen is CNNs national security analyst a professor of practice at Arizona State University and a vice president at New America  He is the author of  Manhunt The TenYear Search for bin Laden  From 911 to Abbottabad  This is an updated version of an article originally published February 19CNN This is how top national security reporters Souad Mekhennet and Adam Goldman of the Washington Post who broke the story that Mohammed Emwazi has been identified as the notorious ISIS terrorist known as Jihadi John describe him  a Briton from a welltodo family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programmingThey go on to say that Emwazi was raised in a middleclass neighborhood in London and attended the University of Westminster which is a university in London that was founded in the early 19th centuryEmwazi poses something of a problem for the Obama administrations narrative about who becomes a terrorist and why Last week the administration hosted a threeday conference on Countering Violent Extremism which is a government euphemism for how best to deal with Islamist terrorismWe heard from Obama administration officials and even the President himself that terrorism has something to do with lack of opportunities and poverty Obama said that we have to address grievances terrorists exploit including economic grievancesHe said when millions of people  especially youth  are impoverished and have no hope for the future when corruption inflicts daily humiliations on people when there are no outlets by which people can express their concerns resentments fester The risk of instability and extremism grow Where young people have no education they are more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and radical ideasThe President did acknowledge that terrorists can be rich like Osama bin Laden who was the son of a Saudi construction magnate and attended the top high school and the best university in Saudi Arabia Its hard to imagine someone with more opportunities Think the Trump family Saudistyle minus the bling and throw in a deep admiration for the TalibanBut in fact Osama bin Laden is more the rule than the exception Take not only EmwaziJihadi John but also the notorious British terrorist Omar Sheikh who attended the London School of Economics and who kidnapped American journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002Nearer to home we can also point to the Fort Hood shooter Maj Nidal Hasan who was not only an officer in the US Army and a psychiatrist but is also from a comfortably middleclass family in VirginiaThese are not the dispossessed They are the empoweredWho becomes a terrorist turns out in many cases to be much like asking Who owns a VolvoWe found that more than half of the terrorists had attended college making them as welleducated as the average American Two of our sample had doctoral degrees and two others had begun working toward their doctoratesNone of them had attended a madrassaOf course largescale insurgent groups such as ISIS and the Taliban recruit foot soldiers who join the cause to get a paycheck But the people running these organizations are in it for ideological reasonsThe diagnosis that poverty lack of education or lack of opportunities have much to do with terrorism requires a fundamentally optimistic view of human nature This diagnosis leads to the prognosis that all we need to do to solve the terrorism problem is to create societies that are less poor better educated and have more opportunitiesKepel researched the 300 Islamist militants who were tried in the wake of the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat Around one in five were professionals such as engineers a quarter worked as government employees just under half were artisans or merchants one in 10 were in the military or police and only one in 10 were farmers or were unemployed Of those who were students around a third were studying in the elite fields of medicine and engineeringThere are of course any number of exceptions to the prototypical middleclass terrorist The terrorists who attacked Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris last month and the Copenhagen caf that was hosting the Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks earlier this month were from the margins of societyBut for every example of poverty or lack of opportunities as a purported rationale for terrorism its easy to supply important counterexamples The underwear bomber Umar Abdulmuttalab who tried to set off a bomb on a US passenger jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 is the son of one of the richest men in Africa and attended University College London which routinely rates among the best universities in the worldAnwar alAwlaki the late leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who tasked the underwear bomber to blow up an American plane over an American city was studying for his PhD at George Washington University before he took up arms with al Qaeda Awlakis father was a Cabinet minister in YemenSo if its clearly not deprivation that is driving much Islamist terrorism what isFor that we must turn to ideology specifically religious ideology And this is where the Obama administration has to perform some pretzel logic It is careful to explain that the war on ISIS is not a war on Islam and that ISIS ideology is a perversion of the religion Fair enough But the administration seems uncomfortable with making the connection between Islamist terrorism and ultrafundamentalist forms of Islam that are intolerant of other religions and of other Muslims who dont share their views to the letterThe Taliban and other Islamist terrorist groups are not of course secular organizations To treat them as if they were springs from some combination of wishful thinking PC gone crazy and a failure to accept in an increasingly secularized era that some will kill in the name of their god an alltoocommon phenomenon across human historyIndeed while ISIS and likeminded groups and their fellow travelers are not representative of the vast majority of the worlds Muslims their ideology is rooted in Salafist ultrafundamentalist interpretations of Islam and indeed they can point to verses in the Quran that can be interpreted to support their worldviewA wellknown verse in the Quran commands Muslims to fight and slay the nonbelievers wherever you find them seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war When bin Laden made a formal declaration of war against the Jews and the Crusaders in 1998 he cited this Quranic verse at the beginning of his declarationISIS distinctive black flags are a reference to a supposed saying of the Prophet Mohammed that If you see the black banners coming from the direction of Khorasan then go to them even if you have to crawl because among them will be Allahs Caliph the MahdiIn other words coming out of Khorasan an area that now encompasses Afghanistan will come an army that includes the Mahdi the Islamic savior of the world The parent organization of ISIS was al Qaeda which of course was headquartered in Afghanistan at the time of the 911 attacksLast year ISIS leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadi named himself caliph which means that in his own mind and in the eyes of his followers he is not only the leader of ISIS but the overall leader of Muslims everywhereThese beliefs may seem like a crazy delusion to most of us but its important to understand that they are theological in nature and this theology is rooted in ultrafundamentalist IslamISIS sees itself as the vanguard army that is bringing back true Islam to the world This project is of such cosmic importance that they will break any number of eggs to make this omelet which accounts for their murderous campaign against every ethnic group religious group and nationality that they perceive as standing in their way ISIS recruits also believe that we are in the end times and they are best understood as members of an Islamist apocalyptic death cultWhat does that mean for policy makers It means that the only truly effective challenges to this reasoning must come from Islamic leaders and scholars who can make the theological case that ISIS is an aberration This too is an Islamic project it is not a jobs project
