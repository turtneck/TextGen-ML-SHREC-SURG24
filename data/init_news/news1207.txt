Washington CNN US lawmakers and administration officials expressed skepticism Tuesday that Israel had access to information on the Iran nuclear talks that went beyond what the White House had already shared with Capitol Hill following a report that the Israeli government had given them secret detailsMembers of Congress were both surprised by and dismissive of a Wall Street Journal story that the Israeli government spied on the USled negotiations and leaked information on the developing deal to legislatorsMore than a halfdozen lawmakers in both parties and chambers denied receiving such briefings from IsraelIm not sure what the information was But Im baffled by it Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday No information was revealed to me whatsoever on the talksSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker too said he hadnt been privy to any leaks from Israeli officials and joked to CNN that he felt left out after he saw the WSJ report Published late Monday the article said that Israelis had eavesdropped on the confidential talks and leaked selective intelligence with the intent of rallying Democratic opposition to the developing agreementIsrael has been vocally opposed to the emerging deal and made its concerns crystal clear to lawmakers including in a controversial address to Congress earlier this month by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu The administration which opposed Netanyahus speech has tried to counter Israels lobbying for bills that would give Congress a vote on the deal which many in both chambers opposeCorker hinted to reporters that he felt the Journal report was a continuation of that White House effortI think yall all understand whats happening here I mean you understand whos pushing this out he saidThe administration for its part aggressively pushed back against suggestions that it hadnt been briefing Congress adequately prompting lawmakers to search elsewhere for information on the talksWe have not just briefed Congress about the progress or lack thereof thats being made but weve also briefed the Israelis and our other partners in the region and around the world President Barack Obama said during a news conference on Monday afternoonHe added that any agreement negotiators reach would be presented for scrutiny by all stakeholders and said he felt there was significant transparency in the whole processState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki meanwhile called it an absurd notion that Congress would have to rely on a foreign government to get information about the administrations negotiations with IranBut some Republicans maintained Tuesday that they have had to rely on other countries for informationCorker said he gets a lot of information from foreign governments and suggested it was the White Houses own fault if their failure to brief lawmakers had them turning to leaks from foreign governments Congress has repeatedly complained about not receiving adequate information from the administration on IranIf the White House was actually doing the normal advise and consent with the Senate then it wouldnt be necessary for us to get our information from foreign governments Corker saidVirginia Democratic Sen Tim Kaine however said the White House had been helpful in its briefings on the Iranian nuclear talks Psaki pointed Tuesday to hundreds of conversations the administration has held with membersThe extent of the administration sharing with us has been very significant and I know the administration has been briefing Israel as well Kaine saidThe substance of the alleged leaks  and whether they actually occurred  was unclear on Tuesday with Congress members professed ignorance matched by a senior official in the Israeli Prime Ministers office calling the allegations utterly falseThe state of Israel does not conduct espionage against the United States or Israels other allies The false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the United States and Israel and the security and intelligence relationship we share the official told CNNBut members of both parties said it was understandable the country would try to get whatever information it couldKaine who noted that he hadnt received any information from Israeli officials he hadnt already gotten from the White House said that if Israel had been trying to glean details about the talks through clandestine channels he didnt find any of that that controversialI dont look at Israel or any nation directly affected by the Iranian program wanting deeply to know whats going on in the negotiation  as spying he said I look at that as thats what you would do if youre directly affectedAnd Maryland Rep Steny Hoyer the number two House Democrat and someone who has worked across the aisle on Iran acknowledged that spying is not an unusual practice for most nationsAll nations try to get as much information as they can about whats going on that affects them  including the United States of America as we know said Hoyer who added that he hadnt received any leaked information from IsraelBut Psaki said that the US continues to share information with Israel on Iran and other shared interests even as the administration has made an effort to protect the sensitive negotiations against leaksI think weve spoken in the past to our concern in the past has been about leaks of certain sensitive information And obviously weve taken steps to ensure that the negotiations remain private she said
