Research could potentially serve as a curative approach for patients with HIV scientist says Scientists have managed to remove DNA of the HIV virus from living tissue for the first time in a breakthrough that could lead to an outright cureAt the moment treating the disease involves the use of drugs that suppress levels of the virus so the bodys immune system can copeNow researchers in the US have revealed they used geneediting technology to remove DNA of the commonest HIV1 strain from several organs of infected mice and ratsIn April the same team reported that they had successfully eliminated the virus from human cells in the laboratory but a paper in the journal Nature Gene Editing revealed they had managed to do the same thing in live animals for the first timeThe researchers team leader Professor Kamel Khalili of Temple University said In a proofofconcept study we showed that our geneediting technology can be effectively delivered to many organs of two small animal models and excise large fragments of viral DNA from the host cell genomeThe current antiretroviral drugs for HIV are not able to eliminate HIV1 from the infected cellsAnd if treatment is interrupted the virus can start replicating quickly putting patients of risk of getting fullblow AIDS This is because it is able to persist in immune system Tcells and other places where it is not actually active and is unaffected by the current treatments The researchers used a specially adapted virus to deliver the geneediting system into the cellsThe ability of the rAAV delivery system to enter many organs containing the HIV1 genome and edit the viral DNA is an important indication that this strategy can also overcome viral reactivation from latently infected cells and potentially serve as a curative approach for patients with HIV Professor Khalili said In a statement Temple University said the implications of the new study were farreachingThe geneediting platform by itself may be able to eradicate HIV1 DNA from patients but it is also highly flexible and potentially could be used in combination with existing antiretroviral drugs to further suppress viral RNA It also could be adapted to target mutated strains of HIV1 it added Professor Khalili said a clinical trial could happen within the next few years but he first planned to carry out a similar study involving a larger group of animalsTMZ Breaking SOURCE
