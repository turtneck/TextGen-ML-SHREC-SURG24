PALM BEACH Fla  Ted Cruz may not be running for anythingyet but the senator from Texas nevertheless presented his theory here Friday night for why a presidential candidate like him would be best positioned to win back the White House for RepublicansThe conventional wisdom in political circles has beenthat to win a presidential election again Republicans must broaden their appeal to more moderate swing voters especially women minorities and young people Its a message former Florida governor Jeb Bush a favorite of theparty establishment has repeatedly delivered as he prepares for an allbutcertain presidential runBut Cruz also a likely 2016 candidate has a different take He argued insome detail to a gathering of elite conservative donors that a Republican candidate couldwin only ifhe or she motivates more conservative activists especially evangelical Christians to vote He posited that former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and Sen John McCain Ariz lost to President Obama in 2008 and 2012 because millions of conservatives who cast ballots for President George W Bushs reelection stayed home the following two cyclesHow do we bring back to the polls the millions of conservatives who stayed home If theystay home we lose Cruz said at a dinner Friday night for the Club for Growth attended by roughly 200 of the fiscallyconservative groups wealthy membersCruz took a swipe at Bushs father former president George HW Bush Cruz said Bush ran for his first term as a conservative promising a third Reagan term but in office raised taxes and became kindler and gentler  a line that drew laughter from the crowd Cruz argued that Bush lost his reelection because he was not sufficiently conservativeCruz drew a sharp contrast with Jeb Bush over education policy describing Common Core which Bush backsas national standards being dictated from Washingtoncontrolling the education of our kidsIn his remarks which including a questionandanswer session stretched for 70 minutes Cruz lambasted what he sees as crony political leaders in both parties He said conservative voters dont trust politicians anymore because theyve been lied to too many times And he lashed out at what he dubbed this small cabal of consultants in Washington who keeprunning Republican campaigns losing and coming back to donors saying Cut us a check to go make the exact same mistake all over againCruz saidtoo many Republicans run an almost Sovietstyle campaign whereas he signaled he would run a grassrootsorientedcampaign empoweringwhat he called political entrepreneurs In his 2012 Senate race he said he tried to nakedly shamelessly copy Obamas 2008 campaign strategy and ordered his aides to read Obama campaign manager David Plouffes memoirCruz who was accompanied at The Breakers an iconic Palm Beach resortby his wife and two daughters basked in a warm reception frommembers of the Club for Growth which provided substantial resources to help his underdog primary campaign for Senate in 2012 I do know for a fact that I would not be in the United States Senate if it were not for the Club for Growth Cruz saidCruz received hearty applause when he said We should abolish the IRS He also called for abolishing the ExportImport Bank a contentious issue within the Republican Party as House Speaker John A Boehner Ohio and many business leaders support the bank And he called for loosening or ending of federal regulations across the boardWe have seen regulations descend from Washington like locusts on small businesses across this country Cruz said
