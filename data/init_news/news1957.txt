Mike Pence Full disclosure I served as head of the Super PAC seeking to draft Pence into the 2012 presidential race Having long been persuaded of Pences superior leadership qualities Im even less objective than usualWe called Pence The Conservative Champion and for good reason Then in 2012 Pence made the right decision to run for governor of Indiana That was an opportunity for distinguished public service As it happened it was also a perfect boot camp for the vice presidencyThe Honorable David McIntosh now president of the powerful Club For Growth was the one who encouraged Pence to come back into electoral politics McIntosh later served as the guru of the Draft Pence For President Super PAC In my recent exclusive interview McIntosh recalledWhen I was vacating my Congressional seat to pursue an ultimately unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2000 I wanted my seat to be occupied by a true conservative and someone of high integrity and commitment to public service I turned to Mike Pence He had run unsuccessfully in 1988 and 1990 and by 2000 had achieved considerable success and affluence as a syndicated talk radio host Mike replied that he no longer aspired to public office but would together with his wife Karen pray on my request and determine whether they sensed a calling Several months later I encountered Mike at the Indiana State Fair I asked him about whether he had reached a conclusion He replied that he and Karen recognized that he could not shirk the duty Pence went on to run and win and serve America with distinction in the Congress and then to serve splendidly as governor of Indiana If elected to the vice presidency he will again serve America magnificentlyOne of the reasons that Pence showed himself extraordinary may have faded from general memory It has not faded from mine Nor has it been forgotten or forgiven by the left who are now highlighting this much to my delight In 2010 Pence gave a major speech at the Detroit Economic Club As the centerleft ThinkProgressorg then reportedThe first item of Pences fivepoint for the economy is a sound monetary policy Pence elaborated that he believes a return to the gold standard could create such a policy PENCE Before I move on Id like to note in the midst of all thats happened recently  massive borrowing and spending QE2  a debate has started anew over an anchor to our global monetary system My dear friend the late Jack Kemp probably would have urged me to adopt the gold standard right here and now in Detroit Robert Zoellick the president of the World Bank encouraged that we rethink the international currency system including the role of gold and I agree I think the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nations monetary affairs A progrowth agenda begins with sound monetary policy Emphasis supplied by ThinkProgressThe elitist left is misguidedly neurotic about the gold standard Properly designed the gold standard favors labor and debtors slightly over capital and creditors and hence carries majority rank and file support among the labor and ethnic left Timothy B Lee wrote at the elite left Vox on July 15th Trump should ignore his running mates bad ideas about monetary policy with reference to the same speechIt is perverse how the left has reviled Friedman when he was as he most often was right while being deferential to him when he was demonstrably wrong The international gold standard had ceased operations in 1914 In 1922 it was replaced in the immortal words of the great French economist Jacques Rueff by a grotesque caricatureThe Economist described that system quite correctly as a mess It called itself a gold standard without playing by the rules of the gold standard The Interwar socalled gold standard was a hybrid between Jabberwocky and Calvinball The true gold standard was but a dim memory by the onset of the Great Depression for which it was framed The misguided fixation of many economists  deluded by the Eichengreen Fallacy  on the role of the gold standard in worsening the Great Depression is contradicted by historyConservative apostate David Frum writing in The Wall Street Journal also stubbornly continues to misunderstand the gold standard Frum does however astutely observe some similarities between William Jennings Bryan and Donald TrumpThis is a similarity previously noted by David Klinghard in US News and World Report and by Tim Reuter at Forbescom It is apt in some ways but not in others Bryan by prescribing depreciation through free coinage of silver lost three presidential races Trump provides a counsel of general prosperity and has thus far gone from victory to victory and is on track to astound the Frums of this world in the general electionIt is disappointing that the erudite but curiously tonedeaf Frum fails to note that the ravaging of small farmers was caused by the postCivil War restoration of the gold standard at prewar parity This forced a painful secular deflation We are back in the jaws of deflation this time Fedinduced Trump twice has stated his appreciation for the gold standard the very platform on which McKinley soundly beat Bryan And the gold standard properly done is not an instrument of deflationPaul Krugman and his plovers will rave on against the gold standard Let them To adapt a tweet by NeoKeynesian economist Austan Goolsbee Roses are red Violets are pink Dont listen to aurophobes No one cares what they think To wit
