Congressional Democrats are trying to build support for an effort to bar gun purchases by terror suspects hoping to take advantage of the same public anxieties about security that gave Republicans a ringing House victoryThe Democratic push seems likely to fall victim to opposition from the National Rifle Association and congressional gunrights backers chiefly Republicans who have smothered firearms curbs for years If the Republicans who control Congress block votes on the proposal Democrats hope to profit politically by winning sympathy from angry votersBy leaving this terrorist loophole open Republicans are leaving every community in America vulnerable to attacks by terrorists armed with assault rifles and explosives purchased legally in broad daylight Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid DNev said Friday in a written statementThe bill by Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif would have the attorney general compile names of known and suspected terrorists likely drawing from huge lists the government already keeps Federally licensed gun dealers would be barred from selling firearms to people on that list if government officials believed they planned to use the weapons for terrorismGun dealers are prohibited from selling to 10 categories of people including many convicted criminals or those with severe mentally illnessBut people appearing on the governments terror watch lists  including those kept off from airlines  are not automatically disqualified from buying weapons from gun dealers The FBI is notified when a background check for the purchase of firearms or explosives generates a match with the watch list and agents often use that information to step up surveillance on suspectsBy law people can try persuading the Justice Department to remove their names from terror lists or can file lawsuits challenging their inclusion The lists are overwhelmingly composed of foreignersBetween 2004 and 2014 people on one terror watch list underwent background checks to buy guns 2233 times and were allowed to make the purchase 91 percent of the time according to a March report by the Government Accountability Office an investigative agency of CongressNRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker noted that there have been numerous instances of innocent people mistakenly added to terror lists She also accused Democrats of trying to take advantage of heightened public alarm following last weeks attacks in Paris which claimed at least 130 lives and for which the Islamic State which has also threatened the US has claimed responsibilityIt is appalling that antigun politicians are exploiting the Paris terrorist attacks to push their guncontrol agenda and distract from President Obamas failed foreign policy Baker saidFeinsteins measure echoes legislation that the late Sen Frank Lautenberg DNJ proposed repeatedly over the last decade and that Rep Peter King RNY has long pushed None of those measures has ever received a voteFeinstein introduced her bill in February But last weeks mass killings in Paris have injected new life into terrorism and public safety as toptier political issuesJust Thursday Republicans took advantage of voters security jitters and muscled legislation through the House preventing Syrian and Iraqi refugees from entering the US until the administration tightens restrictions on their entry Fortyseven Democrats voted for the bill ignoring a veto threat by President Barack Obama who said the current screening system is strong and accused Republicans of playing on panicked votersHouse Speaker Paul Ryan RWis did not respond directly when asked Thursday if he favored barring people on terror lists from buying guns We are just beginning this process of reassessing all of our security stances he saidDonald Stewart spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said McConnell has not said whether he would be open to a vote on Feinsteins billBut opposition from Republicans and some Democrats to curbing firearms runs deep and such legislation would require support from 60 of the 100 senators Democrats could not attain that margin even when they had a Senate majority in the months after the 2012 massacre of 20 firstgraders and six adults in Newtown ConnecticutThough the Senate had showdown votes on gun curbs in early 2013 it did not revisit the issue as the 2014 elections approached and Reid opted to protect vulnerable Democrats from potentially angering constituentsThe GOPrun House has held no votes on major gun control measures since the Newtown killingsFeinsteins bill isnt the only gunrelated measure Democrats may pursue A measure by Sen Dick Durbin DIll would bar gun sales to foreigners in the US from the 38 countries from which visitors need not have visas
