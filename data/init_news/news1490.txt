Twitter Print This Post The following is an opinion column by R Muse Over the past few months there has been a dearth of good news and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change Even dismissing the horrible flooding wildfires droughts sea level rise melting ice caps hurricanes and worldwide food shortages there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures This week while most Americans were living breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign the International Energy Agency offered up some good news for the climate the Earths population and even for America The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency IEA that stated according to new data for the first time Renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world It may not seem like such fantastic news but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending 2degree C rise in global temperatures it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy generating sources This is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of Americas C02 emissions Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in and coming from developing and industrialized nations alike For a developing nation it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years Renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass biogas eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources according to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Both terms renewable and green energy include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable In addition to prorenewable policies such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the AmericaChina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar And the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same fiveyear period Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet there was some extra good news in the report about Americas transition to renewable energy According to the IEAs MediumTerm Renewable Market Report the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity Still America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of Americas electricity In time and if the Koch brothers allow it America may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy Although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications The dirty coal industry is facing some strugglesin part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices financial mismanagement and new cleanair regulations but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs The IEA couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting However since the IEA only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener significantly cheaper and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry particularly the dirty coal industry will absorb this good news In the past eight years Republicans  the Kochs their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals It is likely that the IEAs report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy particularly solar Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the IEAs report never mentions image J Pat Carter
