Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Obama dont see eyetoeye on much But there are ways for allies to get along even when their leaders dontIts safe to say that President Obama was hoping for a different outcome in Israels election Tuesday  just as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did little to hide his preference for Mitt Romney in the last American presidential electionBut Mr Netanyahu will govern for an unprecedented fourth term that is likely to extend beyond Mr Obamas last day in officeNo one anticipates a sudden dissipation in the bad blood between the two leaders nor that a relationship long deemed dysfunctional will suddenly transform into a happy marriageBut a variety of constraints on both leaders suggest that United StatesIsrael relations arent likely to get worse some diplomatic experts say The US has had times when relations with other allies have degenerated and they have recovered at least to some degreeIn the meantime the US and Israel could create channels that allow the states to work together in important ways while allowing the two leaders to avoid each other Thats what happened between the US and France when Presidents George W Bush and Jacques Chirac had widely divergent worldviews and little use for each otherIts going to be a very heavy lift given the history between these two leaders but I think if we look at how relations got back on track between the US and France after the Iraq war there is a lesson says Michael Singh managing director specializing in US Mideast policy at the Washington Institute for Near East PolicyIn that case the making up involved refocusing on vital mutual interests including counterterrorism and national security issues It was not carried out by the two leaders but by key aides Mr Singh says But what you did have was a commitment by the two leaders that this repair of relations was very important to do he addsSingh says he can envision a channel being created through which these key aides would perform the same task as those in the FrancoAmerican case more than a decade ago preventing sharp policy differences from precluding cooperation between two close allies in areas of vital mutual interestObamas pursuit of a nuclear agreement with Iran and Netanyahus campaign pledge never to allow creation of a Palestinian state while he is in office are two prime examples of the policy differences separating the two leadersBut neither of these divisions is really new  suggesting that relations have little reason to worsen and might remain more or less the same for the remainder of Obamas term some experts sayIt didnt take Netanyahus reelection to convince anyone that while the IsraeliPalestinian process maybe wasnt dead it was frozen pretty hard and no matter what happened in the election an Iran agreement appeared to be a done deal or at least pretty close says Aaron David Miller a Middle East expert with the Wilson Center who has held government posts in both Republican and Democratic administrationsA number of factors will tend to constrain what the administration is prepared to do to press the Israelis Mr Miller says These include unabated proIsraeli congressional pressure a US presidential campaign where all the candidates will be trumpeting their support for Israel and shared USIsrael national security interestsMiller points out that the Obama administration has never gone beyond words to demonstrate its dissatisfaction with Israel and he doesnt anticipate that happening now  simply because he doesnt see how the US benefits by getting tough with Israel I just dont see what ratcheting up to concrete steps gets the administration he saysAs a result he says he can envision the US abstaining on rather than vetoing a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israel over expanded settlement construction in east Jerusalem and the West Bank Or the US might support a FrancoArab resolution proposing a framework agreement for resolving the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and creating a Palestinian state Miller saysAnd no matter how much the US and Israel may disagree on approaches to the Iran and Palestinian challenges the reality is that they have common interests in how both play out Singh saysIsrael may not like any Iran nuclear deal but if one is reached Netanyahu will have as much interest as Obama in seeing that Iran honors its terms and is not secretly circumventing it Singh says At the same time he adds the US will have as much interest as Israel in seeing that the vacuum left by the absence of a peace process is not filled by something much worseTheres no question its going to take hard work Singh says but I think its with sustained effort on these kinds of key mutual interests that you get the relationship back on track
