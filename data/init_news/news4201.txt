This summer the court is expected to rule in King v Burwell in which the plaintiffs allege the Affordable Care Acts language does not authorize the federal government to distribute health insurance tax credits in about twothirds of the states Some wording in one section of the law is the source of the dispute  an ambiguity that Congress could fix with a simple oneline correction Coats speaking to the Wall Street Journals Louise Radnofsky seemed to suggest he and other Republicans had no interest in taking that stepIts possible Coats was being flippant His office has not responded to email inquiries from The Huffington Post And he doesnt necessarily speak for other Republicans at least a few of whom have indicated theyre thinking about what to do if the court does find for the plaintiffsOver the last few months a cadre of prominent conservative writers and intellectuals  most notably James Capretta Philip Klein Avik Roy and Yuval Levin  have suggested Republicans seize the opportunity to enact their own version of health reform whether thats through significant modifications to the existing law or some kind of wholesale replacement The topic reportedly came up at a House Republican strategy retreat this month and over in the Senate Republicans Lamar Alexander John Barrasso and Orrin Hatch have started a working group to examine possible postKing reformsThere are a lot of ideas Hatch told TPMs Sahil Kapur this week If the case goes the way I think it should go  then weve gotta come up with a way of resolving the problems were in Were quietly looking at all that and trying to do thatBut drawing up a health care bill cant really be done quietly  or quickly The debate over the Affordable Care Act dragged on for more than a year in Congress And that was just the final stage of a process that had unfolded over roughly a decade during which time liberal intellectuals and interest groups hashed out different ideas for how to write legislation and then how to build a political coalition that could pass it It took such a long time because devising even narrowly tailored health care legislation requires coming to grips with difficult tradeoffs  and then dealing with politically powerful constituencies that might not like themRepublicans would face the very same difficulties Many conservatives have said for example that they would prefer to repeal or at least relax Obamacares restrictions on age rating thereby allowing insurers much more room to vary premiums based on age They tout this proposal because they note correctly it would mean lower premiums for young people What they often dont mention is that it would also mean higher premiums for old people In other words giving a break to twentysomethings would mean sticking it to those nearer retirement Explaining that to older Americans now getting coverage wouldnt be easy for Republicans particularly since older voters are a key part of the GOP constituencyOf course Republicans strategizing about a King ruling may not be acting in good faith Nobody knows how the court will rule or what reasoning the individual justices will invoke in their decisions But lots of people in Washington believe that Chief Justice John Roberts whose vote to uphold the individual mandate saved Obamacare in 2012 might be inclined to save it again if he fears upholding the King lawsuit would wreak havoc  not only by depriving millions of insurance but also by throwing entire state insurance markets into chaos Without the subsidies most experts say many of the laws other reforms could not work and would lead to sudden spikes in premiums or a mass exodus of insurersIf Republicans make it look like theyre prepared to act the thinking goes that will ease Roberts conscience and make it easier for him to rule in favor of the lawsuit For now as one conservative health policy adviser told Kapur the main goal of Republicans is to make the world safe for Roberts to overturn Itd be a smart gambit But Coats comments  if representative of more widespread thinking  would suggest that the mere appearance of trying to pass a law that preserves health insurance for millions is more than many conservatives can stomach
