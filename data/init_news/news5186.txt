At this point even amid one of the most captivating political upheavals in recent memory the election process of 2016 is starting to feel like an extended car ride with a group of people after the conversational possibilities have run out Were all buckled up with a long way to go but everyones most irritating habits are already out in force Were feeling candidate fatigue a malady first observed in the 1980s perhaps earlier and its the inevitable consequence of an exceptionally drawnout political process combined with ample media coverageCandidate fatigue strikes people at different times People were already complaining of Al Gore fatigue in 1999 and the complaints were deafening by 2000 John Kerry fatigueyes there was that in 2004 But it plagues everyone eventually Barack Obama John McCain Mitt Romney Yes yes yes And now its allofthem fatigue Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Bernie Sanders Ted Cruz and John Kasich rotate seats regularly each of them taking turns at the wheel Each takes a different approach to driving all of them tiresomeDonald Trump used to be the most interesting driver because he took strange turns and it kind of worked He also crashed through fruit stands and that was fascinating at first Then it seemed like he was driving through fruit stands for no reason other than that it pleased him Perhaps you thought Trump had a grander plan with this that there were some shortcuts being taken now in order to get everyone somewhere worthwhile later Perhaps you dont think so anymoreHillary Clinton is a more controlled driver at first glance She sits straight at the wheel signals diligently looks attentive But she doesnt seem to notice or maybe care that shes weaving between lanes and belching up exhaust Ask her about it and she smiles sometimes laughs and says she doesnt know what youre talking about She sometimes sings to project cheer She does not have a good singing voiceTed Cruz when driving moves his seat back leans the seatback down and steers with just one hand his right resting his left arm in the open window This is meant to look confident manly and controlled But its 40 degrees outside and raining Everyone is cold Ted has planned everything out carefully He doesnt want you to touch his things When you left your journal in the hotel room though he found it and said he intended to keep it because technically he was in possession of it Then he started reading it and smirking occasionally pushing his hand in the air in a shushing gesture and telling you to calm downJohn Kasich pulls his seat nearly all the way forward and he places both hands on the very top of the wheel elbows at the bottom He fumes at other drivers and he gets angry when he makes a wrong turn If he feels people arent behaving themselves he likes to pull over park on a shoulder and turn around in his seat to lecture everyone No one can explain why hes in the car or where hes goingBernie Sanders has two hands on the wheel and drives alertly but also like Kasich irritably He yells a lot He often lifts his arms and spreads his hands upturned into the air to signal incredulity When Hillary takes potshots at his driving he tells her hes driving fine He looks tired and the cars running out of gas but he thinks he can make it People tell him to try some of the new features or do some reading to get up to speed on the auto world but he has an approach to driving and hes sticking to itCandidate fatigue can be a dangerous thing actually In 2000 journalists who were stuck with Al Gore got so sick of him that they got unfair amplifying every one of his missteps and inventing some more to boot Thats one reason reporters are rotated more often now It makes them less likely to fall in love with the candidate or descend into hate So one must keep that in mind Especially since there are over six months to goIn any case we must be grateful to these candidates on the presidential car ride as they weather the madness of a presidential campaign Its rough enough to watch them Imagine how much rougher it is to be them
