In the days after Kings assassination Americans considered many of the same questions that we are asking today Was this the work of one lunatic or of a larger racial ideology How should lawmakers respond Would the violent tragedy lead to gun control legislation White Southerners even debated whether to lower the flag in Kings honor In the end many ministers and leaders cautioned that King would have died in vain if the country did not act boldly to root out racial injustice The fact that we are having similar conversations almost 50 years later seems a mark of our collective failureAs word of Kings assassination traveled around the country on the night of April 4 1968 two of Americas leading journalists sat down at their typewriters Mike Royko in Chicago and Ralph McGill in Atlanta They reached the same conclusion  that an entire society had murdered King regardless of which individual pulled the triggerAt that point the assassin remained at large and his identity was unknown There were no social media profiles to parse no manifestoes to read That kind of information was unnecessary Both McGill and Royko knew that a sick and racist nation was to blameIn the spring of 1968 King was far from a sanitized national hero Many white Americans detested his activism and begrudged his fame In 1967 King had delivered a forceful speech opposing the Vietnam War Other civil rights leaders turned against him and he faced a round of criticism in the nations newspapers and magazines His relationship with President Lyndon Johnson already frayed fractured completely King then announced plans for the Poor Peoples Campaign in which droves of the nations poor would set up tent encampments on the Washington Mall in a show of nonviolent civil disobedience King was attacking capitalism and imperialism and calling for a revolution of valuesIn early 1968 he traveled to Memphis where 1300 black sanitation workers were waging a strike King led a protest march through downtown Memphis on March 28 Some demonstrators behind him resorted to violence as chaos took hold King was whisked away from the scene The national press intensified its criticism of King On Capitol Hill elected officials denounced him as a lawless radical He had become the target of deepening hatredTo Mike Royko a popular columnist for the Chicago Daily News it was this scorn and revulsion that ultimately killed King Royko published a column on April 5 titled Millions in His Firing Squad Royko expressed confidence that the authorities would soon arrest the assassinBut they cant catch everybody Royko wrote and Martin Luther King was executed by a firing squad that numbered in the millions From many corners of the nation white Americans fed words of hate into the ear of the assassin The killer was simply following orders The man with the gun did what he was told Millions of bigots subtle and obvious put it in his hand and assured him he was doing the right thingRoyko blamed white Northerners the antibusing leaders the lawandorder demagogues all of those Chicago residents who stood against Kings openhousing programs and pelted him with rocks in Marquette Park He also indicted the FBI for its propaganda campaign against King and proceeded to condemn every white American who nodded at racist jokesIt was almost ludicrous Royko wrote of the hostility directed at King The man came on the American scene preaching nonviolence  He preached it in the North and was hit with rocks He talked it the day he was murdered But Americans refused to hear his calls for peace and freedom Hypocrites all over this country would kneel every Sunday morning and mouth messages to Jesus Christ Then they would come out and tell each other after reading the papers that somebody should string up King who was living Christianity like few Americans ever have In a legendary career this was one of Roykos finest moments  and one of his angriestRalph McGill targeted the Southern bigots McGill the publisher of the Atlanta Constitution and a leading Southern liberal chose a title for his editorial that was sure to aggravate the haters A Free Man Killed by White Slaves He wrote White slaves killed Martin Luther King in Memphis At the moment the triggerman fired Martin Luther King was the free man The white killer or killers was a slave to fearIn McGills formulation millions of white Americans stood captive to racial fear McGill located many such slaves in Memphis which was bound by such terrible chains of enmity Hatred at the sanitation workers and at King himself had swirled around the Delta city McGill beseeched white Americans to strike at racial prejudice and injustice The white South  the white population in all the country  must now give answerTo two of the nations most perceptive observers the important issue was not the assassins mental state The crucial fact was that a climate existed in the country that sanctioned racial hatredOf course others rejected this logic The Chicago Tribune bristled at Mike Roykos indictment The murder of Dr King was a crime and the sin of an individual the Tribunes editors asserted on April 9  the morning of Kings funeral The rest of us were not contributory to this particular crime The Memphis Commercial Appeal also dismissed the notion of collective guilt It was the work of an individual a warped mixedup emotional mind the Commercial Appeal editorialized on April 6 In reality the Commercial Appeal itself had helped to whip white Memphis into a feverish state The newspaper had criticized the sanitation strike for the better part of two months and deplored Kings decision to assist the strikers The newspapers Hambone cartoon  which had appeared six days a week since the 1910s  continued to trade in crass racial stereotypes In 1968 the Commercial Appeal focused on one persons warped mixedup emotional mind instead of the racism and racial inequality that so shaped the city and the nationThen as now it was easier to blame a deranged individual than to craft a response that might address racial inequality or gun violence Hours before Kings death the Senate Judiciary Committee finally voted on a guncontrol bill that had been pending before it for three years The bill was initially proposed by Sen Thomas Dodd of Connecticut and supported by Lyndon Johnson James Eastland the longtime segregationist from Mississippi chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee The committee defeated a proposal to ban interstate gun sales The committee then considered a proposal to combine gun control legislation with a safe streets bill It failed to approve this measure then adjourned for the evening An hour later James Earl Ray aimed his rifle at the balcony of the Lorraine Motel and murdered Martin Luther King JrOn Saturday April 6 the committee met again This time it voted 9to7 to attach the gun control regulations to the safe streets bill But to achieve even this tiny advance the supporters of gun control agreed to exempt rifles and shotguns That same day members of the National Rifle Association descended upon Bostons Sheraton Hotel for the organizations annual meeting They would rally against the pending legislation The Senate began to debate the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act This law would prohibit felons from buying guns ban all mailorder gun sales and impose restrictions on certain outofstate transactions The Senate passed the bill on May 24 The House did not act until after the assassination of Robert F Kennedy One day after Kennedys death on June 6 1968 the House approved the bill Months later Congress passed a more expansive law called the Gun Control Act of 1968 It established a licensing system for gun purchases mandated serial numbers on weapons and expanded many of the previous bills measures This was the apogee in the history of American gun control legislation It was eventually undone in 1986 by the Firearm Owners Protection Act Palm Sunday fell on April 7 1968 three days after Kings assassination Millions of Americans gathered in churches to mourn the slain leader Tributes to King rang out in black houses of worship among white congregations and at public gatherings that drew interracial crowds The nation pressed together to grieve for the prophet of nonviolence Many religious leaders offered the same message that for Kings death to have a lasting impact the nation needed to commit itself to racial justice in deed as well as in word At New York Citys Church of the Holy Family Monsignor Timothy Flynn declared that Kings death will be redemptive if it stirs the white community to an adequate healing social action Rabbi Mark Tannenbaum of the American Jewish Committee agreed It will be a great desecration of his holy name if the Congress of the United States and the citizens of this nation do not respond  by providing the elementary decencies for which he sacrificed his life jobs housing education health The Urban Leagues Whitney Young a civil rights leader known for moderation declared We must have concrete tangible action that will remove the inequities in our society If the nation could see its way toward such substantive action if it could begin to remove those inequities then King may have achieved in death something he was never quite able to do in actual life American leaders never did remove such racial inequalities Instead the white backlash intensified as the silent majority lifted Richard Nixon to the presidency The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was in effect the last civil rights bill And the safe streets bill its robust gun control regulations notwithstanding would give rise to the era of mass incarceration In the days after Kings death Southern leaders debated whether to lower the American flag  and Southern state flags  in Kings honor A dramatic standoff occurred at the Georgia Statehouse in Atlanta Kings native city Ben Fortson Georgias secretary of state had lowered both the American and state flags to halfstaff immediately after Kings assassination Georgias flag was essentially the Confederate flag alongside a small image of the state seal Georgia had added the starsandbars to its flag in 1956 The governor at the time was Lester Maddox a segregationist icon On April 8 1968 Maddox called Fortson to register his objections about the lowering of the flags Kings funeral service would begin the next morning thousands of mourners had flocked to the city On April 9 Maddox surrounded the Statehouse with 160 state troopers in riot gear as well as 20 armed wildlife rangers Maddox then marched over to the flagpole and began to raise both of the flags He suddenly realized that television cameras from CBS NBC and ABC were tracking his every move Maddox ultimately left the flags where they were and retreated into his office He later explained I didnt think we oughta use our flag to honor an enemy of our country The symbolism was hard to miss the Confederate flag remained at halfstaff in Kings honor In 2001 Georgia adopted a new state flag  the result of Gov Roy Barnes efforts After 14 more years and the slaughter of nine AfricanAmericans South Carolina may finally retire that symbol of racial hatred Still our nation is dotted with many more shrines to the Confederacy Hundreds of towns have monuments to slaveholders some public schools are named after Confederate leaders Perhaps those symbols will be the next to fall Maybe this awful moment can nudge us toward necessary reforms We comfort ourselves with the notion that the gunman was insane when it is obvious that he was acting out  in extreme form  the ugliest truth of our time that our society places little value on black life If Ralph McGill and Mike Royko were still with us they would not busy themselves with the assassins Internet posts They would not look at him they would look at us They would scrutinize our society at what we have built and what we have condoned In this painful hour we might realize that we dont have to keep living this way We can harness the sadness the outrage and the feeling of unity and use that energy to force our leaders into action  urging them to pursue policies that will make it harder for people to kill one another and to honor the dead by creating a more peaceful and just society for the living
