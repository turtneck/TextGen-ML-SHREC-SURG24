Amid the handwringing over the gutterlevel sexual exchanges between Trump and Cruz it doesnt hurt to remember that it has been ever thus in American politicsThe innuendos flying back and forth between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump about the mutual sexual peccadillos of the candidates and their wives has elicited an abundance of handwringing over how such mudslinging has dragged presidential politics into the gutter Actually it has returned it to the steamy if seamy flow of American history that harkens back to the Founding Fathers The only surprise is that pundits affect to be surprised by this turn of events In fact sexual indiscretion and its consequences are an indelible part of our nations political traditionThe issue is not whether our forbears who attained or aspired to the White House were plaster saints but rather how the times in which they lived responded to their behavior The ink had hardly dried on the Constitution in 1791 when our first secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton entered into a liaison with Maria Reynolds whose scoundrel of a husband James blackmailed Hamilton in return for his silence further implicating Hamilton in corruption charges It wasnt until six years later that Hamiltons political enemies exposed the affair Hamilton responded by coming clean admitting that hed slept with the lady but denying the corruption charges His response won him points for candor but the mud never quite came unstuckTed Cruz might not want to follow the path pursued by Andrew Jackson who killed Charles Dickinson in a duel in 1806 for impugning the reputation of Jacksons wife Rachel The duel did nothing to mar Jacksons reputation as evidenced by his being elected president two decades later The more notorious sexual scandal of Jacksons political career occurred during his presidency when he insisted on defending the virtue of Peggy Eaton the wife of his War Secretary John Eaton Peggy a local tavern keepers daughter disparaged in Washington society for her allegedly easygoing ways was shunned by the wives of Jacksons cabinet What started out as a contretemps of social snubs soon grew into a fullblown political schism Eaton eventually resigned but Jackson revenged himself on his recalcitrant cabinet members by dismissing several of them Jackson won the battle but at a cost that contributed to a growing schism in the Democratic PartyA different set of circumstances entirely arose from two men who entered the White House as bachelors James Buchanan 18571861 and Grover Cleveland who served two terms in the Gilded Age There their similarities end Buchanan was rumored to have had a homosexual friendship with William Rufus King himself a former vice president whom Jackson disparagingly referred to as Miss Nancy The real scandal of Buchanans tenure was his virtual abdication of executive responsibility as the nation unraveled in the months leading up to the Civil WarGrover Cleveland was another story Running as a reforming Democrat in 1884 he was vilified by his Republican enemies as the father of an outofwedlock son whom hed sired during an earlier sojourn in Buffalo The GOP which had run the bribereceptive Sen James G Blaine against Cleveland sought to detract from their own candidates turpitude by sullying Clevelands reputation Cleveland was mocked with the chants of Ma ma wheres my Pa accompanied by cartoons lampooning the errant father whod abandoned his illegitimate son Cleveland turned the tables on his tormenters by acknowledging responsibility for the boy and providing for his welfare although he never fully owned up to admitting paternity The exposure may have dented his campaign but didnt derail it as he went on to win the White HouseThen there was Warren Harding the first president to be elected with the womens vote who displayed his fondness for the ladies by maintaining a longterm affair with his best friends wife Carrie Phillips when he was elected in 1920 and for good measure embarking on a second liaison in the White House with the youngish Nan Britton Their trysts led to the birth of an illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Monthly payments to the parties involved assured their discretion Hardings tenure was ushered in by Prohibition and the ensuing Jazz Age But his teetotaling supporters came to have greater concerns than rumors of randy hijinks in the Executive Office when the Teapot Dome scandal blew the roof off the GOP White HouseThe age of Democratic ascendancy which roughly stretched from the New Deal through the Great Society provided an Era of Good Feeling where the human lapses of our Chief Executives were overlooked by a forgiving press It was only after their tenures that a more prurient or judgmental posterity examined their private affairs more closely Thus the discreet indiscretions of Franklin Roosevelt with Lucy Mercer and Missy LeHand or for that matter Eleanor with Lorena Hickock Jack Kennedys serial philandering or LBJs randy ways were all suppressed by a media that was more concerned with presidential policies than peccadillosWith the sexual abandon of the Cultural Revolution came a new approach to residents of the Oval Office or aspirants for the job Those who sought or won the post for the most part had the same human frailties as their predecessors The difference was in the Anything Goes approach of the media whetted by the success of exposing the Watergate scandal and abetted by a technological revolution that made what was once the province of intimacy the source of prurient interest under the rubric of the publics right to know Watergate whatever its virtues made the president fair game and encouraged an investigative journalism that devolved from monitoring public malfeasance to invading what had once been considered private affairsSo by the 1988 campaign when Democratic Sen Gary Harts presidential hopes and political career became caught in the maw of tabloid journalism and left to the mercies of reporters on the scent of sexual scandal the quest for the presidency had become an adjunct of the entertainment industry The Oscars for this spectacle went to the Clinton impeachment proceedingsDonald Trump took it to the next logical step from turning a candidate into a celebrity to simply making a celebrity a candidate Americans love a circus and the circus has now come to town or rather the electronic Town Hall of social media digital dazzle squawk radio and cable wrestling that passes for discourse in our political arena The unrestrained passions of partisan politics and party faction that Washington futilely warned against were there from the beginning They have simply been amplified by technology The list cited above is a short one
