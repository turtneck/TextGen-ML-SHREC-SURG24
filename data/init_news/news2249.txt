seek the presidency in 2016Romneys activity indicates that his declaration of interest Friday to a group of 30 donors in New York was more than the release of a trial balloon Instead it was the start of a deliberate effort by the 2012 nominee to carve out space for himself in an emerging 2016 field also likely to include former Florida governor Jeb Bush New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Wisconsin Gov Scott WalkerRomney has worked the phones over the past few days calling an array of key allies to discuss his potential 2016 campaign Among them was Ryan whom Romney phoned over the weekend to

was fully engaged and up to speed on everything happening on the domestic and international front To me it didnt seem like he was content to be just a passive player in American politicsRomneys undertaking to reengage and pursue anew the GOPs leading financial and political players began Friday when he told a private gathering of donors I want to be president He also told them that his wife Ann was very encouraging of another campaignRomney is considering attending this weeks meeting of the Republican National Committee in San Diego and is working on a new message about economic

Republicans who are weighing a run Some already have publicly aligned with Bush and othersTheyre competing hard and its going to get complicated for Bush said former Senate majority leader Trent Lott

cheerleaders to onetime foes as well He called Newt Gingrich the former House speaker who relentlessly attacked Romney on the stump and debate stage in 2012 during his presidential run Gingrich said

ties to the Bush family after serving as chief of staff under thenpresident George HW BushJudd Gregg a former US senator from New Hampshire who backed Romney in 2008 and 2012 said Hes reaching out to people My sense is he feels strongly he has an opportunity to do what was incomplete last time He figures theres a lot of buyers remorse now and that his message is a good message and itll resonateRomney is also paying attention to Iowa which holds the firstinthenation caucuses calling his former Iowa strategist David Kochel Romney however has not connected with Iowa Republican Sens
