Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump whose caustic comments about Mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate told thousands of cheering supporters here Saturday that we have to take back the heart of our countryIn a rambling defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nations divisive battle over immigration reform Trump declared These are people that shouldnt be in our country They flow in like water One man in the crowd of 4200 shouted back Build a wallBasking in polls that show he has risen to the top of the crowded Republican field Trump took obvious glee in mocking former Florida governor Jeb Bush the establishment favorite who is setting fundraising recordsJeb Bush lets say hes president  Oy yoy yoy Trump said He asked the crowd How can I be tied with this guy Hes terrible Terrible Hes weak on immigrationTrumps 70minute address here which sounded more like a streamofconsciousness rant than a presidentialstyle stump speech put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversationBush and illegal immigrants were not the only targets of Trumps scorn He also criticized Macys NBC NASCAR US ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and several times the mediaRepublican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee much less of making it to the White House And for now at least his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the partys mainstreamYet Trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue immigration that the GOP had been determined to settle after it hurt Republicans in the most recent presidential electionParty leaders increasingly fear that Trump could do damage to more viable candidates such as Bush who could lose their own footing on immigration These candidates confront a familiar challenge During the primary season they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration But they must do it in a way that will not damage their appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016Republicans are handling Trump delicately for another reason as well They fear that he could leave the GOP entirely and wage a wellfunded thirdparty campaign a possibility that Trump has not ruled outGOP leaders fear damage to partys image as Donald Trump doubles downAfter Trump repeatedly referred to illegal immigrants in the harshest of terms  calling them among other things killers and rapists  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called Trump and asked him to tone things down But that if anything has reinvigorated Trump and his vocal supportersThe crowd in Phoenix began lining up outside the convention center before dawn with many spending hours in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees Hundreds of people who stood in lines snaking down several downtown blocks did not make it into the ballroom for his speechMany of Trumps supporters blame illegal immigrants for crime and economic problems but also express dismay over cultural changesWe dont recognize our country anymore said Jan Drake 72 who lives in a retirement community outside Phoenix If youre coming into our country you have got to conform to what we stand for You speak English You dont try to change our country to what your country wasAfter watching Trump on television the past couple of weeks Drake said that she has become convinced that he would be a very strong president He doesnt kowtow to anybody The Republican Party will try to squeeze him out because theyre afraid of him But he can tell them where to go  to pound sandAfter he walked onto a catwalk stage here like a rock star Trump basked in his crowd The word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration he saidWhile Trump was railing against Spanishlanguage broadcaster Univision a handful of protesters in the crowd interrupted Trumps security guards arrived to break up the skirmish that followed His supporters screamed USA USA USA in the protesters faces as the guards escorted them out of the convention hallI wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here Trump said from the stage He assured the crowd Dont worry well take our country backTrump also had harsh words for Islamic State terrorists If he becomes president Trump said They will be in such trouble  ISIS believe me I would take them out so fast You have to do itBut it was his crusade against illegal immigrants that had Trumps crowd most enthused After expressing shock that his immigration message has resonated so strongly with the GOP base Trump said The silent majority is back and were going to take the country back He walked off the stage to Twisted Sisters Were Not Gonna Take ItEarlier as his plush Boeing 757 headed from an appearance in Las Vegas to Phoenix Trump sat in a leather chair surrounded by binders of articles about him and sipping a CocaCola  the fullcalorie kind he noted because Have you ever seen a thin person drinking Diet CokeSomething is happening in America You may not want to see it but something big is happening People are sick and tired of politicians and Im here for them he said in an interview Im ready to go right at the Mexican government Im going to charge them 25000 per illegal immigrant and oh Ill make them payWould Bush do that Would Rubio I dont think so Trump added taking aim at two of his more mainstream rivals Bush and Sen Marco Rubio RFlaPolls consistently show that a majority of Americans including most Republicans support an overhaul of the law to give millions of undocumented immigrants a means of staying in this country legally But a passionate fraction of the Republican electorate believe otherwiseLou Brudnock 71 said he is attracted to Trumps brash truthfulness on immigration and his willingness to be politically incorrectThis country today is sad sad sad Brudnock said You cant say anything or they call you a racist Its like were back in Nazi Germany But look around man Its people here reading and listening to his messageTrump by virtue of his celebrity has provoked a backlash far more widespread than ever seen toward lesserknown immigration hardliners such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo R That means he could leave lasting damage to the GOP and whoever turns out to be its 2016 standardbearerAll of those crosspressures were in play Saturday at Trumps appearances here and in Las Vegas More mainstream Republicans had anticipated the spectacle and made no secret of their concernI had hoped that we had moved on from some of the coarse rhetoric said Sen Jeff Flake RAriz When theres so many candidates you can appeal to a very small segment of the population and get news and get elevated Flake is a leading proponent of a comprehensive immigration measure that would include a path to citizenship for those who are in the country illegallyArizona has been a hotbed of antiimmigration sentiment having passed a 2010 law that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect are in the country illegallyMaricopa County Ariz Sheriff Joe Arpaio  who in some ways is the face of that law having been the subject of racialprofiling lawsuits  helped warm up the crowd before Trumps arrivalI know that Donald Trump is speaking out Arpaio said Hes getting a lot of heat But you know theres a silent majority out hereWere not silent anymore a man in the crowd shoutedArpaio brought up the mostly dormant questioning of President Obamas birth certificate He and Trump are perhaps the most vocal of the birthers who falsely contend that Obama was not born in the United StatesImmigration also has gained new attention after the June 30 shooting death of a woman along San Franciscos heavily touristed waterfront allegedly by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times from the United StatesTrump  along with much of the rest of the Republican field  has criticized the policies of sanctuary cities where officials cannot detain those they suspect of being in the country illegally unless they have other grounds to do soRepublican strategists say that it is possible to address anxiety over illegal immigration within the GOP base without alienating the electorate at large Advisers to Bush and Rubio for instance say that their candidates can play a long game on the issue continuing to make a case for comprehensive changes to the law while waiting for the Trump boomlet to subsideYou can give a fuller picture of those types of people who are coming to America who are not documented who are not legal said Peter Wehner who was a top official in George W Bushs White House And you can speak about them in a humane and decent and true wayKaren Tumulty in Washington contributed to this report
