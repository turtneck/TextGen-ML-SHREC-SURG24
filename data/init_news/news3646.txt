Washington CNN Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch promised a better relationship with Congress during her confirmation hearing on Wednesday hoping to turn the page from her wouldbe predecessor Eric HolderLynch the US attorney in Brooklyn New York is President Barack Obamas pick to succeed Holder at the helm of the Justice Department a post that has increasingly become fraught with political controversies and clouded by Holder and Congress mutual contempt for each otherJust weeks after taking majority control of the Senate Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee praised Lynchs qualifications but used the hearing to prod her on a number of their top complaints with Obamas administrationThe panels chairman Sen Chuck Grassley RIowa opened with questions about the legality of Obamas move to forestall some deportations  and several other Republicans joined himBut Lynch batted those questions away sticking to legal arguments and noting that the Department of Homeland Security actually carries out many immigration enforcement policiesShe said shed reviewed the Justice Departments legal analysis of Obamas immigration moves and said I dont see any reason to doubt the reasonableness of those viewsLynch focused much of her time vowing that shell try to develop a much better relationship with Congress than the outgoing Holder hasWhile at times offering candor she also showed plenty of political awareness by deflecting many of the panels inquiries She told Sen Ted Cruz RTexas she couldnt answer hypothetical questions about future presidents use of executive authority and Grassley that since she hadnt been involved in the socalled Fast and Furious gun probe she couldnt tell him much about how the Justice Department has handled document requestsLynchs only big policy break with the Obama administration came on marijuanaShe told Sen Jeff Sessions RAlabama that she doesnt agree with Obamas previous comments that the drug is similar to smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol  and that she opposes legalizing its useI can tell you that not only do I not support the legalization of marijuana it is not the position of the Department of Justice currently to support the legalization she said Nor will it be the position should I be confirmed as attorney generalMarijuana and immigration were just a couple of the issues lawmakers  especially Republicans  brought upSen Lindsay Graham raised the Supreme Courts looming decision on the constitutionality of samesex marriage and asked Lynch to explain the legal argument against polygamyThe South Carolina Republican also asked Lynch whether she supports the death penalty to which she responded I believe that the death penalty is an effective penaltyLynchs hearing went as well as it could have and shes likely to be approved even though some Republicans will oppose her because of immigration alone said Carl Tobias a law professor at the University of RichmondShe seemed to give the GOP enough to differentiate her from Obama and Holder yet be able to serve effectively in the administration Tobias saidHe pointed to her comments that the Justice Departments legal opinion on Obamas immigration move seemed well reasoned without directly endorsing it and her commitments of loyalty to the Constitution and justice not Obama as she responded to Republicans questions He also said her nods toward improving the departments relations with Congress could helpThat was a key theme in Lynchs introductory remarks during Wednesdays daylong hearingI look forward to fostering a new and improved relationship with this committee the United States Senate and the entire United States Congress  a relationship based on mutual respect and constitutional balance she said Ultimately I know we all share the same goal and commitment to protect and serve the American peopleLynch has overseen highprofile financial fraud cases against banks terror cases including one against a wouldbe New York subway bomber and the corruption case against a former GOP congressman At the same time she has held a lowerprofile position than others who vied for the attorney general nomination which the White House hopes is an asset in her confirmation processHolder is a friend of the President and often endured battles with Republicans over various controversies related to Obamas policies These ranged from the Presidents plans to close the Guantanamo Bay Cuba military prison to the decision to stop defending federal laws banning recognition of samesex marriagesAfter years in the Senate minority unable to fully control investigations of alleged misdeeds by Holder Republican senators are using the Lynch hearings to replay certain controversiesGrassley included among witnesses in the second part of Lynchs hearing on Thursday a former CBS reporter who spent years reporting on the botched Fast and Furious gun operationFast and Furious was a gun probe run by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives intended to target crossborder gun traffickers The agents allowed thousands of firearms to be purchased by suspected traffickers many of which ended up in the hands of cartels in Mexico Two were found at the scene of a border firefight with traffickers that killed a US Border Patrol agentHolder denied wrongdoing in the threeyear controversy over the operation and he was vindicated by a Justice Department inspector general probeBut Grassley and other Republicans are still fighting to obtain thousands of documents the White House withheld from a House GOP investigationIn his opening statement Grassley said in the publics confidence that the Justice Department can do its job without the influence of politics has been shaken with good reason in recent yearsI for one need to be persuaded that shell be an independent attorney general Grassley said of LynchThe panels top Democrat Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont said Lynchs qualifications are beyond reproach pointing to her two Senate confirmations as US attorneyShes brought terrorists and cybercriminals to justice Shes obtained convictions against corrupt public officials from both parties he said adding that shes worked to improve law enforcement relationships with the communities that they serveSome Democrats raised warrelated issues Lynch told Leahy that she considers waterboarding to be torture and thus illegalLynch also pitched that she would be a capable liaison between law enforcement and minorities an area of increasing tension and importance to the Justice Department in the wake of recent police killings of unarmed black men and boysFew things have pained me more than the recent reports of tension and division between law enforcement and the communities we serve Lynch said in her opening remarks If confirmed as attorney general one of my key priorities would be to work to strengthen the vital relationships between our courageous law enforcement personnel and all the communities we serveLynch was introduced by New York Democratic Sens Chuck Schumer who called her a nosetothegrindstone type and Kirsten Gillibrand who said Lynch is one of our countrys most accomplished and distinguished women involved in law enforcement in the United StatesAt the hearing supporting Lynch were about 30 friends and family members  including members of her sorority Delta Sigma Theta who were clad in redBarring any surprises Lynch is likely to be confirmed  rejecting her means Republicans would continue the tenure of Holder who many in the GOP have pushed to resign
