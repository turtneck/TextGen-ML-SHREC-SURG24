Donald Trump visits Capitol Hill Thursday He will find some fellow Republicans who are struggling with the morality of supporting himHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueDonald Trump is making the rounds on Capitol HillThursday searching for unity with Republican leaders including reluctant House Speaker Paul Ryan But for some GOP lawmakers backing the brash billionaire  or rather not backing him  is more than a matter of agreeing on tax cuts or trade immigration or national securityI will not support Mr Trump Rep Carlos Curbelo R of Florida has told the CBS affiliate in Miami That is not a political decision that is a moral decisionIts hard to know how many of his colleagues share this view Congressman Curbelo who caucuses with the pragmatic wing of the conference says a lot of Republicans have such concerns some expressing it publicly and others privatelyOn Tuesday Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson former speechwriter to President George W Bush articulated the moral dimension in a commentaryThose who support Trump no matter how reluctantly have crossed a moral boundary They are standing with a leader who encourages prejudice and despises the weakThey are aiding the transformation of a party formed by Lincolns blazing vision of equality into a party of white resentment Those who find this one of the normal everyday compromises of politics have truly lost their wayThose are stiff words and interviews with several Republican lawmakers in advance of Trumps visit found that some did not agree with them Some say Hillary Clinton is also an immoral choice and for that reason theyre reluctantly backing Trump Others feel uncomfortable making a moral judgment at all or dont see this as a moral choiceBut personal and policy morality are always involved in the selection of our leaders says theRev James Weiss aprofessor of ethics at Boston CollegePersonal morality affects public behavior and public policy always has a moral dimension  whether lawmakers are dealing with abortion criminal justice welfare medical care or even trade and taxes he addsThe question is never whether morality plays a role its to what extent it does Reverend Weiss saysVoters  and politicians  will differ on that judgmentRep Tim Huelskamp R of Kansas also has moral issues with TrumpThe Kansan a member of the hardright Freedom Caucus questions Trumps positions on life family and marriage and so do a lot of other Republicans he says As a parent he also worries about Trumps languageI cant get comfortable with a candidate if Im worried about what hell say on TV in front of my 9yearold thats vulgar and crassHe says hes still sticking with Sen Ted Cruz even though the Texas Republican dropped out of the race last week after Trump took mustwin IndianaIn a lastditch effort to rescue his campaign in the Hoosier state Mr Cruz lashed into Trump calling him a serial philanderer among other things Trump has been open even bragging about his sexual exploits He told reporters back in December that his  indiscretions would be fair gamefor reporters even as hes made much of Bill Clintons womanizingBut other Republicans see things differently Rep Trent Franks of Arizona one of the most conservative members in the House says he understands Curbelos perspective Curbelo says he views both Trump and Mrs Clinton as dishonest and will vote for neither He points out that there are typically 10 candidates for president on a Florida ballotBut Congressman Franks argues that the choice is binary And when the antiabortion lawmaker compares Trump with Clinton on moral principles on respect for fellow human beings on protecting the Constitution and protecting the republic to keep it intact for future generations  on all those fronts there is no contest Clinton will bring destruction to us in all of those areas whereas Mr Trump mightFranks was one of Trumps most vociferous opponents in the primary As a conservative he says he cannot trust him to do the right thing But he knows he said Wednesday that I can deeply trust Hillary Clinton to do the wrong thing every time And so if it comes down to a vote between Trump and Clinton he will choose Trump and urge others to do the sameOn the Senate side another deep skeptic of Trump moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine says she wouldnt sit in judgment of the presumed nominee She has repeatedly called on him to stop insulting people to make amends with the Muslim community and others whom he has alienated But Im not going to judge him as a human being Indeed she has not foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting himSen Orrin Hatch R of Utah ducking into an elevator explained that Im a great believer in redemption and people being able to change their lives and hopefully hell fit that categoryBut thats a nave approach when it comes to selecting a political leader Reverend Weiss suggests We dont vote for people hoping theyll change any more than we should marry them thinking they should changeMuch more on target Weiss says is the view of Sen James Lankford R of Oklahoma who says that politicians reflect the values of the countryBefore Senator Lankford came to Congress he was the director of student ministry at the Baptist Convention of Oklahoma and of the Falls Creek Youth Camp the largest youth camp in the countryThe moral dimension is obviously extremely important to me personally he said in a brief interview on Wednesday But he said that people mistakenly want to denote and say that political leaders carry all the moral baggage and all the moral weight of the country Its the opposite he says Leaders such as Clinton and Trump are a barometer for where we are as a country and what we valueWashington cant fix wayward values in the nation he says the nation fixes WashingtonFor some Democrats Trump is just a reflection of Republican values in recent yearsSome Republicans  including members of their leadership  have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the Republican frontrunnersaid House minority leader Nancy Pelosi D of California in a press conference WednesdayBut year after year Republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation  whether its insulting President Obama women immigrants Muslims LGBT Americans theres not a dimes worth of difference between what Donald Trump says and what the House Republicans have been saying all alongLike other Republicans Lankford does a sidebyside with Clinton If it comes to that choice he says he will side with TrumpEditors noteRepresentative Huelskamps stance toward Trump has been further clarified from the original version
