After 11 hours a House committees questioning of Hillary Rodham Clinton provided few new details about the 2012 attacks on American installations in Benghazi Libya  and no clear victory for Republicans seeking to trap Clinton in an admission of bad judgmentThe marathon hearing of the House Select Committee on Benghazi concluded at 9 pm with a whimper As the hours passed Republican lines of questioning became increasingly opaque and partisan conflict riled members on both sides of the aisleClinton maintaining calm throughout the hearing received ample opportunity to defend her record and describe her commitment to the safety of US personnel while serving as secretary of state Only a handful of times did Republicans succeed in putting her on the spot more often engaging Clinton on topics that seemed tangential to understanding the 2012 attacks that killed four AmericansChairman Trey Gowdy RSC an ardent defender of the impartiality of his investigation insisted the time was being put to good useLearning about the four people who died  is worth whatever amount of political badgering that may come my way Ive seen the personification of courage and public service Im a better person for it he said late in the eveningClinton only obliquely mentioned the conflict surrounding Gowdys panel which two Republican lawmakers have suggested is politically motivated I recognize that there are many currents at work in this committee but I can only hope that the statesmanship overcomes the partisanship she saidRepublicans on the committee through the day had repeatedly asked Clinton about the special access she gave longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal who sent reports about Libya to the private email address that Clinton used for government business while she was secretary of state They have contrasted that with the treatment of US Ambassador to Libya J Christopher Stevens whose requests for greater security measures went through official channels and never bubbled up to Clintons deskHelp us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you Madam Secretary but the ambassador did not said GowdyThe sharpest questions of the day came from Republicans Jim Jordan Ohio and Mike Pompeo Kan Jordan accused Clinton of misleading the public about the 2012 attacks in order to help President Obamas reelection prospectsYou picked the account with no evidence You did it because Libya was supposed to be  this great success for the White House said Jordan who charged that Clinton had blamed the attacks on reaction to an antiMuslim video while knowing that was false And now you have a terrorist attack Its a terrorist attack in Libya And its just 56 days before an electionJordan was the first Republican in this hearing to spell out the alternate history of the Benghazi episode that many on the right believe is the correct one He spoke rapidly interrupting Clinton at times and personally accusing her of falsehoodsWhere did the false narrative start It started with you madam secretary Jordan said After his questioning period ended Gowdy gave Clinton a chance to respondI wrote a whole chapter about this in my book Hard Choices Id be glad to send it to you Clinton said I think that the insinuations that you are making do a grave disservice to those in governmentClinton said she had not intended to mislead but instead had sought to make sense of confusing intelligence reports from Libya and other places where protesters had overrun American diplomatic installations After that  prompted by a friendly Democratic congressman  Clinton told the committee that she had felt the loss of four Americans in Benghazi deeplyIts a very personally painful accusation that she had misled the public Clinton said Having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me I would imagine that Ive thought more about what happened than all of you put together Ive lost more sleep than all of you put together Ive been wracking my brain about what could have been done or should have been doneIn the next round Jordan returned to the line of questioning It became a parsing of a statement Clinton had issued about the attack afterward with Clinton and Jordan arguing about whether Clinton had blamed an antiIslam video as the cause of the Benghazi attacks Jordan became animated as he asked the questions repeating and restating his case in fast burstsClinton on camera smiled a small smile that indicated amused tolerance Her answer was slow and utterly forgettable which was the victory she wantedClinton testifies  then and nowPompeo pressed Clinton about why no one at the State Department had been fired in the aftermath of attacksWhy dont you fire someone Pompeo said How come no one has been held accountable to dateClinton responded that she had relied on inquiries into the attacks which found that State Department officials had made mistakes but no misconduct rose to the level of a firing offense In the absence of finding dereliction or breach of duty there could not be immediate action taken Clinton saidThe folks in Kansas dont think that was accountability Pompeo saidPompeo also asked Clinton a question related to her unusual email arrangement in which she used a private email account  and a private email server housed at her home in New York  to conduct State Department business That meant that people with her email address including longtime friend Blumenthal could reach her directly Why Pompeo asked had she not been made aware of requests for greater security at US outposts in Libya  passed through official State Department channels  but Blumenthals ideas about Libya got to her inboxHes a friend of mine He sent me information that he thought might be of interest Clinton said of Blumenthal He had no official position in the government and he was not at all my adviser on LibyaRepublicans asked relatively few questions about the issue that has dogged Clintons presidential campaign  her use of a private email account to conduct public business as secretary of stateThey did not delve into Clintons email practices until more than 9 hours of the hearing had passed At that point Rep Jim Jordan ROhio aggressively said that Clinton has shifted her story on the topic and questioned whether she has now turned over all her workrelated emailsClinton merely repeated what she has said on the topic many times before  she said using a private account was a mistake but the State Department now has all of her work correspondenceWhat Clintons emails tell us about her management stylePompeos questions put Clinton on the defensive for the first time on Thursday after other Republicans misfired with questions that strayed  in time or in subject matter  from the attacks that were supposed to be the hearings focus It was damaging enough that the next Democratic questioner Rep Linda Sanchez Calif played a video clip designed to attack Pompeo himself in which TV journalist Andrea Mitchell told Pompeo that he was wrong to say Blumenthal was a major adviser for Clinton on LibyaBut by 515 pm the hearing seemed to have lost steamRep Martha Roby RAla was no longer pressing Clinton about whether shed fulfilled her duties as secretary of state  instead she asked whether she had owed Stevens a personal phone call because he was her friendWhy did it not occur to you to pick up the phone and call your friend Roby asked I just want to hear from you why with all this informationdid it not occur to you to pick up the phone and call your friend Ambassador Stevens and ask him what he neededClinton replied again that Stevens had been given the chance to make those requests through official channelsAfter an evening break around 630 pm Rep Peter Roskam RIll sought to bring new vigor to the questioning In a choreographed gesture he tore a sheet of paper meant to symbolize Stevenss requests for additional security in Benghazi You created an environment Madam Secretary where requests didnt get through They didnt get through to you they didnt get through to your inner circle  the State Department breached its fundamental duty to secure his safety he saidI think its a disservice for you to make that statement Clinton repliedDemocrats as expected have used their time to toss Clinton softballs  or to attack the existence of the committee itself The questions are increasingly badgering I would even say increasingly vicious Rep Adam Smith DWash told Clinton late in the evening It seems to me that really the majority simply wish to wear you down It is clear that they are trying to attack you personallyAs the second round of questions came toward a close Rep Elijah Cummings the committees ranking Democrat asked Clinton about an allegation that has circulated among conservatives for years that she or somebody else in the Obama administration had told US military personnel to stand down and not rush to the rescue of those in BenghaziOf course not Clinton told the Maryland congressman Everybody in the military scrambled to see what they could do  logistics and distance made it unlikely that they could be anywhere near Benghazi in any kind of reasonable timeRepublicans  including Gowdy  seemed to hurt their own cause at times Several spent their 10minute periods on oddball lines of questioning One pressed Clinton repeatedly about an email exchange between two State Department staffers that Clinton said she did not know Others loudly remarked that Clinton was reading notes passed from aides a common practice at Washington hearings Another spent several minutes trying to prod Clinton into saying shed done something even more common than hearings A politician taking credit for somethingAnd repeatedly the Republicans were baited by Democrats into a timewasting fight over whether this committee was a partisan tool and if any of them should be there at all Just before lunch break Gowdy and several Democrats got into a loud argument about whether to release Blumenthals interview transcripts while cameras showed Clinton shuffling papersI dont know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans Clinton said to Gowdy before the intralegislator bickering beganFor Clinton her performance at the hearing was the continuation of a remarkable turnabout As of several weeks ago a revelation from this very committee  the existence of that private email account  had put her on the defensive and threatened to undermine her presidential campaignBut since then shes gotten help from another Democratic candidate Sen Bernie Sanders Vt who said in the Democratic debate that he like many Americans was tired of hearing about the emails A Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Calif seemed to validate Clintons longtime contention that the committee was a partisan tool not a real investigationThe Fix Why Was Hillary Clinton Speaking So SlowlyIn her opening statement Clinton sought to portray herself as above political questions and to portray the panel as secondguessing the necessary risks taken by US diplomats abroadShe began her testimony by naming the four dead She said shed known Stevens recommended him for the job and met his casket when it returned to American soil after the 2012 attacksNobody knew the dangers of Libya better than Stevens A weak government Extremist groups Rampant instability Clinton said But Chris chose to go to Benghazi because he knew that America had to be represented there at this critical timeIn her statement Clinton sought to get in front of the days questions which are likely to focus on the security precautions at the two American facilities where the four died It was a prebuttal to use the political term in which Clinton portrayed that kind of question as contrary to the spirit of diplomatic workRetreat from the world is not an option Clinton said America cannot shrink from our responsibility to leadClinton ended her opening statement with an admonition to the committee itself to ask questions that were not intended to undermine her politicallyIm here Despite all the previous investigations and all the talk about partisan agendas Im here to honor those we lost Clinton said My challenge to you members of this committee is the same challenge I put to myself Lets be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon usClinton needs to avoid a what difference does it make moment The committees chairman opened the hearing with a long defense of its right to exist Gowdy began by talking about his own work  defending his committee from allegations that it is a partisan effort disguise as a factfinding panel That suggestion was made by a top member of the House GOP Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Calif a few weeks earlier McCarthy pressed to say what results the Republican majority had produced noted that Clintons presidential poll numbers had declined after the House investigation began its workThere are people  frankly in both parties  that have suggested that this investigation is about you It is not said Gowdy a former prosecutor elected to Congress in 2010 It is about what happened before during and after the attacks that killed them It is about what this country owes to those who risk their lives to serve it And it is about the fundamental responsibility of government to tell the truthGowdy in his opening statement listed what he said were flaws in past investigations saying they were either incomplete or too close to the Obama administration He said that his committee was the first to discover valuable facts including that Clinton had used a private email server to conduct government business at the time of the attacksHe said that Clinton had not been interviewed on the Hill until now because of Clintons own email arrangement which meant she took valuable emails with her when she left officeYou kept the public record to yourself for almost two years Gowdy said And it was you and your attorneys who decided what to turn in and what to deleteRep Elijah Cummings the top Democrat on the committee followed Gowdy with his own opening statement  an attack on his own panels credibility Cummings charged that the committee had passed up chances to interview other government officials in order to focus on Clinton herselfThey set up this select committee with no rules no deadline and an unlimited budget And they set them loose madam secretary because youre running for president the Maryland congressman said Republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive effort to derail Secretary Clintons presidential campaignCummings noted comments from McCarthy and others that he said indicated the partisan nature of the committees work under Gowdys leadership He called the committee this taxpayerfunded fishing expedition
