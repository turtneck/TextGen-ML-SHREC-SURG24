Photo by Veni  CC BY 20 I trust that I am not the only one to have noticed that in rural areas and economically distressed neighborhoods in towns and cities lawn signs for Donald Trump are everywhere while Hillary signs are rarer than Teslas and Maseratis I think I understand the Trump signs they are cries of defiance Hillarys supporters are harder to figure out I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8 Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump they understand that by voting for Hillary they are embarrassing themselves Lawn signs apart the evidence that Trump is kaput is by now overwhelming He seems finally to have done his campaign in  to such an extent that even diehard antiTrump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons return to the White House Trumps campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced followed by a seemingly endless stream of women  a dozen or so already  accusing the Donald of groping them and worse Then in the third debate Trump announced that he would wait and see before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide deplorables And so the writing is on the wall Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow  well not quite but almost There is no reason to rejoice in her victory only in Trumps defeat And even that isnt as obvious as it seems  Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two The man is an adolescent in a septuagenarians body with a tendency to act out But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a humanitarian intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination This would include not only the usual victims countries incapable of harming the United States militarily but Russia and China as well It is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady and that Trumps crooked Hillary taunts hit the target more often than not These considerations and others like them should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply There is no need to agonize over these issues however not in this case When Trump became the Republican nominee lesser evil arguments became moot This would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clintons determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary and to her fondness for military solutions Lesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat even to her I have been pressing this point and its corollary  that antiTrump hysteria is a distraction  from Day One As recently as a month ago hardly anyone agreed with me If only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic I would be a rich man today But because it is now recognized that Trumps chances of becoming President are for all practical purposes nil no one is pressing that line these days I used to be out on a limb I no longer am It would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events and I would  but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory That prospect is at best only slightly less nightmarish Worse it doesnt seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary From the dead center to the soft left the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost not knock Hillarys campaign  especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty It is remarkable that so many people cannot let antiTrump hysteria go that they are so focused on Trumps misogyny temperamental instability and narcissistic blather that they dont see that the only thing we need fear where Trump is concerned is so to speak the fear itself However in Hillarys case there really is something to fear that she is about to become the CommanderinChief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world On that point her supporters are in denial and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals Apparently they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian fascism shall not pass How much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their cothinkers have helped fashion The best chance for that at this point is Jill Steins campaign on the Green Party ticket Stein cannot win of course a vote for her is only a protest vote But there is nothing wrong with that Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world as we know it and this is one of many ways to convey that message Pundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all I would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines But the racism nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey They therefore cannot register with any real clarity The message protest votes for Stein convey is on the other hand as clear and distinct as can be And if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states This would not make for much of a political revolution even in Bernie Sanders highly attenuated sense of the term but it would make future elections less mindnumbing and degrading and it could ultimately lead to more farreaching transformations of the political scene Now that Trump has all but killed off the GOP the duopoly party system is in jeopardy and all kinds of political realignments have at last become feasible  I wasnt just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trumps chances and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations Let the blogospheres political junkies and the corporate medias talking heads knock themselves out with that What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport Most of them are essentially apolitical I was confident that I was right about Trumps chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the elections outcome Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant but not by much This is especially true when as in this case disdain for one or the other candidate or for both is a dispositive factor in many voters minds I was also fairly sure that rightly or wrongly more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary and that if they didnt at the outset they would before long  because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donalds sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even Godfearing Republicans capable of believing almost any nonsense were bound eventually to be repulsed I suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President that he only got into the race to promote his brand and because he is an egotist and publicityhound Trump hates to lose however  especially to the likes of Hillary  and so at some point he must have decided to give the campaign his all even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him Should it come to that I will shed crocodile tears for his brood Ivanka especially A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible What a delightful irony that would be There are plenty of Hillaryhaters in the Donalds base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goodygoodyism or because they think she is disdainful of people like them people in the deplorables demographic or because they think that she is too leftwing The idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense of course she is not nearly leftwing enough That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the medias ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate But vast rightwing conspiracy Hillaryhaters are spot on right about the rest of it  and two out of three isnt bad Even so there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency They all have to do with the service Hillary has done and will go on doing for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of Americas and the worlds capitalist order and with her untrammeled ideologicallydriven bellicosity Hillary knows how to game the system and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so But for all her vaunted experience she is clueless about the world And although she and her fans boast of her pragmatism that woman is seriously inept Most of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived and nearly all of it turns out badly In short the lesser evil if that is what she is is a very great evil indeed It wont take long once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empires depredations for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters I am even more sure of this than I was of Trumps defeat but I will take even less joy in being proved right again What lies ahead with Hillary in control is too horrible to contemplate Join the debate on Facebook ANDREW LEVINE is a Senior Scholar at
