There was a mass shooting in Hesston KansasHarvey County Sheriff T Walton said that four people including the gunman are dead and 14 are wounded 10 critically after a series of shootings at an Excel Industries plant its parking lot and nearby streets according to theAssociated PressThe suspect was an employee at Excel Industries which makes lawnmower parts identified as 38yearold Cedric Ford A police officer shot and killed Ford who reportedly had an assault weapon and pistolThe gunman apparently began shooting after county deputies served him a protection from abuse order which are typically issued after violence in a relationshipThe order was served around 330 pm local time and the shooting began around 5 pmThe Kansas City Starreported that a womanwho identified herself as Fords livein girlfriend accused him of verbal and physical abuse prompting the protection orderFord also had several convictions in Florida forburglary grand theft fleeing from an officer aggravated fleeing and carrying a concealed weapon according to theAPThe shooting came less than a week after another mass shooting at Kalamazoo MichiganThe shootings are a devastating tragedy but unfortunately one that Americans are increasingly familiar with As more of these events end up in the news the country is being forced to consider why the US more than any other developed nation suffers from such extraordinary levels of gun violence And it seems easy access to firearms provide one answerNo other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada more than seven times Swedens and nearly 16 times Germanys according to UN data compiled by the Guardian These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate which includes nongun deaths than other developed nationsWhats more there appears to be a correlation between Americas high levels of gun violence and gun ownership as this chart from Tewksbury Lab showsResearch reviews by the Harvard School of Public Healths Injury Control Research Center have concluded that more gun ownership leads to more gun violence Other factors such as socioeconomic issues contribute to violence but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstancesStudies have found this at both the state and country level Take for instance this chart from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers showing the correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery ratesA more recent study from 2013 led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher reached similar conclusions After controlling for multiple variables the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 09 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state levelThis holds up around the world As Voxs Zack Beauchamp explained a breakthrough analysis in 1999 by UC Berkeleys Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not contrary to the old conventional wisdom have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations Instead the US appears to have more lethal violence  and thats driven in large part by the prevalence of gunsA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar Zimring and Hawkins wrote A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in LondonHow can the country address this The research shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicidesBut as Harvards David Hemenway told Voxs Dylan Matthews it would likely take decades for the mild gun control measures proposed in the US to have a significant impact Its all speculation Hemenway said I suspect it would take a while decades for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a we have so many guns which are durable and b we have a gun culture  we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countriesTo have a more immediate impact then the US would have to find a way to quickly remove the number of guns in circulation Other countries have actually done that In Australia after a 1996 mass shooting lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program that essentially confiscated peoples guns seizing at least 650000 firearmsAccording to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers Australias firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percentAlthough its hard to gauge how much of this was driven by the buyback program researchers argue it likely played some role First the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback Second firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback ratesStill similar policies would be difficult to pass in America a nation in which gun culture and ownership are tremendously ingrained  notably in the Second Amendment And gun owners are backed by a powerful lobby the National Rifle Association Combined these forces have stopped any serious gun legislation from passing at the federal level  although some states have passed new restrictions in the past few yearsBut given the research Americas policies and attitudes toward guns have clear deadly costs  including perhaps more events like the Hesston shooting
