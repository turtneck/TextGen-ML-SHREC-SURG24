The pair noted that although legislators are allowed to look at the text of the TPP in a secure room they are only allowed to do so under restrictions that make it nearly impossible to understand what they are readingFirst they cant bring expert staffers with them unless they have the right clearances and the aides who have expertise in various relevant areas  for instance on the impacts on the environment or labor law  generally are not clearedWe are unable to take any notes or consider what we just saw unless we have a photographic memory and unfortunately I do not Manchin said Ive tried to remember and look at things I knew I was looking for but still its almost impossible to walk out of there having the ability to sit down and evaluate what you just sawI taught the uniform commercial code and the bankruptcy code I am not afraid of hollow technical language But youve got to be able to dig into it youve got to be able to spend time and figure out the crossreferences and the terms of art Warren said Its difficult thick stuff to read and its set up to minimize your capacity to track all the pieces about whats happeningRight now if youre a staff member of the Finance Committee you can look at it But if youre one of my people who works for my intelligence staff that has clearance to see whats going on with nukes or weapons anyplace in the world or whats going on with the CIA they can do that but they cant look at that real precious agreement that theyve drawn up he saidHatch admitted somewhat uncomfortably on Thursday that its hard to know whats in the deal Look I dont know fully whats in TPP myself he said And Im going to be one of the most interested people on Earth when that comesBut he argued that the bill moving through the Senate to give Obama his fasttrack authority had plenty of transparency since it requires any trade deal such as TPP to be made public 60 days before signing it with foreign partners and another 60 days before Congress votesHatch conveniently overlooked that fact that even if lawmakers find specific problems in a deal there would be little they could do to stop it because fasttrack allows no amendments and no filibustersThe solution of posting a partially redacted version of a deal for everyone to see  before the president gets fasttrack powers  isnt a new idea or even a Democratic one Manchin said He pointed out that President George W Bush released the text of the Free Trade of the Americas AgreementHe did this months before he was granted fasttrack authority Manchin said He wasnt afraid to let us see He wasnt afraid of the American public to know what was in that  it didnt squelch the deal It didnt harm anythingManchin and Warren had hoped to pass their bill as an amendment to the fasttrack legislation but it was clear after the Senate advanced the measure Thursday that they wouldnt get the chance Instead they tried to get consent from Hatch to vote on it separatelyThe Administration has taken unprecedented steps to increase the transparency of our trade negotiations That includes working with Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to make the full text of negotiations and easy to understand summaries of each chapter available to all members of Congress in the Capitol for the first time ever  TPP negotiations are still ongoing Once TPP is completed the public will have months to review the text online before it is even signed by the President and then more time before a vote is ever taken
