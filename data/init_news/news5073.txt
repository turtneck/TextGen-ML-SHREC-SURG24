Lawmakers may have let President Barack Obamas request for the authorization of military force against ISIS gather dust but the White House insisted Friday it hasnt given up on the measure which was introduced in FebruaryWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest hammered lawmakers  both Democrats and Republicans  who have stalled on the war powers resolution saying the delay has been a grave disappointment to the White HouseAnd he characterized Congress unwillingness to vote on the plan as ironic given the steps lawmakers have taken to insert themselves into another of Obamas key foreign policy issues a nuclear deal with IranThe call from this administration to leaders in Congress to do their jobs has for some reason fallen on deaf ears Earnest said The United States Congress has been essentially AWOL when it comes to that debateThe White House convened multiple discussions on the AUMF with lawmakers before presenting the authorization measure two months ago Since then the White House has sent top national security officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter to brief members of Congress on the plan But their explanations for the AUMF didnt work to assuage anxious members of Obamas own party who worry a vote for the war authorization could lead to another American ground war in the Middle East Republicans on Capitol Hill blame Democrats for the standstill Rep Tom Cole ROklahoma said on CSPAN last week The president is essentially a war president without a war party Cole along with a bipartisan group of 30 other lawmakers addressed a letter to House Speaker John Boehner last week insisting he bring the AUMF up for debate But opposition to the plan runs deep in both parties Republicans say the plan doesnt give the president enough power to go after ISIS terrorists and they argue for less restrictive language The measure that Obama presented to lawmakers in February would limit his authority to wage a military campaign against ISIS to three years and does not authorize enduring offensive ground combat operations But it doesnt include any limitations on where US forces can combat ISIS should the terror group move outside Iraq or Syria The White House points out their document was merely a starting point  and claim theyre open to negotiation Administration officials say theyre committed to the absence of geographic limitations but are open to altering the time limit and ground troop provision As Congressional action on the AUMF continues to elude Obama his military is continuing its air campaign against ISIS The White House claims it already has the authority to target Islamic State terrorists using the 2001 war powers resolution that was passed after the September 11 attacks But Obama has said a new authorization is necessarily to put forward a united front in the fight against the Islamic State Ultimately the White House says its exhausted its options in pushing the measure forward I think weve done just about everything that is imaginable that an executive branch can do to try to move a law through the Congress Earnest said The president has higher expectations for elected leaders This birth certificate from the Halab Health Department records information for babies born in the ISIScreated province or wilayat Mothers are reminded how important children are to God and are then instructed to follow a vaccination timetable against polio measles and other ailments This notice declares that the University of Mosul will open on October 18 2014 but that the philosophy and archeology departments among others will remain closed Staff are told to replace all mentions of the Republic of Iraq with Islamic State A schedule for final exams at the Mosul College of Medicine shows areas to be tested included students knowledge of obstetrics parasites Xrays and ethics This notice criticizes the greed of some fishermen and lays out new rules including no fishing during spawning season and no use of electrical current to catch fish as it harms other creatures too This document poses a question on playing foosball Readers are told that its OK provided that there is no gambling no cursing or resentment and that the figurines have no heads This message quotes the Quran and speaks in favor of charity and helping those in need It then details how rents above 100000 dinars about 85 must be cut
