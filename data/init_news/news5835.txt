Holed up in Saudi Arabia the inner circle of President Hadi is rallying tribal leaders to resist Houthi rebels who control much of Yemen The risk is that if and when they regain power the central government will emerge with little authorityUber in court Is it a digital service or an unlicensed taxi companyUber in court Is it a digital service or an unlicensed taxi companyFrom the gilded suites and granite lobby of a luxurious fivestar hotel here the remnants of Yemens embattled government sees a daily lineup of Yemeni tribal leaders Western diplomats and Saudi military commandersOver countless cups of bittersweet coffee and dates and lobster and seafood dinners Yemeni ministers calmly toss out phrases like national dialogue and institution building as they talk up their postwar political plansThey lack the air of urgency or desperation of a government forced to take refuge with its powerful neighbor To hear them tell it they are a government poised to reclaim power from the Shiite Houthi militia and allied fighters that call the shots in much of their countryBut their blueprint for victory may contain the seeds of defeat for a unitary Yemeni state As in Libya the arming of local militia to oust a common enemy could make it even harder to restore central authority in the aftermath of a civil warOver the last two weeks the UNbacked Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has been working feverously to patch together a broad coalition of Yemeni tribes backed by Arab military intervention against the Iranianallied HouthisThe result is a tribal coalition of some 70000 fighters  and the pledge of a SaudiEgyptian expeditionary force Yemeni officials say they are preparing to retake the southern port city of Aden within days and thence fight for control over the rest of YemenFrom day one we have been building a coalition across all segments of Yemeni society to return the rule of law says Yasseen Makawi a close aide to Hadi who has led several talks here with Yemeni tribal leaders Hadi is currently in Riyadh living under tight securityWe will be in Aden soon to start the long fight Mr Makawi saysSo far the Saudiled bombing campaign hasnt stopped the advance of the Houthis which are backed by military units loyal to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh On Thursday these forces captured Ataq the provincial capital of oilrich Shabwa province after days of clashes followed by negotiations with local Sunni tribes according to news reportsFor Hadis exiled government the stakes are high In order to win over the support of dozens of tribes in south and central Yemen officials have agreed in future to devolve more government powers to the provinces and tribal regions threatening the unity of a state that was only reunified in 1990Yemeni tribal leaders see the situation as an opportunity to press for greater autonomy  and perhaps independenceWe are all for a democratic Yemen with greater powers in the hands of the people says Abdullah Kathiri head of the largest tribe in Hadrawmout a wealthy province in eastern Yemen who speaks openly about independence With this understanding tribes across the country are now willing to rise upSuch ambitions speak to the centrifugal forces being unleashed in Yemen Exiled officials concur that by arming and militarizing Sunni tribes across the country they may create a second Libya where tribal militias roam unchallenged and refuse to answer to a weak central governmentWe do not want to place heavy arms into the hands of tribes and have them act outside the army says Transport Minister Badr Mubarak BaSalma who has led talks with tribal representativesWe dont want to finally rid ourselves of Ali Abdullah Saleh to find ourselves with dozens of more Ali Abdullah Salehs Mr BaSalma adds referring to the longtime ruler who stepped down in 2012 Hadi replaced him as president under a Saudibacked transition that began to unravel last yearIn private Hadis inner circle concedes it may be a drawnout yearlong war against the betterarmed Houthi militias and military units loyal to Saleh which swiftly descended from their stronghold in the northern provinces of Saada and Amran to claim over 80 percent of Yemens territoryThe Houthis boast a fighting force of between 80000 and 100000 while forces loyal to Saleh number around 20000 Yemeni government officials and observers sayThe HouthiSaleh fighters boast superior firepower due to the fact that Salehs supporters include entire military units with fierce allegiances to their political and financial backer Some of this equipment is a legacy of US military aid to Yemen during Salehs rule which continued under Hadis governmentThe Houthis control vital military installations outside Sanaa and warehouses of RPGs tanks and armorpiercing grenade and rocket launchersGiven this superior firepower the Hadi governments strategy is to overcome the militias with greater manpower and urge tribal and political factions to rise up town by town village by village against what many Yemenis view as Houthi invadersSix military councils  regional groupings of officers loyal to Hadi  have been tasked with coordinating with local tribal militias and the Saudiled aerial campaignThe councils have succeeded in fostering armed uprisings in Aden as well Taiz in the oilrich province of Marib However due to the disparity in arms and lack of cohesive units the progovernment militias have failed to even secure Aden where Hadi had declared a provisional government after fleeing SanaaTo recapture Aden several hundred Egyptian and Saudi Arabian Special Forces are preparing to deploy in the port city With fighting intensifying in Aden Saudi and Yemeni official sources expect the operation within the next weekHowever weary of being dragged into a protracted fight Riyadh and Cairo have stopped short of committing ground troops to a wider war across YemenWe are committed to liberating Aden and reinstalling the democraticallyelected government but that is all that is being discussed says a Saudi military liaison close to the operationsInstead the joint Arab force would be used with surgical precision say government insiders using force only to turn the tide in key battles in southern YemenThe Hadi government has also received little commitment from the US and its Western allies officials say they left recent talks sessions with Western diplomats frustrated and dismayedThey want us to lead the war against terrorism and extremism in Yemen but they are allowing our country to be overrun by terrorist groups says a cabinet minister who refused to be named due to the sensitivity of the issueThe US has begun conducting aerial refueling of Saudiled coalition warplanes It has also vowed to speed up delivery of weapons to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf powersShould it regain a foothold in Yemen Hadis government is bracing for perhaps the largest obstacle in restoring control the northDespite rounds of marathon talks with northern tribal and political leaders in Riyadh Hadi and his team have reportedly failed to find ready and willing partners to stand up to Saleh and Houthi forces on their own home turfThere are opponents to Saleh and the Houthis in the north but they are afraid they are outmatched BaSalma says Only by breaking their military power will we break the fear and see people in the north willing to stand upIn return for their participation northern leaders want guarantees of greater power and influence for their region which was an independent republic during 196290 It received a privileged status and government jobs during Salehs three decades in powerThe government has been noncommittal so far on granting greater independence to the north beyond what it agreed in a national dialogue that ended two years ago But it has agreed to permit it greater autonomy under the federal systemHadi is also trying to peel away Saleh loyalists who might defect to the government side in return for an amnesty As an olive branch Hadi officials have promised not to dissolve military units that defect or to cashier their officers Instead they say the military must be reconstituted as an internal security serviceWe dont want to make the same mistakes in Iraq and turn thousands of Yemeni citizens into insurgents Mr Makawi says We are prepared to include the supporters of Saleh as an integral part of a stable federal Yemen state
