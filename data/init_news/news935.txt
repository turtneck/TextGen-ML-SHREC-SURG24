Lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that Marco Rubio knows what hes doingA week ago the youthful senator from Florida was in great shape His surprisingly strong finish in the Iowa caucuses left him with a clear chance to consolidate mainstream Republican support  and a path to the GOP presidential nominationBut in just a few minutes Saturday night Rubio undid everything he had worked for during the past year  really the past five years His singularly disastrous debate performance in which he repeated irrelevant canned phrases caused wouldbe supporters to flee for Ohio Gov John Kasich and other more stable candidatesAnd Tuesday night Rubio proved true the axiom popularized by Alan Simpson the wisecracking former senator from Wyoming One day youre the toast of the town the next youre toastThe culprit here as in most things that have gone wrong this campaign season is Donald Trump who after his convincing win in New Hampshire is once again the frontrunner for the nomination Typically Iowa and New Hampshire serve as proving grounds for the candidates Voters there scrutinize the contenders who rise and fall in the polls as various candidates gain and lose the status of frontrunner But Trumps celebrity shortcircuited the process With Trump dominating the coverage and the polls Iowa and New Hampshire failed to fulfill their traditional vetting rolesRubio was one who never got the scrutiny And when he emerged blinking into the spotlight after Iowa voters found an empty suit Watching him campaign last week I wrote Rubios strong Iowa finish has brought new attention  and overcapacity crowds  in New Hampshire But the wouldbe supporters are greeted by a robotWhat Marco Rubio would have said if he had won New HampshireThis wasnt necessarily a surprise to those who watched Rubio closely or even to those who recall his watergulping response to the State of the Union three years ago Buzzfeeds McKay Coppins who wrote about Rubio in a 2015 book observed that he had an incurable anxiousness  and an occasional propensity to panic in moments of crisis both real and imaginedHe had seemed to be a good debater  but with 10 or more candidates crowding the stage in early debates he didnt have to go far beyond canned lines On Saturday exposed to withering attacks from rival Chris Christie a former prosecutor Rubio suffered what was perhaps the most memorable lapse at the presidential level since Edmund Muskie appeared to weep in the New Hampshire snow in 1972Lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing Rubio proclaimed early in the debate as ungrammatical and offpoint He knows exactly what hes doingA moment later Rubio said again But I would add this Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing He knows exactly what hes doingAnd again Heres the bottom line This notion that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing is just not true He knows exactly what hes doingEven when called out by Christie for the mindless repetition Rubio said again We are not facing a president that doesnt know what hes doing He knows what he is doing Thats why hes done the things hes doneThe reviews were savage and then on Monday night RubioBot malfunctioned again Janette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century and we know how hard its become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats he told supporters then added In the 21st century its becoming harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throatsExit polls left little doubt that Rubios glitches ruined his prospects in New Hampshire Twothirds said the debates were important and of the nearly half of GOP voters who made choices in the last few days Kasich did far better than RubioThis left Rubio with 70 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday night languishing at 10percent of the vote He trailed not only Trump 34 percent but also Kasich 16percent Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush who was once left for dead Im disappointed with tonight Rubio said Tuesday acknowledging that I did not do well on Saturday nightThe results also left Republicans once again without a consensus alternative to Trump  and with dwindling hope of finding one Had Rubio received scrutiny earlier voters might have been able to find a candidate who didnt wilt in the spotlight But Iowa and New Hampshire didnt serve their functions this time Trump got in the wayRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
