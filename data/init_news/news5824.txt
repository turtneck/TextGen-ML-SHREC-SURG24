Washington CNN Donald Trump got a morale boost this week  but it likely wont be enough to propel him to the White HouseAfter weeks of devastating headlines the Republican nominee seemed to give himself a break He largely avoided incessant talk about allegations of sexual assault by multiple women and claims that the election is rigged  both of which made wavering Republicans nervousThe drumbeat of WikiLeaks disclosures yielded material to lambast Hillary Clinton and her familys foundation And news of rising Obamacare premiums gave him an opening to criticize President Barack Obamas legacy that Clinton is running to inheritTrump edged up in some state surveys and CNN moved two crucial states  Florida and Nevada  from lean Democratic to battleground status on its electoral mapBut 11 days before the election Trump is down six points in CNNs Poll of Polls His path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency remains daunting and it will be tough to overcome the deficit in the remaining time Trump seemed to acknowledge the challenges ThursdayWith the new changes CNNs electoral college map leaves Clinton with 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction Trump has 179 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in his direction That leaves 87 electoral votes up for grabs at the moment Trump will have to pitch a perfect game to secure the ones he needs especially as he struggles to pull states such as Virginia Pennsylvania or Michigan out of Clintons columnTo have a fighting chance in this election of getting to 270 electoral votes he has to win North Carolina Ohio and Florida If he does win all three that still gives him only 253 electoral votes said Ford OConnell a GOP strategist The biggest problem for the Trump campaign is overall where are you going to get 270 He basically almost has to run an inside straight and almost has to have them all fall into his handsTrump and his aides insist he has a path and momentum citing huge crowds long lines for early voting and the few polls in his favor A Fox News poll Wednesday put the national gap to Clinton at only three points and a Bloomberg Politics survey in Florida said he was two points upI think were going to have a tremendous victory Trump told CNNs Dana Bash Wednesday If I didnt think it I wouldnt say itTrumps schedule shows that he knows the stakesHe spent several days in Florida earlier this week was in North Carolina on Wednesday and spent Thursday in Ohio Without that trio Trump has no platform to mount what even then would be a long shot bid for the White HouseClinton is of the same mind She was in Florida Wednesday and plans to go back Saturday She campaigned in North Carolina with first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday Clinton could effectively stop Trump in his tracks if she can win either state  barring a huge and unpredictable upset elsewhereIf Trump does win North Carolina Ohio and Florida he can trace the narrowest of routes to 270 electoral votes by winning New Hampshire a congressional district in Maine Iowa and Nevada But Clinton is leading or in a tight race in those states Trump also cannot afford to drop any red state and is already fighting rearguard actions in Arizona and Utah and some Democrats believe that Georgia could be competitiveAgain Trumps travel is instructive  he is campaigning in Maine New Hampshire and Iowa on FridaySome Democrats worry Clintons biggest risk is that her voters think she has the presidency in the bag and will fail to show up to voteNo complacency here Clinton said Wednesday at a rally in Tampa Florida Donald Trump says he can still win and he is right That is why it is so important everyone gets out and votesClintons advisers also warn that the race will probably narrow in the days to comeQuite likely we are in store for one final round of tightening Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted WednesdayIn essence Trumps hopes rely on a huge turnout of his base voters who are largely white and working class He also needs significantly depressed enthusiasm among Clinton voters and a polldefying shock on the scale of Brexit the surprise British vote this year to quit the European UnionTrump has repeatedly said the polls are wrong And its true that some preelection polls underplayed the size of Obamas reelection victory in 2012 and the Democratic midterm election debacle two years laterBut if he goes into Election Day with his current deficit Trump would require a massive polling miss outside the margin of error in multiple statesThe Republican nominees own strategy makes his task even more difficultSince he has likely alienated minority and educated women with his rhetoric and behavior Trump must pull in vast numbers of new white voters  some who may have voted for Democrats in the past  to make up for the shortfallBut the Fox News poll like some other recent surveys suggested Trump is underperforming 2012 nominee Mitt Romney among this core constituency Romney won white voters by 20 points over Obama according to exit polls but Trump is only 14 points ahead of Clinton in the poll with the same voting groupTrumps problems with educated white female voters have been well documentedIf those numbers hold it means that the GOP nominee must reverse trends in which white voters have become a smaller share of the electorate in recent electionsThere are just not enough white men in these battleground states for him to win this election said Tharon Johnson who ran Obamas southern states strategy in his 2012 reelection bidStill Bloombergs poll of Florida does suggest Trump has some traction in the state he regards as a second home  even though most other recent surveys have given Clinton a lead of a few points Some close observers of Sunshine State politics do believe his intense campaigning is having an impactI think it has moved some polls He has been very strategic about going into some of the media markets where there are a lot of suburban voters said Professor Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida who does not rule out a late Trump surge Never say never in our state On paper it should be Hillarys to lose But its not an on paper election She has soft spots in her base so does Trump
