Anomalous signals from deep space often evoke a quick pulse of gossip and speculation about aliens that dies off soon thereafter when scientists are able to explain it Usually the explanation involves a natural cosmic process  an asteroid space detritus or frequencies from an exploded star Via AntiMedia Sometimes however the signals are too mysterious to explain Theres a reason why you may have seen a sustained social media buzz regarding aliens this past week A few days ago two scientists from Laval University in Quebec released a paper arguing they may have just received our first communication from extraterrestrialsScroll Down For Video Below First a bit of context This has been an exciting decade for those of us who stargaze in awe wondering how many sentient beings live in this incomprehensibly enormous universe of ours First the search for exoplanets accelerated dramatically aided by the Keplar telescope which has identified over 1000 planets outside of our solar systemWhile scientists have long known that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably contains several hundred billion planets the ability to study them had eluded us until fairly recently this ability will be exponentially augmented when the James Webb telescope allows us to analyze exoplanets atmospheres and search for traces of industrial gasses Additionally the discovery of Earthlike exoplanets  some of which are conceivably close enough to visit in a few decades  has tantalizing ramifications for our near future human raceEarlier this year scientists announced the incredible observation of a series of inexplicable brightness frequencies from the star KIC 8462852 which led many to speculate the signals could have been originating from a Dyson sphere a theoretical megastructure by which an advanced alien race a Kardschez type 2 civilization could harness the power of its sun The newest discovery from this star has made it even more unlikely that the signals are from natural causesThe newest strange signals hail from a gaggle of some 234 stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which analyzed the spectra of 25 million stars EF Borra and E Trottier the two astronomers who discovered the anomalies discussed them in their paper which was originally titled Signals probably from Extraterrestrial IntelligenceWe find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis they wroteThe fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis Of course it is far from certain that these are actual alien messages In an interview with none other than Snopescom Borra claimed he never actually used the word probably and that further confirmation was neededThe director of the SETI Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute Andrew Siemion issued an admonishing response You cant make such definitive statements about detections unless youve exhausted every possible means of followupSo why is everyone so excited The discovery appears to match a prediction Borra made in 2012 when he claimed aliens could very well use intermittent bursts of laser as a means of communication For his part Siemion plans to use his Breakthrough Listen Initiative to more closely assess several stars from the 234 sample Meanwhile Borra andTrottier Borras graduate student will continue observing the mysterious signalsIts an exciting decade for space research With plans for a mission to Mars in the hopper as well as an exploratory probe that will be sent to the moon Europa we may be witnessing the rebirth of the Space Race What better incentive could there be to venture further into space than the call of an alien species Lets hope that by the time we meet them our own species will have transcended its addiction to war and unsustainable resource allocation
