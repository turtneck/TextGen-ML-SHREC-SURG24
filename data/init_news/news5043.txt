The conservative justices on the Supreme Court gave little indication Monday that they were inclined to fully revive President Obamas stalled plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation and give them the right to work legally in this countryInstead the courts conservatives and liberals seemed split while hearing a challenge to the plan and a 4to4 tie would leave in place a lower courts decision that the president exceeded his powers in issuing the directiveThat would close Obamas presidency with perhaps his biggest legal loss and leave in limbo about 4 million undocumented immigrants whom the initiative was intended to help those who have been in the country since 2010 have committed no serious crimes and have family ties to US citizens or others lawfully in the countryIn questions and comments over 90 minutes the Obama administration did not receive support from Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr or Justice Anthony M Kennedy seen as most likely among the four conservatives to let the program proceedBut Mondays oral arguments may not tell the whole story Once the justices debate the case behind closed doors they could be motivated to search for a compromise to avoid the image of a court at an impasse after the February death of Justice Antonin ScaliaOne possibility might be for the court to recognize the presidents authority to set priorities on whom to deport but to limit the impact of such a designation on an immigrants ability to receive work authorization or become eligible for government benefitsGOPled states and Republican members of Congress say the presidents November 2014 guidance on deportation states that those with deferred deportation are lawfully present in the United States That term opens a number of opportunities and government benefits to them according to Texas and 25 other states that have objected to the planBut Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr representing the administration denied that the language was legally significant it would be more accurate to say the government is tolerating their presence he saidIf the court thinks its a problem and wants to put a red pencil through it  its totally fine Verrilli saidRoberts tried that out on Erin E Murphy a lawyer for the US House of Representatives who was given time to argue against the administrations policyWhy dont we just cross out lawfully present as the SG has suggested Roberts askedYou cant cross it out and achieve what the president intends Murphy said Whatever one calls it the administration means for those whose deportations are deferred to be able to legally work and receive government benefits she saidIn the arguments the court showed a familiar divide in confronting a fundamental tension of Obamas tenure whether the president is correctly using the substantial powers of his office to break through political gridlock or whether he has ignored constitutional boundaries to unilaterally impose policies that should require congressional acquiescenceHeres who will be affected by this immigration caseBut the future of the program depends on who takes Obamas place Republican presidential candidates have vowed to revoke it Democrats have pledged to expand itThe immigration program Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents DAPA would allow illegal immigrants in the affected categories to remain in the country and apply for work permits if they have been here at least five years and have not committed felonies or repeated misdemeanors Obama announced the executive action in November 2014 after House Republicans did not act on comprehensive immigration reformThe administration says the program is a way for a government with limited resources to prioritize which illegal immigrants it will deport As a practical matter the government has never deported more than 500000 undocumented immigrants per year and often sends home far fewer than thatJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was in agreement Inevitably priorities have to be setAdded Justice Sonia Sotomayor So they are here whether we want them or notThats correct Verrilli said and so the administration decided it would be better to have them be able to work legally400000 in Los Angeles could be shielded from deportation if justices give green lightBut Kennedy saw the action as doing much more than that It seemed he said that the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it Thats just upside downAnd Roberts said the administration saw no limit to Obamas authorityUnder your argument could the president grant deferred removal to every  unlawfully present alien in the United States right now he asked VerrilliBut Roberts did not seem convinced by Verrillis reference to specific undocumented immigrants whom Congress has said must be immediately removed such as those who have committed crimes or are apprehended at the borderTexas Solicitor General Scott A Keller called Obamas program an unprecedented unlawful assertion of executive power and added that DAPA would be one of the largest changes in immigration policy in our nations historySotomayor stopped him How can you say that she asked noting that previous presidents have also protected specific groups from deportationThe liberal justices seemed to agree with the administrations contention that the states have no legal standing to sue because it is up to the federal government to set immigration policy and that the Department of Homeland Security did not violate federal statutes in devising the programJustice Stephen G Breyer was most skeptical of Texass argument that it had standing to sue because of a state law requiring it to provide drivers licenses to those authorized to work He said it could lead to a flood of litigation on other mattersVerrilli said Texas could be relieved of what it sees as its burden in other ways But Justice Samuel A Alito Jr said the government would insist that the immigrants who receive deferred deportation have access to drivers licenses if offered to othersAt the beginning of the legal fight US District Judge Andrew S Hanen agreed with the state that because it would face a financial cost in providing drivers licenses to those covered by the new program Texas had standing to challenge the initiativeA panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld that decision on a 2to1 vote Circuit Judge Jerry Smith rejected the administrations argument that DAPA was a form of prosecutorial discretion in which a government with limited resources sets priorities for enforcementThe program Smith wrote is much more than nonenforcement It would affirmatively confer lawful presence and associated benefits on a class of unlawfully present aliens Though revocable that change in designation would trigger eligibility for federal and state benefits that would not otherwise be available to illegal aliensThe court granted time in the arguments to hear from the House of Representatives and from three Jane Does from Texas who would be eligibleMurphy representing the House said even Obama did not originally think he possessed the power to take the actionThree years ago the executive asked Congress to enact legislation that would have given it the power to authorize most of the people that are living in this country unlawfully to stay work and receive benefits and Congress declined she said Now the executive comes before this court with the extraordinary claim that it has had the power all alongThomas A Saenz of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund represented the Jane DoesThey seek the opportunity to apply for discretionary temporary and revocable relief from the daily fear that they will be separated from their families and detained or removed from their homes under the current nonuniform and frequently arbitrary federal immigration enforcement system he saidThe case is US v Texas
