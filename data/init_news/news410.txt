LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las VegasIt marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen Bernie Sanders IVt  will appear on the same stage in this campaign along with the other three candidatesThis campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady but it hasnt turned out that wayOne big reason seems to be the story that just wont away how she used a private email server to conduct government business Its fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rulesEven so Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont but Sanders is coming on strong Hes beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa tooPlus Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messagesWith the threat from Sanders a reality Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward Just recently she came out against President Barack Obamas big TransPacific Partnership free trade agreementThats a reversal because while serving as secretary of state she was for it This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her partyAs of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it Clinton said I dont believe its going to meet the high bar I have setSo tonight the drama will center on how much Sen Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stageExpect former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley to be an instigator Hes trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few monthsAs for Clinton herself shes trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite then ran into a buzz saw called Barack ObamaThis time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders
