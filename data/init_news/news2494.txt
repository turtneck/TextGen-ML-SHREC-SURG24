Puerto Rico defaults on a 422million debt payment Sunday but Congress cant agree on a rescue plan with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers wary of any bailout billA member of a labor union shouts slogans while holding a Puerto Rico flag during a protest in San Juan September 11 2015 Thousands of public sector workers demonstrated on Friday against an austerity plan to help pull Puerto Rico out of a massive debt crisis saying the private sector should take more of the pain The islands government is calling for shared sacrifice and concessions from citizens and investors alike as it tries to lift itself out of a 72 billion debt holePuerto Ricos May 1 deadline on a 422million debt payment has arrived and US lawmakers are no closer to finding a solution for the islands financial woesMost of Sundays payment is principal and interest due from the Government Development Bank Puerto Ricos main bond issuer and fiscal agentThat deadline is imminent but Republicans in the House and Democrats in the administration are still haggling over the terms of a bill to rescue Puerto Rico writes The New York Times Missing the payment risks further destabilizing its shrunken economy And there are concerns that the passage of any legislation could be delayed until the island nears the tipping point of its debt woes a 2billion debt payment due on July 1Before Congress left Washington Friday for a weeklong recess legislators were deadlocked over any plan that could be seen as similar to bailout bills of the 2008 financial crisis Rep Rob Bishop RUtah is leading a draft of a tentative rescue plan in the House but it has faced opposition from legislators in both parties who see the bill as nothing more than a bailoutFor me I think to any human being bailout means youre going to get money to solve your problem said Representative Bishop But the bill would give Puerto Rico access to a courtenforced debt restructuring in exchange for the imposition of a federal fiscal oversight board so the island would get no direct money out of the deal So to say its a bailout its obviously not just a stretch of the meaning of the word there has to be an ulterior motivePuerto Ricos Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla is frustrated with Washingtons inaction because he has warned about a default on Sundays deadline for months And while Washington may be at a standstill the financial crisis has everyday implications for the 347 million people who call Puerto Rico homeThe islands unemployment rate was 118 percent in March more than twice the overall US rate of five percent Tens of thousands of government workers have been laid off since 2009 to cut costs and 10 percent of the islands schools have been closed since 2014These personal hardships along with others have led to Puerto Ricos largest mass exodus in the last 50 years The island county has witnessed a 9 percent population decline in the 21stcentury with almost seven percent occurring between 2010 and 2015Population growth was once the norm in Puerto Rico explains Pew Research in a March study of population data from the US Census Bureau The islands population grew by 10 from 1980 to 1990 and by 8 from 1990 to 2000 But as the effects of a decadelong economic recession have mounted Puerto Ricans  who are US citizens at birth  have increasingly moved to the US mainland with many settling in FloridaAccording to the Census Bureau data economic opportunity is a primary driver for the mass outmigration 40 percent of the islandborn Puerto Ricans moving to the continental US say their main reason for moving was jobrelated and another 39 percent cite family and household reasonsBut the continental US is not immune to Puerto Ricos financial illsA massive default from Puerto Rican bonds can create a financial contagion in the US municipal bond market Jose CaraballoCueto Director of the Census Information Center at the University of Puerto Rico writes for NBC News And the new influx of Puerto Ricans to the continental US will further strain our countrys public services adds Dr CaraballoCueto as the majority of islanders moving to the mainland are very poor Moreover US exports  especially agricultural products  to Puerto Rico will be reduced even further if the Great Depression of Puerto Rico deepensAnd regardless of future side effects of the islands bankruptcy on the overall US economy the US government has a shared responsibility on Puerto Ricos crisis notes CaraballoCueto Not only has the US banned Puerto Ricos access to federal and local bankruptcy laws that could have restructured 70 percent of the countrys debt but it has also upheld a marine law from 1920 the Jones Act that cripples the countrys international trading by essentially only permitting US ships to enter or leave Puerto Rican ports as all other foreign vessels are subject to absurdly high customs and import feesMost people think July 1 is atomic bomb day Sergio Marxuach public policy director of the Center for a New Economy in Puerto Rico tells The Washington Post  May 1 is still significant
