Donald Trump needs to stop the bleedingSince the two parties conventions he has plummeted in the polls  both nationally and in the statesHis campaign knows this His new campaign manager KellyAnne Conway is a veteran Republican pollster well aware of Trumps deficiencies with certain voting groupsThats why theres been a concerted effort in the Trump campaign to reach out to black and Hispanic voters even if its been poorly received by many nonwhitesBut the outreach might not be entirely to gain the support of minority voters who are deeply skeptical of Trump and indicate they are supporting Hillary Clinton overwhelminglyIt might be aimed in large measure at white people in particular suburban whites with college degrees You know people who traditionally vote Republican They might be persuadable given their past voting history but they dont want to vote for someone who is viewed as a racist or a bigotSo his campaign is trying to change that Trump has been speaking specifically about black voters at multiple events over the last week or so though in front of predominantly white crowds in Wisconsin Ohio Texas and Florida He held an event Wednesday night in Jackson Miss where 4 in 5 residents are blackThat outreach continues Thursday at an event at Trump Tower where black and Latino leaders are supposed to join Trump And there will perhaps even be a tour of Detroit led by Ben Carson who grew up there in early SeptemberBut how can it be that Trump has a white people problem Isnt he supposed to be the candidate who appeals squarely to whitesLets take a look at the polling What it shows is that Trump is underperforming with whites compared with Mitt Romneys performance in 2012White women Romney won white women by 14 points  5642 percent according to national exit pollsTrump in the latest NBCWall Street Journal poll released this month is down a point with the group 4342 percentThats a 15point shift No Republican can afford thatTrump is supposed to drive up the score with white men But according to NBCWSJ hes only up 13 points 4936 percent far less than RomneyAnd lets remember Romney lost in an electoral landslide to President ObamaA big problem for Trump is when education is factored in He is struggling to win the margins he needs with whites with college degrees Just look at this chart of Trumps massive deficit with white women with college degreesWhats stunning about this is that Democrats have never won a majority of white voters with college degrees since exit polling began in 1976And when it comes to white voters without a college degree even here Trump is only doing about as well as Romney did Romney won 61 percent of whites without a college degree Trump in the latest CNNORC poll gets the support of 59 percentYes Romney lost by big margins with nonwhite groups too but white voters made up 72 percent of the electorate in 2012 likely to be slightly less this year Trumps campaign has to think theres nowhere to go but up with minority voters  except right now Trump is doing worse or almost similarly bad with both AfricanAmericans and Latinos alsoMaybe Trumps outreach to minorities can change his standing somewhat with those groups But an important group he needs to reach are those white voters who should be traditionally open to voting Republican but are not behind him right nowThats a point Republican pollster Whit Ayres made as well this week to the Washington PostAfter 15 months of denigrating every nonwhite minority in sight its hard to believe that he can actually do significantly better among nonwhites said Ayres who wrote the book 2016 and Beyond How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America He joined Marco Rubios campaign as his pollster But he may be able to soften his image a bit with some Republican and maybe a few independent whites who have been put off by his harshness thus farBut this is a big hole to climb out of in less than 11 weeks
