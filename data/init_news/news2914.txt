Work can be a fourletter word in our culture Pundits demagogue against successful businesses and demonize the onepercent as financial parasites said to be profiting unfairly Charitable and nonprofit work is extolled often as a better way to help a community But in truth if you want to change the world consider starting a business that makes a tangible contribution to the lives of the people around youIts interesting that in the Bible so many of the greatest leaders had a day job Jesus was a carpenter Luke a doctor Moses a shepherd Deborah a judge Paul a tentmaker  the list goes on While the Bible does describe duties for people of faith who are in church work the larger message of scripture is that whatever you do in word or deed do as unto the LordAmong the community of believers and in our current modern day culture a prejudice has developed against mainstream secular work as a way to make a significant contribution to a community This attitude ignores the very real impact that a good paying job has on a person a family the community and even the world at large With Americans spending an average of 47 hours a week at work its time to consider whether a better way to change the world is to make it better at workOne reason that people may be dreaming of nonprofit work is that so many dont like their jobs Most people  8 out of 10 in fact  hate their jobs and may be dreaming of a different kind of life according to Deloittes Shift Index Survey If that is even partially accurate its easy to understand how people can dream of a life of doing something good for others that feels more worthwhile than dealing with a curmudgeon for a bossEven as job creation has dramatically declined with a 38year low in the labor force participation rate an increasing number of people have chosen to join the nonprofit world From 2001 to 2011 the number of nonprofits in the United States grew 25 percent while the number of forprofit businesses rose by half of 1 percent according to the most recent figures compiled by the Urban Institute noted the New York Times In fact according to the National Center for Charitable Statistics more than 15 million nonprofit organizations of all kinds are registered in the United StatesStill most people spend their days in forprofit companies as nonprofits employ 10 percent of the workforce in 2010 accounting for about five percent of Gross Domestic ProductSince 911 theres been more of a  I dont mean this to sound pejorative  kneejerk reaction to start a new charity whenever something goes wrong  however very few of these charities are going to last said Chuck McLean vice president of research for GuideStar which tracks nonprofit activityFrankly nonprofit and ministry jobs are still work with all the ups and downs of employment Many in charitable efforts find its not as glamorous at it might look from the outsideConsider the ultimate job from the nonprofit world the local pastor A Fuller Institute Project that began in 1998 and picked up in 1998 by the Francis A Schaeffer Institute of Church Leadership Development took a look at how pastors were handling the pressures of caring for a hurting community With more than 18 years of data to consider research found that 70 percent were so stressed they often considered leaving the ministry while 35 to 40 percent actually did give up after about five yearsNo matter the profession one way that you can practically care for people is to create jobs in an environment that cares for and values people both customers vendors and employeesIts fascinating that today the most popular fastfood chain comes from a company that does not hide its family values while making sure every customer gets a good mealConsider the rise of the humble chicken sandwich at Chickfila a high quality product in an enjoyable environment in a company that cares for its employeesAnd importantly those with a job have the means to contribute time and moneySometimes called Tentmakers referencing the Apostle Paul who supported himself with his skill volunteers who financially support themselves with outside employment are invaluable for cashstrapped charities Those with means make a huge difference Consider Luke 8 where we learn about some wealthy women who contributed to Jesus ministry on earth out of their private meansGood jobs with a steady income empower Americans to be the most charitable people in worldAccording to the National Philanthropic Trust almost 96 percent of American households donate to charity giving an average of more than 2900 In fact even as the economy has been stagnant Americans increased their giving 71 percent from 2013 to 2014 the last figures availableGiven the pressing needs of the world a profitable company that provides a lifetime of opportunity for employees excellent service for the community and a source of income that can allow employers and employees alike to contribute to the needs around them is world changingA good job provides the means to give back remembering the instructions in in Deuteronomy 1617 Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed youRobert Dickie III
