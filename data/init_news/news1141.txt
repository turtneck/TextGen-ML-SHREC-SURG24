It was rare for poet and singersongwriter Leonard Cohen to venture into the realm of politics however quite a few of his songs including some of his love songs were infused with a bleakness that confronted morality and the darkness of humanity He also wrote a song of hope and possibility about the experiment of democracy in the United States that perhaps takes on a new kind of resonance in the wake of the election of Donald TrumpCohen was asked in 2014 if songs can offer solutions to political problems He replied I think the song itself is a kind of solutionAnd so to pay tribute to a troubadour who died at 82 and whose artistic work only seemed to get better as he aged and his voice grew deeper here is a retrospective on some of the more philosophical and sociopolitical songs he composedJoan Of Arc 1971 Cohen declared in an interview for Rolling Stone in 1971 Women are really strong You notice how strong they are Well let them take over Let us be what were supposed to be  gossips musicians wrestlers The premise being there can be no free men unless there are free women He believed it was just for women to gain control of the worldWith that context this elegiac narrative takes on greater gravitas It consists of a dialogue between Joan of Arc and the Fire as she is burnt at the stake The womens movement was flourishing at the time and Cohen saw Joan of Arc as a symbol of courage Yet he also recognized she may have been lonely because she had to disguise herself as a male soldier and he imagined what it was like to fight English domination of France and in her final moments face down the fact that she would never return to what could be considered an ordinary lifeDance Me To The End Of Love 1984 During a CBC radio interview in 1995 Cohen said the song came from hearing and reading or knowing that in the death camps during the Holocaust beside the crematoria the string quartet would be pressed into performance while this horror unfolded Cohen sings in the opening Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin Dance me through the panic til Im gathered safely in Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove The song represents an embrace of passionate acts in the face of atrocities and deathIf It Be Your Will 1984 This is a truly grim song in which Cohen is probably using the specter of a benevolent oppressor or fascism as a metaphor for the next stage of a relationship And yet the lyrics are subtle enough that Cohen may be addressing morality and how easy it is to convince men to carry out heinous acts He sings All your children here in their rags of lightIn our rags of lightAll dressed to killAnd end this nightIf it be your willFirst We Take Manhattan 1987 The song is about terrorism or militant extremism It is told from the perspective of an individual who tried to work within the system in order to change it That failed Now the individual has taken solace in the beauty of his weapons and turned to Manhattan and to Berlin to make his or her markIn a 2007 interview for XM Radio he said Theres something about terrorism that Ive always admired The fact that there are no alibis or no compromises That position is always very attractive I dont like it when its manifested on the physical plane I dont really enjoy the terrorist activities but psychic terrorism I remember there was a great poem by Irving Layton that I once read Ill give you a paraphrase of it It was well you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there he says But our terrorists Jesus Freud Marx Einstein The whole world is still quakingWhat Cohen meant albeit in a very cynical way is the philosophies of these people have such a history of being used to justify horrible acts He never engages with the subject fully and probably never wanted to do so but Cohens song clearly approaches the issue of statesponsored political violence versus political violence of the individualEverybody Knows 1988 It is one of the most wellknown songs he ever recorded The wry cynicism diagnoses the realities of a cruel world In the neoliberal age of austerity the opening lyrics are exceptionally appropriate Everybody knows that the dice are loaded Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed Everybody knows that the war is over Everybody knows the good guys lost Everybody knows the fight was fixed The poor stay poor the rich get rich Thats how it goes Everybody knowsCohen sings Everybody knows that youre in trouble Those in charge of the social order are indifferent to the pain and suffering of the masses But are the owners and politicians capable of maintaining control Because everybody also knows that it is coming apartDemocracy 1990 Cohen described in an interview with Paul Zollo that he wrote the song after the Berlin Wall came down Everyone was saying democracy is coming to the east and I was like that gloomy fellow who always turns up at a party to ruin the orgy or something And I said I dont think its going to happen that way I dont think this is such a good idea I think a lot of suffering will be the consequence of this wall coming downThat seems strikingly backward But it motivated Cohen to ask Where is democracy really coming He thought there may be more democracy coming to the United States From a love of America he wrote a song that is really about the irony of America a song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country He added This is really where the experiment is unfolding This is really where the races confront one another where the classes where the genders where even the sexual orientations confront one another This is the real laboratory of democracyGiven the American exceptionalism of Cohens statement he could have easily produced something with lyrics Lee Greenwood would have proudly belted out on stage However each time Cohen sings Democracy is coming to the USA there is a raw irony it like he does not believe the forces running this nation are capable of democracy Then theres the inimitable line Im sentimental if you know what I mean I love the country but I cant stand the scene It makes it clear Cohen was a disappointed idealist Like so many he liked the idea of America but seeing it play out on that hopeless little screen was never quite what he had in mindThe Future 1990 For this song Cohens character looks into the future and it is not good at all It is so frightening in fact that he thinks he would be willing to see fascist society restored Give me back the Berlin wall Give me Stalin and St Paul Give me Christ or give me HiroshimaThe song hurdles onward into more nostalgia for familiar horror Destroy another fetus now We dont like children anyhow Ive seen the future baby it is murder He has no hope that humanity can right itself Civilization can try and erect a social order with a tyrant or it can unravel tyranny and push for something more just Yet inevitably to Cohens character there will be murder In which case what really is the right thing to doOn That Day 2004 Cohen wrote this as a response to the September 11th attacks It is an artifact that represents reactions to what happened He sings Some people say its what we deserve for sins against god for crimes in the world There are others who blame it on the fact that women live unveiled or because the country has its fortunes as well as people who are subjugated Whatever the case may be Cohen does not seek to settle the discussion Rather he seems more interested in whether those who survived were able to press onward So he poses a rhetorical question Did you go crazy or did you report on that day Then the song abruptly endsAmen 2012 This song comes from the latter era of Cohens life where the sultry nature of his music took on a much more wistful and brooding characteristic He wrote about love but love in a time of war or love with inescapable horror all aroundIn Amen the character Cohen channels desperately wants to love He must first see through the terror around him He does not think he can love until the victims are singing and laws of remorse are restored He does not think he can love until the day has been ransomed and night has no right to begin He awaits some kind of redemption and only then will he be able to feel wanted again but there is too much despair and destruction right now for the character to indulge in pleasureAlmost Like the Blues 2014 We live in a world of permanent war and so in this gorgeously layered piece of music Cohen grapples with atrocities he witnessed I saw some people starving There was murder there was rape Their villages were burning They were trying to escape I couldnt meet their glances I was staring at my shoes It was acid It was tragic It was almost like the bluesFew of Cohens songs are as profound The song which appears on Popular Problems could easily be grappling with what goes through the minds of war criminals He sings I have to die a little between each murderous thought and when Im finished thinking I have to die a lot The soldier witnesses torture or is party to it He witnesses killing or is party to it And theres all my bad reviews It seems his superiors are unhappy with his performance Maybe they do not think he is killing enough Whatever the case may be he has lost his grip on morality entirely and finds himself confronting the scope of his sinsA Street 2014 To Cohen Popular Problems was all about dealing with defeat  He told the Telegraph the lyrics were about facing down failure disappointment bewildermentespecially the dark forces that modify our lives What is a person to doRecognize that your struggle and your suffering is the same as everyone elses Cohen suggested I think thats the beginning of a responsible life Otherwise we are in a continual savage battle with each other with no possible solution political social or spiritualWhile referring to A Street which is about a faltering romance during war he added When I say the partys over but Ive landed on my feet Im standing on this corner where there used to be a street I think thats probably the theme of the whole album Yeah the scene is blown up but you just cant keep lamenting the fact There is another position You have to stand in that place where there used to be a street and conduct yourself as if there still is a streetIn a very basic sense the master of romantic despair the high priest of pathos has now gone up to that Tower of Song meant people have to find ways to keep living They have to exist and by existing that is in and of itself an act of resistance to all the depravity that unfolds around themThe post The Political Songs Of Leonard Cohen appeared first on Shadowproof
