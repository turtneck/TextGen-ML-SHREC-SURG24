NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Black Americans Going For Donald Trump In Record Numbers As Election Day Approaches Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many AfricanAmerican voters  especially younger voters who backed Sen Bernie Saunders  distrust Clinton said Wayne Bradley state director of AfricanAmerican engagement for the Michigan Republican Party by Geoffrey Grider November 5 2016 Donald Trump is on track to double Gov Mitt Romneys support among AfricanAmerican voters according to a series of state polls In 2012 AfricanAmericans comprised a record 13 percent of all voters President Barack Obama was reelected with 93 percent of the AfricanAmerican vote leaving Gov Mitt Romney with only 6 percent of the AfricanAmerican vote Obama is now campaigning against Trump and hoping to keep his share of the AfricanAmerican vote below the 11 percent that George W Bush won in 2004 during the housing bubble On Friday  a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 1846 percent of AfricanAmericans Thats eight points more than Romneys share of the national vote in 2012 and if it proves true during the ballot that 1846 percent AfricanAmerican support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump The poll also said another 46 percent were undecided Trump acknowledges Blacks for Trump supporters The Harper poll is small  with an error margin of 44 percent but an Oct 30 poll of 1249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans while another 7 percent remain undecided That poll has a error margin of 277 percent In nextdoor Michigan two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support leaving Clinton with 83 percent and 79 percent support Thats equivalent to a twopoint shift from Clinton to Trump in the state Were showing Donald Trump doing far better among AfricanAmericans than any other Republican in modern memory said John Yob CEO of a Michiganbased polling firm Strategic National  Trump has done an excellent job in campaigning for the votes of AfricanAmericans he said partly by campaigning in Detroit said Yob whose automated tracking polls show Trump and Clinton running level in the state Black Trump Supporters Explain Why They are Voting for Donald Trump Donald Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many AfricanAmerican voters  especially younger voters who backed Sen Bernie Saunders  distrust Clinton said W ayne Bradley state director of AfricanAmerican engagement for the Michigan Republican Party T here is a tremendous trust deficit with Hillary Clinton because tough anticrime laws established when her husband was president in the 1990s he said That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before Bradley said Faced with a low turnout the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten AfricanAmericans to vote but t hats not a convincing enough argument he said Detroit as of Wednesday had seen absentee ballots returns equaling just 46 percent of the total 2012 absentee vote in the city and the city clerks office is forecasting a decline of 10000 absentee ballots compared to 2012 a fall of 125 percent according to a review of absentee records by the Gongwercom website which intensively tracks Michigan politics It is possible that the falloff portends reduced election day voting at the precincts in which case  Clinton could net something like 32000 fewer votes out of the city than President Barack Obama did in 2012 But other polls offer better news to Clinton A Detroit Free Press poll of 600 likely Michigan voters released Nov 4 showed that Among black voters her margin also grew substantially to 92 compared to 88 two weeks ago National Trends Trumps gain among AfricanAmerican voters is happening in many states alongside an overall reduction in AfricanAmerican enthusiasm and support for Obamas designated successor That dropoff in support from Obamas 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton MSNBC reporter wasnt expecting Black Americans to vote for Trump Thats a problem for Democrats because a 75 percent drop in nationwide AfricanAmerican turnout would be equal to a onepoint drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton Reports say the earlyvoting turnout by AfricanAmericans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida  President Barack Obama and other top Democrats have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a highstakes emotional competition For example a large slice of AfricanAmericans are picking undecided in some polls The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among AfricanAmericans but the fine print in the article says Clintons score is 82 percent and Trumps score is 3 percent  leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate So if Trump gets just oneinfive of the undecided AfricanAmerican voters he reaches Romneys 2012 level Blacks for Trump Its a Thing Some concerned people lie to pollsters For example roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when theyre ask by pollsters over the phone perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public So when polls show a nonanswer from respondents for example many undecided voters the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump These factor may be impacting polls of AfricanAmericans who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers  the Klan  and hesitate when asked about that support then youll tolerate that support when youre in office Obama told an AfricanAmerican crowd in North Carolina on Nov 3 For example Public Policy Polling  which mostly works for Democratic clients  used phone interviews in a poll that showed Trump with just 9 percent support in Michigan among 957 likely voters of whom 12 percent were AfricanAmerican The poll said none of the roughly 110 AfricanAmericans were undecided in a twoperson race even though 8 percent said they were unsure when they were asked if they had a favorable view of Trump In contrast the Harper Polling survey in Pennsylvania got very different answers from AfricanAmericans Trump got 185 percent support in a fourperson race although many respondents waffled when they were asked to pick between just Clinton and Trump When asked to pick either of the two main candidates only 123 percent supported Trump while 139 percent declared themselves to be undecided So Trump actually picked up half of the undecideds when the respondents were allowed to chose from the four candidates Polls A national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all nonwhites including Hispanics AfricanAmericans and Latinos That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of nonwhites  leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates In North Carolina 19 percent of AfricanAmericans support Trump according to an Oct 30 survey of 1176 likely voters by Remington Research Group An Oct 28 to Oct 31 poll in North Carolina by SurveyUSA showed Trump with 14 percent support in a poll of 800 adults including 659 likely voters AfricanAmericans comprised 21 percent of the voters in the poll SurveyUSA is the topranked pollster in Nate Silvers rankings  But a late October poll of AfricanAmericans in North Carolina by Siena University showed 89 percent support for Clinton and 1 percent for Trump  but it also showed 6 percent staying they did not know who they will vote for and 11 percent support for the GOP Gov Pat McCrory In Florida a Siena University poll showed that Trump had the support of 13 percent of AfricanAmericans More ominously for Clinton she had the support of only 83 percent while 4 percent said they didnt know who to vote for If Trump gets onequarter of the 4 percent he reaches 14 percent of the AfricanAmerican vote leaving Clinton with roughly 86 percent In Virginia a survey by Public Policy Polling taken in Nov 3 and Nov 4 showed Trump with 9 percent support and Clinton with 91 percent support A Remington Research automated poll of 1106 likely voters in Virginia showed Trump with 19 percent  and Clinton with just 78 percent support In Georgia a Nov 2 to Nov 3 poll of 1000 likely voters showed Trump with 12 percent of the AfricanAmerican vote leaving Clinton with 85 percent Amid the disagreement rivalries and complexity Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among AfricanAmericans His final tally as the GOP candidate will be a higher number that it has been in the past because hes working hes coming to these cities to deliver the message The AfricanAmerican vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the socalled blue wall of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House source SHARE THIS ARTICLE
