WASHINGTON  The United States is a significantly less Christian country than it was seven years agoThats the top finding  one that will ricochet through American faith culture and politics  in the Pew Research Centers newest report Americas Changing Religious Landscape released TuesdayThis trend is big its broad and its everywhere said Alan Cooperman Pews director of religion researchChristianity still dominates American religious identity 70 but the survey shows dramatic shifts as more people move out the doors of denominations shedding spiritual connections along the wayAtheists and agnostics have nearly doubled their share of the religious marketplace and overall indifference to religion of any sort is rising as well Only the historically black Protestant churches have held a steady grip through the years of changeRemember the familiar map of American religion The South A bastion of white evangelicals The Northeast Cradle of Catholics The Midwest Nest of Mainline Protestants The West Incubator of nones  people who claim no religious brand labelWell scratch all that in the new topographyThe shrinking numbers of Christians and their loss of market share is the most significant change since 2007 when Pew did its first US Religious Landscape survey and the new equally massive survey of 35000 US adultsThe percentage of people who describe themselves as Christians fell about 8 points  from 784 to 706 This includes people in virtually all demographic groups whether they are nearing retirement or just entering adulthood married or single living in the West or the Bible Belt according to the survey reportMassachusetts is down on Catholics by 10 percentage points South Carolina is down the same degree on evangelicals Mainline Protestants already sliding for 40 years or more declined all over the Midwest by 3 to 4 percentage pointsThe Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church the countrys two largest Protestant denominations are each down roughly the same 14 to 15 percentage pointsEvery tradition took a hit in in the West as the number of people who claim no religious brand continues to climbChristian faiths are troubled by generational change  each successive group is less connected than their parents  and by switching at all ages the report shows While nearly 86 of Americans say they grew up as Christians nearly one in five 19 say they arent so anymoreOverall there are more than four former Christians for every convert to Christianity said CoopermanAlthough evangelicals are part of the decline their slide has been less steep They benefit from more people joining evangelical traditions but theyre hurt by generational change and by Americas increased diversityAccording to the survey white bornagain or evangelical Protestants  closely watched for their political clout within the GOP  now account for 19 of American adults down slightly from 21 in 2007Politicians should take note said Mike Hout a sociologist and demographer at New York University who is also a codirector of the General Social SurveyTraditionally we thought religion was the mover and politics were the consequence he said Today its the oppositeMany of todays formerly faithful left conservative evangelical or Catholic denominations because they saw them align with a conservative political agenda and they dont want to be identified with that Hout saidCatholics dropped both in market share and in real numbers Despite their high retention rate for people reared in the faith they have a low conversion rate Today Cooperman said 13 of US adults are former Catholics up from 10 in 2007Generational shifts are also hurting Catholic numbers Greg Smith Pews associate director of research said just 16 of the 18to24yearolds today are Catholic and that is not enough to offset the numbers lost to the aging and switchingWhere are they going To religious nowhereThe nones  Americans who are unaffiliated with brandname religion  are the new major force in American faith And they are more secular in outlook  and more comfortable admitting it than ever before said John Green director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of AkronTheir growth spans the generations as well as racial and ethnic groups said Green a senior fellow in religion and American politics for the Pew Research CenterNones at 228 of the US up from 16 just eight years ago run second only to evangelicals 254 and ahead of Catholics 208 in religious market shareThe nones numbers are now big enough to show noteworthy diversityAtheists rose from 16 to 31 and agnostics from 24 to 4 Combined there are more nones than Evangelical Lutherans United Methodists and Episcopalians all togetherIts because were right crowed David Silverman president of American Atheists He hadnt yet seen the Pew findings but commented based on other surveys he said showed nones rising numbers Indeed its the public attention given to nones in the last decade combined with the wideopen access to antireligious discussion on the Internet that drives the change Silverman saidMore people know the facts and more people realize they are not alone Silverman said And with these shifts the stigma of coming out as an atheist is lesseningIts now impossible for an atheist to think he is alone in this world They are automatically empowered said SilvermanThe bulk of the nones 158 up from 121 in 2007 dont even commit to any view on God Instead they say they believe nothing in particularBut among the nothings theres a distinct split between spiritual and totally indifferent nonesThirty percent of all nones still showed a sort of religious pulse by saying that religion is still at least somewhat important to them said CoopermanHowever the bulk of this group 39 are not agnostic atheist or vaguely spiritual  theyre just not interested Religion is not even somewhat important to themThat same level of disinterest cuts into their social and political clout said HoutThe nothinginparticular folks dont vote dont marry and dont have kids at the same rate as other Americans said Hout They are allergic to large organized institutions  mass media religions big corporations and political partiesNone is the winning category for religious switchers across society particularly among gay and lesbians  41 of gay or lesbian Americans say they have no religion Cooperman said This suggests the degree of alienation and discomfort and sense of being unwelcome that they may have felt in traditional religious groupsIntermarriage is rising with each generation Among Americans who have gotten married since 2010 nearly fourinten 39 report that they are in religiously mixed marriages compared with 19 among those who got married before 1960 according to the reportTheres an identity gender gap Most Christians are women 55 and most nones are men 57 However womens unbelief numbers are growing nearly one in five 19 now say they have no religious identityDiversity makes a difference Racial and ethnic minorities now make up 41 of Catholics up from 35 in 2007 24 of evangelicals up from 19 and 14 of mainline Protestants up from 9 The share of Americans who identify with nonChristian faiths also has inched up rising 12 percentage points from 47 in 2007 to 59 in 2014 Growth has been especially great among Muslims and Hindus the report saidThe latest survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 35071 adults interviewed by telephone on both cellphones and landlines from June 4Sept 30 2014 The margin of error on overall findings is plus or minus 06 percentage points
