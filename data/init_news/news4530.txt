Republicans taking control of Congress this coming week will try to overcome their reputation as a divided party hobbled by infighting by working to reshape policy in ways that Americans will feel in corporate boardrooms on factory floors and at the gas pumpIncoming committee chairmen are preparing fresh oversight of federal agencies while rankandfile members will be encouraged to use a new budget plan and government spending bills to chip away at President Obamas environmental regulations healthcare reform and outreach to Cuba and IranAfter years of sparring with the White House Republicans are eager to demonstrate productivity and some level of bipartisan cooperation with Obama and the Democrats Public disgust with Washington gridlock remains high and with the 2016 presidential campaign beginning in earnest broader voter interest  especially among independents and Democrats  could put recent GOP gains at risk in less than two yearsOn the things where we agree the goal will be to make a law not just put something on Obamas desk incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said in an interview adding later I want to make it clear Desire for a signature is not going to dictate everything that we doSecuring final passage of bills will require McConnell and House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio to compromise with Democrats while holding together their own ranks which have clashed repeatedly over issues such as spending and immigration Many GOP leaders hope that their differences can be set aside in favor of legislative winsThe House and Senate formally reconvene Tuesday New members will be sworn in and top leaders and committee chairmen formally installed on a day steeped in tradition and ceremonyBoehner and McConnell will be backed by larger GOP majorities 246 Republicans in the House  the partys largest majority since just after World War II  and 54 GOP senators an impressive gain but short of the 60 votes required to overcome most procedural hurdles that Democrats will have at their disposalIn the Senate the rebranding effort will begin with energy policyMcConnell plans to start his tenure as Senate majority leader with a fullthroated debate on national energy policy ranging from a new oil pipeline to additional oil exploration He has also promised consideration of liberal alternativesMcConnell wants to use the controversial proposal to authorize construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as the genesis for a freewheeling Senate debate about the United States energy future in which both sides will have the opportunity to offer and debate more expansive energy issues than the narrow pipeline proposalWe can treat this like a serious and significant energy debate McConnell said in an interview before Christmas in his Capitol officeObama has resisted GOP efforts to authorize the pipeline but dozens of moderate congressional Democrats support the bill and a broader energy debateOther Democrats are skeptical of McConnells plansThe 64000 question as to whether the Congress can get anything done is which way the Republican leadership goes Sen Charles E Schumer DNY said in an interview Saturday If they let the tea party pull them to the right into the path of negativity and obstruction well get nothing doneSen John Hoeven RND a lead author of the Keystone bill said that Republicans plan to consider proposals allowing the export of liquefied natural gas to give state governments greater power to oversee hydraulic fracturing and to restrict the federal governments role in the construction of crossborder gas pipelinesI dont think we have an energy bill that doesnt have a Democratic cosponsor on it he said Because at the end of the day youve got to get at least 60 votes to clear procedural hurdlesThe open process is part of McConnells effort to live up to his pledge to restore the Senates grand tradition of free and full debate while also advancing conservative causes A skilled practitioner in the use of the Senates arcane procedural rules to move or block legislation McConnell has pledged to use those rules to score conservative wins He has been coaching GOP senators that their most likely path to wins will come on the annual spending bills for the federal government  which Republicans have routinely opposed on the grounds that they spend too much taxpayer moneyOther party leaders echo those sentiments I think a majority of Republicans recognize that we have to govern responsibly said Sen John McCain RAriz who will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee We have to show that we can be a productive party and that I think will have a direct effect on whether were able to elect a Republican as president in 2016But now with control of the House and Senate Republicans have more leeway to attach policy riders to spending bills that will restrict federal agencies in their oversight of environmental labor and other regulations These still may draw presidential vetoes but McConnell believes that Republicans will have leverage to get some restrictions included just as the mammoth spending measure approved last month included language sought by Wall Street firms making risky tradesIn the House most of the early weeks will seem like a doover of the past two years  except that many of the bills passed will get swifter Senate considerationUp first is a veterans employment bill that passed last year with bipartisan support according to senior leadership aides There is also a bill to loosen work requirements set by the Affordable Care Act and a similar bill to authorize the Keystone pipelineThe second week of January will be devoted to a new spending plan for the Department of Homeland Security The spending bill funds DHS only until the end of February a move designed to give Republicans more time to craft a legislative response to Obamas decision to change immigration policy through executive actions But no specific proposals have emerged the aides saidThen there are the investigations into alleged wrongdoing at agencies including the Internal Revenue Service the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection AgencyThere are issues that havent been resolved said Rep Jason Chaffetz RUtah the new chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform CommitteeHe is launching subcommittees to closely track Obamas energy and environmental policies and created administrative rules a panel that will try to figure out what the administration is doing next with its rulemaking authority Were going to jump on those as fast as we possibly can he saidBefore the work begins Boehner is expected to face another leadership challenge After he survived a close call two years ago conservative blogs and radio shows are actively supporting another effort to unseat himPresuming that the 434 currently seated House members show up to vote Tuesday and that all Democrats vote against him at least 28 of the 246 Republicans also would need to vote against Boehner to deny him the gavel The 435th House seat is held by Rep Michael G Grimm RNY who plans to resign Monday after recently pleading guilty to tax evasion chargesRep Walter B Jones RNC who opposed Boehner two years ago said in a recent radio interview that hell do it again adding that at least 16 to 18 Republican members might vote against the speaker Among them is Rep Jim Bridenstine ROkla who said Friday that he will vote against the speaker because the spending bill passed last month didnt fully strip DHS of its fundingRep Tom Cole ROkla a Boehner ally said in an interview that I expect a few scattered no votes But because Boehner has been strengthened by the gains in the election the speaker election should mostly be an uneventful coronationThe opening weeks of the new Congress are also expected to include the confirmation of Ashton Carter Obamas pick to lead the Pentagon and Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general Concerns with Iran are also expected to be an early focus The Obama administration persuaded Senate Democrats last year to hold off debating a bipartisan proposal authorizing stronger sanctions against the Iranian regimeBut Sen Bob Corker RTenn the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said My guess is fairly early on in some form or fashion the Senates going to want to weigh in on IranCorker also plans to launch a rigorous hearing process on Obamas decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba Republicans have threatened to block funding for a new embassy in Havana and confirmation of a new ambassador to Cuba But Obama could veto spending bills that include such restrictions sparking a showdown over whether the GOP is willing to shutter parts of the government over a new Cuba policyIn 2016 Republicans will be defending at least 24 Senate seats and about a dozen firstterm House members from swing districts around the country Party leaders have a political imperative to govern and avoid shortterm fights with ObamaWe will see if there is an opportunity for a fourth quarter for President Obama that actually moves the country in the direction wed like to go said Sen Roger Wicker RMiss who also will be responsible for helping reelect GOP senators in 2016Reagan did it a generation ago working with Democrats Clinton did it almost two decades ago with welfare reform and deficit reduction he said So it can be done  if the president is disposed to move in that direction
