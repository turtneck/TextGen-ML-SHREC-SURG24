 A network of conservative advocacy groups backed by Charles and David Koch aims to spend a staggering 889 million in advance of the next White House election part of an expansive strategy to build on its 2014 victories that may involve jumping into the Republican primariesThe massive financial goal was revealed to donors here Monday during an annual winter meeting hosted by Freedom Partners the taxexempt business lobby that serves as the hub of the Kochbacked political operation according to an attendee The amount is more than double the 407 million that 17 allied groups in the network raised during the 2012 campaignThe figure comes close to the 1billion that each of the two major parties presidential nominees are expected to spend in 2016 and it cements the networks standing as one of the countrys most potent political forces With its resources and capabilities  including a national field operation and cuttingedge technology  it is challenging the primacy of the official parties In the 2012 elections the Republican National Committee spent 404 million while the Democratic National Committee shelled out 319 millionThe new 889 million goal reflects the anticipated budgets of all the allied groups that the network funds Those resources will go into field operations new datadriven technology and policy work among other projects along with likely media campaigns aimed at shaping the congressional and White House electionsThe group  which is supported by hundreds of wealthy donors on the right along with the Kochs  is still debating whether it will spend some of that money in the GOP primaries Such a move could have a major impact in winnowing the field of contenders but could also undercut the networks standing if it engaged in intraparty politics and was not successfulThe threeday conference was held at a luxury resort perched on a rocky hillside near Palm Springs Calif with stunning views of the palmtreespeckled desert floor below The event drew 450 attendees a record number as well as the largest number of firsttime contributors to the networkSaturdays opening dinner held on the resorts wide lawn under strings of twinkling lights celebrated a crop of new US senators whose victories helped put the Senate back in GOP control Their bids were lifted by the Freedom Partners network which had pledged to spend close to 300 million in the runup to the November electionsSens Steve Daines Mont Joni Ernst Iowa Tom Cotton Ark Thom Tillis NC David Perdue Ga and Cory Gardner Colo were on hand to thank donors according to people familiar with the eventBut much of the weekend was spent looking ahead to 2016Freedom Partners President Marc Short said in an interview that 2014 was nice but theres a long way to go noting that the groups ultimate goal is to make freemarket ideals central in American society Politics is a necessary means to that end he said but not the only oneMuch of the conclave served as an informationgathering exercise for network officials who are assessing whether financiers will coalesce around a single candidate in the GOP presidential contest At this point some contributors have said they have little interest in putting money into a bloody internal fight and many others are not yet set on a candidateFew here suggested they would support 2012 nominee Mitt Romney who is considering another run in 2016 Among the favorites are Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker former Florida governor Jeb Bush Sen Marco Rubio Fla and Sen Rand Paul KyIts not as if theres one perfect champion and five bad individuals said one person familiar with donors views who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversationsThe Kochs moves are being carefully watched by operatives throughout the party who are well aware of how the brothers could alter the trajectory of the race if they took sides in the primariesIts not like a Chicago political boss where Charles would say Were all for this guy said conservative activist Grover Norquist who has attended past Koch donor seminars But if he said I really like this guy and did an oped it would matterThe networks influence was underlined by the number of prospective 2016 contenders who flocked to Rancho Mirage to mingle with the deeppocketed crowd Walker arrived Saturday from Iowa after addressing conservative activists at a forum in Des Moines That night over an al fresco dinner of filet mignon the Wisconsin governor thanked the Freedom Partners donors for their past support and touted his efforts to curb state spendingSunday night Paul Rubio and Sen Ted Cruz Tex were on hand to participate in a panel about the economy and foreign policy moderated by ABCs Jonathan KarlThe three senators aimed some of their comments at the business leaders in the audience touting their support for cutting taxes and regulations and dismissed a question about whether wealthy donors have too much influence on politicsThere are a bunch of Democrats who have taken as their talking points that the Koch brothers are the nexus of all evil in the world said Cruz calling that thinking grotesque and offensiveI dont know a single person in this room who has ever been to my office  asking from government any special access Rubio added By and large what they want is to be left aloneThe panel was available to news organizations via a live Web stream part of a new posture of openness embraced by the usually private organization For the first time Freedom Partners shared details about the donor conclave including excerpts of Charles Kochs welcoming remarksStill some critics scoffed at the idea that the group was being transparent On Saturday a handful of protesters stood at the base of the curving driveway that leads up to the resort waving a large American flag and holding signs denouncing the KochsThey claim theyre being more open said Tracy Turner a 49yearold retiree from Palm Springs noting that the news media was barred from the event Clearly thats not the case Theyre scripting it very carefullyStarted by Charles Koch in 2003 and originally hosted by Koch Industries the twiceayear donor seminars are now sponsored by Freedom PartnersThe network has evolved into a sophisticated political operation that mirrors those of the official parties Along with its main political advocacy arm Americans for Prosperity the network finances groups such as Concerned Veterans for America the Libre Initiative and Generation Opportunity Last year it added a super PAC to its arsenal but most of the allied groups are nonprofits that do not disclose their donorsNetwork officials used the conference to lay out ambitious goals to promote freemarket principles in government business and the media There were also frank assessments of what they need to do to refine their tacticsOne area seen as a major improvement over 2012 was how the network uses data to improve its voter outreach Another major 2014 investment  expanding a national field organization  was also viewed as promising but officials believe it will take time to make it more effectiveIn the coming year allied groups in the network will put a renewed focus on the issue of crony capitalism and will pressure Democrats and Republicans alike on issues such as taxcode reform and the ExportImport Bank according to people familiar with the plansDenver investor John Saeman a veteran cable executive who has been a longtime supporter of the network described the mood as measuredIts very much of staying the course he said during a break between sessions This is a battle for hearts and mindsIn his speech Saturday night Charles Koch exhorted his fellow donors to deepen their commitmentIt is up to us he said Making this vision a reality will require more than a financial commitment It requires making it a central part of our lives
