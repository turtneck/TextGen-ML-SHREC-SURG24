 Does The US Government Really Know Who Hacked Democrats Emails By Kassia Halcli  PBS  The hacking and public release of Democratic campaign and committee emails made the news and a presidential debate with more leaks expected to comeThis week WikiLeaks published more emails from Hillary Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta Nearly 20 batches of campaign emails were released over the last month in addition to Democratic National Committee emails released earlier this yearIn the final presidential debate on Oct 19 Clinton said documents released by WikiLeaks were part of Russian espionage on the US She called on Republican candidate Donald Trump to acknowledge the Russia connection and condemn such actionsShe has no idea whether its Russia China or anybody else She has no idea said TrumpI am not quoting myself I am quoting 17 17 intelligence agencies Do you doubt 17 military and civilian agencies Clinton askedOur country has no idea Trump respondedClinton was citing the Oct 7 statement from the US intelligence community saying it was confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutionsAnalysts say however that the ability to determine who cyber attackers are where theyre located and sometimes who ordered their operations is rarely definitive and comes in degrees of confidenceBeyond the governments headline assertion that Russia is to blame its important to parse the public statement pretty closely said Susan Hennessey a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution Theyre being really careful in their word choiceThe Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security said in a statement earlier this month that only Russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activitiesBut that statement does not mean that the US has direct evidence of senior officiallevel involvement Hennessey saidWithout more definitive statements its difficult for some technical experts to take the governments word on faith she and others have saidTheres no evidence that this was done by the state itself only evidence it was done by nonstate actors that might be Russianspeaking said Jeffrey Carr CEO of the cyber security consultancy firm Taia Global referring to the evidence available to the publicThat evidence which was released by private threat assessment companies rather than official channels indicates hackers used Cyrillic keyboards and operated during Moscow working hoursBut indicators of identity like timestamps language preferences and IP addresses can be manipulated or faked rather easily said Juan Andres GuerreroSaade a senior security researcher at Kaspersky LabTrump has a point when he says we cant know for sure said Cris Thomas an information security professional known online as Space RogueI dont know what evidence they have that couldnt have been faked Thomas saidSophisticated attackers have learned how to tamper with the technical indicators to mask their identity or at least send analysts in the wrong directionDmitri Alperovitch cofounder of CrowdStrike hired by the Democratic National Committee to assess its breach wrote a blog post attributing the hack to two separate Russianintelligence affiliated groups Fancy Bear and Cozy BearAlperovitch classed both as sophisticated actors writing on CrowdStrikes blog that their tradecraft is superb operational security second to noneFancy Bear is very very good at deception campaigns said Brian Bartholomew who coauthored a report about the deception tactics that complicate attributionBut he added the group has recently seemed a little more lax about getting caughtCarr asked if these hacks are a ploy by Russian President Vladimir Putin to install what Clinton has called a puppet at the helm of a Western democracy why leave such obvious technical indicators in their wakeThats not even sloppy Carr said Thats just ignorantPerhaps Russia wanted it traced back to them to show that theyre flexing their geopolitical muscle Schwartz saidDeception however is exceptionally difficult to pull off at the level that is going to withstand the amount of scrutiny the government will put on it said Jason Healey senior fellow at the Atlantic Councils Cyber Statecraft InitiativeAnother complicating factor is that the first intrusions into the DNC go back more than a year well before Trump purported to be Putins favorite candidate was perceived as having a reasonable chance of winning the Republican Partys nominationTo think these hacks were in service of a farsighted cunning plan designed by the Kremlin is imputing a level of insight and ability to understand and predict the US electoral system that certainly no one in the United States has demonstrated Hennessey saidA more likely explanation she said is that the hackers were conducting lowthreshold espionage but ending up finding information that could be opportunistically releasedThe US government has swaths of intelligence and the ability to operate beyond laws that constrain private sector threat assessment companies said GuerreroSaadeAs the public we should really understand that theres a lot more at play behind the scenes Bartholomew saidJudging by the practice established by its three previous attribution claims the government is unlikely to release substantiating evidence in order to guard US sources and methodsThe world of cyber crime feels like the Wild West but its not to say that nothing can be known GuerreroSaade said
