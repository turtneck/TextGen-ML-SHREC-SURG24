Fact Check Did Hillary Clinton Introduce A New Approach To Early EducationThis week Hillary Clinton was in Virginia to talk about women family and workplace issues She met at the Mugn Muffin coffee shop with local participants in a program called Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool YoungstersIn HIPPY as its called parents receive free books educational materials and weekly home visits to coach them on how to get their young children ready for school  for example by reading to them dailyA Clinton campaign video features Bill Clinton in a speech crediting his wife with bringing the program to the US from Israel when she was first lady of Arkansas in 1985She comes in one day jumping up and down happy the former president says in the video She says I found it A preschool program in Israel that teaches people to be their childrens first teachers even if theyre illiterate I think it could work here  Next thing you know its in 26 states Its still thriving and there are thousands of people in this country today who have better lives and learn more and grew up just because of herHillary Clinton did bring the program to Arkansas but she wasnt responsible for importing it to the United StatesAnd it is national in 21  not 26  states and DC but its not very big  only 15000 participants each yearClinton discovered the program many years ago when it came to the US says Margie Margolies the chairwoman of HIPPY USAs board no relation to Marjorie Margolies Chelsea Clintons motherinlaw She was instrumental in growing the program in Arkansas when Bill was governor She had been working for a way to boost the educational start of children in Arkansas so she reached out to the Israeli founder to find out how to scale it up Arkansas is still one of our largest programsCould HIPPY scale up nationwide Should itDecades of independent research including randomized controlled trials shows that children ages 3 4 and 5 who participate in HIPPY are more prepared for school Studies in four states found that higher reading math and social studies scores persisted into third fifth and sixth gradesTeachers report that parents who participate in HIPPY become more involved in their childrens educations for years to come HIPPY seems to blunt the impact on school performance of factors like being an Englishlanguage learner Children who go through the program also seem to have better attendance behavior peer interactions and academic selfesteemAlthough Margolies says that she wouldnt want to pit HIPPY against universal preK programs the fact remains that the homevisit program seems to produce similar effects on kids at a lower cost per participant And there are ancillary benefits like connecting families to housing health care and job assistanceOf course its hard to control for the enthusiasm factor Lowincome working parents who are willing to sign up for 30 straight weeks of home visits and then actually stick with the program with no payments or other incentives beyond a few free books must be exceptionally committed to their childrens welfareBut if nothing else the success of HIPPY demonstrates that it is possible to close the notorious word gap and change parents behaviorIt really makes a huge difference in peoples lives says Margolies who has been with the program in Milwaukee for nearly two decades Im lucky enough to have seen in many years how much more confidence the parents haveMany of the homevisit coaches she says began as parents in the program We have a woman right now its her first job ever She was a parent and shes being trained as a home visitor  Its a great start for parents too not just for kids
