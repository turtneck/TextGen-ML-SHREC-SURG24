Washington CNN Governing is much tougher than it looks even for a master of the Senate like Mitch McConnellClaiming the majority he had long craved in the midterm elections the wily GOP leader promised to turn the polarized gridlocked Senate back into a chamber in which both sides get a say and pass meaningful legislationMcConnells vow was not just altruistic With a tough slate of Senate races looming in 2016 and Republicans desperate to take back the White House he has a strong incentive to show the GOP can governBut two months into the Republican majority the new Senate looks an awful lot like the old SenateThe chamber cant even come together to pass a bill tackling the scourge of sex trafficking  which has wide bipartisan support  because it has become derailed in a partisan fight over abortion The result is that President Barack Obamas nominee for attorney general Loretta Lynch is being held up If things were not bad enough Lynchs confirmation process has degenerated into an ugly row over raceIf we cannot approve a bill to deal with human trafficking then what will we be able to deal with Maine Republican Sen Susan Collins said this week We have to get past the tendency to score partisan political points that has affected too many bills on both sides of the aisleThe new Senate is not yet breaking its bad productivity streakThe only high profile legislation sent to Obamas desk was a bill authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline which the president swiftly vetoedThe Republican establishment in the House and Senate has spent much of its time having to quell a bid by grassroots conservatives to defund the Department of Homeland Security as a way to punish what they see as Obamas executive amnesty in reshaping immigration lawsThe GOPled Senate and House are also at odds over exactly what to include in the biggest piece of looming business the party majorities will face  a budget billThis is all welcome news for Obama who was dealt a humiliating defeat in Novembers midterms but is not facing much pressure from Congress at all Hes using the political vacuum as a respite from the misery lameduck presidents usually expect in their twilight yearsThe raging Republican civil war meanwhile is making McConnells task in managing his restive conference almost as difficult as the one John Boehner has slogged through in recent yearsAnd Boehner unlike McConnell does not have to deal with at least three Republicans  Ted Cruz Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham  who are flirting with running for president and who may have personal rather than party motivations at stakeThe election changed majority control  it didnt change the sharp differences between the two parties said Steven Smith a specialist in Congress at Washington University St Louis It didnt change McConnells relationship with his own colleaguesStill McConnells defenders say that he has managed to make at least peripheral changes to Senate life He has allowed more amendments to legislation than was typically allowed under the former Democratic majority rule of Harry Reid letting lawmakers feel their voices are heardIn the DHS battle McConnell honored his vow not to allow a government shutdown though that promise will be tested in government funding and debt ceiling fights later this yearAnd even in the best of times nothing moves in the Senate at anything other than glacial pace So McConnells quest to restore regular order might be the political equivalent of turning around an oil tankerProspects look reasonable that by using a budget device known as reconciliation which can bypass the Senate filibuster the GOP will be able to move some legislation through Congress and evade Democratic obstructionBut many Republicans believe that Democrats by suddenly objecting to the abortion provision after it sailed through committee are simply looking for a way to jam up the Senate in the belief Republicans will get the blame for the futility Their current strategy is in effect a 2016 strategyWith the chambers filibuster rules which require a 60 vote majority on most significant legislation the current Republican high water mark of 54 seats is not sufficient to dictate terms to the opposition partyAlready with an apparent eye on 2016 senior Democrats are making the case that Republicans simply cant get things doneRepublicans have came in saying they would know how to govern and what a mess theyve made of it said veteran Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer of New York They didnt have a good time or good luck on the pipeline bill where they got bollocksed up on climate change Theyve held us for four weeks on funding Homeland Security And now even a simple trafficking bill they cant get doneHe added Hello our Republican friends youre in the majority They still think theyre in the minority and theyre putting their own poison pills in their own billThe shenanigans have some veteran observers of the Senate already beginning to downgrade expectations for the next few yearsWhats clear is that the quick cement is rapidly drying on how the new Senate is going to operate said Ron Bonjean a former top Republican strategist in the Senate and the HouseBonjean predicted a return to the grueling trench warfare which has made the Senate one of the most trying places to be in WashingtonDemocrats dont want to move anything They are finding reasons not to join Republicans in moving legislation because that will help the majority succeed politically said BonjeanThe row over the trafficking bill is a bad omen for those who want to see a return to comity in the Senate An attempt at a compromise failed on Thursday so the controversy will rumble on at least until next weekAnd the clash has become much more than a dispute over an obscure bill Its a test case of how the Senate will be run for the next two years being waved by two veteran experts of gridlock and procedure McConnell and Reid who have seen their relationship deteriorate badly in recent yearsMcConnell is refusing to bring up Lynchs nomination which has the support of a number of Republicans as well as Democrats until the trafficking bill passesBut in the end some conservatives believe the Democrats will have little option to climb down because the White House badly wants Lynch to get confirmed to succeed Eric HolderBut by then it may be too late to stop ill feelings over the nomination from poisoning whatever goodwill is left in the Senate setting a bad precedent for the rest of the yearFor example Sen John McCain on Thursday furiously condemned another Senate veteran Dick Durbin a Democrat from Illinois after he accused Republicans of treating Lynch who is African American like civil rights icon Rosa Parks by moving her to the back of the busMcConnell doesnt just have problems with Democrats though He increasingly is struggling to keep his own caucus in line especially among lawmakers who have ridden the Tea Party wave and are challenging the Republican establishment in the SenateIn one eyeopening example Republican freshman Sen Tom Cotton bypassed Senate leadership by getting together a letter signed by 46 other GOP senators to warn Iran directly that Congress could torpedo a nuclear deal between world powers including Washington and the Islamic RepublicGrass roots conservatives are also furious that Boehner and McConnell combined to derail a bid by conservatives to withhold funding for the DHS in protest at Obamas unilateral effort to save millions of undocumented immigrants from deportationThey organized a surrender it was the surrender brigade said Ken Cuccinelli President of the Senate Conservatives Fund a political action committee devoted to sending candidates supported by the grassroots to the Senate McConnell misled Kentucky voters He said he was going to stand up to Obamas liberal agenda He said he was going to use the power of the purse he said he was going to repeal Obamacare root and branchCuccinelli the former Attorney General of Virginia predicted that the action of the Senate Republican establishment would not be accepted by Republican activists and could fuel primary campaigns against sitting senators up for reelection including McCain Ohio Sen Rob Portman and North Carolina Sen Richard BurrSo under simultaneous attack from the right and the left and with the president ready with his veto McConnell is going to have to negotiate an increasingly narrow path before he can send his troops into the field in the 2016 election and argue that unlike Democrats the GOP actually got something done
