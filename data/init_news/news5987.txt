CNN The two presidential frontrunners are both eyeing Super Tuesday 2 as a chance to build on their momentum and pad their leads as they look to put the races away by the end of the monthAnd Donald Trump will try to run the table with four Republican contests on tap He leads in Michigan and has done well in Southern states like Mississippi Idaho and Hawaii vote Tuesday as well a chance to pick up more delegatesHeres what to watch in the days electionsTime is running out for Trumps opponents to turn things around before the winnertakesall states start to vote and the GOP frontrunner racks up enough delegates to lock the nomination up before the conventionTrump leads the polls in Michigan the crown jewel of Tuesdays contestsMississippi meanwhile will test whether Cruzs surge in Louisiana  he closed a massive polling gap and finished within four points on Saturday  expands to other Southern states or Trump can finish running the table in the Deep South Idaho could be better ground for Cruz who has spent more time in the state than other candidatesAll three states though pose problems for RubioMississippi and Michigan each require candidates to reach 15 to accumulate delegates Idaho requires candidates to top 20 The stronger Trump and Cruz run the tougher it becomes for Rubio to make any gains at allWhat about the late decidersRubio has a history of doing well with late deciders  voters who make up their minds in the last week He picked up 39 of those voters in Virginia for example according to exit pollsBut those voters polls have shown typically make up less than onethird of a states electorateIn Michigan a Monmouth University poll showed 23 of voters were undecided or only had a slight preference in the days leading up to the primaryAnd supporters of Trump polls have shown tend to be more lockedin on their candidate than supporters of RubioWhat Tuesdays contests could demonstrate is whether theres enough late movement to help Trumps rivals  particularly since the week leading up to the debate featured the most explosive Republican debate yetFor Clinton Michigan will put that claim to the testShes increasingly eager to turn her attention to the general election  and to do that Clinton needs to turn the tide with white voters and particularly run up her advantage among women She has performed better in those demographics since Sanders won in New Hampshire just over a month ago and Michigan is a good bellwether for Clinton Its a heavilypopulated diverse state that Democrats absolutely have to have in order to win the general election in NovemberGiven the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing I think it was the right decision to heed what Presidentelect Obama asked us to do she added You were either for saving the auto industry or against it I voted to save the auto industry and Im very glad that I didA victory in Michigan could set Clinton up for a huge March 15  when Florida Ohio Illinois North Carolina and Missouri vote If Sanders cant win Michigan he might not be able to win any of those states A Clinton loss though means Missouri Ohio and potentially Illinois could be in playSo imagine this scenario Kasich beats Rubio in Michigan Then on March 15 Kasich wins his 66delegate winnertakeall home state of Ohio and Rubio loses his 99delegate winnertakeall home state of FloridaSuddenly Kasich would become the leading moderate establishmenttype Republican in the race  and Rubio would lack a path forwardThere are a lot of ifs for that to happen But for Kasich to stand any chance of turning whats been a smallerscale campaign thats been much choosier about where he tries to compete into one with a real shot at quickly racking up delegates Michigan is where it has to startWinning Ohio could help Kasich play a small role in denying Trump the delegates he needs to win the GOP nomination outrightBut to have a shot at the nomination himself Kasich has to win the Midwest  states like Michigan Illinois Indiana and Wisconsin which have similarlystyled Republican governors and are often general election battlegrounds
