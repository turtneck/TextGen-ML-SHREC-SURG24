Washington CNN After 10 hours and 30 minutes Sen Rand Paul relinquished the Senate floor late Wednesday night ending his filibuster over National Security Agency surveillance programs authorized under the Patriot ActPaul RKentucky ran through several binders of material over the course of his marathon protest and also got some help from 10 fellow senators  three Republicans and seven DemocratsSens Ron Wyden DOregon and Mike Lee RUtah were the biggest boons to Pauls efforts joining Paul on the Senate floor several times to give the Kentucky Republican a chance to catch his breath  and often grab a sip of water and pop a candy in his mouth And one of Pauls rivals for the Republican presidential nomination Sen Ted Cruz of Texas also ended up helping Pauls efforts late in the nightThere comes a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer That time is now and I will not let the Patriot Act the most unpatriotic of acts go unchallenged Paul said at the opening of his remarks and those who joined him on the Senate floor shared his concerns and stressed the need to reform the Patriot ActThe Senate is considering whether to reauthorize or reform a crucial section of that law that gives the government sweeping powers to collect phone metadata on millions of Americans in an effort to thwart terrorist plots The House last week overwhelmingly approved a bill to reform that lawThe NSAs bulk collection program expires at midnight on June 1 and the Department of Justice warned in a memo shared by a GOP aide on Wednesday that the agency will have to begin preparing a week before the expiration date for a potential lapse in the lawPauls talkathon Wednesday came more than two years after his nearly 13hour filibuster in 2013 which was widely anticipated and brought him national attention for delaying the confirmation of CIA chief John Brennan to draw attention to US drone policiesBut his speech Wednesday wasnt technically a filibuster because intricate Senate rules required him to stop talking by early Thursday afternoon for an unrelated voteStill Pauls office insists it was a filibuster saying Paul prevented lawmakers from taking action to reauthorize the Patriot Act while he had the floorSen Paul will speak until he can no longer speak spokeswoman Jillian Lane said WednesdayPaul began speaking at about 120 pm ET More than two hours later Wyden Pauls Democratic partnerincrime on stopping the NSAs domestic surveillance programs joined him on the floor to aid the effortPaul slammed Congress for not scheduling enough time to debate whether to reform the Patriot Act and to debate the merits of NSA surveillanceAt the very least we should debate we should debate whether or not we are going to relinquish our rights or whether or not we are going to have a full and able debate over whether or not we can live within the constitution or whether or not we have to go around the constitution Paul said on the floorAnd as his voice waned in the 10th hour of his time on the floor Paul again emphasized the need for an open and honest debate about the Patriot Act and domestic surveillanceAnd he again hammered home the need for Congress to uphold the Constitution as it takes action on the Patriot ActThere is absolutely no excuse  no excuse not to debate this no excuse not to vote on a sufficient amount of amendments to try to make this better to try to make the bulk collection of records go away Its what the American people want its what the Constitution demands Paul saidThe debate over NSA reform has pitted Republican leadership in the House and Senate against each otherHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul RTexas on Wednesday lamented that ongoing deadlock slamming GOP leaders for failing so far to broker a deal to keep key provisions of the Patriot Act aliveWe go dark  in a high threat environment thats a very dangerous thing to do thats dangerous politics McCaul told reporters Wednesday Im disappointed that were not able to work this out and now were going to do this ping pong game and play politics with national securityAnd McCaul added that Pauls filibuster drove home his point about the dangers of politics interfering with national securityThats my point he saidPaul and Wyden both talked up the amendments during Wednesdays socalled filibuster that they are proposing to add to the USA Freedom Act a reform bill the House overwhelmingly passed last week Paul and Wyden are pushing for additional reforms not included in the measure a compromise bill between reform advocates in the House and House Republican leadershipWyden added to Pauls lambasting of the NSAs bulk data collection programs and also slammed national security hawks in Congress who have repeatedly held back reforms Wyden allegedThey wait until the very last minute Wyden said They wait until the last minute and then they say Oh my goodness it is a dangerous world weve got to continue this program the way it isAnd Lee who is the chief Republican sponsor of the USA Freedom Act also joined Paul on the Senate floor promoting his bill and slamming a dysfunctional Congress that he said isnt serving the American people well on surveillance and other issuesPassage on that bill is anything but certain though with some senators supportive of moderate reforms hoping to weaken the bill while others like Paul and Wyden want the bill to do morePaul voted against allowing debate on a previous version of the USA Freedom Act last year saying it did not go far enoughThe people dont want the bulk collection of their records And if we were listening wed hear that Paul saidThe Kentucky Republican was also using his filibuster as an opportunity to rally his supporters and raise money for his presidential campaignWhile Paul was speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday his campaign sent an email to supporters asking for donations to support his presidential ambitionsAnd his marathon session on the floor also jolted his supporters who posted photos of themselves watching Pauls speech throughout the ten and a half hours using the hashtag StandwithRand that had emerged during Pauls famed 2013 filibusterPaul also slammed President Barack Obama for refusing to end the program through executive order despite saying he opposes the bulk data collection programHe has every power to stop it and yet the president does nothing Paul said of ObamaPaul repeatedly drew on the Founding Fathers as he laid out his arguments why the government should not be allowed to collect troves of information on innocent Americans in the name of counterterrorismIf government were comprised of angels we wouldnt need restrictions we wouldnt need laws Paul said quoting James Madison He later quoted Ben Franklin as wellBut Paul a libertarianleaning conservative had his own words as well insisting that Americans should always be wary of the government and increasing government powerAnytime you give power to government they love it and they will accumulate more he said They will not live within the confines of power unless you watch them Like a hawk youve got to watch them
