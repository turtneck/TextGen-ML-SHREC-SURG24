Why has Donald Trumps appeal come to be so different than that of the Republican Party and its longerterm leaders The complex answer rests on the paucity of ideas and leadership skills on the part of the rest of the dwindling field of Republican presidential candidatesbut it also includes a failure on the part of party leaders and pundits to understand the people they thought they were leading They have equated past electoral support with philosophical alignment We are seeing through Trump that the connection between the two always tenuous is easily severedOne of the reasons the Republican elite has dealt so ineffectively with Trump is that it has never understood that they dont control the masses who have voted for them believing that its dog whistles could always bring the straying back into line The forces that they have ridden to power however are much stronger than they imaginedand quite different from what they thought they were so deftly manipulatingTheir lack of understanding of their base can be seen in Charles Murrays 2012 book Coming Apart The State of White America 19602010 Clueless to the extent that cultural background influences people and like so many of todays elite believing in an American meritocracy Murray asserts that the trends I describe exist independently of ethnic heritage This points to a major blind spot of the soontobe former leaders of the Republican Party The irony is that they use ethnic division to attract votes though they have long believed with Murray and with contradiction notwithstanding that the successful in America rise through their individual worth not their backgrounds Everyone the elite believe at least the Republican elite wants to join them They even believe that ones cultural orientation ethnic class and more has become a personal choiceSo obtuse are they that it is no wonder that The Rise of Trump blindsided themMurray applauds what he describes as a new class structure in America led by a small subset the people who run the nations economic political and cultural institutions This imagined pyramid of power unintentionally outlines the difference in theory and practice for the Republican eliteand explains just why they have been paralyzed by the presence of an actor within their ranks who comes from the top but does not share the illusions of the elite Theirs is as a result an example of paralyzing cognitive dissonanceBy claiming that people are successful by their own merits the Republicans have elided above the line consideration of why certain groups of people are not as successful as others  and so of necessity have also ignored the fact that not everyone can make it Safe in their imagined meritocracy they ignore the role luck has played in their climbs to the top leaving their less fortunate followers searching for someone or something to blame for their own lack of elite status Teachers are blamed for the failures of their students immigrants are responsible for unemployment among the nativeborn and welfare cheats are keeping taxes high Someone else is always getting the break the less fortunate come to believe Deserved legacies of success are being stolen awayAs most anyone from any cultural background knows the isolation of the very rich from everyone except others of their economic status and the people who serve them has a very long tradition in America as elsewhere in the world Walled estates and patrolled neighborhoods have been standard for eons Yet as if the situation of todays meritocracy were something new or different Murray writes thatActually this is a problem both ways When the truck driver does not also understand the priorities of Yale professors a dialogue between the two can never be established Murray has unwittingly bought into one of the reasons for the resentments of red state conservatives toward the East Coast elite that the elite need knowledge while the rest do not This is the problem liberals such as John Dewey were trying to address through creation of a system of education based on the concept of the citizen as informed decision maker and that conservatives such as Walter Lippmann resisted believing the population best served by an informed elite crafting choices for the population as a whole That the divide between the professor and the teamster has been in existence since the early years of English colonization of America should be apparent to anyone who has made even the briefest study of the history of American culture Murray does try to base his vision of the new lower class in history but it is a history that takes as truth the myth of industriousness honesty marriage and religiosity as the basic aspects of American culture This has not really been the case at all Murray taps into other longterm myths claiming that early Americans may not have been genteel but as a people they met the requirements of virtue This sort of selfcongratulatory vision of history is common to the myths within any culture or ethnic group Unfortunately it also can lead to resentments to feelings that virtues unrewarded are actually cases of rewards stolen by the undeserving It also can lead to Donald Trumps Make America Great Again and destruction of an elite in the Republican Party that neither understandsnor is understood byits supporters By the time of the 2012 Republican National Convention with its catchphrase of We Built It the myth of an American individualism that led to a meritorious elite of builders had become the basis for a successful cult that could now explicitly show its political muscle The Tea Party the major manifestation of this new cult of individualism however is much more than a simple political movement It is a reflection of that cultural belief that outside forces have conspired to dampen individual initiative that if people could only be left alone they could work miracles for themselves Its attitudes are those behind the mania for guns that grew so strong over the first decade of the 21st century stronger than it had ever been in American history Guns it is imagined can keep at bay those who would keep one down And there is a belief a cultural conspiracy theory if you will that there are such enemies Trump plays on this more directly than do the Republican leaders he is on the verge of superseding They in order to keep up their imaginary view of their own worth hid their pandering to the worst instincts of Americans Trump with no such illusions does not Without any sort of real philosophical underpinning the new individualism reflects the sort of inchoate yearning that crosses political boundaries and that Donald Trump of course has tapped into so well His followers arent conservatives not as the Republican elite define the term supporting lower taxes for the rich smaller government etc but are people who believe their legacy has been stolen that their failure to also make it into the elite is the fault of forces well outside of their own lives They arent even Republicans except by convenience This article is adapted from passages in Chapter Six of Aaron Barlows book The Cult of Individualism A
