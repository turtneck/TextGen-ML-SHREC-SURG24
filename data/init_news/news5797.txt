LAS VEGAS  Katy Perrys glamour Tom Steyers money Univisions megaphone and organized labors muscle along with a late assist from Barack Obama each helped lubricate Harry Reids welloiled political machine over the past 48 hoursThe media tends to focus on the lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton relative to President Obama which is real but a few thousand more ballots were cast in Nevada on Saturday during the first day of early voting than during the kickoff day four years ago when there was a similar flurry of activity to propel Democrats to the polls And that was before Air Force One touched down yesterday afternoonIt is a testament to the power of the organization that Reid the retiring Senate minority leader has built over three decades and thathe is now using to get Clinton and his handpicked successor Catherine Cortez Masto across the finish lineAs much as 60 percent of the vote will be cast before Nov 8 in the Silver State Democrats for several cycles have dominated early voting running up the score so that Republicans struggle to overcome it on Election DaySince handily winning the Republican caucuses here in February Donald Trump has been stronger in Nevada than in most other battlegrounds The race remains tight here a function of the relatively high percentage of lowincome whites without college degreesLets face it Nevada is always close Obama who carried the state twice said during a rally at a high school in North Las Vegas Nevada always makes you a little nervous because you dont know whats going to happen But thats what makes it excitingThe bulk of Nevadas Democratic voters are concentrated in Clark County which includes Vegas During a twoweek window the race is on to lock in Clintons narrow advantage in the polls by getting as many of her supporters as possible to one of 97 early voting sites The Reid machine fully activated is a sight to behold Unions play a huge role Reid kicked off his Saturday with a 9 am speech at the Iron Workers Union in the suburb of Henderson Cortez Masto joined him Then she went to the Carpenters Union training center at 1015 am and the Service Employees International Unions office on Sunset Boulevard a little after noon A taco truck parked out front served dual purposes the promise of free lunch built a crowd while trolling the Trump surrogate who warned during a recent cable interview that a Clinton victory would mean a taco truck on every corner A shuttle bus ferried people to the nearest polling location A few hours later pop star Katy Perry drew a diverse young crowd of 500 to the courtyard in front of the student union at the University of Nevada atLas Vegas The 31yearold didnt sing but she did get right to the point Perry talked about how she likes to procrastinate as much as anyone else but thats not okay when it comes to early voting Lets cut the crap  Weve all got excuses Dont put it offShe then lamented thatvotes in Nevada matter more than hers does in California Im not just here to see a Cirque show she said You guys are importantPerry wore a blue leather dress red heels and a white Tshirt that said Nasty Woman which is what Trump called Clinton during their debate right here on the campus of UNLV last Wednesday night As she spoke about how shes been campaigning for the Democratic nominee since the cornfields of Iowa a guy in the audience yelled that Clinton should appoint her to be an ambassador Not yet she replied Ive got to put out a record or fourThen Perry introduced Cortez Masto Its important to not just vote for president the singer concluded Weve got a crew Weve got a clique We all run together We need to vote for the right senators tooShe announced at the end of her speech that she would take sophomore Kendra Patterson president of the campus Black Student Organization to vote for the first time Perry and her entourage piled into three black Escalades and headed for the nearest polling placeNextGen the climatechangefocused super PAC bankrolled by liberal billionaire Tom Steyer had a dozen volunteers working the Perry rally in orange Tshirts They handed out water bottles and had a coach bus in front of the student union to shuttle anyone who wanted a ride to go vote Early voting also gives Democrats more opportunities to turn out Latinos who have never voted before Mi Familia Vota and Voto Latino cohosted a fourhour block party Saturday afternoon in the parking lot of a mall that has an early voting site There was live Spanish music and allyoucaneat plates of free tacos from a popular local eatery There were two bouncy houses face painting and popcorn for the kids Steyers group helped pay for the event and Univision Radio a cosponsor promoted it on the air Staffers directed attendees to go inside the mall to vote At around 6 pm Saturday there were about 100 people in line for tacos and another 50 voting inside They waited in a line between a candy store and a cosmetics shop The Clinton team is investing heavily in doortodoor canvassing to run up herearly vote numbers Pilar Grullon a field organizer for the Nevada Democratic Party led a training session for 40 volunteers before Perry arrived at UNLV The native of the Dominican Republic said her mom worked two jobs to make ends meet but that her family still relied on public assistance including food stamps and Medicaid to get by She recently became the first in her family to graduate from college All of those services that my family depended on are at risk in this election she saidGrullon spent 15 minutes giving volunteers tips on how to give a little extra push to registered Democrats who might be reluctant to vote early Everyone got commit cards to get people to write down exactly when and where they will vote And they got leaflets with the number for a hotline that Clinton supporters can call to get a free ride to the polls You walk through and you make a plan with the voter at every door Grullon saidShe encouraged volunteers to be forceful If a mom tells you her daughter is voting for Hillary dont take her word for it Note that and someone else will come back to find her Be scrappy If theres a gate wait for someone to come to the gate If they speak Spanish and you cant mark it down and someone else will go Dont engage anyone who wants to talk smack about our candidates It is a waste of your time For good measure she even told everyone to smile Part of the Democratic strategy is to unashamedly pester people until they vote The campaigns find out who voted at the end of each day So they can stop targeting potential supporters once they havecast a ballot During the training session Grullon urged her door knockers to tell people that they wont get bothered once theyve voted If you dont want somebody to knock on your door or call you anymore go vote she said And it will stop SeriouslyThis turns out to be a powerful incentive in a state where almost every commercial is about the election Beatriz Martinez 27 voted Saturday inside a temporary trailer that has been set up in a Target parking lot in Las Vegas Asked why she went on the first day she said We got tons of texts saying early voting started this morning from the Clinton campaign people from the climate change people from the party people She and her boyfriend a law student supported Bernie Sanders in the caucuses but rallied behind Clinton after she wrapped up the nominationMartinez also brought her dad with her to vote The 58yearold was born in Mexico and speaks Spanish He became a US citizen more than a decade ago but had never voted before Saturday The chance to vote against Trump changed that He was very excitedAt the end of Saturday Democratic staffers celebrated news that 39148 people had voted in Clark County compared to 33187 in 2012 Of those 55 percent were registered Democrats and 27 percent were registered Republicans Hitting the churches The work continued early Sunday Ruben Kihuen a state senator challenging Republican Rep Cresent Hardy arrived at a Baptist church just before 8 am to warn that all the progress of the Obama years could unravel if Democrats do not win I was trying to convey the sense of urgency of getting to the polls he said in an interview after the service as he headed to a second church to deliver the same closing argument This election could be won during early voting if you run a strong campaign Five hours later Obama arrived in Kihuens congressional district for a rally aimed primarily at turning out African Americans The president took the stage at Cheyenne High School after Boyz II Men performed The End of the Road Speaking in front of a giant sign that said VOTE EARLY Obama told an audience of 5100 Youve got the winning hand Youve got blackjack But youve got to make sure to turn over the card by voting  This game does not start on November 8th The game ends on November 8thBringing back a fictional character whom he invoked often in campaigns past Obamaadded with a hint of nostalgia I need you to call up cousin Pookyand say Pooky its time to voteI need you to go call Jesse and say Jesse come on Dont be sitting on the couch Its time to vote Everybody has got to vote early Thats how we won in 08 Thats how we won in 2012 Thats how were going to win in 2016 The Republican effort to push early voting pales in comparison and it certainly lacks the star power The RNCled victory program has 66 staffers spread across eight offices in Nevada more than in 2012 The state Democratic Party declined to provide a staff count but said it has 17 field offices But even GOP operatives marvel at the Reid machine They are trying to play catch up but they acknowledge that their only hope to carry Nevada is to win big among those who vote on Election Day Starting this weekend the GOPs field staff pivoted to knocking on the doors of registered Republicans who are probably with Trump but do not routinely voteRep Mark Amodei chairman of Trumps campaign in Nevada hosted a modest early vote kickoff event at the RNCs Reno office on Saturday morning Republican Senate candidate Joe Heck meanwhile campaigned with Ted Cruz in Reno and Elko less populated but redder areas of the state Heck a congressman from Vegas alienated many Trump supporters by rescinding his support So he campaigned with the Texas senator in an effort to shore up his conservative base Many Republicans familiar with Nevada worry about this nightmare scenario If Trump loses decisively along the Eastern seaboard  New Hampshire Virginia North Carolina andor Florida  the networks could declare that Clinton is the presidentelect before polls even close in Nevada Many core GOP voters typically cast their ballots while commuting home from work What if a couple percent of them decide that the election is over and its not worth waiting in line Because Republicans are so reliant on these voters and Democrats will have so many votes locked in from early voting it could lead to a downticket bloodbath At the very least it could tip a close Senate race to Cortez Masto Happening today at 10 am Eastern The 202 goes live with Gary Johnson I just

city Hugh Naylor ScoopPlans to send heavier weapons to CIAbacked rebels in Syria stall amid White House skepticism by Greg Miller and Adam Entous As rebelheld sections of Aleppo crumbled under Russian bombing this month the Obama administration was secretly weighing plans to rush more firepower to CIAbacked units in Syria The proposal which involved weapons that might help those forces defend themselves against Russian aircraft and artillery made its way onto the agenda of a recent meeting President Obama held with his national security team And thats as far as it got Neither approved nor rejected the plan was left in a state of ambiguity that US officials said reflects growing administration skepticism about escalating a covert CIA program that has trained and armed thousands of Syrian fighters The operation has served as the centerpiece of the US strategy to press Assad to step aside But US officials said there are growing doubts that even an expanded version could achieve that outcome because of Moscows intervention Obama officials said now seems inclined to leave the fate of the CIA program up to the next occupant of the White House Bill Murray received the Mark Twain

for Hillary Clinton by Matea Gold and Anu Narayanswamy Determined not to fall behind in the money race she has ramped up her appeals to rich donors and shrugged off restrictions that President Obama had imposed on his fundraising team Even as her advisers fretted about the perception that she was too cozy with wealthy interests they agreed to let lobbyists bundle checks for her campaign including those representing some foreign governments  Top aides wooed major donors for super PACs taking advantage of the leeway that campaigns have to legally collaborate with the groups on fundraising An analysis by The Post found that more than a fifth of the 1 billion donated to help her bid was given by just 100 wealthy individuals and labor unions  many with a long history of contributing to the
