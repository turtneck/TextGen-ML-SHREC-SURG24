shorty Dispatches from Eric Zuesse O n November 1st The Intercept headlined HERES THE PROBLEM WITH THE STORY CONNECTING RUSSIA TO DONALD TRUMPS EMAIL SERVER  and the reporting team of Sam Biddle Lee Fang Micah Lee and Morgan MarquisBoire revealed that Slates Franklin Foer published a story thats been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime an enormous eyebrowraising claim that Donald Trump uses a secret server to communicate with Russia That claim resulted in an explosive night of Twitter confusion and misinformation The gist of the Slate article is dramatic  incredible even Cybersecurity researchers found that the Trump Organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with Alfa Bank Russias largest commercial bank This is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over and drool Foer did The Intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying Franklin Foer is an American warmonger and pr agent a Democrat and former editor of The scurrilous Neocon New Republic Foer was a 2012 Bernard L Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation Could it be that Donald Trump used one of his shoddy empires spam marketing machines one with his last name built right into the domain name to secretly collaborate with a Moscow bank Sure At this moment theres literally no way to disprove that But theres also literally no way to prove it and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof Without more evidence it would be safer and saner to assume that this is exactly what it looks like A company that Trump has used since 2007 to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that Otherwise were all making the exact same speculation about the unknown thats caused untold millions of voters to believe Hillarys deleted emails might have contained Benghazi coverup PDFs Given equal evidence for both go with the less wacky story However they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of Trump was it just sloppiness on the part of Slate and of Foer Hardly  it was anything but unintentional A core part of the Democratic Partys campaign for Hillary Clinton consists of her claim that Donald Trump is secretly a Russian agent This is an updated version of the Republican Joseph R McCarthys campaign to root communists out of the federal government and of the John Birch Societys accusation even against the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower that With regard to  Eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason Neoconservatives  in both Parties  are the heirs of the Republican Partys hardright which now even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union hate Russia above all of their other passions Neoconservatism has emerged as todays Republican Partys Establishment and like with the Democratic Partys original neocon US Senator Henry Scoop Jackson the Senator from Boeing theyve always viewed Russia to be Americas chief enemy and they have favored the overthrow of any nations leader who is friendly toward Russia such as Saddam Hussein Muammar Gaddafi Viktor Yanukovych and Bashar alAssad Hatred and demonization of Russia is the common core of neoconservatism  the postColdWar extension of Joseph R McCarthy and the John Birch Society Neoconservatives  in both Parties  are the heirs of the Republican Partys hardright which now even decades after the 1991 end of communism and the Soviet Union hate Russia above all of their other passions Both Slate and especially Foer have long pedigrees as Democratic Party neoconservatives  champions of US invasions otherwise called PR agents journalists promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as Raytheon Lockheed Martin Dyncorp and the Carlyle Group offer to the US federal government Ill deal here only with Foer not with his latest employer in a string all of which are neocon Democratic news media Foer wrote in The New York Times  on 10 October 2004 against isolationist Republicans who regretted having supported George W Bushs invasion of Iraq and he headlined about them there Once Again America First  equating non neoconservative Republicans with essentially the profascist isolationists of the 1930s He concluded that they would come to regret their regret Conservatives could soon find themselves retracing Buckleys steps wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts Thats how farright Franklin Foer is hes to the right of those Republicans  On 7 June 2004 Foer in a tediously long badly written and argued article in New York Magazine  The Source of the Trouble  described the downfall of The New York Timess leading stenographer for George W Bushs lies to invade Iraq their reporter Judith Miller He closed by concluding that the source of the trouble was that Miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard  not that she was a stenographer to power  People like Miller with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition obsession and competitive fervor relying on people like Ahmad Chalabi with his smooth affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives for the benefit of people reading a newspaper trying to get at the truth of whats what   She was anything but trying to get at the truth of whats what She was the opposite a mere stenographer to George W Bush and to the Administrations chosen mouthpieces such as the antiSaddam exiled Iraqi Ahmad Chalaby O n 20 December 2004 when the question of whether to bomb Iran was being debated by neoconservatives Foer who then was the Editor of the leading Democratic Party neoconservative magazine The New Republic  headlined in his magazine Identity Crisis Neocon v Neocon on Iran  and he introduced a supposed nonneocon from the supposedly nonneocon Brookings Institution Kenneth Pollack to comment upon the conflict among  the other Partys  neocons In part the lack of neocon consensus on whether to as John McCain was to so poetically put it Bomb bomb bomb Iran  can be attributed to the nature of the problem Nobody  not the Council on Foreign Relations not John Kerrys brain trust  has designed a plausible policy to walk Iran back from the nuclear brink Or as Kenneth M Pollack concludes in his new book The Persian Puzzle this is a problem from Hell with no good solution But actually both Pollack and Brookings are Democratic Party neocons themselves and among the leading proponents of invading Iraq had been not only Pollack but Brookingss Michael OHanlon  Brookings had no prominent opponent of invading Iraq Brookings has a long history of neoconservatism  and routinely leads the Democratic Partys contingent of neocon thinking even urging a Democratic administration to have its stoogeregimes violate international laws  The real reason why neocons being the heirs of the farright extremists ColdWar demonization of Russia even after communism is gone wanted to conquer both Iraq and Iran was that both countries leaders were friendly towards Russia and were opposed by the Saud family who own Saudi Arabia which family quietly worked not only with the US government but with Israels government against both Iraq and Iran as well as against Syria  those three nations Iraq Iran and Syria all being friendly toward Russia which both the Saudi aristocracy and not only the US aristocracy hate Its not just the conservative news media that are neoconservative now The socalled liberal media are so neoconservative that for example Salon can condemn Donald Trump for his having condemned Hillary and Obamas bombing of Libya Salon condemned Trumps having said We would be so much better off if Qaddafi were in charge right now  as if Trump werent correct and as if what happened after our overthrow and killing of Qaddafi werent far worse for both Libyans and the world than what now exists in Libya But of course for Lockheed Martin etc it is far better CBS News and Mother Jones condemned the Trilateralist Joseph Nye for having veered temporarily away from his normal neoconservatism Then Nye wrote in the neocon Huffington Post saying that David Corn of Mother Jones and Franklin Foer of The New Republic had misrepresented what he had said and that he was actually a good neocon after all Nye closed In any case I have never supported Gaddafi and am on record wishing him gone and also on record supporting Obamas actions in recent weeks We now know that Gaddafis departure is the only change that will work in Libya Sure it did Oh really Its Trump who is crazy here More recently Foer headlined at Slate Putins Puppet If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests  and advance his own  hed look a lot like Donald Trump Foer proceeded to present the view of Trump that subsequently became parroted by the Hillary Clinton campaign that Trumptraitor Wikipedia has a 450person List of Republicans opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign 2016  and its almost entirely comprised of wellknown neoconservatives  the farthestright of all Republicans the people closest to Joseph R McCarthy and the John Birch Society Foer cited many neoconservative sources that are not commonly thought of as Republican such as Buzzfeed and he even had the gall to blame the Russian government for having made public its best evidence behind its charge which was true  that the overthrow of Ukraines democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 was no authentic democratic revolution such as the US government and its news media said but was instead a very bloody US coup detat in Ukraine  which was organized from the US Embassy there starting by no later than 1 March 2013  a year beforehand Foer wrote The Russians have made an art of publicizing the material they have filched to injure their adversaries The locus classicus of this method was a recording of a blunt call between State Department official Toria thats actually Victoria Nuland a close friend of both Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney and the American ambassador to Kiev Geoffrey Pyatt The Russians allegedly planted the recording on YouTube and then tweeted a link to it  and from there it became international news Though they never claimed credit for the leak few doubted the White Houses contention that Russia was the source To a neoconservative even defensive measures such as Russias there exposing the lies that America uses to justify economic sanctions and other hostile acts against Russia  indeed anything that Russia does against Americas aggressions against Russia and against Russias allies such as Saddam Hussein Muammar Gaddafi Bashar alAssad and Viktor Yanukovych  anything that Russia does is somehow evil and blameworthy And of course Americas aggressions are not The US government and its neocon propagandists are outraged that some people are trying to expose  instead of to spread  their lies The American government isnt yet neocon enough in the view of such liars About the author SUBSCRIBE TODAY NOTHING TO LOSE EVERYTHING TO GAIN free  safe
