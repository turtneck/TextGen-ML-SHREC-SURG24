The revolving door between politics and journalism and sometimes right back again has been spinning for a very long timeJournalism depends so much on credibility The recent Brian Williams scandal reminds us that this is not simply an academic issuePoliticians and political operatives are all about the spin Their mission isnt to get as close as they can to the truth Its to win elections Which means casting everything in a light most favorable to their prospectsNot the finest or most appropriate credential for truthseekerOne day they are calling journalists to spin them to write favorably about their prominent political patrons and the next minute they are sitting at the table with journalists and indistinguishable from the journalists the late David Broder an outstanding Washington Post political reporter who loathed that spinning door once told American Journalism ReviewYet there are people who have overcome their substantial political baggage and made that transition in a most impressive way None more than the late Tim Russert a onetime aide to the late New York Democratic Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan Russert became a sterling host of NBCs Meet the PressAnother political player who seemed to have successfully navigated those treacherous waters was George Stephanopoulos I thought it was a truly bad idea when the former top aide to President Clinton a hugely partisan figure became a news analyst for ABC back in 1996 But Stephanopoulos now ABCs chief anchor host of its Sunday morning political talk show This Week with George Stephanopoulos and coanchor of Good Morning America turned out to be a pleasant surprise shedding his political warrior past and showing journalism chopsThe recent revelation that Stephanopoulos had donated 75000 to the Clinton Foundation between 2012 and 2014 not only raises serious questions about his judgment It also disqualifies him from having anything to do with covering the 2016 presidential race He has already said he wont moderate ABC News Republican primary debate in February which is a startSo far ABC is standing firmly behind its embattled anchor But its early in the saga and that could change quickly Regardless there is no way he should allow himself  or be allowed  to deal in any way with a contest in which Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite to become the Democratic candidate for presidentExhibit A of why that is the case came on April 26 when Stephanopoulos aggressively grilled Peter Schweizer author of the book Clinton Cash which is critical of the Clinton Foundation Stephanopoulos failed to disclose that he was a benefactor of said foundation But even if he had that would hardly have eliminated the problem The issue is the donations themselvesMaking them would be inappropriate for any political journalist But its particularly crucial for a former Clinton consigliere Even though he had had a public break with the Clintons Stephanopoulos of all people should not be giving money to anything having to do with them What was he thinkingSure the foundation is a charitable enterprise But all things Clinton tend to be closely intertwined And there has been no shortage of suggestions that people have been ponying up to the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons one of whom is a potential next president There are lots of worthy causes out there with no links to HillarylandOne key point Stephanopoulos role  and that of his network for that matter  are very different from the jobs and the forum of the excandidates who have made Fox News a full employment act for failed GOP presidential aspirants Fox is a political force ABC News is notStephanopoulos apologies have not been reassuring certainly not the initial one He first said he should have told his employer and his viewers about the donations which are a matter of public record not that he shouldnt have made them He later conceded that the donations were problematicFor someone so politically and journalistically astute this was a boneheaded  and totally tone deaf  error indeed
