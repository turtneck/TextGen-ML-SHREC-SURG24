This post has been updatedPresident Obama would veto a bill that would allow for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline the White House said TuesdayIfthis bill passes this Congress the president wouldnt sign it said White House press secretary Josh EarnestThe White Houses announcement came as the Republicancontrolled Congress was being sworn in GOP leaders have pledged to pass a bill authorizing the pipelines construction Sen Joe Manchin DWVa and John Hoeven RND introduced legislation Tuesday authorizing the pipelines constructionThe president is going to see the Keystone XL pipeline on his desk Sen John Barrasso RWyo said Sunday on Meet the PressSenate Democrats narrowly blocked passage of the bill in November The White House said at the time that the bill was something Obama doesnt supportIf this bill passes this Congress the president wouldnt sign it either Earnest saidEarnest said there is a wellestablished process in place for approving projects such as Keystone The 76 billion project would stretch nearly 1700 miles and deliver 830000 barrels of oil a day from western Canada to the United States Earnest said that because there is a process Congress should not meddleThat process is held up by alawsuit in Nebraska over whether the state legislature could allow the governor to make decisions on the pipeline rather than the states Public Utilities CommissionI think the president has been pretty clear that he does not think that circumventing a wellestablished process for evaluating these projects is  the right thing for Congress to do Earnest saidObama rejected a Canadian firms application to build the pipeline in 2012At a yearend news conference in December Obama sought to downplay the benefits of the pipeline He said the benefits for US citizens and workers from the pipeline would be nominalI think that theres been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the US economy Obama saidHouse Speaker John Boehner said Obama has sided with fringe extremists in the Democratic party who do not support Keystone not Americans who do want the pipeline to be built Boehner said the veto threat shows that Obama is hopelessly out of touch and has no plans to listen to his constituentsAfter years of manufacturing every possible excuse today President Obama was finally straight with the them about where he truly stands His answer is no to more American infrastructure no to more American energy and no to more American jobs Boehner said in a statementJack Gerard chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute said the group is very disappointed by the veto threatAnd I think it doesnt bode well for relationships between the White House and Capitol Hill GerardsaidIm disappointed the president has made that decision Im hopeful he and his advisers will reconsiderThe move angered not just Republicans and oil industry officials but some Democrats such as ManchinIts the most discouraging thing Ive ever heard Manchin said in a phone interview minutes after Earnest had made his comments For the leader of the country to say basically Forget it this is all for naught is not what this country is about its not what were all about and its not the process that Im used to working throughManchin said the move made a mockery of a legislative process under which Democrats as well as Republicans would have a chance to offer amendments to alter the bill To say that he wont give it a chance is absolutely a disservice to our country he addedAt the same time that the White House issued its veto threat Sen Richard J Durbin DIll objected to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee holding a hearing Wednesday on the Keystone XL bill Durbin said another Democrat whom he did not identify objected to the sessionWhile this means we wont be having a hearing tomorrow it does not slow down the Keystone XL floor process the panels spokesman Robert Dillon wrote in an email Sen Murkowski was committed to moving legislation through regular committee order and having a robust hearing process Working with the incoming ranking member we had lined up witnesses from a labor union and the Center for American Progress CAP to testify on the Keystone XL Democrats will no longer have an opportunity to hear that testimony or make statements We think thats unfortunateThe new Republican majority in Congress wants to play pipeline politics with our future and the president is focused on a single question is the tar sands pipeline in our national interest said Bob Deans a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council Its notSen Bernie Sanders IVt said he applauds Obama for standing up to Republicans trying to ram through Congress a bill to let a Canadian oil company ship some of the dirtiest oil on the planet across the United States on its way to overseas marketsSupporters of Keystoneargue that the pipeline will create jobs tied to the pipelines construction and boost a source of reliable energy helping the economy Opponents counter that it will extract oil from dirty tar sands in Canada and do little to help the US economy
