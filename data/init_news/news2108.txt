After a tireless campaign to unbind Republican delegates to vote their conscience at next weeks convention the antiTrumpers were trampled at a marathon rules committee sessionwere pushing a proposal designed to stop Trump in the days leading up to the Republican convention next week The proposal would unbind Republican delegates from how citizens in various states voted and allow them to vote instead based on their personal consciencesFor weeks members of the rules committee had been urged to support this rebel effort One delegate said she had received some 400 emails urging her to support the socalled conscience clauseIt all converged late Thursday night after an exhausting day of mindnumbing obscure rules changes Then came the dramatic moment a vote that one 40year rules committee veteran said had obviously been the subject of more preconvention publicity than any rules matter ever in living memoryThe incessant campaign of the antiTrump rebellion rankled some of the delegates committed to the New York businessman The people who sent all those emails Its over folks proclaimed Iowa delegate Steve Scheffler while the committee debated the proposal Lets get behind our nominee right nowThe results were disastrous Not only did the NeverTrump delegates lose on their issue by an overwhelming number but the Republican delegates voted to strengthen the binding of delegatesUsing procedures to their advantage proTrump forces on the committee shut down the NeverTrump effort with ease In the end the antiTrump delegates failed event to get a tallied vote on the conscience clausethey were shouted down in a voice vote They were denied even the chance to debate the initiativeThis angst isnt going to go away just because we paper over it with rules said Sen Mike Lee a rules committee delegate from Utah and a urging Trump instead to make the substantive case to Republican delegates for why they should support himNot long after his speech the senator walked out of the rules committee He told The Daily Beast he didnt want to comment on what happened insideUnbinding proponents never expected to gain a majority of committee members Instead the antiTrump Republicans set their sights on securing 28a quarterof the committees 112 members which would have sent the proposal to the convention floor as a minority reportKendal Unruh a Colorado delegate leading the unbinding effort claimed throughout the last week that the antiTrump Republicans had secured the necessary 28 votes citing the movements internal whip count A Wall Street Journal last week found 20 members open to consider unbinding delegatesYet a  published the day before the failed vote found only five committee members in support of allowing delegates to vote their conscienceThe antiTrump Republicans now plan to take their fight to the convention floor next week Under their interpretation of party rules delegates have always been free to vote their conscienceThe NeverTrump movements last chance to stop Trump will be through a lastminute challenge on the convention floor when state delegations participate in the official vote for the presidential nominationUsually each state delegation chairperson simply announces the state delegates vote count as it has been preassigned by party rules But an antiTrump delegate could contest his or her states vote count and ask for essentially a redo of votes while on the convention floorand the delegates hope to switch their votes away from Trump during the recount
