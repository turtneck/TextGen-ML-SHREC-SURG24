EDITORs NOTE This story was originally published on May 1 It has been updated to include the news that Pataki has announced his presidential campaignThe tall man in a blazer burst into the Chipotle in the middle of the afternoon He had a smile a TV camera following him and the jovial air of a man who expects to be recognizedGeorge Pataki from New York he said shaking hands with the first two diners he met Were doing the nonHillary tour Were actually saying hi to peopleThen the tall man moved on to quiz the next table about their food Chicken burrito I gotta try something new When he was gone the first two diners wondered Who was that Do they not have Chipotle where he livesIts like Oh Im from New York said Aaron Lee 22 What are you doing here thenOfficially what George E Pataki was doing was flirting  for the fourth time in 16 years  with the idea of running for president of the United StatesA few weeks ago Pataki was in New Hampshire raising money and telling people that he was close close close to making a decision Im strongly leaning toward making the run he told a radio station in New HampshireThis happened three times before Every other time Pataki flirted with running he didnt On Thursday the Republican exgovernor of New York announced that this time he is actually is runningSpring is the flirting season in American politics in the early part of this year more than 20 politicians were officially considering or exploring a run for president The key to understanding this strange everyfouryears ritual is to understand that there are two kinds of flirtingFor the bigname candidates the presidential flirt is a useful temporary legal dodge They will run They are essentially running already But they dont want to admit it yet because that would bring on tighter fundraising rulesFor the others  particularly the eight or so who have fallen out of the political spotlight  the flirt can be an end in itself It allows them to experience some of the most pleasant parts of a campaign audiences media attention a chance to raise money And then it lets them escape before they have to face the lesspleasant parts Such as getting crushedThis time apparently Pataki is ready to take that riskI make a joke that every four years theres the Olympics theres the World Cup and I come to New Hampshire thinking about running for president Pataki told a crowd of 15 people during a speech at a SeaDoo and snowmobile dealership in Laconia NHNobody laughed Then Pataki said this election was different This time in all honesty I see things differentlyPataki 69 has already lived a remarkable political life The son of a postman he unseated liberal icon Mario Cuomo D in a 1994 governors race  one of New Yorks legendary upsets Pataki then won second and third terms by large margins He led New York through the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the rebuilding of Ground ZeroBut he has not held office since 2007 Since then his political star has faded somewhatWho is Bloomberg a Jeopardy contestant said in January while looking at a photo of PatakiThe category was New York governors and the clue was He took New York into the 21st centuryNo host Alex Trebek said The other two contestants stared blankly at the same photo without buzzing in until time ran outAnother sign There used to be a museum about Pataki in his hometown of Peekskill NY It opened after he left office complete with an exhibit where schoolkids could see Patakis gubernatorial deskThen in 2013 it closed Its leaders thought maybe more schoolkids would visit if it was a Web siteBasically it would be like a monkey flying out of a unicorns posterior if Pataki won the 2016 Republican nomination said Floridabased GOP strategist Rick Wilson If Pataki got into the GOP primary he would face obstacles that go far beyond his meager name recognition He is prochoice He signed strict guncontrol laws He let state government spending grow rapidlyIn recent polls his best showing has been 1percentLets just say a meteor strikes the first debate and kills everyone except Pataki who is stuck in traffic Lets hypothesize for a moment Wilson said He thought No It still wouldnt be Pataki Theyd find somebody elseBut despite those long odds Pataki came to New Hampshire last month for his eighth flirtingrelated visit since September He later made a ninthI know I can appeal  not just to Republicans and conservatives  but to independents and intelligent Democrats as well Pataki told an audience of eight College Republicans at the University of New HampshireThis is the heart of Patakis pitch to voters Hes a Republican who won big in a blue state Hes a reformer who would tame Washingtons bureaucracy I go there today and its like Im on an alien planet Pataki said of Washington They are an insular world They talk a language you dont understandIn New Hampshire Patakis crowds were not big At the official opening of his super PACs office in Manchester for instance 25 people turned up And one of them turned out to be an incognito staffer for Donald Trump Think about that If this was an intentional act of flirteragainstflirter espionage which the Trump staffer denied it might be the most pointless dirty trick in the history of American politicsNevertheless wherever Pataki went the crowds were pleasant and admiringUnder a Pataki administration one man asked him at a diner how would Middle East policy changeThis is one of the things that makes flirting worthwhile for an expolitician it is an unlocked door back into the American political arenaThat can mean new audiences for men used to audiences The same College Republicans for instance had recently hosted a 2016 flirter whose odds are even longer than Patakis former Virginia governor James Gilmore III R Gilmore left office in 2002I mean thank God for Wikipedia said UNH senior Elliot Gault 22And the same kind of magic works on the news media Before former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee D announced he was exploring a presidential run on April 9 The Washington Post had not quoted him about anything in nine monthsIn the weeks after that The Post quoted him eight times Er nineClinton is just too hawkish Chafee said in an interview repeating his signature attack line on the Democratic frontrunner former secretary of state Hillary Rodham ClintonThe other great thing about flirting is the money While you flirt you can raise it And if you dont run you can spend it anywayIn 1999 for instance Pataki flirted with a campaign then gave up and endorsed George W Bush In 2007 he did it again I was very serious about it that time Pataki says now But Mayor Giuliani The former New York City mayor was in the race and Pataki didnt think there was room for two New Yorkers So he got outBoth times Pataki raised more than 1million in donors money Both times the New York Times reported Pataki spent it  giving to allied Republican candidates paying for Patakis travels and paying a circle of Patakis own advisers strategists and fundraisersI was very serious about it Pataki says But everywhere I went people had committed to Mitt Romney He pulled the plug but still raised and spent more than 600000 via a political nonprofitThis year Pataki is raising money again  for a super PAC called We the People Not Washington Among those leading the fundraising are several Pataki associates who got paid from the money he raised in past flirtations Aides wouldnt say how much hed raised or spent this timeBecause he was my friend I wouldnt feel cheated if Pataki didnt run Im never one to say that a guy should be a suicide lunatic said Peter Kalikow a New York real estate titan who donated to Patakis super PAC this year In the last presidential cycle Kalikow was a major backer of another long shot pizza executive Herman CainPatakis aides said they had a strategy ready if their man really got into the race Hell stand out in the debates with his genial wit and executive experience Then hell surge in New Hampshire by appealing to libertarianleaning Perhaps were getting ahead of ourselvesWhen I heard the name I was like Pataki Pataki Pataki But I didnt know that he was the mayor of New York Tony Coutee 42 a crane operator who was at the second table Pataki visited in that Manchester Chipotle said incorrectly After Pataki left his table Coutee said I Googled him and found outWhile the two of them were talking Pataki was into a fullblown campaignstyle restaurant schmooze He bumped elbows with the grill man He walked back to greet employees in the walkin cooler He just shook my hand and I said I didnt want to be on camera and he asked if I was on parole one said bewildered Pataki went through the line and loudly asked if he could leave a tipThen he came back and sat down with Coutee and Soto Im trying the chicken burrito Pataki told themThe two men quickly got up to leaveKinda normal Soto said of this onlyinflirtingseason interaction a pseudoconversation with a pseudocandidate who never said what he was running for But abnormalAnu Narayanswamy in Washington contributed to this report
