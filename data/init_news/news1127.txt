Washington CNN President Barack Obama on Wednesday made the case for Congress to formally authorize the use of military force in the war against ISIS declaring that congressional passage of the measure makes the US strongest in the fight and that ISIL is going to loseNow make no mistake this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time he said during an afternoon press conference But he added Our coalition is on the offensive ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to loseObama flanked by Vice President Joe Biden Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel outlined the parameters of the request he delivered to Congress earlier that day He said the bill reflects our core objective to destroy ISIL and includes authority for a systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes support and training for forces on the ground and humanitarian assistanceHe made clear however that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force or AUMF does not call for the deployment of ground troops in Iraq or SyriaI am convinced that the US should not get back into another ground war in the Middle East  its not in our national security interest and not necessary for us to defeat ISIL he saidThe joint resolution would limit the Presidents authority to wage a military campaign against ISIS to three years and does not authorize enduring offensive ground combat operations according to text of the resolutionThe resolution would also sunset the 2002 AUMF that spawned the Iraq War Obama withdrew American troops from Iraq in 2011 but the military authorization remains in effectThe resolution drafted by the White House does not repeal the 2001 military force authorization that has served as the legal justification for the military campaign against ISIS and other US military efforts to combat terrorism around the worldThe document also specifically notes that ISIS poses a grave threat to US national security interests and regional stabilityAnd Obama detailed the ISIS threat in a letter to Congress accompanying the draft legislationThe socalled Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL poses a threat to the people and stability of Iraq Syria and the broader Middle East and to US national security Obama writes It threatens American personnel and facilities located in the region and is responsible for the deaths of US citizensAs in the draft resolution Obama goes on to name the Americans killed in ISIS captivity including James Foley Steven Sotloff AbdulRahman Peter Kassig and Kayla MuellerThere is broad support in Congress for a formal AUMF though lawmakers disagree on the scope of the military powers that should be handed to the PresidentHouse Republican leaders were quick to dismiss the White House draft authorization as too limited insisting that the President should have fewer limitationsIf we are going to defeat this enemy we need a comprehensive military strategy and a robust authorization not one that limits our options House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Tuesday Any authorization for the use of military force must give our military commanders the flexibility and authorities they need to succeed and protect our peopleI have concerns that the presidents request does not meet this standardBoehners No 2 Rep Kevin McCarthy echoed Boehners support for an AUMF as well as his criticism of the limits the White Houses draft would imposeI am prepared to support an Authorization for Use of Military Force AUMF that provides new legal authorities to go after ISIL and other terrorist groups However I will not support efforts that impose undue restrictions on the US military and make it harder to win McCarthy said in a statementHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi took the opposite path during a press conference WednesdayWe hope to have bipartisan support for something that would limit the power of the President but nonetheless protect the American people in a very strong way Pelosi saidPelosi added that she hoped the threeyear authorization would be longer than needed to defeat ISISPelosi also offered her support for repealing the 2002 authorization another provision included in Obamas draft resolutionI dont see any reason  in fact I actively support  repealing the 2002 authorization It was based on a false premise Pelosi said Nonetheless it should go and it should go nowSen Rand Paul of Kentucky who is staffing up for a potential 2016 presidential bid took the opportunity to slam likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary ClintonI do really blame Hillary Clintons war in Libya Paul said Wednesday on Fox News referring to the NATO campaign to oust Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi authorized by Obama while Clinton was secretary of stateLibya has erupted into civil war and has become a breeding ground for radical Islamic fighters many of whom have left to join ISISs ranksPaul also said the US needs to supply more weapons to Kurdish fighters fighting ISIS in Iraq but said the US should refrain from getting involved in the war in Syria  fearing weapons supplied to moderate fighters could get into ISISs handsPaul has been at odds with his Republican colleagues on many aspects of foreign policy especially in urging for a more restrained and not limitless authority to fight ISISObama urged Congress during his State of the Union address to formally authorize the military campaign to show the world that we are united in this mission and Secretary of State John Kerry urged Congress to swiftly pass the resolutionWe are strongest as a nation when the Administration and Congress work together on issues as significant as the use of military force Kerry said This is a moment where Congress can make it clear all over the world that no matter differences on certain issues at home were absolutely united and determined in defeating ISILObama again noted in his letter to Congress Wednesday that he already has the authority to fight ISIS I have repeatedly expressed my commitment to working with the Congress to pass a bipartisan authorization for the use of military force against ISISObama also stressed that the White Houses draft resolution would constrain the US military effort and would not authorize longterm largescale ground combat operations like in Iraq and AfghanistanWhile Obama did not repeal the 2001 military authorization he explained in his letter that he remains committed to working with Congress and the American people to refine and ultimately repeal the 2001 AUMF
