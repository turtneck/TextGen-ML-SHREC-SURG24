Meeting small business capital technology and labor needs and relieving their regulatory burden could drive new boomThe economy has experienced 75 straight monthsmore than six years  of private sector job growth Yet some areas still have not recovered all the jobs lost during the recession and nationally underemployment exceeds prerecession levels How can we increase the speed of job creationA critical part of the answer lies with Americas small businesses which create over 60 of net new privatesector jobsand employ nearly halfof Americas workforce Helping them expand  to get their ideas off the ground  is one of the best ways to support economic growth and needs the continued focus of both elected officials and the private sectorPolitical debates on economic growth tend to focus on taxes But taxes are just one big issue facing small businesses A report released by Babson College  The State of Small Business in America underscores that fact It provides a window into small businesses most pressing needs and it can serve as a blueprint for addressing themAs weve seen through Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businessesentrepreneurs across the country are facing barriers to growth Based on a survey of over 1800small businesses the report pinpoints four major challenges that cut across industries the need for better access to capital less burdensome regulations more qualified workers and ability to better assimilate information technology Lets consider eachCapital Securing financing remains a major barrier to growth The net result is that across all sources while the median funding request is 100000 businesses typically secure just 40500 Small business owners overwhelmingly rely on banks for funding but banks face more stringent regulatory requirements that have restricted lending and made loans harder to obtain Closing the gap between what businesses seek and receive would lead to more hiring investment and growth It would also reduce the common practice of credit card borrowing where high interest rates can lead to financial difficultiesBusiness owners suggest a reconsideration of terms loan sizeand paperwork and more than oneinfour call for increased transparency in the borrowing process Policy discussions around credit access must recognize the need to balance the needs for both regulatory protection and economic growthRegulationNearly 60 of respondents have difficulty understanding and managing government regulations and laws Companies spend about 200 hours annually on compliance Governments should lessen this burden without compromising consumer and environmental protections Streamlining agencies approval processes for instance can help small businesses open their doors sooner and expand more rapidly In addition simplifying the tax code would be a boon to small businesses allowing them to spend less time and money on complianceSkillsOverwhelmingly a major hiring challenge was finding employees with the right skillsets  a challenge even greater than salary requirements and competition for candidates Small businesses are increasingly looking for techsavvy workers who also have the required licenses and certifications The Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey identifies 58 million openings  the secondhighest level on record  reflecting a mismatch between company needs and applicants skillsMore collaboration between state and local workforce development programs and the private sector can help address this skills gap and community colleges have an important role to play too Programs and curriculum need to align with job needs in growing industriesto ensure that graduates leave with the skills necessary to get hired Some governments have begun subsidizing internships recognizing there is no substitute for onthejob training Cooperative programs among small businesses in each industry can also share in the costs of professional developmentTechnology Small businesses recognize technology as essential to productivity and success But accessing modern technology is perceived as costly and requires skills that many businesses lack Better technology is also urgently needed to protect against the increasing threat of cybercrime which 40 of respondents are not prepared to handleIn fact oneinfive have been victims of cybercrimes part of a disturbing global trend in which businesses are becoming hackers preferred target Given advances in the affordability of technology technological literacy can be improved through increased access to resources enhanced trainingand clearer government cybersecurity standardsSmall businesses face other challenges but progress in these four areas would provide a significant boost to local hiring  and to national economic growth More than six years into a sluggish recovery we must do more to help small businesses drive a new generation of growth  and put the next generation of Americans to workLloyd Blankfein
