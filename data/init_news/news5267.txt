It wasnt long ago that the Left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics They used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations But today you see leftists protesting against Brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using Twitter on their Apple products while sipping on their Starbucks coffee and are calling for war in Syria to challenge the Russians So just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elitesTo understand we must go back to 2011 when the Occupy movement was ongoing The Occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system We can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their powerThe elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of West mobilized in mass to threaten their rule So the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution And they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and ruleThe Diversion When the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere The people want to vent out their frustrations The elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhereOn February 2012 with the Occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in Florida the none other than the infamous Trayvon Martin case The shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them With their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of AmericaBut they didnt stop there Police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of Black Lives Matter movementa movement that is financed by George Soros and others to stir up unrests across AmericaDid the elites convert Occupy protesters into SJW patsiesThe diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the 1 who were dictating their lives The Occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere Although I dont have as much proof as with the rise of BLM movement I strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the Leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established orderThe Strategy Back in 19th century Karl Marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism If we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elitesThe goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power Meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans The worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possibleMy understanding of their modus operandi is this 1 Use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense 2 Have the Leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the Right 3 Let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats 4 When the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process By cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against themThus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men Islam and atheism against Christianity Left against Right and so on but no more antiglobalization Tea Party movement or Occupy Wall StreetAs long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change As long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided As long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named Cecil got shot the elites will continue to winA Couple More Points To Consider I know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about Theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terroristsFirst while this article has been focused on how the Left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the Right are not totally immune to their influence either Remember how Neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in America through faith and patriotism The support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against Iraq based on bullshit evidences of WMDs and SaddamAlQueda link While the Right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with Russia because USA USA USA Second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it The elites have far more sinister aims By raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control I get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social controlNo matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security Europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the US government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  A leaked Soros memo also reveals that the BLM movement is potentially being used to federalize the US police  While many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near futureThe Culture Wars Necessary Fight Or Engineered Distraction The issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elitesOn one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists Zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence Really do the issues of politicallyincorrect Halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the DNC the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world All the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shapeOn the other hand culture does matter in many ways Uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues And as much of the Leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model I described above In a way we are now forced to fight the Left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elitesSo does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us Or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their SJW drones I dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do I believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on We should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankindConclusion Is There Still Hope Although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current US election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment To me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling classWith Bernie Sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by Donald Trump This is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down Trump and use disgruntled Leftists against his supportersI have my doubts about Trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that Hillary Clinton will bring to America and the world if she gets elected But besides voting I believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us We cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destinyRead More The Elites Have One Rule For Themselves And One Rule For The Rest Of Us
