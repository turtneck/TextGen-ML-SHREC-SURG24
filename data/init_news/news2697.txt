Washington CNN In theory Carly Fiorina should be one of the best fundraisers in the Republican fieldShe was the breakout star in CNNs Republican debate on Wednesday the second straight contest in which shes distinguished herself Shes the former CEO of a major company and shes wellconnected in donorrich CaliforniaBut she has a problem The money hasnt followed the hype  yetBuzz tends to turn on the money spigot and shes clearly getting a lot of buzz out of last night said Ken Kies a longtime Republican bundler and lobbyist But its probably not enough to fuel the tank to get you through to FebruaryBuoyed by two consecutive widely praised debate performances Fiorina is expected to surge in the next round of public opinion surveys But party insiders say her next challenge will be to convert that goodwill into hard dollars that can drive votes come next winterDespite her deep connections to the conservative movement in Washington and to the moneyed class of Silicon Valley Fiorinas campaign had only 1 million on hand as of this summer just slightly more than the same amount as Rick Perry who has since dropped out of the race due to financial problems The former HewlettPackard executive took in about 17 million in the first two months of her campaign less than every other Republican candidate she shared the stage with on Wednesday that reported totalsAnd her super PAC which can collect checks of unlimited size only hauled in about 35 million a smaller sum all the more harmful given the candidates unusual dependence on the outside group Almost half of that money came from one of the partys biggest donors Jerry PerenchioShell face an early test Fiorinas campaign will have only two weeks to capitalize on Wednesdays performance before needing to file new numbers with election officials But her supporters  along with top unaligned GOP fundraisers  say the narrative is about to changeMy emails are going crazy today said Karolyn Dorsee who is organizing a San Diego fundraiser for Fiorina but hasnt committed to help her exclusively If my little world here is any indication she is on fireHer world likely isnt  Fiorinas first reports reveal that she drew heavily from the deep well of California donors something she may need to broaden to make a serious run for the GOP nomination But even top moneymen working for other campaigns said they expected the new Republican star to give their fundraising shops a run for their money predicting that she could post mammoth returns in the final two weeks of what is traditionally a sleepy quarterThere were already immediate signs on Thursday that donors were watching CNNs debate closely Stanley Hubbard a Minnesota billionaire and a top backer of struggling Wisconsin governor Scott Walker said he planned to give the maximum he could to Fiorinas campaign 2700 though he said the only super PAC hed give to would be WalkersMaybe shes another Margaret Thatcher Shes terrific said Hubbard who is also cutting new 2700 checks to Chris Christie and Marco Rubio We think theyre breakthrough peopleHubbard is part of a network of topflight donors organized by Charles and David Koch who surprisingly extended an invitation to Fiorina to address their millionaires as an exclusive conference this summer That coveted speaking slot gave the Californian a chance to win over some of the biggest GOP whales who could easily write sevenfigure checks to Fiorinas super PACThat group has perhaps gone further than any other outside group at taking the place of a traditional campaign The super PAC christened CARLY for America is often times confused in reports with the official operation Carly for President The super PAC officials travel with the candidate as she barnstorms the country and helps the businesswoman collect endorsements from earlystate officialsBut it has struggled to reel in large donations beyond Perenchio convincing only a handful of Republican donors to give sixfigure amounts to the group The super PAC supporting Jeb Bushs bid for instance raised 30 times the amount than did Fiorinas The groups second biggest donation came from a separate super PAC bankrolled by billionaire Republican Bob Mercer but Mercer is expected to overwhelmingly back Fiorina rival Ted Cruz whom he originally gifted 11 millionFiorina loyalists say that Wednesday nights debate means more bigmoney backers are en routeI dont know if she really has a chance to win but I like seeing her in these debates said Orlando executive Richard Lee who gave the group 25000 in April despite originally pledging to not get involved in the primary After last night she should probably be able to do betterThats the thinking of many Republican donors who like Hubbard and Mercer are supporting Fiorina as a side bet in a 16candidate field Some of the biggest names in Republican politics appear on Fiorinas campaignfinance reports but with small dollar amounts next to her name They may envision her as a pitbull against the Democratic nominee  shed eat Hillary Clinton alive said Hubbard  or as a worthwhile investment in the party that has been attacked by Democrats as waging a war on womenAnd while Hubbards 2700 could be a token of more to come top fundraisers point out that candidate cannot wage a campaign entirely on the back of a super PAC Perrys group raised more than 17 million but his cash strapped campaign lasted 100 days Candidates tend to spend months building professional fundraising operations that can systematically collect maximum checks from dozens of their associates and top bundlers say that doesnt bloom overnightWill people go out of their way to call their friends asked David Beightol a top bundler for Mitt Romney who is now raising money for Bush If she has those tools in place she could do really well If she doesnt she might get a lot of little donors  and that wont hurt  but to make a difference shes going to have some big donors tooFiorina friends say she is fine being underestimated as a fundraiser  arguing that both of the past two debates are evidence that shell beat expectationsShe believed that at first no one would take her seriously Then that shes nice to have there said super PAC donor Phil Lebherz an ally from CaliforniaLebherz said shes now taking the third step And then shes a threat
