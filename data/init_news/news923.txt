To watch the video of photographer Tim Tai getting pushed around by a turfprotecting scrum of protesters at the University of Missouri is to experience constitutional angstYou dont have a right to take our photos said one protester at the universitys Mel Carnahan Quadrangle following the news that University system President Tim Wolfe and chancellor R Bowen Loftin would resign amid an uproar about racial issues on campusI do have the right to take photos replied Tai a 20yearold senior at the university who was shooting the proceedings on Monday on assignment for ESPNcom A former staff photographer for the Columbia Missourian Tai was forced by circumstances to doubletask as he attempted to take photographs and provide civics lessonsFollowing the announcement of the resignations Tai chronicled a celebration including the protest group Concerned Student 1950 After 10 minutes or so of jubilation said Tai in an interview with the Erik Wemple Blog protesters decided that it was time to push the media away from an encampment of tents on the quads lawn  Media get off the grass  said the organizers as Tai recallsYet he wasnt backing up He wanted some good shots of the tents and thats where the trouble startedYoure an unethical reporter you do not respect our spaceThose were just a few of the taunts that Tai received as he attempted to do his work His references to a certain founding document persuaded precisely none of his opponents Maam the First Amendment protects your right to be here and mine he said At one point Tai tangled with a protester about the absence of any law proscribing his presence on this disputed grass Forget a law  how about humanity protested the protesterSo much for the ideal of the American collegiate quad as a locus of tolerance and free expression Time to usher in a new ethic of intimidation a twist that carries some irony at the Columbia Mo campus Back in February 1987 58 protesters seeking the universitys divestiture from companies that do business in South Africa were arrested for trespassing on the quad They were dropped in all cases but one who secured an acquittal on the grounds that the quad was a highly public spaceThe people who were trying to impede the photographer in effect were trying to impede his rights to be there says Sandy Davidson a curators teaching professor at the University of Missouri school of journalism Nor was Tai intent on peering into the tents with his lenses I was not trying to get into the tents says Tai I wanted a picture of the tents placing it in the quad  because thats part of the story Regarding the restraint that the protesters were demanding Tai felt this wasnt the time I think  there are times when its best for photographers to put their camera down he says However In this situation this was national news breaking news  at a public university and the students involved have become public figuresUpon checking his photos Tai realized that the obstruction worked They didnt turn out well because all the hands were in the way and you know  he says Were he to be given a redo hed likely just move to another spot At the moment I felt I had to stand up for being there he saysTom Warhover executive editor of the Columbia Missourian said the Tai video aligns with recent events The protesters all week have asked people kind of to stay out of the tent area proper if you will and so weve had many confrontations because it is a public space and  other students have a right to be there says Warhover who approves of how Tai carried himself Im pretty proud of Tims actions both standing up for himself and his job but doing it in a way that didnt provoke Through his travels Tai has learned that on one hand the protesters want to protect idea of privacy and protect a safe space where not theyre not overwhelmed with the attention On the other hand they want to control the narrative themselves because they feel the media has not treated minority or black stories accuratelyTheres no excuse for protesters to push a photographer in a public square theres no excuse for protesters to appeal for respect while failing to respect theres no excuse for protesters to dis the same rights that allow them to do their thingAnd theres even less excuse for faculty and staff members at the University of Missouri to engage in some of this very same behavior In his chat with this blog Tai cited the involvement of Richard J Chip Callahan professor and chair of religious studies at the university In the opening moments of the video Callahan faces off with Tai over whether the photographer can push to get any closer to the tents Im not gonna push them says TaiMoments later the protesters resolve to throw up their hands literally to show Tai who owns this public roost Callahan participates in this collective action As Tai swivels his camera from place to place Callahan shuffles to block the sight paths Behold these screenshotsCallahan after moving a bit to the left and holding up his handsCallahan again after moving to the right with hands aloft The religious studies prof paired agility drills with his censorshipA source with access to Callahans tweets theyre protected passes along these screenshots to yield some insight on his views regarding the media and the protests at the universityCallahan didnt respond to emails and phone calls The universitys media office said it has no comment at this point on the staffers Not only did Tai identify Callahan as the person at the start of the video but so did Peter Legrand a graduate who took courses from CallahanAt the 200 minute mark in the above video Janna Basler the universitys assistant director of Greek life and leadership adds her own thuggish sensibilities to the mix Sir I am sorry these are people too You need to back off Back off go In her showdown with Tai Basler lays bare how little she knows about photography As they tussle about a woman with whom Tai had just finished arguing Basler says She gets to decide whether shes going to talk to you or notTai responds like someone whos interested in securing images not quotes I dont want her to talk to me he says as Basler gets in his face When Tai asks her whether shes with the office of Greek life Basler responds No my name is Concerned Student of 1950And the video ends with assistant professor of communication Melissa Click essentially threatening a journalist Who wants to help me get this reporter out of here I need some muscle over hereThese three university employees had a chance to stick up for free expression on Monday Instead they stood up for coercion and darkness They should lose their jobs as a resultUPDATE The universitys journalism school dean has released a statement reading in part as follows
