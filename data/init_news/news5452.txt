Floridas deceptive solar initiative backed by utilities companies loses support Its a monopoly wolf in solar sheeps clothing By Nika Knight Posted on November 4 2016 by Nika Knight As utilities companies funnel millions of dollars into a lastditch effort to convince Florida voters to pass an antisolar initiative the latest polling data shows support for the measure falling  Floridas Amendment 1 is  deceptive  environmentalists argue as it is written in prosolar language but would in actuality block widespread adoption of solar power in the Sunshine State The measure is backed by a political committee formed by utilities companies which has so far raised more than 26 million to fund the campaign As we like to say its a monopoly wolf in solar sheeps clothing Dr Stephen Smith executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a founding member of Floridians for Solar Choice told the Sierra Clubs Sierra magazine We are in a pitted battle to stop the utilities from choking off citizenowned solar The initiative would write peoples right to own or lease solar panels and other equipment into the state constitution InsideClimate News explains  But it would also make it unconstitutional to require a utilitys nonsolar customers to subsidize those who do go solar Those subsidies have helped make home solar affordable and are the best incentive to push the fastgrowing energy source to widespread use Support for the measure fell markedly after an audio recording leaked to the public last month in which a lobbyist working for electric companies bragged about the measure to industry insiders The Miami HeraldTimes  which released the recording reported  Sal Nuzzo a vice president at the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee      called the amendment which has received more than 21 million in utility industry financing an incredibly savvy maneuver that would completely negate anything they prosolar interests would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road according to an audio recording of the event supplied to the HeraldTimes  He offered others a recommendation As you guys look at policy in your state or constitutional ballot initiatives in your state remember this Solar polls very well he said To the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiujitsu and take what theyre kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy in legislation or in constitutional referendumsif thats the direction you want to takeuse the language of promoting solar and kind of kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop Im discouraged as a citizen how far we have slipped and see Amendment 1 as a means of accelerating that decline in solar in Florida Graham said according to the Miami Herald And Grahams far from the only prominent voice to condemn the measure Former Vice President Al Gore speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton described the amendment as  phony baloney  Carl Hiassen Floridas bestknown opinion journalist has called the proposal a  slick oily fraud  and even the usually apolitical Jimmy Buffett has urged a no vote noted Such statements from opponents of the initiative have gone far to quell support according to a new poll One of those voters was Barbara Waks a retiree who had already mailed in her earlyvoting ballot when the Herald story appeared She said that she thought she was supporting renewable energy the New York Times reported I felt so stupid she told the Times Im familiar with the political arena and the garbage that exists but this is beyond the pale Nika Knight is a Common Dreams
