Wed 26 Oct 2016 0804 UTC  periodictablecom Are you taking your iodine Everyone should be supplementing with iodine but if you live on the west coast of the United States Canada or Mexico you better be taking your iodine and your children should be taking their iodine because Thanks to the environmental disaster that was Fukushima and the incredibly long halflife of iodine129 the Pacific coast may never be the same again It will take about 16 million years for the contamination from the tremendous nuclear accident to dissipate  While a vast array of radioactive isotopes were released into the environment during the Fukushima meltdown iodine129 is a particularly concerning material due to its incredibly long halflife This means that basically any food that comes from the North American western coast will likely be contaminated with radiation for innumerable generations to come Radiation in the oceans will inevitably enter our water supply and consequently our food supply as well According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR iodine from the ocean enters the air as sea spray or iodine gas Once in the air iodine can then combine with water particles and enter surface water and soil once the particles fall to ground Iodine can remain in the soil for extremely long periods of time because it can combine with organic material easily Plants and vegetation that grow in this soil also have the potential to absorb the iodine Iodine could potentially improve your health People who have low iodine levels are more likely to get thyroid cancer than those who do not Low iodine levels also cause goiter an enlarged thyroid and this increases the chance of developing thyroid cancer When faced with a radioactive cloud as is everyone in the northern hemisphere thanks to Fukushima it is absolutely imperative that we take iodine whatever iodine you can get your hands on If the only iodine available is topical iodine that is not suitable for oral use then you should paint your body and your childrens bodies with it Dr Brownstein writes If there is enough inorganic nonradioactive iodine in our bodies the radioactive fallout has nowhere to bind in our bodies It will pass through us leaving our bodies unharmed It is important to ensure that we have adequate iodine levels before this fallout hits Dr Michael B Schachter says The treatment dose when a person is iodine insufficient is generally between 125 mg and 50 mg daily Preliminary research indicates that if a person is iodine insufficient it takes about three months to become iodine sufficient while ingesting a dosage of 50 mg of iodine daily and a year to achieve that while ingesting a dosage of 125 mg of iodine daily Women with a history of low iodine levels hypothyroidism face a significantly higher risk of developing liver cancer Researchers led by Manal Hassan of Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas concluded that this finding suggested a clinical association between hypothyroidism and hepatitis C which is contributing to the countrys rising rate of liver cancer At 6 grams daily which is 6 million microgramsday or 6000 milligramsday a much higher dose iodine has been used to cure syphilis skin lesions and chronic lung disease  says Dr Gabriel Cousens  From a larger physiological perspective it is important to realize that the thyroid is only one gland of many glands and tissues that needs iodine Other glandsorganssystems with high iodine uptake are the breasts ovaries cervix blood lymph bones gastric mucosal salivary adrenal prostate colon thymus lungs bladder kidney and skin Iodine is found and used in every hormonal receptor in the body he states No one recommends that much iodine today but it is good to understand iodine so one is not afraid to take as much as one needs Iodine prevents cancer especially in the breasts ovaries and prostate gland It is also extremely important in the age of antibiotic resistant infections for it kills viruses bacteria and fungi Breast tissue contains the bodys third highest concentrations of this essential mineral so shortfalls in iodine needs have a highly negative impact on breast tissue Iodine shortfalls coupled with bromine and other toxic halogens cause fibrocystic breast disease and breast cancer  It is unbelievable that doctors nor the government recommends enough iodine to protect people from the harm that comes from not taking iodine Makes me believe that most doctors have no idea how to practice medicinenot real medicine that helps more than it hurts The iodine in salt is enough only to prevent goiter but nothing else Comment For more information on the benefits of iodine and how to take it read
