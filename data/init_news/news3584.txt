It was refreshing to moderate a town hall with the Libertarian presidential and vice presidential candidates last week because Govs Gary Johnson and William Weld respect limits on presidential powerSunday when Foxs Chris Wallace challenged Johnsons plan to replace the IRS with a consumption tax Johnson pointed out that hes not getting elected dictator or kingWallace suggested that means Dont take my policies seriously because they wont get throughIt means that Johnson understands that America is a constitutional republic and there are and ought to be checks on what presidents can doIn response to Wallaces comment about Johnson not taking his promises seriously Johnson said Take them very seriously Count on certainty that were always going to support taxes going lower being in business being easier rules and regulations not getting worseClinton changes positions from year to year praising trade deals then condemning them condemning gay marriage then praising itthen scolding anyone who doesnt share her new positionTrump changes positions even faster sometimes day to day After saying hell deport millions of immigrants now he says he wont if they pay taxes and fill out paperworkroughly the same position Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio held when Trump trashed themLibertarians dont shift to fit the whims of the day because we have core principles One is On most every issue less government involvement is betterGovernment doesnt create jobs said Johnson when a young woman asked what Johnson and Weld would do about jobs The Libertarians said jobs get created when government gets out of the way imposing only a few clear and predictable rulesWhile Trump makes vague promises about making government great and Clinton about making it fair Johnson and Weld talk about getting rid of as much of it as they canThere are constitutional limits to that said Johnson But if you were to wave a magic wand there are a number of departments that come up Commerce Housing and Urban Development Education Homeland SecurityUnlike Trump and Clinton Johnson specifies cutsand hes willing to go after sacred cows such as defense spending You cant balance the federal budgetsomething were promising to do in the first 100 daysyou cant do that without cutting military spending  The BRAC Commission set up by the Pentagon says that weve got to eliminate 20 percent of those bases but that hasnt happenedWhen the GIs returned from World War II they had two sets of needs education and health care he says Education was handled through the GI Bill which was essentially a voucher system You could go wherever you wanted the most successful program in domestic political history of the 20th century Health care was the  opposite approach command and control one size fits all the government is going to do thisThe GI Bill vouchers allowed soldiers to enroll at a school they chose But for health care they must wait in long lines at governmentrun veterans hospitals sometimes dying for lack of adequate careApplying these freemarket lessons across a range of policies Johnson and Weld would roll back the drug war decrease our involvement in foreign wars and give individuals more control over how their Social Security funds are investedWhen an audience member suggested that voting for a third party is a wasted vote Weld replied Were fiscally responsible Were socially inclusive and tolerant but if you agree with us and you want to go waste your vote on Trump or Clinton be our guest Were LibertariansJohnson and Weld dont promise they can get rid of the Washington leviathan overnight but taking a few steps closer to liberty sounds like a good start to me Its a lot better than the path the two major parties want us to take
