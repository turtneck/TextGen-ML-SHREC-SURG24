The most controversial presidential campaign in modern American history has sharpened a longstanding debate Is it ethical to not voteMore than 92 million Americans who were eligible to vote four years ago didnt cast ballotsBut politics in the Age of Trump hasprompted editorial writers Democratic partisans and even some Republicans to argue that Donald Trump is so unacceptableas a potential commander in chiefthat citizens have a heightened duty to show up to cast their ballot against himSome Trump supporters presumably including those whochant Lock her up at GOP ralliesfeel the same way about Hillary ClintonLets be clearElections arent just about who votes but who doesnt vote first lady Michelle Obama said last week at a Clinton campaign rally at La Salle University in Philadelphia with a cautionary message aimed at Millennials And if you vote for someone other than Hillary or if you dont vote at all then you are helping to elect Hillarys opponent And the stakes are far too high to take that chance too highSome among the antiHillary brigades have decided in deference to their exquisite sensibilities to stay at home on Election Day rather than vote for Mrs Clinton she wrote in FridaysThe Wall Street Journal But she warned Her election alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable proudly uninformed psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White HouseOn Team Trump New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are among those whoargue it is Clinton whose election would pose athreat to the republic And some Republicanswho oppose Trump make the case for sending a message by supporting a thirdparty candidate or not voting at allFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush vanquished by Trump in the GOPprimaries told reporters Thursday after delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University that he planned to vote but not for Trump or Clinton If everybody didnt vote that would be a pretty powerful political statement wouldnt it he saidTrumps temperament criticism of MuslimAmerican Gold Star parentsa latenight Twitter storm against a former beauty queen  and policy views that include skepticism of the NATO alliance and admiration forRussian President Vladimir Putin have fueled alarm even among some lifelong Republicans aboutwhether he should be trusted with the nations highest office Former president George HW Bush and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney are among those who have said they wont vote for TrumpBut concerns about Clinton including questions about her honesty and trustworthiness have complicatedthe calculations by some voters aboutjust whom to support All that hasboosted Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson whose 73 level of support in the RealClearPolitics average of recent nationwidesurveys is higher than any thirdparty candidate on Election Day since Ross Perot in 1996When both majorparty candidatesget negative ratings from most Americans will more voters just stay homeInspirational contenders tend to do best in drawing voters to the pollsThe highest rate of turnout since World War II was 638 of the votingeligible population in1960 when a youthful Massachusetts senatorJohn F Kennedy narrowly won the White House After decades of moreorless steady decline it spiked again to 616 in 2008 whenIllinois senator Barack Obama was elected the nations first AfricanAmerican presidentBut scholars say fearcan be as compelling as hopeFear is a pretty big motivator just as is enthusiasm says Michael Dimmock president of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center which has studied voters and nonvoters Turnout in presidential elections tends to dip inyears such as 1996 and 2000 when voters dont see the stakes as particularly high or the differences between the two major candidatesas particularly sharpNeither factor would apply this time And high levels of interest this year may signal higher turnoutIn a Pew study released this summer more than eight in 10 said they were following news about the candidates closely the highest level of interest in a quarter century Eight in 10 said they had thought quite a lot about the election Three of four said it really matters who winsThat said twothirds called the tone of the campaigntoo negative and only four in 10 were satisfied with their choices the lowest level in two decades Just one in 10 said either candidate would make a good president Four in 10 said neither wouldWeve never had candidates like this for president says Michael McDonald a political scientist at the University of Florida who heads the United States Elections Project He turns to Senate races for comparison citing the 2010 Delaware contestwhen Democrat Chris Coons crushed Republican Christine ODonnell She was a controversial Tea Partybacked contender who among other things aired a TV ad denying she was a witchDespite a contest that wasnt seen ascompetitive turnout in the First State was among the highest in the country last yearMy guess is people are going to be activated to vote against these candidates McDonald says They may not like their particular candidate but they certainly dont like the other partys candidateIts notHowmuch do I like these people says Jan Leighley an American Universityprofessor and coauthor of Who Votes Now Demographics Issues Inequality and Turnout in the United States Its Does it make a difference between this person I do not like opposed to that person I do not likeThis year Trump has heightened that issue with rhetoricthat seems outside the scope of reasonable conversation or respectable public dialogue she says If he continues to do that she says the question for voters could be thisIsone being irresponsible by not casting a ballotIn the first tentative clues about turnout this year McDonald saysrequests for absentee ballots in congressional districts in Iowa Maine and North Carolina likely to favor Clinton have been running slightly ahead of requests at this point four years ago Requests in districts in those three states likely to favor Trump have been running slightly lowerMost Americans think theres an obligation to votesays Jason Brennan a Georgetown University professor and author of The Ethics of Votingthough the percentages may be inflated because they think thats what theyre supposed to say He doesnt agree likening it to a lottery when anindividual ticket or vote isnt likely to make a differenceThat said he generallydoes vote himselfA look at the demographics of those least likely to vote explains why Democrats are more focused on turnout efforts than Republicans A majority of eligible Latino voters and of voters under 30 didnt go to the polls in 2012 Both groups support Clinton over Trump and they make up significant blocs in some battleground states Millennials inColorado and VirginiaHispanics in Florida and NevadaClinton has vowed to encourage 3 million new Americans to register to vote before Nov 8 She and her top campaign surrogates increasingly are focused on registering voters before state deadlines loomand encouraging supporters to cast early ballotsThat said Trump has done well among another group of voters not inclined to cast ballots Those who dont have a college education Only a third of eligible voters who dont have a high school diploma voted in 2012 and less than half of those with only a high school education did soMost nonvoters stay away from the polls not because they are making an ideological statement but because they say they are too busy or they dont like either candidate or they dont think it matters if they voteAs a group they are younger less educated and less affluent than votersThey express less interest in politics and public affairs although a USA TODAYSuffolk University poll of unlikely voters in 2012 found twothirds of them said they were registeredThey are much more likely than voters to favor an activist government eight in 10 said the government plays an important role in their lives And the USA TODAYsurvey found they supported Obama over Romney by more than 21 a far wider margin than those who cast ballotsGetoutthevote efforts a standard part of presidential campaigns for decades have started earlier than ever this yearin part because of the rise in early voting An estimated four in 10 voters will have cast early or absentee ballots before the polls open on Nov 8 The GOTV campaigns also have taken on a fiercer intensity than say when the choice was between Barack Obama and Mitt RomneyI agree with the premise of The Arizona Republic The Detroit News and many others that Donald Trump is a unique kind of candidate who represents a unique kind of threat to our fundamental way of life says Norman Ornstein a veteran political analyst at the American Enterprise InstituteUSA TODAY which in the past hasnt endorsed a presidential candidate on Friday came out against Trump urging voters to go to the polls to support someone elseOrnstein acknowledges some voters are wary of Clinton as wellEven if you see it as the lesser of two evils he says one of those evils is going to become president
