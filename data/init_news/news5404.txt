America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn TIME November 1 2016 A nation without borders Donald Trump has warned us  is not a nation at all Trump was explaining the logic of the multibillion dollar wall he promises to build along the USMexican border but he was hardly the first to make the case Years ago Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the highflown rhetoric Teeshirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan snip snip For much of its early history the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed like the USMexican War while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba Central America and Hawaii Whats more the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous Until well into the nineteenth century immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens indeed for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was The only international migration policed was the African slave trade which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores snip It is easy when politics and ethnocentrism serve to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself while the borders are in fact regularly traversed by policy makers investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick Trump himself regularly touts though refuses to reveal his international dealings many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they dont outright violate American laws Truth is that the nations prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrantsvoluntary and involuntary free and slaveand that those who most loudly denounce a nation without borders are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins faith and lifeways at some point in the past We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance a nations security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospectsand thereby creating political alliesof working people around the world
