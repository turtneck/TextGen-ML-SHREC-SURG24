Email When TimeWarner announced it planned to merge with another major communications firm many feared the new company would exercise neartotal monopoly power These concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both TimeWarners competitors and consumers No I am not talking about TimeWarners recent announced plan to merge with ATT but the reaction to TimeWarners merger with then Internet giant AOL in 2000 Far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all competitors the AOLTimeWarner merger fell apart in under a decade The failure of AOLTimeWarner demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace AOLTimeWarner failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices andor better quality Corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors These managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with affordable quality products Thus laws making it difficult to launch a hostile takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm investors workers and consumers Monopolies and cartels are creations of government not markets For example the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees Similarly anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal regulations they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government Fortunately the Internet has given Americans greater access to news and ideas shut out by the governmentlicensed lapdogs of the mainstream media This may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web Government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry Large companies can afford the costs of complying with government regulations costs which cripple their smaller competitors Big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business Examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the Food and Drug Administrations FDA regulations that raise costs of developing a new drug as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals Another example is the DoddFrank legislation which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors Legislation forcing consumers to pay outofstate sales tax on their online purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less politicallypowerful competitors This legislation is being pushed by large brickandmortar stores and Internet retailers who are seeking a governmentgranted advantage over smaller competitors Many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the Federal Reserves inflationary monetary policy Perhaps the most famous example of this is the AOLTimeWarner fiasco which was a direct result of the Fedcreated dotcom bubble In a free market  mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices Any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices andor higher quality Monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of wellconnected crony capitalists Therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the regulations taxes and subsides that benefit politicallypowerful businesses The most important step is to end the boombust business cycle by ending the Federal Reserve  Article reposted with permission from The Ron Paul Institute Dont forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook  Google Plus   Twitter  You can also get Freedom Outpost delivered to your Amazon Kindle device here
