Before any rational discussion of the economic or scientific merits of President Obamas Clean Power Plan can begin it will be announced Monday it is necessary to take his rhetoric about its benefits off the table The president stated Sunday that his plan is protecting the world we leave to our children To be generous to the president that is a gross exaggerationBy the Environmental Protection Agencys own calculations the plan will reduce US emissions of carbon dioxide by about 10 from what they are now projected to be in 2030 Since by that time the US will be producing less than 20 percent of global CO2 emissions the result is at most 2 percent less growth in global emissionsBased on the calculations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that will make less than onetenth of a degree of difference in global temperaturesContrary to the presidents claims about saving lives and reducing energy costs his own EPA has found that the drastic cuts they are ordering will increase electricity costs while doing next to nothing to slow the pace of climate changeWhat the president will not admit about his ambitious plans is that they will not matter unless the countries actually responsible for future greenhouse gas emissions do far more than they now show any intention of doingThe worlds future major emitters will be China India Brazil  and of course Russia  and other rapidly growing economies whose use of fossil fuels is part and parcel of their growth plansThe Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency forecast that by 2030 these countries will be responsible for almost 60 of global greenhouse gas emissionsTheir role is growing fast not shrinkingDespite the presidential hoopla about the upcoming Paris climate summit what the actual preparations show is how little those other major emitters have any intention of doingThe Paris meeting is not about setting new binding international targets for global emissions Instead nations will determine their own efforts and communicate their intentions in documents called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions INDCsThis in the long run could be a great improvement over futile meetings to discuss mandatory targets but China the worlds largest source of CO2 has already stated its intention to keep growing carbon emissions out to 2030In other words the president is claiming that the US must provide a leading example at a time when the most important carbon emitters have already declared they will not follow itAt the pace those countries are moving the problem of climate change will be just as great for our children as it is today no matter what costly regulations the president imposes on the US economyDr W David Montgomery is an expert on the economic issues associated with climate change policy and testifies as an expert witness in state and federal courts on antitrust and damages cases dealing with petroleum and natural gas markets His scholarly work is frequently published in peerreviewed journals and Congressional committees have requested his testimony on climate change issues affecting oil and gas markets and other energy market and environmental issues on numerous occasions He advises clients on the strategic implications of changes in energy and environmental policies and energy markets
