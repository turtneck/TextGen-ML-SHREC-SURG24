The Washington Post reported Donald Trumps hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov Rick Scott The Trump campaigns latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly 767000 that Fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling Trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain Donald Trumps mentality has always been to put himself first Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign Anybody who works for the Trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because Donald Trumps version of making America great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket Trump Is Deadbeating On His Campaign Debts By Refusing To Pay His Own Pollster added by Jason Easley on Mon Oct 31st 2016
