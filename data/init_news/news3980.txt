Throughout the Republican Party from New Hampshire to Florida to California many leaders operatives donors and activists arrived this week at the conclusion they had been hoping to thwart or at least delay Donald Trump will be their presidential nomineeAn aura of inevitability is now forming around the controversial mogul Trump smothered his opponents in six straight primaries in the Northeast and vacuumed up more delegates than even the most generous predictions foresaw He is gaining highprofile endorsements by the day  a legendary Indiana basketball coach Wednesday two House committee chairmen Thursday And his rivals Sen Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov John Kasich are making the kind of rushed tactical moves that signal desperationThe party is at a turning point Republican stalwarts opposed to Trump remain fearful of the damage the unconventional and unruly billionaire might inflict on the partys downballot candidates in November But many also now see him as the allbutcertain nominee and are exhausted by the prospect of a contested July convention according to interviews this week with more than a dozen party figures from coast to coastPeople are realizing that hes the likely nominee said Tim Pawlenty a former Minnesota governor and onetime endorser of Sen Marco Rubio of Florida The hysteria has died down and the range of emotion is from resignation to enthusiasmIn Colorado  where Cruz outfoxed Trump in a series of clamorous meetings earlier this month to win all of the states 34 available delegates  former state party chairman Dick Wadhams said Fatigue is probably the perfect description of what people are feelingHe continued There is an acceptance a resignation or whatever that Trump is going to be the nominee More and more people hope he wins that nomination on the first ballot because they do not want to see a convention that explodes into total chaos People just want this to be over with  and we need a nomineeTrump rolls to crushing victories in five East Coast primariesWith likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pivoting to a general election and her wellfunded allies readying for a fullout assault Republicans are eager to unite quickly Some are fearful that waiting until the convention in Cleveland to pick a nominee would put the party at a disadvantage in raising money and engaging the DemocratsThe lions share of Republicans want the process settled said MikeDennehy a veteran New Hampshirebased party strategist Theres anxiety setting in about the process and thats what people are tired of They just want it done they want the fighting to stop and they want a generalelection campaign to begin in a meaningful waySo does Trump Celebrating his sweep in Tuesdays primaries he declared himself the presumptive nominee At a rally the next day in Indianapolis he proclaimed Were just about ready to put it away folksCruz is pushing back on the idea that Trump is nearing a lock on the nomination He took the unusual step Wednesday of choosing a running mate businesswoman Carly Fiorina The new ticket as well as independent groups opposed to Trump see Indianas primary on Tuesday as their best  and perhaps last  chance to derail the frontrunner and deny him the nominationOpposition to Trump still runs strong in parts of the GOP establishment Former Florida governor Jeb Bush a vocal Trump critic and former presidential candidate praised Cruzs pick of Fiorina in a CNN interview that aired Thursday  in part because he said she takes on Trump really wellSpeaking to reporters Thursday in Fort Wayne Ind Cruz predicted that Trump will not win the majority of delegates  1237  and blamed the mainstream media for bestowing what the senator considers a false sense of inevitability on Trumps campaignDonald sadly aided and abetted by media network executives who are all liberal Democrats who are all rooting for Hillary are quick to say that the race is over Cruz saidIndiana looms large for Cruz while options to stop Trump dwindleThe race is not over but both Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich are already mathematically eliminated from clinching the nomination on a first ballot and would need a convention floor fight to win Trump has won 992 of the required 1237 delegates so far according to the Associated Press Cruz has 562 and Kasich has 153 If he falls short Trump could persuade unbound delegates to lift him over the threshold on the first ballot at the conventionTrump has become a fact rather than a problem said Newt Gingrich a former House speaker who has offered informal advice to Trump but has not endorsed him Show me mathematically how youre going to stop him This all assumes by the way that the guy who wrote The Art of the Deal cant figure out a way to make a deal with the undecided delegatesRepublican consultants across the country are singing the same tune Reed Galen in Southern California said Is it a done deal Its certainly looking that way In Georgia Tom Perdue said If you go to barbershops in Atlanta youll hear people say they never thought hed end up being the nominee but for the most part people think he will be the nomineeOn Thursday Trumps top campaign adviser Paul Manafort was on Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers and press his case that Trump is becoming the de facto GOP standardbearerTwo prominent GOP establishment congressmen  Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania who chairs the House Transportation Committee and Jeff Miller of Florida who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee  endorsed Trump on ThursdayIts time for our party to unite behind

going to be holdouts till the very end who are bitter about what happenedAt last weeks RNC meeting in Hollywood Fla many party officials seemed resigned if not thrilled with the idea of Trump as the
