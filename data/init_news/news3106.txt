Eric Liu is the founder of Citizen University and the author of several books including  A Chinamans Chance and The Gardens of Democracy He was a White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton Follow him on Twitter ericpliu  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authorAs we mark Martin Luther King Jr Day this year its worth asking Can America handle either oneWhen Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa after the end of apartheid he had two choices He could have gone down a path of confrontation and retribution against the white Afrikaners who had ruled so oppressively Or he could have skipped quickly past the history and reality of apartheid and pardoned all its perpetrators in the interests of maintaining orderHe did neitherIn one of his many acts of civic genius he chose a path for his country that exposed the ugliness of the past and only then invited forgiveness His government launched a Truth and Reconciliation Commission led by Archbishop Desmond TutuThe commission gathered public testimony across the land naming the institutional structures and individual acts that had brutalized blacks No perpetrator was granted amnesty without a candid accounting of his or her deeds The opportunity for restorative justice gave every participant a sense of heightened responsibility  a chance to be bigger citizens togetherOnly then could reconciliation begin And though the commission was not sufficient to solve race in postapartheid South Africa it was still necessary Without such an attempt at formal accounting without such an opportunity for oppressed and oppressor to face one another that nations challenges would be even greater todayFor proof consider our own nation 150 years postslavery For a fleeting while after the Civil War we tried Reconstruction Freedmen could earn wages and vote freely and claim an equal place in politics Then we gave up on Reconstruction And Jim Crow came along to make black citizens secondclass and to ensure that neither truthtelling nor reconciliation would be on the agendaConsider our nation 50 years postcivil rights movement That movement is sometimes called the Second Reconstruction It sought to finish the fight to make truly equal citizens out of the descendants of slaves But here we are today still plagued postFerguson and postStaten Island by divisions of color and caste  and by an inability to talk about them without angry defensivenessYou can hear the objections already For instance Wont cataloging acts of racism from the past just make it harder for us all to get alongBut of course racism is not only in the past It did not end with the Thirteenth Amendment of 1865 or with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 It is present in the acts and attitudes of many today It is present in the institutional residue of past choicesThat the phrase BlackLivesMatter must be said says it all The criminal justice system the education system the economic system and as this years sowhite Oscars remind us the pop culture system  all of them value black lives black voices and black experience less than fully We must all face that factTheres also this objection to a commission that by racializing everything it would basically be racist Consider the words of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts who arguing against affirmative action once wrote that the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of raceThis tidy tautology flattens out history It obliterates the difference between injury and remedy It wants to rush us along to a colorblindness that our society hasnt yet earned and perhaps shouldnt even seek as an idealAs a Chinese American I am an inheritor of what white people wrote in the Constitution and what they did to subvert it I am the beneficiary of what black people and people of every color have done to redeem the Constitution I am sometimes the object of a presumption that yellow people are presumed foreign until proven otherwiseI own the good the bad and the ugly of this country None of this is neat None of it is colorblind eitherUltimately the deepest objection to a racial truth and reconciliation process in America is that it would be hard Hard to start and to finish We Americans can be a bit lazy when it comes to messy civic and historical truths We want our stories  and our Story  to have happy endings We want reconciliation on the cheapBut the point of MLK Day and of MLKs entire life is that true redemption is never cheap or easy So to honor him truly lets commit to whats hard Whether through official commissions or citizen conversations lets face ourselves
