And then there was oneThere is an expression on Wall Street for a stock that just keeps moving up and up while everybody is scratching their heads trying to figure out whats going onThey put their hands up and say Dont fight the tapeIt comes from back in the day when there actually was ticker tape and when Wall Street wasnt everyones favorite punching bagBut it helps explain what is going on right now in the mind bending age of Donald TrumpYou cant fight the tape and you cant fight a phenomenon Donald Trump is a phenomenon Barack Obama was a phenomenon A phenomenon is a happening or an experience It doesnt happen much folks but its happening now So get ready for the ride of a lifetimeThe point is all the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world cant stop a political phenomenon when its pulling out of the Trump Train stationNobody was going to beat Barack Obama in 2008 Thats a fact It was his moment It wasnt that John McCain ran a bad campaign or picked the wrong VP It was just that it didnt matter it was over when it started It has to do with understanding your momentreading the populace knowing that they want exactly the opposite of what theyve had in the White House They want a charismatic candidate to match what they are feeling and promise to give them exactly the big fat cheeseburger theyve been wanting ever since they went on that awful dietMichelle Obama told her husband it was Iowa or bust for themShe knew that if they couldnt win Iowa they couldnt win America but if they could  there would be no stopping them She told her husband it was now or never and that she would only do this thing once Even though he was a new senator she correctly assessed this was their Moment and they would not get a redoShe was absolutely right onThe country was war weary and the handsome young Senator promised Hope and Change Political pendulums swing hard and feed on stark contrastHe was not a Bush and not a Clinton Not at all In fact he was Barack Hussein ObamaHe was Kennedyesque with a young attractive family He was Bobby Kennedys dream of how the Civil Rights movement crescendos He was the man who perfectly matched the mood and he grabbed itThats what its all aboutJust ask Governor Chris Christie who missed his moment Had he run against Barack Obama in 2012 he would have won The tough talking New Jersey Governor was getting a ton of attention in 2011 Hed shockingly won a blue state governors race when the odds were stacked against himHe was telling it like it is to anybody who crossed himHe shouted down Teachers Unions for depriving kids of the education they deserved He told firefighters and policeman that the pensions theyd been promised would never arrive if they werent willing to give back a little to keep the programs solvent These YouTube hits were going viral getting coverage The portly governor with his tie askew was the opposite of the snappily dressed lean and eloquent president whod lost his shine a bit four years inBut while GOP leaders begged Christie to run he demurred He said he wasnt ready It wasnt his time But as it turns out it wasAnd he never got it backSo now we have had 8 years of ObamaCare and ObamanomicsEight years of promising to end the Era of WarStill we are mired in rising costs stunted economic growth and an epic battle with an enemy that is a He Who Shall Not be Named Except that everybody knows his name is Radical Islamist TerroristIn fairness the presidents approval numbers have risen of late to 51 percentmany are satisfied However it may have something to do with the tenor of the sloppy primaries that have given him almost former president nostalgia points alreadyStill there is an undeniable restlessness in the country We see it in the crowds who turn out in droves for Bernie and DonaldAs long as it took for Republicans to seeDonald Trumpis the perfect storm of message Make America Great Again genius simplicity and ManThis brash businessman AntiObama sold his brand brilliantly with his huge success on The ApprenticeNow Reality TV meets politics I bet Mark Burnett wishes hed thought of it He was from the beginning the guy we all already knew Love him or hate him he leapt over the name recognition hurdle like it was a parking curbAnd it didnt even cost him a dimeBut surely he would not abide the rigor and tedium of the Campaign Trail What would he do fly his jet all around the country Yes Stay at Holiday Inns in places that dont have Trump Hotels um yesSurely this rich guy wouldnt have a way with voters Hed rather be in his Tower as his beautiful wife sips champagne he doesnt drink not out there in flyover state diners and arenas pressing the fleshWrong He would say scandalous things Yes Just think of all the tape and tabloid that already existed on this guy There would be no way hed get away with it Wrong againBesides the republicans had the deepest bench theyd had in a long time Superstars Scott Walker Jeb Bush Ted Cruz Marco Rubio Carly Fiorina the list went on And on actually It even spilled across two debate stages there were so many bright and talented options All they had to do was nominate the most conservative electable one as Bill Buckley had instructed See Mitt Romney John McCain Bob Dole And they must remember as Ronald Reagan warned no shooting inside the tent guys Well without apologies to Buckley or Reagan the guy who beat them all was not your textbook conservative to be sure and he shot up the tent until it fell down on top of them as he slipped out the back flap and dusted off his suitHeres the thing His message was right on for his audience He talked to them about what he felt was wrong with the country and how he wanted to fix it Too many illegals stealing your jobs and committing crimes Build a wallYour company went under We will get you a better job Sick of everything being so damned PCMe too He said Dont worry we are going to win again Youll be so tired of winning That sounds awesome they cried And then  to top it all off  he made them laugh He made them howl actually at the offcolor jokes and craps and hells he sprinkled in with his happy warrior rantsThe pundits scoffed Itll be over by summer make that fall The Super BowlThe Conventions Forget it guysTrumps son Don Jr nailed it He said my Dad is a bluecollar billionaire a common sense conservative none of this highfalutin panel jibber jabber Gimme Trumpthe GOP voters saidThe guy gets meDonald has wanted this shot at the White House since the early 90s when he took out full page ads and wrote letters railing against Japan and how they were eating our lunch and it needed to stop Now his handsome welleducated and wellliked kids are taking the weight off him at the office and he knowsthis is his time Its now or neverAnd one other thing Dont look for Mr Trump to get all presidential on you any time soon Why would he As any good businessman knows if it aint broke dont fix it And like he says its too soon for thatBut can he seal the dealBuckle your seat belts America Its going to be a bumpy rideMartha MacCallum currently serves as the coanchor of Americas Newsroom alongside Bill Hemmer Weekdays
