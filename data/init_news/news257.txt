The overflow crowds showing up to hear Bernie Sanders these days are a testament not only to his current popularity and the campaigns socialmedia savvy but also to the promotional abilities of an alchemy of likeminded interests progressive activists labor unions and even Sarah SilvermanThe comedian took to Twitter to let her nearly 67million followers know she would be at a rally for the Democratic presidential hopeful here Monday That event drew an estimated 27500 people  about five times as large as any crowd that has turned out for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham ClintonBernie always seems to be on the right side of history Silverman told the boisterous audience at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena noting that the 73yearold was a civil rights activist in the 1960s supported gay rights in the 1980s and strongly opposed the Iraq war before most other AmericansTo his old socialist allies Sanders has sold outAll told Sanders has attracted more than 100000 people to his rallies in recent weeks riding a wave of Facebook shares retweets and oldfashioned wordofmouth to become by far the biggest draw on the campaign trailSuch turnout is no guarantee that Sanders will perform well in the crucial earlynominating states  fellow Vermonter Howard Dean preached to similarly large and frenzied audiences in mostly liberal enclaves in 2003 only to collapse as the Iowa caucuses approachedBut it is drawing energy and attention away from Clinton  whose aides peg her largest crowd to date at 5500  and exposing a lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy among some facets of the Democratic Party And it is creating a network of smallscale donors and volunteers that could provide Sanders with the resources he will need to compete with the former secretary of state and first lady in the weeks and months aheadRoughly 28000 people showed up for a recent Sanders rally in Portland Ore The selfdescribed democratic socialist drew 15000 in Seattle 11000 in Phoenix

population LatinoSanders needs to court black voters Now he isThere were young hipsters and graying hippies Some wore black Tshirts with red hammers and sickles others wore black Tshirts that read Black Lives Matter They sang along as the loudspeakers blasted songs by Willie Nelson Tracy Chapman and Neil Young One man carried a handmade sign that said Bernie Our Only Hope for ChangeAbout a week before each Sanders rally his campaign sets up a Web page announcing the location and blasts out an email tosupporters in that geographic area asking them to RSVP There are no paid advertisementsThe events are promoted on Facebook with the campaign enlisting progressive groups and other friends and allies to help spread the word said national field director Phil Fiermonte From there things tend to take on a life of their ownLike Harris climatechange activist Joe Galliani got a speaking slot in Los Angeles because his union had spread the word about the rally He earned some of the loudest cheers as he denounced construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and touted the benefits of solar roofsThen there was Maria Barrera the 31yearold leader of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles who tearfully noted that Congress has not enacted comprehensive immigration reforms since the 1980s For the last 25 years families have been separated Barrera saidActivists drove

them know about the event with the disclaimer that the party is not taking sides in the presidential primaryLocal Democrats who attended the rally said it appeared to draw lots of newcomers to party politicsI hardly ever go to these events without running into friends and I didnt see many people I knew said Sue Hagmeier the communications officer for the Democratic Party in Multnomah County which includes PortlandHagmeier said she probably received 15 to 20 digital notifications in advance of the event counting forwarded emails and Facebook posts Sanders supporters also posted fliers on

of the Willamette River as he closed in on the Democratic presidential nominationSanders is striving to harness the energy to help him in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire where his crowds have been much smaller but still relatively robust Volunteers hand out donation envelopes to rally attendees and carefully take down their contact information so they can be solicited for money laterIn Los Angeles anyone who gave on the spot received a Sanders campaign Tshirt Speakers asked the crowd to text Bernie to a fivedigit number In reply they would receive text messages seeking money and volunteer timeWhen Sanders came onstage the cheers were deafening His voice hoarse the senator told the crowd This campaign is not a billionairefunded campaign  it is a peoplefunded campaignThere is no president who will fight harder to end institutional racism he said Or for a higher minimum wage Or for paid parental leave Or for at least two weeks of paid vacation  Whenever we stand together when we do not allow them to divide us up by the color of our skin or our sexual orientation by whether a man or a woman is born in America or born somewhere else whenever we stand together there is
