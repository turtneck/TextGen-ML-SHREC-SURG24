probably in one of two vehicles in the motel parking lot a car or a moving truck The vehicles left together and the team followed as they took a Uturn and a strange route  seeming to be lost or trying to shake those who followed Fernandez saidOfficers eventually got between the two vehicles in northeast Washington and took Wint three other men and two women into custody Fernandez saidWe had overwhelming numbers and force Fernandez said They completely submitted immediatelyFernandez said he noticed a big wad of cash in the moving truck but he didnt know how much was there It was not clear whether that money might have been connected to the Savopoulos family Fernandez said he did not know whether any weapons were found as the group was taken into custodyPolice said Thursday that they havent ruled out the possibility that other people were involved in the slayings but no othersuspectshave been identifiedWint had worked for Savopoulos company American Iron Works in the past police said Savopoulos was the CEO of American Iron Works a constructionmaterials supplier based in Hyattsville Maryland that has been involved in major projects in downtown WashingtonThe Savopouloses lived in a 45 million home in Woodley Park wheremansionsare protected by fences and security systems and local and federal law enforcement officers are a constant presence in part because Vice President Joe Bidens official residence is nearbyText messages and voicemails from the Savopouloses to their confused and frightened household staff suggest something was amiss hours before the bodies were found Their Porsche turned up in suburban Maryland hours after the slayings It too had been set on fireDNA analysis at a Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms lab linked Wint to the crime a law enforcement official involved in the investigation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to discuss the investigation publiclyDuring the familys final hours someone called Dominos from their house and ordered pizza The Washington Post reported that the DNA was found on a pizza crust At a Dominos about 2 miles away a worker told the AP that a pizza was delivered from there to themansionthat dayWint was convicted of assaulting one girlfriend in Maryland in 2009 and he pleaded guilty the next year to malicious destruction of property after he allegedly threatened to kill a woman and her infant daughter breaking into her apartment stealing a television and vandalizing her carIm going to come over there and kill you your daughter and friends Wint told that woman according to the records The defendant advised he was good with a knife and could kill them easily and was not afraid of the police a detective wroteAlso in 2010 Wint was arrested carrying a 2footlong machete and a BB pistol outside the American Iron Works headquarters but weapons charges were dropped after he pleaded guilty to possessing an open container of alcoholAttorney Robin Ficker said Wint didnt seem violent when he defended him in earlier casesMy impression of him  I remember him rather well  is that he wouldnt hurt a fly Hes a very nice person Ficker saidA housekeeper who worked for the Savopoulos family for 20 years Nelitza Gutierrez told the AP that she believes the family and Figueroa were held captive for nearly a day before they were killed citing an unusual voice mail from Savopoulos and a text message sent from the phone of his wife telling her not to come to the houseGutierrez said she and Savopoulos spent May 13 cleaning up a martial arts studio he was opening in northern Virginia before his wife called around 530 pm She could hear his half of the conversation He later said his wife told him to come home to watch their son because she was going out Gutierrez saidLater that night sounding flustered he left Gutierrez a voice mail saying Figueroa would stay with his sick wife overnight that she shouldnt come the next day and that Figueroas phone was deadIt doesnt make any sense How come you dont have another phone  iPhones are all over Gutierrez said He was kind of building storiesThe next morning Gutierrez received a text message from Amy Savopoulos that read in part I am making sure you are not coming today She called and texted back and got no responseThe Savopouloses had two teenage daughters who were away at boarding school at the time of the killings Relatives of the victims have made few public statements and have not returned calls from the AP Representatives of American Iron Works have repeatedly declined to commentAssociated Press
