On Sunday at the great Paris rally the whole world was Charlie By Tuesday the veneer of solidarity was exposed as tissue thin It began dissolving as soon as the real remaining Charlie Hebdo put out its postmassacre issue featuring a Muhammad cover that as the New York Times put it reignited the debate pitting free speech against religious sensitivitiesAgain Already Had not 4 million marchers and 44 foreign leaders just turned out on the streets of France to declare No to intimidation and pledging solidarity indeed identification Je suis Charlie with a satirical weekly specializing in the most outrageous and often tasteless portrayals of Muhammad And yet within 48 hours the new Charlie Hebdo issue featuring the image of Muhammad  albeit a sorrowful indeed sympathetic Muhammad  sparked new protests denunciations and threats of violence which in turn evinced another round of doubt and selfflagellation in the West about the propriety and limits of free expression HopelessAs for President Obama he never was Charlie not even for those 48 hours From the day of the massacre he has been practically invisible At the interstices of various political rallies he issued bits of muted mealymouthed boilerplate Followed by the nowfamous absence of any highranking US official at the Paris rally an abdication of moral and political leadership for which the White House has already admitted errorBut this was no mere error of judgment or optics or most absurdly of communications in which we are supposed to believe that the president was not informed by staff about the magnitude both actual and symbolic of the demonstration he ignored He needed to be toldOn the contrary the noshow following the near silence precisely reflected the presidents profound ambivalence about the very idea of the war on terror Obama began his administration by purging the phrase from the lexicon of official Washington He has ever since shuttled between saying that a the war must end because of the damage keeping America on a perpetual wartime footing was doing to us and b the war has already ended as he suggested repeatedly during the 2012 campaign with bin Laden dead and alQaeda on the runHence his call in a major address at the National Defense University to refine and ultimately repeal Congress 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force the very legal basis for the war on terror Hence his accelerating release of Gitmo inmates  five more announced Wednesday  fully knowing that up to 30 percent have returned to the battlefield 17 percent confirmed up to 12 percent suspected but not verified Which is why since about the Neolithic era POWs tend to be released after a war is overParis shows that this war is not On the contrary As it rages it is entering an ominous third phaseThe first circa 911 involved sending Middle Eastern terrorists abroad to attack the infidel WestThen came the lone wolf  local individuals inspired by foreign jihadists launching oneoff attacks as seen most recently in Quebec Ottawa and SydneyParis marks Phase 3 coordinated commando strikes by homegrown nativespeaking Islamists activated and instructed from abroad AlQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo killings while the koshergrocery shooter proclaimed allegiance to the Islamic State They develop and flourish in Europes nogo zones where sharia reigns and legitimate state authorities dare not treadTo call them lone wolves as did our hapless attorney general is to define jihadism down It makes them the equivalent of the pitiable mentally unstable Sydney hostage takerThe Paris killers were welltrained thoroughly radicalized cleareyed jihadist warriors They cannot be dismissed as lone loons Worse they represent a growing generation of alienated European Muslims whose sheer number is approaching critical massThe war on terror 2015 is at a new phase with a new geography At the core are parallel wouldbe caliphates in Syria and Iraq the Islamic State in SubSaharan Africa now spilling out of Nigeria into Cameroon a nearsovereign Boko Haram in the badlands of Yemen AQAP the most dangerous of all alQaeda affiliates And beyond lie not just a cast of minicaliphates embedded in the most ungovernable parts of the Third World from Libya to Somalia to the borderlands of Pakistan but an archipelago of nogo Islamist islands embedded in the heart of EuropeThis is serious In both size and reach it is growing Our president will not say it Fine But does he even see itRead more from Charles Krauthammers archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
