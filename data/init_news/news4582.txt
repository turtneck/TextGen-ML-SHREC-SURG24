Comments Democrats are better for the economy This statement is not an opinion but a fact According to economist Steven Stoft who created a series of graphs charting job creation under each party over the last 72 years during which time Democrats and Republicans have held control for 36 years each Democrats have created 58 million jobs while Republicans can only claim 26 million  For roughly the last century electing a Democrat has been the better option for the economy with Dems creating more than double the jobs than that of Republicans and faster Even when taking the percent change of number of jobs held or scaling population to avoid counting an increased population thus falsely indicating an increase in jobs Democrats still prove more successful than Republicans in job creation and by a wide margin Another way of studying job creation is to take unemployment into account When a Democrat is in the White House logically unemployment decreases as well By this rational of course when a GOP takes the Oval Office unemployment rises and has risen under this party since 1945 Indeed this extends to state and federal levelsthe top 20 years of national GDP growth have all been under a Democrat This is not only true for GDP but for all economic growth in generalextending to the stock market income growth and debt as a percentage of GDP As if you needed more proof that the blue party is better for the economy simply turn to the numbers over the last 70 years When it comes time for Election Day its a matter of fact that with every Democratic ballot cast its almost guaranteed the country will be in a better economic position than if a Republican is sworn in
