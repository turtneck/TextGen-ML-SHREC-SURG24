Washington CNN The date for arguments is on the calendar The questions that the justices will have to decide are clear Even the amount of time lawyers will have to make their case is set in stoneBut theres still one mystery heading into next months historic gay marriage case at the Supreme Court Who will get to argue before the justices that same sex marriage should be legal across the nationThe roster of lawyers for each side is still being worked out And like many things related to the law its complicated Six legal challenges in four states have been consolidated into one case And to make things even more dicey there are actually two separate legal questions before the courtStill this is a rare opportunity to argue before the highest court to shape the law on one of the most consequential modern social issues Its no wonder that any lawyer  from recent law school grads to titans of the profession  would dream of a chance to snag a piece of the debateIt will be a very sensitive negotiation among the lawyers said Adam Winkler a professor at the UCLA School of Law Everyone involved in this case would love to be the one to argueIn general the court leaves the decision up to the parties The plaintiffs on Tuesday proposed that their time to make their case be divided  a practice the Court usually frowns uponIf the justices decline the request plaintiffs will have to winnow down their choicesThat will be tough because scores of lawyers have been involved with the challenge including some of the best litigators in the countryThe parties could choose a private attorney who has been with the case all along such as Alphonse A Gerhardstein a civil rights attorney from Cincinnati or Carole M Stanyar who is based in Ann ArborThe choice could also depend upon whether the parties ask and the court agrees to allow them to designate two lawyers to argue said Amy Howe the editor of ScotusblogThey could opt for someone with vast experience arguing before the the Supreme Court Both Jeffrey L Fisher of Stanford Law School and Douglas HallwardDriemeier who used to work in the Solicitor Generals office have appeared multiple times before the justicesAnother option would be to pick a lawyer affiliated with one of the movement groups that has been working in the trenches for years on a statebystate strategy to build political momentum on the issue Top contenders would include Mary Bonauto of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders and James Esseks of the ACLUEveryone involved wants to win more than anything else said WinklerIt would be unusual for the parties to choose a lawyer unaffiliated with the case at handFor instance Theodore Olson and David Boies the political odd fellows who came together in 2012 to fight Californias ban on same sex marriage backed a different challenge this time around in Virginia The Supreme Court ultimately declined to take up that case making it harder for the power lawyers to be involved in next months caseAt least one big name is expected to argue for those in favor of samesex marriage Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr The Obama administration filed an amicus brief in the case two weeks ago and as the governments lawyer before the court Verrilli would typically get some time before the justicesBut from there its anyones guessThe court is considering two questions The first concerns the central issue of whether states can ban gay marriage The second question gives the justices an off ramp if they decide against issuing a sweeping ruling That question concerns whether states must recognize the marriage of couples legally married out of stateState officials in the four states involved  Michigan Ohio Tennessee and Kentucky  have to go through a similar process to decide who will lead arguments defending state bans on samesex marriageOn Friday Michigans attorney general announced that Special Assistant Attorney General John Bursch the former Michigan solicitor general will present the states oral argument And according to Dan Tierney the spokesperson at the Ohio Attorney Generals Office Joseph F Whalen Tennessees associate solicitor general will handle the second questionDeciding who will argue the case will mark one of the last strategic decisions the parties will have to make before the issue goes to the justicesFor the challengers the moment has been years in the making as they worked toward the overall aim to get the Supreme Court to issue a nationwide rulingSome longtime gay rights advocates were nervous a few years ago when opponents of Californias Prop 8 chose to push their case to the Supreme Court The advocates felt the better choice was to move more incrementally and first ask the Supreme Court to rule on a section of the Defense of Marriage Act DOMA  a federal law that denied benefits to same sex couples who were legally married in the statesAs it turned out both cases arrived before the court in 2012 and it ultimately struck down a section of DOMA and dismissed the Prop 8 case on procedural groundsSince the DOMA ruling the victories for gay rights advocates have been astoundingIn the last two years challenges to same sex marriage bans have been successful in nearly 60 lower court decisions according to the group Freedom to MarryThats led some to believe its a foregone conclusion that the court will rule in favor of marriage for same sex couples this summerIm reluctant ever to call anything a done deal said Scotusblogs HoweBut she points out that in October the Supreme Court cleared the way for thousands of marriages to take place in Virginia Utah Oklahoma Indiana and Wisconsin when it declined to take up an earlier set of same sex marriage petitionsAs a legal matter the Court could of course uphold the bans but as a practical matter it would be very hard to put the genie back into the bottle so to speak and hold that  notwithstanding all of the marriages it has allowed to go forward in the last few months  there is no longer a right to samesex marriage she said
