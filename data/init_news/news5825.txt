House Speaker John Boehners stunning announcement that he will resign his post and seat in Congress sparked chaos on Capitol Hill Friday with lawmakers immediately jockeying for position ahead of the upcoming reshuffleThis is going to be a barn burner of a leadership election one source saidThe 13term Ohio Republican shocked his GOP caucus early Friday morning when he informed them in a closeddoor session that he intends to step down at the end of October One lawmaker told Fox News he was stunned and that there was some anger in the room against the people who caused this to happenBut the drama didnt stop the almostimmediate scramble for his gavelSome lawmakers swiftly hit the phones making intense calls as they jockeyed for position ahead of what could potentially be an overhaul of the entire leadership teamThe immediate favorite to inherit the gavel is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif a Boehner ally Fox News is told hes actively seeking the postAsked about a potential successor Boehner said thats up to the members but then gave McCarthy a nearendorsement I think Kevin McCarthy would be an excellent speakerBut it is far from a done deal with Rep Jeb Hensarling RTexas Rep Pete Roskam RIll and Rep Tom Price RGa thought to be potential candidates who could throw their hats into the ringFox News learned late Friday that Rep Cathy McMorris Rodgers RWash and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise RLa are both looking at running for the leadership positionThe leadership battle also begins as Congress still struggles over a budget measure and efforts by conservatives to defund Planned Parenthood as part of itEven if that issue is resolved in the nearterm the next speaker will confront those same partisan divisionsNot everyone wants that responsibility Rep Paul Ryan RWis the partys vice presidential nominee in 2012 has already ruled himself out of the race calling the job a great job for empty nestersFor his part Roskam attempted to become whip after thenHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary race last June and was replaced in leadership by McCarthy  then the majority whip However Roskam was beaten by ScaliseFox News understands Roskam is one of the lawmakers jockeying for position When asked for comment Roskam warned against merely reshuffling the deckIm for somebody who can bridge the divide in our Conference If we dont have a plan to get us out of this dysfunction reshuffling the deck wont make anything betterIm going to work hard to make sure we get the leadership we need not just settle on the fastest easiest choice Roskam saidAn aide to Hensarling told Fox News that he was considering his options and would expect to have a decision next weekShould McCarthy succeed Boehner there would be an opening for House majority leader as well as potentially further down the roster in positions such as majority whipBoehners backing may help McCarthys chances with the establishment but may hurt him elsewhereBoehners backing will help him with the establishment but not with the conservative House Freedom Caucus He may face a challenge from conservatives but even the House Freedom Caucus admit they arent organized and so they may not even put up a candidate GOP strategist Ron Bonjean told FoxNewscom Speed is the key Waiting can hurt your chances Members who can get members behind them can build momentum and a snowball effect allows them to wrap things up Thats what McCarthy is going for  theres already a sense of inevitability that hes getting the jobIf conservatives do put forward a candidate of their own Reps Jim Jordan ROhio and Rep Ted Yoho RFla are among the names that could be put forwardDemocrats too will almost certainly run Boehners predecessor  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif  for the postAt a press conference Friday afternoon with Chinese President Xi Jinping President Obama also voiced his own general hopes for the next speakerMy hope is theres a recognition on the part of the next speaker something I think John understood  that we can have significant differences on issues but that doesnt mean you shut down the government Obama saidBoehners resignation could make next weeks budget battle easier to resolve in the shortterm Conservatives want to use the budget measure to defund Planned Parenthood and Boehner previously had to worry about an internal party revolt if he tried to strike a deal with Democrats to pass a clean budget billHowever it also could work the other way A lameduck Boehner could open a situation where aspiring GOP leaders are put on the spot and under even more pressure from the conservative wingOnce Boehner resigns the total number of members in the House will be 434 An absolute majority of the House is required to elect a new speaker not a simple majority  meaning the magic number of votes that a candidate must get is 218Once Boehner resigns the House will be unable to do anything until it elects a new speakerBoehners resignation is rare but not unprecedented The last speaker to resign in the middle of a Congress was Speaker Jim Wright DTexas who resigned in 1989 amid an ethics scandalFox News
