The reporters job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable  a credo that humorously was originally written as a smear of the selfrighteous nature of journalists And so the justification for going after a public figure increases in proportion to his or her stature The bigger the figure the looser the restraintsAfter a quarter of a century on the national stage theres no more comfortable political figure to afflict thanHillary Clinton And shes in for a lot of affliction over the next year and halfThats generally a good way for reporters to go about their business After all the more power a person wants in our republic the more voters should know about her or him But its also an essential frame for thinking about the longtoxic relationship between the Clintons and the media why the coverage of Hillary Clinton differs from coverage of other candidates for the presidency and whether that difference encourages distortions that will ultimately affect the presidential raceThe Clinton rules are driven by reporters and editors desire to score the ultimate prize in contemporary journalism the scoop that brings down Hillary Clinton and her familys political empire At least in that way Republicans and the media have a common interestI understand these dynamics well having cowritten a book that demonstrated how Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillarys time at State to build the family political operation and set up for their fourth presidential campaign That is to say Ive done a lot of research about the Clintons relationship with the media and experienced it firsthand As an author I felt that I owed it to myself and the reader to report investigate and write with the same mix of curiosity skepticism rigor and compassion that I would use with any other subject I wanted to sell books of course But the easier way to do that  proven over time  is to write as though the Clintons are the purest form of evil The same holds for daily reporting Want to drive traffic to a website Write something nasty about a Clinton particularly HillaryAs a reporter I get sucked into playing by the Clinton rules This is what Ive seen in my colleagues and in myselfOne of my former colleagues a hardnosed reporter who has put countless political pelts on his wall once told me that everyone in public life has something to hide Who goes down in the flames of scandal The politicians we decide to go afterThat may not be 100 percent true but its true enough The act of choosing time and again to go after the same person has the effect of tainting that person even when an investigation or reporting turns up nothing nefarious  and its time not spent digging into his or her adversaries The original source of alleged malfeasance could come from the other party within a politicians party or from the reporters own observations and industrious digging But two things are crystal clear If theres no investigation theres no scandal And if theres no scandal theres no scalpThe Clintons have been under investigation for about 25 years now Theres little doubt theyve produced more information for investigators lawyers and journalists about their finances their business and philanthropic dealings and their decisionmaking processes in government than any officials in American history Theyve watched countless friends frogmarched into congressional hearings and in some cases to jail They know theres a good chance that any expressed thought will become part of the public record and twisted for political gainThe most absurd allegations against Hillary Clinton have been bookends on her public career so far that she had something to do with the suicide of Clinton White House aide Vince Foster and that she bears responsibility for the terrorist attack that killed US Ambassador to Libya Chris StevensBut in between there was Travelgate Filegate and Whitewater Some were less legitimate than others When Clinton surprisingly claimed that she and her husband were dead broke when they left the White House it was because they had spent all of their money to defend themselves against an eightyear barrage of investigationsIts understandable then why the Clintons have a bunker mentality when it comes to transparency But their paranoia leads them to be secretive and their secrecy leads Republicans and the press to suspect wrongdoing That spurs further investigation which only makes the Clintons more secretive The paranoia and persistent investigation feed each other in an endless cycle of probe and parry Along the way the political class and the public are forced to choose imperfect sides the power couple that always seems to be hiding something or a Washington investigation complex that is overly partisan and underwhelming in its ability to prove gross misconductThis is for Republicans a reasonable strategy They know that if they keep investigating her it will do two things keep the media writing about scandals that might knock her out and turn off voters who dont want a return to the bloodsport politics of the 1990s They leak partial stories to reporters hungry for that one great scoop that will give them the biggest political scalp of them all But they also err in jumping the gun in accusing her of wrongdoing which allows Clinton to defend herself by pointing at the folly of her adversariesIn touring the country to promote our book in 2014 my coauthor and I were repeatedly lobbied to assert that Clinton is a lesbian One gentleman pushed the issue during a QA at a Barnes and Noble on the Upper West Side of Manhattan  one of the few places you might expect that kind of thing to get a restThe National Enquirer published a story in April alleging that Clinton wiped her personal email server clean because it contained references to her lesbian loversMeanwhile the conservative media are also convinced Clinton is preparing to wage a war on Christianity if she wins the presidency But one thing revealed in her State Department emails is that Clinton shared daily religious reflections with her friendsIts not just the outofthebox allegations that keep the media machine spun up A year before Chelsea Clinton got married Clinton staffers were kept busy by mainstream journalists who were absolutely sure she had already gone through with secret nuptialsAnd on a more serious note remember Benghazi flu Many political opponents and members of the media were unable to accept the idea that Clinton was forced to cancel planned Senate testimony on Benghazi because shed suffered a concussion Now three years later it seems ridiculous to think that Clinton was making an excuse  shes since testified on both sides of the Hill  or that she suffered as Karl Rove suggested brain damage And if she was making up the concussion to avoid testifying how did she suffer brain damage from a fake fallThe conservative media echo chamber which bounces innuendo from Rush Limbaugh to Fox News and back again ensures that the most damning story lines  true or not  stay alive The Benghazi attacks are a perfect example Terrorists killed four Americans The conservative echo chamber seems convinced Hillary Clinton is at fault The reasonable argument to make is that we shouldnt have been in Libya in the first place and the murders were a downthechain result of bad policy But the right wing wants to prove that they happened because of Clintons actions  or inaction  on security mattersTheyve talked about security requests denied for Libya never mind that the stronger contingent would have been in Tripoli not Benghazi and that theres no evidence Clinton herself was aware of the requests a standdown order that prevented reinforcements from arriving in Benghazi never mind that they wouldnt have gotten there until after the fighting was done and that even a House Republican committee found that there was no such order and most of absurd of all that Clinton knew the attack was coming This is how Limbaugh put it in MayThe freedom of the conservative media to make wild allegations often acts as a bulldozer forcing reporters to check into the charges and in doing so repeat them By the time theyve been debunked theyre part of the American publics collective consciousness Or as its been said a lie gets around the world before the truth gets out of bedOne outgrowth of Clintons terrible relationship with reporters is that journalists often assume she is acting in bad faith Theres good reason for that Though shes added some new pros to her press staff for this campaign her operations stance toward the media was always a reflection of the way Bill Clintons White House handled journalistsBack in the mid1990s Bill Clinton relied on a series of Machiavellian spin doctors to keep the press at bay With the Clinton White House the modus operandi was to stonewall as long as possible lie if necessary  or just out of habit  and turn questions around on the questioners After all Bill Clinton once wagged his finger at a press conference and told reporters I did not have sexual relations with that woman  Ms Lewinsky Hed lied in a deposition tooSo the press has plenty of precedent for believing that when the Clintons arent forthcoming  and sometimes even when they are  theyre covering something up And the Clintons given the history of somesmokenofire investigations launched against them have plenty of precedent for being mistrustful of the press The result is a brutally dysfunctional relationship on both sides The Clintons believe the press acts in bad faith and the press believes the Clintons attitudes toward the press are evidence that the Clintons are hiding somethingThat attitude carried over to Hillary Clintons 2008 campaign and to some degree her tenure as Secretary of State The standard response to a reporters question is not an answer It is to ignore the question or to engage in a Socratic debate by asking a question in return Its clear Clinton doesnt like the media one bit as Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman reported last yearAt a July Fourth parade this past weekend Clinton aides used rope to create an impromptu moving barrier for reporters keeping them away from the candidate and voters She treated them like cattle and they responded by putting the video on television for the last three daysThe mistrust among journalists is a problem for Clinton And as the media is an amplifier for the public its also little wonder that so many voters are inclined to believe shes often acting in bad faith Most Americans say shes not honest and trustworthyThis view shared by many reporters and most of the public makes it much easier to treat Clintons actions as though they are uniquely sinister Case in point She made a ton of money giving paid speeches to people with business before the government So did Jeb Bush of course But until Bush recently released an accounting of some of those speeches the media had little interest in his dealings Kudos to Ken Vogel of Politico who did some digging on that for a story published ThursdayThe imbalance in assumptions about Clintons motivations is another way in which the Clinton code has a distorting effect on the public perception of her And it too is selfperpetuating It leads Clinton to assume the press is biased against her which leads her to treat the press poorly which leads more reporters to assume shes trying to hide something from themWhen Clinton keynoted an annual fundraiser for David Axelrods epilepsy charity in June 2013 several major news outlets sent reporters to cover the speech That was more than three years before the 2016 election Every word every gesture every facial expression is scrutinizedVideo of Clinton ordering a burrito bowl at a Chipotle became the first viral image of her campaign Reporters gave fodder to latenight comedians earlier this year when they made a mad dash to catch up as her campaign van rolled byThis coverage of every last detail of course isnt a oneway street It wasnt until a reporter was tipped off to the Chipotle visit that anyone knew about it She craves the attention even more than she detests itBut that too has a distorting effect As with the royal family in London normally private moments become part of a public narrative her husbands affair her daughters wedding the birth of her granddaughterAll the attention has the effect of making Clinton seem to the casual observer hungrier for press than even the average politician And theres no doubt that part of the lovehate relationship is an intense desire to attract and manipulate coverage But Clinton understands that sometimes its better not to be in the spotlightThe best example of that was when she declined requests to appear on Sunday political talk shows right after the Benghazi attacks Susan Rice then the ambassador to the UN and now Obamas national security adviser leaped at the chance to stand in for Clinton Those appearances ended up costing Rice the nomination to succeed Clinton as secretary of state when many senators concluded she had lied about the origin and nature of the attacksThe press has such fascination with the Clintons that the coverage would be there whether Hillary Clinton wanted it or notFor someone who lost a big lead in the 2008 presidential primary and is ceding ground to Bernie Sanders right now Clinton is given a lot of credit for her political acumen Her detractors see in every move including the birth of her granddaughter a grandly conceived and executed political calculationAnd Clinton plays into that by using the positives in her life for political gainThat doesnt make her different from other candidates for the presidency  it makes her just like them New Jersey Gov Chris Christie talked about his grandmothers his mom his wife and his kids when he launched his bid for the presidency last week Was that calculated to send messages about Christie to the public Of courseThe best example though was the tear  the one that rolled down Clintons cheek as she campaigned in New Hampshire after having come in third in the Iowa caucuses in 2008The New York Timess Maureen Dowd pilloried her for what Dowd saw as a window into the dark part of Clintons soulHow far political journalism has come from castigating Ed Muskie for crying to accusing Clinton of calculating that tears would help her win Shes not that good at politicsI take a dim view of the idea that journalists successfully anoint political winners The media might have been in the bag for Barack Obama but he didnt win because he got positive coverage He won because he had better strategy a better message and better skills at delivering that message  in the 2008 primary and in the two general elections he wonThat said the media can definitely weigh down  and even destroy  a candidate The emphasis on a candidates flaws  real or perceived  comes at the cost of the candidates ability to focus his or her message and at the cost of negative attention to the other candidates This is a problem for Clinton and it seems unlikely to go awayHillary Clinton is comfortable enough to be a target for a lot of journalistic affliction and powerful enough that no one needs to comfort her from that affliction But these double standards are an important factor to keep in mind when judging her against her rivals for the presidency Whether theyre fair or not the Clinton rules distort the publics perception of Hillary ClintonCorrection This story has been corrected to remove an erroneous
