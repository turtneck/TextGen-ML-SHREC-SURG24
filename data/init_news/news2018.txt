AmericanMultiple US officials told CNN the hostages Warren Weinstein  an American and Italian national Giovanni Lo Porto  were killed by a US military drone that targeted the al Qaeda compoundAs president and as commander in chief I take full responsibility for all our counterterrorism operations including the one that inadvertently took the lives of Warren and Giovanni Obama said Thursday morning in the White House briefing room where he apologized on behalf of the US governmentThe White House also disclosed Thursday that two Americans both al Qaeda operatives were also killed in US counterterrorism operations in the same regionEarnest said at a press briefing Thursday that Obama did not specifically approve the operations that killed the Americans but that the strikes were within the bounds of policy guidanceEarnest said Thursday that the families of the hostages will be financially compensated by the US government He would not disclose the details of that compensationAmerican officials at the time had no reason to believe either hostage was present when the operation was launched on a compound in the AfghanistanPakistan border region US officials also did not know that Farouq or Gadahn were present at the targeted sites and neither was specifically targeted Earnest said in a statementEarnest said during the briefing Thursday that US officials believed with near certainty there were no hostages at the target site and that the strike was carried out after hundreds of hours of surveillance on the al Qaeda compound and near continuous surveillance in the days leading up to the operationUnfortunately that assessment was not correct and the operation led to this tragic unintended consequence Earnest saidAnalysis of all available information has led the Intelligence Community to judge with high confidence that the operation accidentally killed both hostages Earnest said in a statement No words can fully express our regret over this terrible tragedyObama directly apologized during his televised address to the families of the two hostages who were killed in the drone strike and said he spoke Wednesday with Weinsteins wife and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi Obama did not refer to the operation as a drone strike and Earnest would not confirm that the operation was carried out by drone strikeAs a husband and as a father I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Weinstein and Lo Porto families are enduring today I realize that there are no words that can ever equal their loss I know that there is nothing that I can ever say or do to ease their heartache Obama said ThursdayOfficials are conducting thorough independent investigation of the operation to ensure this type of incident is never repeated Earnest said the Office of the Inspector General was conducting an investigationA senior administration official told CNN that the review began in January after the drone strike occurred but said the review so far suggests the operation was by the book until we realized these people the hostages were in thereThe concern is not about anything other than this is a colossal tragedy the official said This doesnt seem to be raising any process flags  But everyone is still going through this and no one is resisting thatAnd Earnest told reporters the death of the hostages raises legitimate questions about whether additional changes need to be made to the protocol for launching counterterrorism operationsTo put it more bluntly Earnest said We have national security professionals who diligently followed those national security protocolsand yet it still resulted in this unintended but very tragic consequence and thats why the President has directed his team to conduct a review to see if there are lessons learned reforms that we can implement to this processThe death of an American hostageWeinstein was an American USAID contractor whose work focused on helping Pakistani families Obama said and was captured by al Qaeda in August 2011 The other hostage Lo Porto was an Italian aid worker and had been held by al Qaeda since 2012Weinsteins wife Elaine Weinstein said Thursday in a statement that she and her family are devastated by this news but said Weinsteins captors are ultimately responsible for his deathWe were so hopeful that those in the US and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through she saidShe added that her family does not yet fully understand all the facts surrounding her husbands death but said the family looks forward to the results of the investigation Obama said was underwayThe US never recovered Weinsteins body and did not conduct a DNA test to determine his death several sources told CNN adding that multiple intelligence sources confirmed their deaths based on circumstantial evidence and a CIA assessmentRenzi the Italian prime minister expressed his condolences on behalf of his country to the families of Weinstein and Lo PortoI express my deepest sorry for the death of an Italian who has dedicated his life to the service of others Renzi said in a statement My condolences also go the family of Warren WeinsteinThe decision to go publicThe information on the killings had been classified until Obama directed officials to declassify the information and share it ThursdayObama said he decided to release the information because the Weinstein and Lo Porto families deserve to know the truth and because the US is a democracy committed to openness in good times and badEarnest emphasized that the counterterrorism operation that killed the hostages was lawful and conducted consistent with our counterterrorism policies in a statement earlier Thursday and Obama said an initial assessment indicates that this operation was fully consistent with the guidelines under which we conduct counterterrorism efforts in the regionBut Obama still stood by US counterterrorism efforts in the region which have been criticized for their heavy reliance on drone strikes and resulting civilian casualtiesSince 911 our counterterrorism efforts have prevented terrorist attacks and saved innocent lives both here in America and around the world And that determination to protect innocent life only makes the loss of these two men especially painful for all of us Obama said ThursdayThe White House said the strike occurred in the AfghanistanPakistan border region a haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda but did not specify in which country the strike occurredPakistans Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday declined to comment on the news of the strikesElaine Weinstein who resides in Maryland specifically thanked their senators Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski and congressman Rep John Delaney for their relentless efforts to free my husbandCardin Mikulski Delaney expressed their sorrow at Weinsteins death in statements Thursday morning and recalled their efforts to try and secure their constituents releaseI have tracked Warren Weinsteins status since he was first taken hostage in 2011 The United States government including members of my staff worked tirelessly to bring him home safely said Cardin who recently became the top Democrat on the foreign relations committeeHe added that he received a preliminary briefing from CIA Director John Brennan and said he requested a full account of the events that led to the hostages deathsDelaney called Weinsteins killing a sobering national security and government failure and said he was saddened disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring Warren homeThe loss of Warren is devastating a tragic event that we must never forget Delaney said As Warrens representative I feel like his country failed him in his greatest time of need Im determined to ensure that Warrens story is not forgotten that we get to the bottom of why Warren wasnt found and how he was killedHe also called for a broader effort to reassess the US governments policies and procedures for securing the release of American hostages held abroad and called for the need for a top US official focused specifically on the location and release of American hostages  someone who wakes up every morning focused on freeing hostagesA much broader analysis needs to be launched and were going to push it really hard to make sure that were really pursuing this really hard as a top priority for the united states of America he said on CNNMikulski in a statement said she has many questions about how this tragedy occurred and said she was truly heartbroken to learn the news of Weinsteins deathDr Weinstein dedicated his life to improving the conditions of others all around the world and his legacy is truly immeasurable His humanitarian service and that of Mr Lo Porto stands in stark and shining contrast to the depravity of their captors Mikulski saidHouse Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also shared their condolences Thursday and lauded Obamas decision to launch an independent
