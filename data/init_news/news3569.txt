Loretta Lynch had them at Jim CrowSenate Republicans had delayed confirmation hearings for President Obamas attorney general nominee until they took control of Congress  giving them a chance to use the nomination to protest Obamas immigration policy and other actions by Obama and the outgoing attorney general Eric HolderBut those who figured they could take out their frustrations on Lynch had misjudged her The nominee has a long and impressive rsum as a nononsense prosecutor and she managed at Wednesdays hearing to be both assertive and anodyne in her testimony expert in the law but opaque about controversial legal matters As important Lynch with the help of committee Democrats painted an unassailable biography This daughter of a fourthgeneration minister and a segregationfighting mother from the South would be the first African American woman to be the nations top law enforcement officialThe case against Lynch deflated faster than if the New England Patriots had run the hearingSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley RIowa toned down his prepared statement as he read it I for one need to be persuaded that she will be an independent attorney general he read but he then departed from the text and added I have no reason to believe at this point she wont be He read a long list of complaints about the administrations actions but then adlibbed As far as I know Ms Lynch has nothing to do with the Department of Justice problems that I just outlinedThe panels new Republican leadership was already on thin ice over its decision to remove the phrase civil rights and human rights from the name of its subcommittee on the Constitution The atmosphere in the room surely had to make the members of the allwhite committee think twice before turning Lynch into a punching bag for their disagreements with Obama and Holder More than half of those in the public seats were black and 40 of them wore red  the color of Delta Sigma Theta Lynchs predominantly black sororityLynch all of 5 feet tall planted her spiked heels firmly on the floor in front of her and leaned her forearms on the witness table as she made her case She described her mother as a courageous young teacher who refused to let Jim Crow define her and who refused to use segregated restrooms because they did not represent the America in which she believed In North Carolina she said her father opened his Greensboro church to those planning sitins and marches standing with them while carrying me on his shouldersDemocrats formed a chorus to repeat the message She grew up hearing her family speak about living in the Jim Crow South Sen Patrick Leahy DVt said of the historic nominee Said Chuck Schumer DNY Her mother picked cotton when she was a girl so her daughter would never have to This line was rather more plausible than Schumers jest that Lynch has a reputation for avoiding the spotlight just like meSen Dick Durbin DIll described her as witness to a moment in history because of her fathers civil rights work and Sen Amy Klobuchar DMinn told the story of how Lynchs school named a second valedictorian because it was thought having Lynch as sole valedictorian would be too controversialEven if Republicans had the appetite to challenge a nominee with such a life story her lawyerly demurrals made it impossible for them to land a blow Several times Republican senators asked what she thought of an opinion from the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel defending Obamas executive actions on immigration She replied over and over that she found the opinion reasonable and the overall policy legal but she went no furtherShe blended flattery  I certainly think you raised an important point and would look forward to discussing it with you and relying upon your thoughts and experience she informed a skeptical Sen Jeff Sessions RAla  with reminders that she had nothing to do with policies Republicans found objectionableThe performance was disarming After Lynch assured Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah that she would take the attorney generals independence very seriously Hatch said that youll be a great attorney general if youll do thatEven the dyspeptic Sen Ted Cruz RTex acknowledged that his legal friends in New York describe her as a US attorney who honored and respected the lawAnd freshman Sen David Perdue RGa positively gushed to Lynch about her patience perseverance professionalism and  graciousnessSen John Cornyn RTex summed up the demobilization of the antiLynch forces Youre not Eric Holder are you he askedRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
