Its generally understood that presidential elections are decided in the socalled swing states Everything reduces to turnout Which is why the ground game is so important You cant get people to the polls without a sophisticated voter targeting operation and thousands of staffers and volunteers on the ground doing the dirty workTo the extent that thats true Republicans are in troubleA new Politico report confirms the GOP is way behind in all the states that matter Because their nominee has no interest in data or analytics or infrastructure the RNC is forced to shoulder the entire burden By contrast Clinton already has a political machine up and running in each of the swing states and the DNC is coordinating with the campaign as it prepares to do the heavy liftingRepublicans meanwhile are hostage to the whims of their nominee Trump doesnt do retail politics so the party has no choice but to rely on his personality and media presence While Democrats are focused on organization and digital operations Republicans are hoping Trumps demagoguery will carry enough angry white men to the polls His job is to be Mr Trump said Rob Gleason who chairs the Pennsylvania Republican Party His appeal is very different than a normal politicianAll he has to do is announce three days ahead of time hes going to be somewhere and a huge crowd shows up I admire the optimism but surely Mr Gleason knows circuslike crowds wont translate to election day turnout Attracting people to spectacles is easy getting them to the polls when it counts is notIts scarcely a plan but GOP operatives are saying publicly at least that Trumps cult of personality will energize disaffected blue collar workers in places like Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania And they assume that any anxieties about Trumps blinding incompetence will be eclipsed by hatred of Clinton Again I admire the optimism but this is wishthinking not a strategyLogistics aside the poll numbers in the 11 or so swing states also portend trouble for Republicans Currently Clinton holds a 5point overall advantage over Trump according to Politicos polling average Shes leading in 8 of the 11 individual states including Florida and Ohio and those numbers are likely to improve as Trump continues to unravel and the Democrats unite behind their nominee Its still early but the numbers offer a snapshot of where the electorate is headingThe national poll numbers tell the same storyA recent Bloombergpoll shows Clinton with a doubledigit lead over Trump 49 percent to 37 percent a noticeable spike since Clinton became the presumptive nominee The gender gap is especially worrisome if youre a Republican 63 percent of women say they could never vote for the Republican nominee Women represent a majority of voters  if 2 out of 3 wont vote for Trump the race is over before it begins The groups that will decide the election particularly in swing states are also strongly opposed to Trump Clinton is winning 57 percent of women 58 percent of single voters and 77 percent of nonwhites Trump is doing far better among white men but that wont compensate for his negatives among every other demographic Besides Trumps appeal with white men is often overstatedAs Bloombergs John McCormick pointed out White men are among Trumps strongest demographics But even there hes not showing as much strength as the partys last nominee Mitt Romney who beat Obama in 2012 by 62 percent to 35 percent among white men Trump is currently at 50 percent The closer you look at the numbers and the more obvious the organizational gap becomes the harder it is to see a path to victory for Trump Hes quickly confronting the limits of his amateurish mediacentric campaign Anything is possible in November but theres no question that Republicans are comparatively disadvantaged Theyre led by an organizationally inept candidate who cant appeal to women and nonwhites and has proven himself incapable of compromise
