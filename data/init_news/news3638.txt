From the start Hillary Clinton declared today in Reno Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia He has taken hate groups mainstream and is helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party The speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist a conspiracy theorist and a man temperamentally unfit to be presidentClintons campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about Donald Trump and his advisors embrace of the disturbing altright political philosophythe altright being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micromovements and online subcultures Yesterday I suggested that making the altright the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is after all a rather obscure political faction But Clintons comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks And while that minute was pretty juicy the altright wasnt really the rallys star villain after allThe star villain was Donald Trump Everyone else that Clinton brought into the addressthe altright Breitbart Alex Jones David Duke Nigel Farage Vladimir Putinwas there in a supporting roleSome of Clintons arguments didnt make a lot of sense She led her litany oddly by quoting Trumps recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in America Poverty Rejection Horrible education No housing No homes No ownership Crime at levels nobody has seen Most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black communitys problems but Clinton declared them a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters She also wildly overstated the altrights influence declaring that the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign means the altrightists have effectively taken over the Republican Party She was on sturdier ground at other moments as when she mentioned Trumps habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheer the 911 attacksRunning through all her claims both the weak ones and the strong ones was one basic theme Donald Trump is a bigot and a nut And while thats an idea youve been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality TV star entered the race this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as Ive ever heard emerge from Hillary Clintons mouth Its bound to fire up her supporters and I expect it will help her get out the vote Whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to Google altright depends I suppose on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few daysBut the guy who must be really delighted right now is Alex Jones Hillary Clinton just attacked him by name His listeners will be hearing clips from this speech til Ragnarok
