CNN An employee at the prison where two convicted killers escaped over the weekend is being questioned as a possible accomplice a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNNInvestigators on Monday questioned the employee a woman who worked with escaped convicts Richard Matt and David Sweat tailoring clothing at the Clinton Correctional Facility in New YorkThe woman knows the two escapees very well the source said though she has not been charged or arrestedThe development comes after New York Gov Andrew Cuomo said inmates Matt and Sweat must have had help in carrying out the intricate plot The pair who were in sidebyside cells used power tools to cut through the cells steel walls and clambered through a maze of underground pipes according to authoritiesThey wouldnt have had the equipment on their own thats for sure Cuomo told CNN of the convicted killers who escaped sometime after they were last seen at bed check Friday nightThe two prisoners were in the honor block of the prison meaning they were given certain liberties for good behavior the law enforcement source saidFor the most part they have a clean disciplinary record according to records provided by a spokeswoman for the Department of CorrectionsDespite a 100000 reward and a manhunt involving some 250 law enforcement officials Matt and Sweat  both serving lengthy sentences  were still on the loose MondayThey could be literally anywhere said Maj Charles E Guess of the New York State Police which is leading the searchCuomo said residents of Dannemora where the prison is located should feel safe because of the presence of hundreds of law enforcement officers thereStill students returned to schools Monday amid heightened security after police thoroughly searched every building and bus Saranac Central School District Superintendent Jonathan Parks said in an email to parents Police officers were scheduled to be at every school throughout the day he saidThats in part because of its remote location  in the sparsely populated northeast corner of New York about 25 miles from the Canadian borderAnd also because its in a region where wintry weather can persist more than half the yearThe facility has 2689 inmates and two of its most notorious inhabitants were Matt 49 and Sweat 35They apparently were last seen at 1030 pm Friday during a standing count  head counts that are performed every two hours throughout the night when guards visually check to see whether inmates are in their bunksThe pair tricked the guards by arranging things in the bunks to look like people were sleeping  with these sweatshirt hoodies on Cuomo saidOnce they were out of their cells they then followed a catwalk down an elaborate maze of pipes until they emerged from a manhole outside the prison wallsThey evaded detection for some seven hours until the inmate count at 530 am SaturdayAlong with the taunting sticky note the pair also left a host of unanswered and uncomfortable questions for law enforcementHow did they get the power tools How could they have known the layout of the bowels of the old prison Did they have help from the insideCuomo who toured the escape route and announced the 100000 reward Sunday said it was possible the tools came from contractors working on the 170yearold prison Authorities are also looking at civilian prison employees he said But he seemed to rule out the involvement of the prisons certified employeesId be shocked if a guard was involved and thats putting it mildly he saidThe danger the two men pose cant be overstated officials saidSweat was serving a life sentence without parole in the killing of Kevin Tarsia a sheriffs deputy in 2002Matt was convicted on three counts of murder three counts of kidnapping and two counts of robbery after he kidnapped a man and beat him to death in December 1997 state police said He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prisonHe has a history said Gabriel DiBernardo who led the investigation into the murder for which Matt was convicted He broke out of jail before He is a cunning individual no question about it and a vicious individualSweat is white 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds He has brown hair green eyes and tattoos on his left bicep and his right fingersMatt is white 6 feet tall and weighs 210 pounds He has black hair hazel eyes and several tattoos Mexico Forever on his back a heart on his chest and left shoulder and a Marine Corps insignia on his right shoulderThese are dangerous people Cuomo said And theyre nothing to be trifled withMatt is also wellknown to Mexican authorities In 2007 he was extradited from Mexico back to New York on a decadeold murder charge documents showWith the facilitys proximity to Canada and with Matts ties to Mexico authorities on both international borders have been alertedOfficers used roadblocks and bloodhounds and went door to door in their search for the men They scoured the woods and sifted through the dozens and dozens of tips that came inBut so far no luckThey dont know if the pair is still together had help on the outside or if the men had access to a vehicleJonathan Gilliam a former Navy SEAL FBI agent air marshal and police officer told CNNs New Day on Monday that the inmates might have been able to pull off part of the escape by themselves But he said the presence of power tools and the complicated escape route suggest that they werent working aloneThe combination of all those things is very worrisome for me because that spells help he saidOn Sunday the US Marshals Service issued federal arrest warrants for the escapees The warrants clear the way for the federal government to involve its considerable resources in the manhuntEvery resource available to us will be used in bringing these two men to justice said William OToole a US Marshals Service spokesmanWere leaving no stone unturned Guess of the New York State Police said Sunday
