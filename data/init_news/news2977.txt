These Blast Points on Hillarys Campaign Only The Deep State Is So Precise   Charles Hugh Smith The Deep States most prescient elements must derail Hillarys campaign to clear a path to Trumps executive team Back in August I asked Could the Deep State Be Sabotaging Hillary I think we now have a definitive answer These blast points on Hillarys campaign too accurate for the Mainstream Media Only the forces of the Imperial Deep State are so precise The Mainstream Media is presenting the FBI investigation as a loselose situation for embattled FBI Director Comey If Comey remained quiet until after the election he would be accused of colluding with the Clinton campaign and its allies in the Department of Justice sic But in going public he stands accused by Democrats of intervening in an election ie raising doubts about Hillarys judgement and veracity days before Americans go to the polls Another narrative has Comeys hand forced by the threat of disgusted FBI agents leaking information that would show the FBI caved into political pressure from the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign to keep relevant material out of the public eye until after the election I submit another much more powerful dynamic is in play the upper ranks of the Deep State now view Hillary as an unacceptable liability The word came down to Comey to act whether he wanted to or not ie take one for the good of the nationDeep StateImperial Project As a refresher the Deep State is the unelected government also called the invisible or shadow government that is not as monolithic as generally assumed The neoconservative globalists who want Hillary to continue pushing their agenda are the more visible camp but another less visible but highly motivated camp realizes Hillary and her neocon agenda would severely damage the nations security and its global influence It is this camp that is arranging for Hillary to lose The consensus view seems to be that the Establishment and the Deep State see Trump as a loose cannon who might upset the neocon apple cart by refusing to toe the neocon line This view overlooks the reality that significant segments of the Deep State view the neocon strategy as an irredeemable failure To these elements of the Deep State Hillary is a threat precisely because she embraces the failed neocon strategy and those who cling to it From this point of view Hillary as president would be an unmitigated disaster for the Deep State and the nationImperial Project it governs Whatever else emerges from the emails being leaked or officially released one conclusion is inescapable Hillarys judgement is hopelessly flawed Combine her lack of judgement with her 24 years of accumulated baggage and her potential to push the neocon agenda to the point of global disaster and you get a potent need for the Deep States most prescient elements to derail her campaign and clear a path to Trumps executive team Once this path is clear the management of Trumps executive team can begin in earnest a management process aimed at disengaging the nation and its global Empire from neocon overreach If you think this scenario is impossible lets see how the election plays out before deciding whats impossible and whats inevitable
