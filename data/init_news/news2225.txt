 How Putin Derailed the WestBy Mike Whitney Nation state as a fundamental unit of mans organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nationstate Zbigniew Brzezinski Between Two Ages The Technetronic Era 1971Im going to continue to push for a nofly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Third Presidential Debate  Counterpunch   Why is Hillary Clinton so eager to intensify US involvement in Syria when US interventions in Afghanistan Iraq and Libya have all gone so terribly wrongThe answer to this question is simple Its because Clinton doesnt think that these interventions went wrong And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment akaThe Borg In fact in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success Sure a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq or the logistical errors like disbanding the Iraqi Army butfor the most part the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washingtons diktatsThis is hard for ordinary people to understand They cant grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists sectarian death squads and foreignborn terrorists Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washingtons 15 yearlong rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds What is the purpose of all thisFirst we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan If it wasnt part of a plan than the decisionmakers would change the policy But they havent changed the policy The policy is the same The fact that the US is using foreignborn jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq is not a fundamental change in the policy The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washingtons actionsBut why What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and deathHeres what I think I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents the international banks and multinational corporations Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening Quote  he also explains what is taking place The nationstate is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests Instead Washington is erasing borders liquidating states and removing strong secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region a new world order The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnectedglobal free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital in other words a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions like a centralized treasury mutual debt federal transfers that would allow the borderless entity to function properlyDeep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our boughtandpaidfor congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the worlds energy supplies the worlds reserve currency and become the dominant player in this centurys most populous and prosperous region Asia This is essentially what Hillarys pivot to Asia is all aboutThe basic problem with Washingtons NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it This is whats really going on in Syria the improbable alliance of Russia Syria Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed so farNaturally the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments and for good reason The US has run the world for quite a while now so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September but only recently has Washington shown that its prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country Raqqa But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017 Thats when the US will directly engage Russia militarily assuming that their titfortat encounters will be contained within Syrias borders Its a risky plan but its the next logical step in this bloody fiasco Neither party wants a nuclear war but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down therefore Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante Nofly zone anyoneThe assumption is that eventually and with enough pressure Putin will throw in the towel But this is another miscalculation Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad Thats not it at all Putin is in Syria because he has no choice Russias national security is at stake If Washingtons strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia Putin knows this just like he knows that the scourge of foreignbacked terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya He knows that its better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow So he cant back down thats not an optionBut by the same token he can compromise in other words his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide For example he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not supportBut why would he do that Why wouldnt he continue to fight until every inch of Syrias sovereign territory is recoveredBecause its not in Russias national interest to do so thats why Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that hes in Syria to protect Russias national security Thats his main objective But hes not an idealist hes a pragmatist wholl do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP That means compromiseThis doesnt matter to the Washington warlords yet But it will eventually Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort No one is going to get everything they want that much is certain For example its impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria In fact Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings But that doesnt mean that Putin doesnt have his red lines He does Aleppo is a red line Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter AleppoThe western corridor the industrial and population centers are all red lines On these there will be no compromise Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact But will Turkey control sections in the north and will the US control sections in the eastProbably This will have to be worked out in negotiations but its unlikely that the countrys borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored In any event hes not going to hang around until the last dog is hungUnfortunately were a long way from any settlement in Syria mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed Thats the crux of the matter isnt it The bigshots who run the country are still in denial It hasnt sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadistmilitia plan has failedIts going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster The sooner they figure it out the better itll be for everyone Mike Whitney lives in Washington state He is a contributor to
