GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression onlineAmericas right wing is in a frothabout allegations that Facebook has tweaked its trending news feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sitesIts not clear if the allegations from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources are true and Facebook denies them But the deeper problem is undeniably real Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities  corporate and governmental  that are gaining control over news freedom of expressionand much of our digital lives The irony is that the conservatives and businessbacked Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized controlAlmost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word Along with Google it dominates online advertising Facebook especially does so on mobile devices which are the way many people connect to the Internet If you offer news and information online you have almost no choice but to play on Facebooks fieldbecause so much of your audience is there In some parts of the world Facebook essentially is the Internet because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online accessand in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies andor governmentsFacebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition Instagram WhatsApp Oculus This is smart  no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists  but its also a red flag As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago he wants Facebook to be like electricity Well electricity is a utility And we regulate utilitiesMonopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition Its their nature Which is why capitalism plainly the best system when its working right needs rules to promote competitionYet Republicans in general think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive at best  except of course when a powerful constituent a corporation usually is in danger from predatory behaviorThat attitude accounts for the GOPs cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access Republicans in general are fine with the idea that one or two companies say the leading cable provider and another telecom should control access in most communities and utterly opposed to a remedy  what we call network neutrality  to ensure that people at the edges of networks not dominant Internet service providers should decide what information they want and at what priorityI dont want the government to tell Facebook what it can publishand dont look forward to much more than posturing from Congress But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopolyand to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online I want government to use antitrust and other procompetition laws to ensure that Facebook doesnt abuse its dominance in a business sense I want governments to promote open technology and communications and fierce competition at every level Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users thats an amazing achievementBut we cant allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook usersWe all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression Once you are in its enclosed online space it is the corporations terms of service not the First Amendment that determines what you can say If it decides to downplay speech it doesnt like Facebook has the right to do soSo Im glad that conservatives are concerned even if the allegations prove overblown Facebook has modified its outright denial to a were looking into it stance stay tunedId be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition  and that were in uncharted informationfreedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon ValleyDan Gillmor teaches digital media literacy at Arizona State University He is the author of Mediactive He wrote this for Zocalo Public SquareIn addition to its own editorials USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourBoard of Contributors To read more columns go to theOpinion front pageand follow us on TwitterUSATOpinion
