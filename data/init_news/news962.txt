Ever since The Donald descended that escalator at Trump Tower a couple of months ago to announce his entry into the presidential race Democrats have been laughing Watching the Republicans squirm and Fox News jump through hoops has made the GOP presidential primary a delightful entertainment for their rivals on the other side of the aisle I dont know how many of them had it in them to watch the whole Trump Town hall extravaganza in Derry NHon Wednesday but those who did were unlikely to be laughing by the end of itThere was the standard braggadocio and egomania that characterizes his every appearance and weird digressions into arcane discussions of things like building materials for The Wall naturally He complained about the press and politicians and declared himself superior to pretty much everyone on earth But after you listen to him for a while you come away from that performance with a very unpleasant sense that something rather sinister is at the heart of the Trump phenomenonTrump was still talking when Chris Hayes opened his showthat nightwith this commentI want to talk about what we are seeing unfold here because I think what we are seeing is past the point of a clown show or a parody I believe it is much more serious and much darkerYou have someone now who is getting huge crowds who is polling at the top of the GOP field who polls show is beating Jeb Bush by 44 to 12 percent on the issue of immigration going around the country calling little children newborn babies anchor babies saying that hes going to use that term which I find a dehumanizing and disgusting term Talking about giving the local police the ability to do whatever they need to do to round up the illegals Building a wall talking about basically chasing 11 million people out talking about deporting American citizens to keep families together talking about what would essentially be the largest most intrusive police state in the history of the American republic to go about this task that is the person that is right now at the head of the Republican partys presidential contestAnd the delirious crowd applauded all those those things just as they loudly cheered this reference to Bowe Bergdahl the American soldier held by the Taliban for more than five yearsIts that pantomime of him shooting Berghdahl dead and saying when we were strong when we were strong that appeals so muchTrump repeatedly paints a picture of America in decline  weak impotent and powerless in terrible danger of losing everything unless we get a leader who will cast off all this political correctness this effete insistence on following the rules He promises to make America great again by cracking down on the bad people and being very very strongWhen talking about Iraq he characterized the the Iraqi people as cowards running whenever the bullets are flying He said the enemy has our best equipment we have the old stuff and that the country is a mess because of all the years of fighting unsuccessfully  because of the way we fight The implication is that we didnt take the gloves off He said the problem is that as a country we dont have victories anymore When was the last time we had a victory And he declared I believe in the military and military strength more strongly than anybody running by a factor of a billion We are gonna make our military so strong and so powerful and so incredible so strong that nobodys gonna mess with us folksnobodyAnd we dont have that right now This garnered huge cheers from the crowdOn economics its all about other countries taking advantage of the US He said Theyre up here were down there I dont blame China or Mexico or Japan Their leaders are smarter and sharper and more cunning  and thats an important word cunning  than our leaders Our leaders are babiesour country is falling apart He explains the problemChina is killing us Theyve taken so much of our wealth Theyve taken our jobs Theyve taken our business theyve taken our manufacturing audience member screams out our land Our land The way theyre going theyll have that pretty soonThink about it we have rebuilt China  somebody said to me thats a harsh statement  its the greatest theft in the history of the United States Now I have great respect for China and their leaders The largest bank in the world is from China Theyre a tenant of one of my buildings I love China I think its great But we dont have the people that know what theyre doing so  theyre killing us You know what that is They call it a sucking action Theyre sucking the jobs and the money right out of our countryThats what theyre doing Weve rebuilt China They have bridges they have airports so do other countries and were like a third world countryTheyre taking our jobs theyre taking our moneyThey take our jobs they take everything and we owe them money How does that happen Its magic Thats not gonna happen with Donald TrumpIf a person feels as if this country isnt what it used to be that theyve lost their place that their future isnt promising Donald Trump is telling them right up front that foreigners are to blame It isnt the government being unwilling to collect taxes from people like Donald Trump so we can build infrastructure  were rebuilding China instead of our own country It isnt that we spend vast sums of money to maintain the worlds only superpower military its that people from other countries are stealing us blind And Trump will fight all these foreigners to take our country back from them wherever they are Of course there is no foreigner who is wrecking this once great country more than the undocumented immigrant and he plans to cleanse our culture of their evil influence we have crime all over the country we have  the borders the southern border is a disasterThe other night a 66 year old woman a veteran raped sodomized brutally killed by an illegal immigrant We gotta stop we gotta take back our country Weve gotta take it back huge applause I love this country and I know that I can make it great again We have to build a wall we have to get the bad people out A lot of the illegals if you look at Chicago with the gangs you look at Baltimore you look at Ferguson a lot of these gangs the most vicious are illegals Theyre outta here The first day I will send those people  those guys are outta here cheers They talk about guns Im a big second amendment person I believe in it so strongly cheers Big But they talk about guns and you look at Chicago Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the US by far and people are being shot with guns all over the place You need enforcement but you also have to get the bad people out the people that arent supposed to be here and were gonna get em out so fast so quick  and its gonna be tough Its not gonna be oh please will you come with us please will you please come with us Because you know these law enforcement people and I know the guys in Chicago the police commissioners a great man They can do it if theyre allowed to do it I know the guys I know em New York theyre great Bratton great They can all do it They can all do it But they have to be allowed to do their job they have to be allowed to do their job Cheers It isnt just liberals like Chris Hayes who are becoming alarmed by this Republican strategist Alex Castellanossees the attraction of Trump in similar terms When a government that has pledged to do everything cant do anything otherwise sensible people turn to the strongman This is how the autocrat the popular dictator gains power We are seduced by his success and strength As our old inflexible government grows beyond its capacity to service a complex and adaptive society and its failures deface our landscape it creates demand for efficiency Who can bring order to this chaos Who has the guts and the strength to make the mess we have made work Then the call goes out for the strongman Who cares what he believes or promises And with the voice of the common man though he is anything but the strongman comes and pledges to make America great again Castellanos agrees with Trump that America is going to hell in a handbasket largely due to liberal failure but doesnt think that consolidating power in the hands of a single billionaire is a great way to deal with it Its easy to dismiss Trumps ramblings as the words of a kook But hes tapping into the rage and frustration many Americans feel when our country is exposed as being imperfect These Republicans were shamed by their exalted leaderships debacle in Iraq and believe that American exceptionalism is no longer respected around the world  andtheyare no longer respected here at home Trump is a winner and I think this is fundamentally what attracts them to him I will be fighting and I will win because Im somebody that wins We are in very sad shape as a country and you know why that is Were more concerned about political correctness than we are about victory than we are about winning We are not going to be so politically correct anymore we are going to get things done But his dark authoritarian message of intolerance and hate is likely making it difficult for him or any Republican to win a national election particularly since all the other candidates feel compelled to follow his lead Those who challenged him like Perry and Paul are sinking like a stone in the polls And while Trumps fans may want to blame foreigners for all their troubles most Americans know that their troubles can be traced to some powerful people right here at home Powerful people like Donald Trump Still history is littered with strongmen nobody took seriously until it was too late When someone like Trump captures the imagination of millions of people its important to pay attention to what hes saying For all his ranting youll notice that the one thing Trump never mentions is the constitution
