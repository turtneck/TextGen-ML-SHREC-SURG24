Politicians make many campaign promises they dont intend to deliver on But Netanyahus promise Monday to never agree to a Palestinian state fits his recordIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks as he visits a construction site in Har Homa east Jerusalem Monday March 16 2015 a day ahead of legislative elections Netanyahu is seeking his fourth term as prime ministerWith Israels final preelection polls pointing to a difficult road for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in power he spent his final days on the campaign trail throwing red meat to his baseProLikud robocalls warned Israeli voters that only Mr Netanyahu has the strength to stand up to Hussein Obama Campaign ads compared Israeli dock workers and regulators to Hamas militants and called his opponents tools of shadowy foreign financiers a strange charge given his own close ties to US casinobillionaire Sheldon AdelsonBut on Monday the prime minister delivered his show stopper Vote for me and Ill kill whats left of the peace process stone deadThough not his precise words that was their meaning And this is one campaign promise that voters could probably take to the bank If that promise helps tip the electoral balance in his favor it would mean the road to a Palestinian state that was at the heart of the OsloAccords signed over 20 years ago has come to a dead endI think that anyone who moves to establish a Palestinian stateand evacuate territory gives territory away to radical Islamic attacks against Israel he told NRG a prosettler news website owned by Mr AdelsonHe warned in the interview that if the more dovish Zionist Union headed by Isaac Herzog won the new government would do the bidding of the international community That was code for freezing settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and focusing on a Palestinian peace deal drawn on the borders that prevailed before 1967s ArabIsraeli war  all leading to the creation of a Hamastan in JerusalemWithout a Palestinian state and Israels evacuation of at least some of the settlements it has built on land captured in 1967 whats left of the socalled peace process becomes a farce There simply isnt that much more to talk aboutTo be sure its a somewhat academic question at this point There has been no process to speak of for years US Secretary of State John Kerrys protestations to the contrary notwithstanding When it was announced that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was stepping down from his role as the socalled Quartets special envoy on Middle East peace  after 8 years on the job  it was the first hed been heard from on the issue in quite some timeWhile spending most of his tenure talking about transformational change for Palestinians through investment promotion Mr Blair was also tending to his growing consulting empire whose clients include companies like JPMorgan Chase and governments like Kazakhstan and Abu Dhabi Middle East peace particularly the creation of the Palestinian state that the Quartet  the UN EU US and Russia  says is key steadily receded from viewBut at least lip service was paid to that ultimate goal by all concerned  including Netanyahu In 2009 in a speech following President Barack Obamas Cairo address in which the thennew US leader spoke of a new chapter for the Palestinians Netanyahu said as long as there were strong US security guarantees for Israel and a recognition of the Jewish state by the Palestinian Authority that we will be ready  to reach a solution where a demilitarized Palestinian state exists alongside a Jewish stateAlmost six years on he has repudiated that positionIt was no mistake that one of his last campaign stops Monday was in Har Homa a Jewish settlement of 20000 people wedged between Jerusalem and the ancient Palestinian town of Bethlehem Netanyahu approved construction work on Har Homa during his first term as prime minister in 1997 On Monday he confirmed what has long been suspected  that settlements like Har Homa were established to make any Palestinian claims on parts of Jerusalem impossibleWe will preserve Jerusalems unity in all its parts he told voters We will continue to build and fortify Jerusalem so that its division wont be possible and it will stay united foreverThe Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas views East Jerusalem as its future capital and that portion of the city is considered occupied by Israel under international lawSince the late 1990s a network of concrete walls checkpoints Israelionly roads and settlements in the West Bank has hemmed in and divided Palestinian population centers effectively chopping into pieces the territory that was meant to be the heartland of a Palestinian state Integrating them into something resembling a working economic and political whole would require settlement concessions And Netanyahu has now promised he will never make those concessionsTurnout in voting Tuesday has been brisk Haaretz reports that about 14 percent of eligible Israelis had voted by 10 AM local time a clip 20 percent faster than in the countrys two previous elections The final polls projected Likud slipping Israels Channel 2 had Likud down to 20 seats in its final poll on Friday with the Zionist Union projected at 24Yet even if Herzogs party wins more seats Netanyahu will still have a path to power Smaller rightwing and religious parties could pull enough seats to form a governing coalition  with Netanyahu once again at the head of the tableA likely partner for Netanyahu isNaftali Bennett head of the prosettlement Jewish Home party IndeedNetanyahu said his first call  after the election results are in  would be to Mr Bennett His party favors formal annexation of the major settlement blocks in theWest BanksArea C and has compared the creation of a Palestinian state to suicide for Israel Area C covers about 60 percent of the West Bank and intersperses the Palestinian towns and cities
