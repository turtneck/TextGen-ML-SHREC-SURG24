Nine years ago Michelle Obama was a reluctant political spouse The Chicago hospital executive made little secret of her distaste for the process as she stepped onto the national stage calling partisan politics a cynical business Her raw authenticity at times hurt her husbands campaign for the presidencyToday the first lady is a fully evolved political superstar hugely beloved within the Democratic Party and a force within popular culture Handed a primetime speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention on Monday she has been tapped to serve as a crucial validator for Hillary Clinton among groups who may remain skeptical of the partys nomineeIm glad that she was selected to speak on the first night the opening night of an historic convention said Donna Brazile the longtime Democratic strategist The country trusts her People know shes authentic and will be honest and they want to know what she thinksIn nearly eight years as first lady she has deliberately avoided partisan issues  but in her address she will fully endorse Clinton According to an official familiar with her written speech she plans to talk about the role a president plays in the lives of the nations children shaping their values and aspirations She will also discuss why she thinks Clinton has the character temperament and experience to be president and how Clintons career reflects ideals such as opportunity equality inclusionPersonally its a big step Mrs Obama hasnt been particularly close to the Clintons in the years since her husbands bruising 2008 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton But now the legacy of President Obamas administration rides on her victoryWhat kind of expresident will Barack Obama be POTUS plans for the futureShe is there in part to be a coda and also to be a bridge said Andra Gillespie a political scientist at Emory University who studies political mobilization Shes there to wrap up the Obama administration and provide a transition to what a Clinton presidency could beHer openingnight slot reflects more than just her steady popularity Organizers also appreciate her unerring knack for making headlines  and capturing the attention of people who dont otherwise follow the news cycle closely Come Tuesday there will be stories about everything from how warmly she spoke about Clinton to which fashion designers clothing she woreEven while absent from the action she ended up at the center of the news last week when Melania Trumps speech at the Republican National Convention turned out to have borrowed from her 2008 DNC speech and the Trump campaign was forced to acknowledge that Melania is an admirer of Michelles She stayed mum throughout Melanias ordealHow Michelle Obamas team wrote the speech that sparked the Melania Trump controversyIt was an ironic flub for the Trumps  after all the decision to have the first lady open the convention for Democrats is not without peril For all her popularity among party faithful and young popculture obsessives 57 percent of Americans viewed her favorably in a January 2015 Fox News poll she may not be the most effective figure for wooing swing voters or peeling off Trumpskeptical RepublicansWhile her predecessor Laura Bush was viewed warmly by many Democrats even as their disdain for her husband grew many Republicans see Michelle Obama more unfavorably In a 2014 Pew survey 46 percent of Republicans rated their views of her as very unfavorableConservative pundits have portrayed her advocacy for healthy food and exercise as a scolding biggovernment intrusion into private lives other critics have turned up their noses at her easy fluency in youthful hiphop culture Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan described the first ladys appearance at the 2013 Oscars as disquieting and questioned this White Houses lack of hesitation to insert itself into any cultural event anywhereAs it happened Michelle Obamas most visible appearance last week was her instantly viral Carpool Karaoke segment with The Late Late Show host James Corden in which she sang along to Beyoncs Single Ladies and rapped along to Missy Elliots 2001 hit Get Ur Freak On accompanied by Elliot herself Vanity Fair upon seeing this dubbed her the Coolest First LadyIn her DNC remarks though she will attempt to connect her life story to broader political and policy themes Her personal narrative of being reared in workingclass Chicago shows up in nearly all of her speeches and she probably will use it again to motivate the young people Democrats want to turn out to voteThe first lady takes a very active role in her speeches Tina Tchen the first ladys chief of staff said in an interview earlier this summer She wants to communicate that these are the circumstances under which I grew up and I never dreamed Id be in the White House and now I am and you can do that too Thats a theme woven through her speechesOver nine years of telling and retelling her trajectory from the South Side to the Ivy League to motherhood and a legal career her story has become more polished  thanks in part to the small cadre of White House speechwriters who have channeled her voiceIn 2007 she would try to connect with other women over their household duties doing a lot of juggling a lot of balancing as she told a New Hampshire crowd For the most part if a toilet overflows were the one scrambling to change the meeting time to be there to meet the plumber Can I get an Amen ladiesStories like that have fallen away now that she is a globetrotting first lady She continues to describe her own family life as busy but affectionate Yet it has been a long time since she sounded as if she was writing her own speechesDemocrats have high expectations for what she will bring to this political moment particularly after Clintons choice of mildmannered Sen Timothy M Kaine of Virginia as her running mate said Jamal Simmons a Democratic strategist who served as DNC communications adviser during the Obama 2008 campaignClinton is going to need to create as much sex appeal around her candidacy as she can Simmons said People will be looking for some excitementThe big stage also provides an opportunity for Obama to foreshadow the role she hopes to play after January 2017 The first lady has spoken of the isolation she feels living in the Executive Mansion While riding with Corden she mentioned how rare it was for her to be riding in the front seat of a car listening to musicClearly she is ready to regain more control over her private life But her speech may hint at her future as a public figure
