A Twitter page known as Black Women for Trump shared pictures of the result of the ingenious trap and it is simply hilarious Guys we got one pictwittercom2hZUVxyP8K  Black Women 4 Trump TallahForTrump October 28 2016 The pictures showed the row of downed Trump signs as well as a closeup of the specially designed trap on the first sign in the line   The final picture was of the likely suspects pulled over a short distance away car jacked up for a tire change This is probably not the wisest thing an American voter could do to show support for Donald Trump but its hard to argue that the woman who chose to drive over the signs in an effort to destroy them didnt get exactly what she deserved Hopefully this will teach a valuable lesson to this woman and other Trump haters out there that other peoples property is best left alone
