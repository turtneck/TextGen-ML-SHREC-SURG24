discussions but remain confident theres a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goalRyan speaking with reporters during his weekly press briefing sought to portray his openness to Trump despite withholding his endorsementThis is our first meeting I was very encouraged with this meeting but this is a process It takes some time you dont put it together in 45 minutes he saidThe speaker called Trumps achievement of earning more votes than any Republican candidate in history really kind of unparalleled and clearly hopes to channel the support for the presumptive nominee into support for a conservative policy agenda writ largeThe question is  how we unify it all How do we keep adding and adding and

FridaySenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters his meeting with Trump was constructive and that they spoke about a variety of things both campaign related and issuesFor Trump the meeting tested his ability to reconcile with the Washington establishment that he and the voters have scornedFor Ryan it will help shape his own future with a party increasingly impatient to get behind its nominee and win back the White HouseA top Trump aide had said there are no expectations at all of an immediate Ryan endorsement describing the Thursday session as an opening conversation in an ongoing process of party unificationSenators who met with Trump said they discussed a range of issues from immigration to tax policy and were impressed at how genial and affable he was in person Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said he understood that Trump is more of a showman in publicHe said he suggested to Trump that he find a new way to talk about immigration and referenced his experience as a border state senatorTheres some issues that Trump is clear on but they shouldnt be scary for our members Our members have always said they believe in ending the lawlessness of illegal immigration and always said we have to have trade agreements that are good said Sen Jeff Sessions the first senator to endorse Trump who has served as a liaison between the campaign and his Senate colleaguesAccording to a source familiar with the meeting Trump told House leadership he would come out with a list assisted by conservative groups The Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation of judicial nominations he would make if he had the opportunity to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court Trump also said the members present at the meeting should submit names to him and he would put them on the listA few of the House leadership members pushed Trump on abortion  he has voiced views to the left of the GOP on the issue  and Trump confirmed repeatedly that he was not interested in changing the partys platformHordes of reporters mobbed the front entrance of the GOP headquarters and gathered across the street from an alleyway behind the building but Trumps motorcade evaded the glare of the cameras and led the presumptive GOP nominee to the back entranceInside Trump was slated for a slew of meetings the first of which was with Ryan and Priebus who brokered the meeting in hopes of gluing the GOPs jagged divisions back together after Trump became the presumptive nominee and Ryan dropped a bombshell last week by refusing to back the brash billionaireTrump also met with the rest of the House Republican leaders only one of whom  Rep Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington  has not yet endorsed Trump and is holding out alongside RyanTrump then headed to meet with Senate Republican leadership before he departs Washington around 2 pmDemocrats meanwhile were more than happy to paint Trump and congressional and party GOP leaders as already unitedI guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency Donald Trump is everything that McConnell and his party could ever want in a nomination said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on the Senate floor adding that Trumps positions are identical to the Republican Party platformImmigration activists and other protesters were on site Thursday morning to reinforce the division Trump has sowed in the country holding signs calling the presumptive nominee dangerous divisive and deceitful A Trump impersonator with a bullhorn held bags with dollar signs printed on themBut Priebus left the meeting reassured that Trump would be able to appeal to communities of color that Trump largely alienated during the primary seasonTone and tenor matter and I think Donald Trump understands that too Priebus told Blitzer on The Situation Room saying that real estate magnate absolutely could do well with minority votersIn private and in public Ryan is sending the message his party wants to hear The GOP will be united this fallIn a private meeting in his office Wednesday Ryan told his colleagues who support Trump that his highprofile sitdown with the billionaire businessman would be the start of a continual dialogue between the speakers office and the presidential campaign sources saidSpeaking to the full House GOP Conference in the basement of the Capitol Ryan suggested that the partys focus this fall will be on defeating Hillary Clinton  not the internal GOP bloodbathThe United States cannot afford another four years of the Obama White House which is what Hillary Clinton represents Trump and Ryan said in their statement following the meeting That is why its critical that Republicans unite around our shared principles advance a conservative agenda and do all we can to win this fallBut according to several allies of the speaker Ryan went into the meeting seeking some assurances for himselfHe wants to ensure Trump will not hurt his House Republican majority by undermining his colleagues and the carefully crafted electionyear agenda the GOP is painstakingly trying to create He wants Trump to communicate a positive vision avoid using foul and incendiary rhetoric and keep the party united on its core conservative principles And as Ryan told reporters Wednesday he just wants to get to know TrumpYet his strategy  to publicly announce last week he wont yet back Trump  also has put Ryan on the firing line including among his own members who say they were blindsided that the leader of their party undermined their presumptive nominee just as the GOP was trying to heal after a divisive primaryWell it sure doesnt make it look like were all on the same page does it Rep Mark Amodei RNevada said of Ryans public stand Whats the matter with saying I disagree with him on this and that but were all wearing the same jersey So guess what We want to win the game and we go have a fight in the locker roomAsked if Ryans comments bothered him Amodei said Yes it does Im trying to figure out what the upside isRep Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia a friend of Ryans was surprised by the speakers lack of endorsementIt just seemed like he could have said Im going to support whoever our nominee is that comes out of Cleveland Westmoreland said Why do you want to make mad who you are trying to go into a room and negotiate withOn the Senate side McConnell told reporters this week that Trump could be competitive in the fall a show of support from the party leaderSen Shelley Moore Capito a West Virginia Republican who has not yet said shell back Trump said she has a point to make with the frontrunner during the Thursday meetingThe other thing is the tone that he has had Capito said Im going to express that I dont think thats a productive tone for the rest of the campaign and I think it would affect the intensity in which people campaign for himAlready other meetings between Trump and other House factions are in the works including with the conservative House Freedom Caucus Many conservatives expect that group and others to get behind Trump The longer Ryan holds out the more isolated he could become in his conferenceBut Trumps detractors on Capitol Hill believe Ryan has provided cover to his colleagues in tough races by showing some distance from the candidateRep Carlos Curbelo  one of the most endangered House Republicans in the country  said Im very grateful for the speaker for doing thisAfter the Trump meeting Senate GOP leaders briefed their conference in Mansfield room near the Senate floor Former Trump rival Ted Cruz didnt say much there other than a joke according to a senator in the roomTo be honest with you I didnt want to come back Cruz saidArizona Sen John McCain responded We didnt want you to either
