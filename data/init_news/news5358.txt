Behind The Shortage Of Special Ed Teachers Long Hours Crushing PaperworkThere is a letter that school districts really dont like sending home to parents of special education students Each state has a different version but they all begin with something like thisDear Parent as of the date of this letter your childs teacher is not considered highly qualified  And then This doesnt mean your childs teacher is not capable or effective It means they havent met the state standards for teaching in their subjectIn any other subject thats an annoying problem that suggests students may not be wellserved In special education it means the school district is breaking the lawThe federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or IDEA requires that every student have whats known as an IEP  Individualized Education Program And almost always those IEPs spell out that students  either some of the time or all of the time  must be taught by a teacher fully certified in special educationYet around the country thats exactly the category of teacher thats most in demand as many states and districts are reporting severe shortagesThis crisis has been coming for a long time says David Pennington superintendent of Ponca City public schools in Oklahoma Many teachers there are nearing retirement and hes not sure he can replace themForget about replacing them with someone of the same quality he says Im just worried about replacing them PeriodPenningtons rural district of 5300 students northwest of Tulsa has been hit hard by the shortage He says its extremely difficult to persuade newer special education teachers to stay beyond two or three yearsThe job is not what they thought it was going to be Pennington explains They feel like theyre under a microscope all the timeOn top of the normal demands of teaching special education teachers face additional pressures feelings of isolation fear of lawsuits and students who demand extra attention Many are the only specialneeds teacher in their grade or their school or sometimes in the entire districtAnd then theres the seemingly endless paperworkIt is not uncommon Pennington says for a special ed teacher to tell me I did not get a degree in special ed to do paperwork I got a degree to help kids The IDEA and the IEP require hours and hours of filling out forms and writing reports documenting each students progressAnd when do teachers do that paperwork Sometime during the hours of 3 pm to 10 pm says Deborah Ziegler of the Council for Exceptional Children a special education research and advocacy group Its like having two fulltime jobsSo whats the answer Aggressive recruitment says Trevor Greene Hes the human resources director of Highline Public Schools a 19000student district south of SeattleRight now its a buyers market he says Districts cant afford to wait around for the right candidate And hes speaking from experience When Greene started as HR director last July he had 30 vacancies in special education to fill before school began in SeptemberIt was pretty ominous at the beginning he recallsGreene reached out on every teacherrecruitment platform he could find He even tracked applicants down on LinkedInGreene was even able to find certified special education teachers for all of the positions which has become a rare occurrence Many districts are able to fill vacancies only by hiring teachers trained in general education who are willing to make the switch to a special education settingBetty Olson the special education administrator for the Boise public schools in Idaho says she was forced to hire a few general education teachers this yearAs the school year approached she was prepared to send some of her district specialists former teachers who now train new teachers back into the classroom to fill vacanciesIt didnt come to that But she now has the challenge of helping a slew of new teachers adjust to the world of special educationOlson is getting some help from Boise State University which has created a new program designed to prepare teachers with little or no experience in special education Candidates are put on a fast track to complete a masters degree and they receive oneonone support as they begin their new careerSimilar programs have popped up around the country Im hopeful things will get better Olson saysOther administrators like Pennington from Oklahoma are less optimisticHe believes were in for a rude awakening He expects more and more teachers to look at all that responsibility all that pressure and conclude that its not worth itAnd so he wonders What happens when it gets so bad that you literally cannot find anyone to be in charge of a classroom
