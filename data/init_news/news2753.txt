A suicide bomber believed to be linked to the Islamic State struck the historic heart of Istanbul on Tuesday killing at least 10 people in what would be the groups first major attack on Turkeys vital tourism industryThe bombing which injured 15 others took place in the shadow of the citys famous ninedomed Blue Mosque which draws visitors from around the world Most of the victims were German nationals Turkish officials saidThe targeting of Turkeys tourism trade puts the group on a more direct collision course with the Turkish state which has been criticized for not doing enough to prevent militants from using the country as a crucial route for recruits supplies and oil smugglingBut the militants appear increasingly desperate to strike overseas as they lose territory in Iraq and SyriaThis terror organization the assailants and all of their connections will be found and they will receive the punishments they deserve said Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu He said the attacker was a member of the Islamic State though the group has not asserted responsibility for the attackThe blast occurred just before 1030 am in the Sultanahmet district an area that includes the 400yearold Blue Mosque Hagia Sophia a former Byzantineera basilica and the lavish Ottoman Topkapi PalaceThe attacker identified by Turkish authorities as a 28yearold of Syrian origin mingled with a group of German tourists as they gathered near the Obelisk of Theodosius an ancient Egyptian monolith brought to Istanbul  then known as Constantinople  in the 4th centuryTurkish news outlets later identified the attacker as Nabil Fadli adding that he had been born in Saudi ArabiaEight of those killed were Germans according to authorities In addition officials said that at least 15 people were injured in the explosion including nine Germans and other foreigners  among them a Peruvian and a NorwegianToday Istanbul was hit Paris has been hit Tunisia has been hit Ankara has been hit before German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin International terrorism is once again showing its cruel and inhuman face todayThe White House also condemned the heinous attack which it said struck Turks and foreign tourists alike In a statement Tuesday National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said that the United States stands with NATO ally Turkey a valued member of the USled coalition

over SyriaDirectly and indirectly tourism makes up about 12 percent of Turkeys gross domestic product according to the World Travel and Tourism Council an international travelindustry organization with the country welcoming about 40 million tourists a yearThe vast plazas and surrounding streets of Sultanahmet normally busy with merchants vendors and visitors were quiet late Tuesday with many restaurants empty The area immediately around the blast was cordoned off by policeYahya Ibrahim an imam from Perth Australia was visiting with his wife and three children when the blast hitWe were just about to head into the mosque but then decided to have breakfast first he said A huge boom reverberated through the streets he said which his 9yearold daughter thought was thunderIbrahim said that the attack wouldnt deter them from visiting again On a theological basis its a perversion of Islam he said of the Islamic States ideology On a practical level its murderPentagon pushes allies to help choke off Islamic State networksThe Islamic State probably has the capability to launch an extended terror campaign against Turkey said Firas Abi Ali a senior analyst at IHS a global risk analysis firmIts territorial losses in Iraq and Syria may well have led the group to assess its needs to expand its influence and capability in Turkey he said If todays attack was perpetrated by the Islamic State it would reflect a shift in the groups strategy and herald a broader campaign against TurkeyHowever such a move will likely provoke a significant backlash by the Turkish government he saidTurkish forces have not directly intervened in the Syrian conflict but Ankara has been under pressure from Western governments to crack down on the crossborder flow of people and supplies to Islamic State strongholds in Syria Last summer Turkey opened its Incirlik air base to US warplanes carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State positions in SyriaTurkey is also a key backer of rebel groups opposing Syrian President Bashar alAssad and it has recently stepped up its decadesold fight against Kurdish separatistsIn the past Turkish groups have staged their own attacks in the country A year ago a Chechen woman believed to be linked to militant factions blew herself up outside a police post in Sultanahmet killing one police officerThere were also two major suicide attacks on peace activists in the countrys southeast last year killing more than 100 people The government blamed the Islamic State for those explosions but the militant group never asserted responsibilityCunningham
