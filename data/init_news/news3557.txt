Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump scored resounding wins in New York Tuesday The results underscored Bernie Sanderss limitations but still leave much to play for in the GOP raceHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueFormer President Bill Clinton l applauds as his wife Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton celebrates after winning the New York state primary Tuesday in New YorkThis time it was personalOn Tuesday Hillary Clinton emphatically underlined her frontrunner status and won a resounding victory over her previously surging rival revealing the limits of Bernie Sanderss rallybased campaign and his focus on antiWall Street economic populismMrs Clinton won the New York primary by nearly 16 percentage points  an unexpectedly wide margin ofvictory crafted by assembling a diverse coalition of Democratic votersClinton had come to New York weeks ago campaigning during a stretch in which Senator Sanders of Vermont had been reeling off convincing wins in eight of the previous nine contestsSanderss momentum included his massive recordsetting rallies in New York Hollywood star power and the enthusiasm of tens of thousands of young and boisterous supporters during the past two weeks And in many national polls Sanders had all but erased the former secretary of States lead of nearly 15 percentage points in FebruaryClinton however kept it small and local throughout the campaign fanning out into the states Democratic establishment bases She danced Dominican bachata at a block party in Washington Heights played dominoes with locals in Harlem sipped Chinese bubble tea in QueensShe pressed the flesh with local officials at organizing events visited black churches throughout the state and bored into local concerns  just like she had when she twice ran for the United States Senate here In a closed primary  where only registered Democrats could vote  the strategy workedToday you proved once again theres no place like home Clinton said during her victory party at the Sheridan near Times Square beaming and with an almost palpable sense of relief In this campaign weve won in every region of the country she continued But this ones personal New Yorkers youve always had my back And Ive always tried to have yoursJust a few blocks away at Trump Tower in Manhattan billionaire Donald Trump reestablished his role as the Republican frontrunner also winning the New York primary in dramatic  if expected  fashion with nearly 60 percent of the vote and taking at least 89 of the 95 delegates at stakeMr Trump too had stumbled in recent weeks as Sen Ted Cruz of Texas had strategically outmaneuvered his campaign which relies on big rallies to galvanize followers Senator Cruz had swept up all the delegates from the Colorado Republican convention earlier in April and continued to pick up stray delegates even in states the real estate mogul had received a majority of votesThe GOP leader had been decrying the partys delegate system calling it rigged against outside candidates like him But New York voters overwhelmingly chose the Queensborn billionaire giving new life to his hope of winning a majority of delegates before the convention in ClevelandWe dont have much of a race anymore Trump told his supporters in his victory speech in the Trump Tower lobby Were going to go into the convention I think as the winner saying Cruz was just about mathematically eliminatedTo the contrary the math still shows a steep climb for Trump to get the 1237 delegates he needs to avoid a contested convention The latest estimate by NBC News suggests Trump will need to win about 57 percent of the remaining delegates to reach 1237 To this point hes secured 47 percent of the delegates on offer according to a Politico tallyFor both Cruz and Gov John Kasich of Ohio as well as the NeverTrump establishment forces within the GOP the strategy remains to deny Trump a majority of delegates and then take their chances within a contested conventionOn the Democratic side however Clinton is more and more poised to become the nominee The NBC estimate suggests she now needs to win less than 33 percent of the remaining delegates including super delegates to secure the nomination To this point shes won 59 percent of the delegates on offer according to PoliticoWe started this race not far from here on Roosevelt Island Clinton said during her victory speech And tonight a little less than a year later the race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sightSanders had hoped a victory here  or even a closelycontested loss on Clintons adopted home turf  would further damage the frontrunner His campaign spent nearly 2 million more in television ads than Clintons and Sanders and his followers had ramped up their criticisms questioning her ties to Wall Street and past support for harsh criminal justice measuresThe Vermont senator traveled to Pennsylvania for a rally at a college on Tuesday but in the evening he flew home to Burlington Vt  without his press entourage  to get recharged and take a day offBernie Sanders got very negative attacking Hillary Clinton and dividing the party in New York and I think he now has to ask himself if he wants to keep going down that path said Jay Jacobs the Democratic chairman in Long Islands suburban Nassau County according to The New York Times After New York were moving into a phase of the campaign where we have to start uniting the partySanders complained about the builtin advantages Clinton had as an establishment candidate Since New York is a closed primary independents and those registered with other parties had to reregister as Democrats by October of last year  well before Sanders began his surgeBut the same problems Sanders faced in New York will onlymultiply in the days aheadConnecticutDelaware Maryland and Pennsylvania hold closed primaries next Tuesday Moreoverthe Vermont senator has performed best within states with few minority voters Polls show that Clinton maintains significant leads in diverse states like Pennsylvania and Maryland as well as ConnecticutThe Sanders campaign said it would assess where we are after those contests the Associated Press reported late TuesdayAnd while many of Sanderss young supporters had sometimes expressed deep animus towards Clinton exit polls on Tuesday revealed that a vast majority of Democratic voters in New York would support either candidate in the general electionTo all the people who supported Sen Sanders a rejuvenated Clinton told her supporters Tuesday night I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us
