Hillary Clinton is clobbering Bernie Sandersand yet getting negative reviews from some of the punditsHow is that possible The Democratic race is essentially over President Obama is privately telling donors its time to get on the Hillary train the New York Times reports A frontrunner who wins in state after state usually basks in a winners aura as the party coalesces around her and draws glowing profiles of how she and her team did itSure Hillary was always expected to beat Bernie Its also true that Clinton has never been beloved by the press and the feeling is mutualBut the larger problem is the outlook as the commentary class looks ahead to the fallUntil the last couple of weeks the conventional wisdom was that a Trump nomination would all but assure a second Clinton presidency After all shes the former senator and secretary of State with an awesome political machine and hes the untested billionaire with a penchant for divisive rhetoric Plus Democrats have an Electoral College edge and have won the popular vote in five of the last six campaignsBut some commentators see troubling signs in Clintons performance so far and wonder how she would withstand a Trump onslaught The Donald has high negatives to be sure but Hillary does as wellAn unsparing assessment comes from Joe Klein who has known the Clintons for a quarter century and mostly written sympathetically about them since his 1992 New York magazine cover story on Bill ClintonKlein agrees with Hillarys selfassessment that she is not a natural politician but goes much further in weighing a Trump matchupClinton seems particularly ill equipped for the task She is our very own quinoa and kale salad nutritious but bland Worse shes the human embodiment of the Establishment that Trump has been running againstIndeed her real problem is that shes too much of a politician She still speaks like politicians did 20 years ago when her husband was President This year the candidates who have seemed the most appealingTrump Sanders John Kasichdont use the oratorical switchbacks that have been beaten to death since John F KennedyIts no secret that Sanders has pushed Clinton to the left on trade immigration Wall Street and other issues But Klein says that is often viewed as dissemblingThere is an odd new law of US politics You can lie as Trump does all the time egregiously but you cant temporize You cant avoid a position on the XL pipeline or the TransPacific trade deal as Clinton tried to do in the campaign You cant try to please too many people too much of the time Raising your voice to make a pointwhich Clinton does all the time disastrously because it seems such a conscious actwont get you anywhere unless youre really angryIn the end Im not at all certain that Clinton can beat TrumpA note about her speaking style When Clinton won five states on Tuesday night I tweeted that she was shouting her speech and that it would be more effective with the audience at home if she was more conversational I didnt say she was shrill I didnt say she should smile and in the past Ive criticized Sanders for shouting his way through debatesBut I was hit with hundreds of tweets declaring me to be a horrible misogynistic sexist Some of this was a wave powered by what others had said about her speech Maybe my quick take was wrong But I hope were not entering a period where any criticism of the presumptive Democratic nominee is treated as sexismOther leftwing pundits driven in part by ideology fear the worst This Salon headline boils it downHillary Will Never Survive the Trump Onslaught Its Not Fair But It Makes Her a Weak NomineeClintons largest problem in my view is her low polling marks on honesty a result of the email scandal and perhaps decades of scars of accumulated accusations some of them fair and some exaggeratedVeteran journalist Jeff Greenfield writing earlier in Politico spells out three reasons why Clinton could prove to be a weak candidateFirst Hillary Clinton commands little trust among an electorate that is driven today by mistrust Second her public lifethe posts she has held the positions she has adopted and jettisoneddefine her as a creature of the establishment at a time when voters regard the very idea with deep antipathy And finally however she wishes it were not so however much she argues that she represents the future as Americas first prospective female presidentClinton still embodies the past just as she did in 2008 when she lost to Barack Obama The combination of those three factors is already playing out in the Democratic primary where younger voters are turning away from her and embracing a geriatric whitehaired alternative in drovesWhen Clinton recalibrates says Greenfield she always embraces the politically popular standHowever lukewarm the Democratic base may be about Hillary she enjoys broad support within the party and most Bernie backers should have no trouble shifting their allegiance to her The same cant be said for Trump who is weathering a Republican revolt against the likelihood of his winning the nominationWell know Hillary is solving her enthusiasm problem when she starts getting better reviews from journalists on the
