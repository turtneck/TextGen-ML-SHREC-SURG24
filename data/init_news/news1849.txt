CNN Donald Trump is issuing a dire warning to his supporters Youre getting ripped offThe system folks is rigged Trump told supporters at a rally Monday night in Albany New York Its a rigged disgusting dirty systemTrump is coming to grips with the creeping possibility that he could narrowly lose the Republican nomination at a contested GOP convention despite landing in Cleveland with the most delegates And his latest comments follow a series of victories by Ted Cruzs welloiled delegate wrangling machine at state and county Republican conventions most recently this weekend when the Texas senator swept the Colorado Republican convention  wins that are fueling Cruz in the event neither of the two men capture the 1237 delegates needed to avoid a brokered conventionAnd with party elites continuing to rally around efforts to derail and delegitimize his candidacy Trump is feeling the heat  and using it to sow new outrage with his backersI say this to the RNC and I say it to the Republican Party Youre going to have a big problem folks because there are people that dont like whats going on Trump said at a Rochester New York rally on Sunday during which he referred to the partys nominating process as crooked or corrupt seven times during his speechHe also called attention eight times during that speech to the millions of votes he has pulled during the primary  nearly 2 million more than CruzRNC chairman Reince Priebus said the rules that Trump is criticizing are nothing newAt a rally in San Diego Cruz told Trump You lost fair and squareDonald it aint stealing when the voters vote against you It is the voters reclaiming this country Cruz said Monday 65000 people voted in the state of Colorado They just didnt vote for you They voted for our campaignBut voters at Trump rallies are already sharing the frontrunners outrageHere is the Republican Party instead of listening to its constituents  to the majority of America  who are saying this is what we want theyre not backing him up Instead theyre rallying against him which in turn theyre rallying against us said the 37yearold from Saratoga New YorkAmy Almy a 48yearold hairdresser who also attended Trumps rally Monday said she now feels nave for not realizing that everything was so fixedYou see whats happening to me and Bernie Sanders Trump said Sunday in Rochester New York Its a corrupt deal going onSix in 10 Republican voters said in a recent CNNORC poll that if no major candidate earns a majority of the delegates headed into the convention those delegates should nominate the candidate who entered with the largest pool of delegates That candidate would most almost certainly be TrumpTrumps opponents meanwhile are shaking off accusations of foul play and saying Trump is failing to follow the rulesSo what So what Thats not how it works Black said If he cant get a majority of the delegates somebody else will and thats the person that won it fair and squareIts about the delegates its not about his ego Black added of Trump who has benefited from winnertakeall primary rules in several states to earn a larger share of delegates than he has votesColorado Sen Cory Gardner on Monday night took to Twitter  one of Trumps favorite stomping grounds  to troll TrumpHow on earth are you going to defeat ISIS if you cant figure out the cologop convention Gardner tweeted one of several in a string from his accountBlack downplayed the potential of a fractured Republican Party should Trump fail to cinch the nomination at a brokered convention but Trumps allies are painting a disastrous pictureIf there are shenanigans its not straightforward all of those millions of people that Donald Trump has brought into the arena are not going to stay there and the Republicans are going to lose former presidential contender turned Trump supporter Ben Carson said late last month on Fox News Its going to be absolute destructionJesse Benton the chief strategist to a proTrump super PAC described an equally grim outcomeIt would be such a suicidal move for the party to nominate anybody besides Donald Trump Benton said If they decide to push millions of people out of the process its going to be devastatingBut while Trump and his supporters are warning of an establishment effort to subvert the popular outcome the billionaire is also beginning to look for ways to outgun his opponents within the confines of the systemHis hire came after Trump only recently came to the realization that he could very well win more delegates than his opponents and yet still leave the Cleveland convention without the crown he has been seekingTrump placed a call to his longtime and now informal political adviser Roger Stone on March 25 and asked if party elites could truly screw him out of the nomination at a brokered convention according to a source with knowledge of the conversationStone recommended Trump hire Manafort and by the end of the weekend Manafort was on boardBut while those gears quietly churn with his blessing Trumps outrage is only growing louderWeve got a corrupt system Its not right Trump said on Sunday And weve got to do something about it
