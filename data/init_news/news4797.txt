As part of aneditorial calling for Republicans to stop Donald Trump from becoming their presidential nominee the Boston Globe on Sunday imagined what covering a President Trump would be like on its front pageThe Globe took some editorial liberties with how Trumps plans would impact the US including the potential for riots markets crashing and the military refusing to obey Trumps ordersIt is an exercise in taking a man at his word And his vision of America promises to be as appalling in real life as it is in black and white on the page It is a vision that demands an active and engaged opposition It requires an opposition as focused on denying Trump the White House as the candidate is flippant and reckless about securing itThe Globes predicted results to Trumps policies dont seem too far off from reality Deporting 11 million unauthorized immigrants would likely cause a lot of social unrest in the US and Trump has explicitly called for violence at his rallies Imposing taxes on foreign goods if Trump cant get the trade deals he wants would very likely hurt the economy And former CIA Director Michael Hayden warned that the military really would ignore Trumps orders to go directly after the relatives of ISIS members and other terroristsThe Globe looks at all of these possibilities with horror  enough to publish a satirical front page and call for Republicans to stop Trump at a brokered convention regardless of the risks to the party
