Sheldon Adelson the Las Vegas casino magnate and billionaire Republican donor has made up his mind Hes supporting Donald Trump and other Republicans need to fall in lineAdelsons endorsement in an oped in the Washington Post matters because hes very wealthy and very willing to spend his wealth to elect Republicans He spent as much as 150 million trying to defeat President Obama in 2012 His proTrump argument boils down to three points Any Republican is better than a Democrat Hillary Clinton in particular would be worse and Trumps CEO experience has to count for somethingAs Republicans we know that getting a person in the White House with an R behind his name is the only way things will get better That opportunity still exists We must not cut off our noses to spite our facesAdelson almost certainly wont be the last prominent Republican to rationalize supporting Trump like this Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan seem to be working toward a rapprochement Senate Republicans up for reelection are still dancing around outright endorsing Trump but are refusing to publicly denounce him eitherAnd if anyone had reasons to be skeptical about Trump its Adelson a hardliner on Israeli security Trump promised to be neutral on IsraelPalestine  although he later backed away from that stance  and to enforce the Iran deal Adelson has been telegraphing for months that Trump might be acceptable to him His rationale  The alternative to Trump being sworn in as the nations 45th president is frightening he wrote  is likely to show up in other Republicans statements between now and November
