    "Welcome to the Zero to GPT course!  This course will take you from no deep learning knowledge to being able to train your own GPT model.\n",

    "GPT models are types of deep learning models.  Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which is a subfield of AI.  In deep learning, we train a neural network composed of many layers to transform an input into an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can't understand text directly, so GPT has to convert your prompt to numbers, make predictions, then convert the predictions back to text.  The process works like this at a very high level:\n",

    "The key part of GPT is the prediction step, where the network predicts what words will come next.  To do this, the network uses its parameters.  You can think of parameters like memory.  This memory has been trained on a lot of data (gigabytes or terabytes).  Parameters enable neural networks to make accurate predictions about what should come after your prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest GPT models have around 100M parameters, and the largest have 176B.  They use parameters to transform your input to predictions - usually by adding the parameters to your input, or multiplying your input by the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you'll understand how to train deep neural networks that work like GPT.  This course is split up into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding deep learning - how to create and train deep neural networks, including gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
    "2. Deep learning for NLP - deep learning architectures to work with text, including RNNs, encoder/decoders, attention, and transformers.\n",
    "3. Scaling up models - putting together the building blocks to train a model with a large number of parameters.\n",

    "This course will get you ready to do meaningful work with deep learning.  We'll balance theory and practical application.  Without theory, you won't understand how to apply deep learning in the real world.  But theory shouldn't overwhelm - it should aid you in actually doing the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each lesson, you'll learn the theory behind what you're doing, and code complete implementations that solve problems.  For example, in the dense neural networks lesson, you'll learn the theory - backpropagation, why nonlinearities are useful, and how multiple layers work.  Then you'll code a complete neural network using NumPy that predicts the weather.\n",

    "- This is not a mathematically rigorous course.  We'll include the math, but we'll focus on building intuition and understanding first.  For a mathematically rigorous resource, I recommend the [deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)."
