 Trump is The Lesser Evil Because Hes Such a Narcissist By Prof Michael HudsonShe a vindictive dictator punishing her enemies appointing neoconsWell both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil So if thats true whos the greater evil Posted November 08 2016Ross Ashcroft Youve got two candidates in the US and one is very proWall Street specifically Goldman Sachs She might as well be on the payroll In fact she is on the payroll And the other is a rentseeker inchief and hes built real estate and used the banks So youve got Trump and youve got Clinton Both of them are in bed with Wall Street fundamentally But the people get it nowMichael Hudson Well I think Hillary Clinton has a 79 percent disapproval rating and Trump has an 81 percent disapproval rating So you have the two most unpopular politicians in the United States as the choice So basically the voters in the United States are given a choice YesYes please and Yes thank you I think Trump missed his big chance to make a populist push Instead of saying hes going to cut taxes on Wall Street he can say Look I stiffed the banks I went bankrupt four or six times I screwed the banks and they didnt get paid and I can screw the banks for you people Vote for me I know how to do itAshcroft Yes hes missed thatHudson I think that would have been his winning ployAshcroft You should be his campaign strategistHudson Well except I dont think Id have many friends if I worked for Donald Trump And we dont know that if he agreed with me today what hed do tomorrow Thats part of the problem He doesnt play well with colleaguesAshcroft You sort of prefer him thoughwould that be right Because he doesnt play well with colleagues because hes awkward because hes a loner becausebecause youre saying you dont want a resourceful intelligent and influential type in the job because the jobs so powerfulHudson Well both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil So if thats true whos the greater evil Hillary has a whole crowd behind herthe neocons who basically want to be very confrontational toward Russia and continue what she was doing in Libya to Syriamilitarily confrontational Or you have Donald Trump who doesnt really know who he can appoint and whether he can get enough people to work with him So if the direction of America is to try to hold on to a unipolar worldmilitarily confrontationalyou want a president who is least able to do evil And theres no question Trump is the lesser evil because hes such a narcissist and really sort of a blank slate And Id rather take a pig in a poke than someone whoyou already know what Hillary will do Shell do what the husband does And itsthe Clintons have corrupted the Democratic Party Thats what Bernie Sanders ran on against herAshcroft And did very wellHudson And did very well But then he didnt realize that there really cannot be any progress by the labor unions or consumers or the 99 percent as long as the Democratic Party is controlled totally by Wall Street and by the Robert Rubin gang that they brought in And theyre really like a mafia gang If you think the financial sector and the banking sector as crimeand after all remember theyve paid billions and billions of dollars in civil fines without a single banker being sent to jailthats what a criminal wants to do When the criminals take control of the justice system and take over the police force and bribe the judgesall the Hollywood movies in the 1930s were thatthen youve got the criminals in control And youve got the financial sector criminalized Thats what my colleague Bill Black at the University of Missouri at Kansas City has been emphasizing and hes convinced all of us that the business plan of the big banksCitibank Bank of America weve just got and Wells Fargo with all of the huge frauds that are coming outthat was their business plan fraud And people are afraid to say that fraud is banking Theyre afraid to say just exactly what the evidence is because its considered impolite to talk about realityAshcroft What sort of president then will Hillary Clinton beHudson A dictator She a vindictive dictator punishing her enemies appointing neocons in the secretary of state in the defense department appointing Wall Street people in the Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the class war will really break out very explicitly And shellas Warren Buffet said there is a class war and were winning itAshcroft As in the one percent are winning itHudson The one percent are winning it And she will try to use the rhetoric to tell people Nothing to see here folks Keep on moving while the economy goes down and down and she cashes in as shes been doing all along richer and richer and if shes president there will not be an investigator of the criminal conflict of interest of the Bill Clinton Foundation of paytoplay Youll have a presidency in which corporations who pay the Clintons will be able to set policy Whoever has the money to buy the politicians will buy control of policy because elections have been privatized and made part of the market economy in the United States Thats what the Citizens United Supreme Court case was all aboutAshcroft So thats another example of rentseekingHudson Yes political payoffs And thats the largest rentseeking of all Basically for paying one penny you get a whole dollars worth of special privileges And rent is really payment for a privilege Its for a privilege thats created from the private sector And basically as Balzac said every great fortune originates in a great theft that isnt considered a great theft anymore because its all viewed as part of the market Its viewed as if thats how the world works So youll have a theft taking place and the Clintons will say Thats just how the world operates and GDP is going up because were getting richer enough to offset the degree by which you 99 percent are getting poor
