By all accounts Loretta Lynch president Obamas choice to replace Eric Holder as attorney general was very impressive in the first day of hearings In fact she was so impressive that eventhe rightwing bloggersat Powerline called her the Ernie Banks of nominees which judging from theireulogy for the real Ernie Banks is very good indeed But then they also said the committee was throwing softballs so the metaphors got a little confusing It was a very good day for Loretta Lynch much to their chagrin She was appropriately confident dignified and boring and thus made for a dull affair that was unlikely to derail her nominationThe second day of hearings in which both Republicans and Democrats on the committee invited both people to testify was a little bit more lively We knew it would be when the committee announced their guests The Democrats offered a group of former colleagues and law professors The Republicans offered a couple of conservative law professors to denounce President Obamas usurpation of democracy  and some farrightwing activists to complain about being victimizedThe first person to testify was someone who had never met or had any knowledge of Loretta Lynch This wasformer reporter and current rightwing icon Sharyl Attkissonwho told a harrowing story of harassment including her questionable allegation that the government bugged her computer obviously shocking the likes of Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch to the depth of their souls Its one thing for the government to relentlessly pursue reporters like James Risen who report serious and important stories They wholeheartedly support the Justice Department in such cases Attkisson howeverresigned from CBS Newsbecause she felt the entire network was biased in favor of the Obama administration and refused to allow her to pursue the scandals she just knew were there These were scandals like Benghazi and Fast and Furious  scandals that have been investigated approximately 756 times under every committee in the Congress and have turned up zilch Somehow theyve managed to morph this professional dispute into a story of Attkisson being victimized by the authoritarian police stateIt would have been interesting to hear testimony about the governments pursuit of leaks and reporters over the past few years which really is a scandal and which should form the basis of questioning for the new attorney general But since both parties are generally in favor of this practice that wasnt to be Instead the Republicans called one of their celebrity martyrs to testify about how hard it is for a conservative to live in this worldThe next activist they called to testify about Loretta Lynch was a man who admittedly has absolutely no knowledge of her but had something to say about how Eric Holder was very mean to police officers around the country He is an AfricanAmerican sheriff from Wisconsin namedDavid Clarkewho up to this point is best known for his appearances on Fox and Friends in which he says things like the NAACP is nothing more than a propaganda entity for the left and that the behavior of black people is the reason they are getting shot so often He suggested that the federal government is waging a war on police and should butt out of local businessThe final activist of the day was a citizen who has been working her heart out trying to protect our electoral system from the scourge of nonexistent voter fraud That would be a woman named Catherine Englebrecht who runsa farrightwing group called True the Votewhich sends out groups of observers to AfricanAmerican and Hispanic polling places to make sure theyre not stealing the votes of decent Americans Upon Eric Holders resignation her group put out a press release stating that Holder had carried out aradical racialist assault on voting rightsShe was there to complain about the Department of Justice failing to immediately interview her over the alleged IRS scandal and to excoriate them over the nightmare of citizen targeting She then testified that Loretta Lynch was wrong in saying that laws had been passed throughout the South to prevent some people from voting Sen Jeff Sessions pointed out that an Alabama Tea Party leader had been victimized by the IRS and nobody at the IRS cares Sen Orrin Hatch expressed his deepest sympathy for what shes been through and assured her that they were going to get to bottom of it Her voice cracked with emotion as she said Thank you sir This was the first committee hearing of the new Senate Judiciary Committee under GOP rule a hearing to determine the fitness of a presidential nominee to the most powerful law enforcement office in the land and they called a group of partisan crackpots and grassroots loons to relitigate moldy pseudoscandals and complain about nonexistent government persecution And its not as if they couldnt have found some real scandals to talk about The Obama Justice Department is hardly perfect But they are married to their Foxified version of reality and simply cant see the forest for the trees The whole spectacle was a nostalgic trip back in time to the days of Clinton madness when the judiciary committees were able to leverage any public hearing into a scandal fest The press seems less inclined to go along these days a fact that Sharyl Attkisson would surely attribute to its political bias But the truth is that these scandals are just sad echoes of the scandalmongering of the 1990s The energy is gone the issues seem pale and lifeless Not that there was ever any there there but they are now just going through the motions But I hope Democrats dont get too complacent President Obama has never been able to get their scandal mojo rising But theres every reason to suspect that this is just an offseason workout for what they see as a return to the big leagues If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency you can be sure there will be a return to the fiery investigations whenever the Republicans hold either house of Congress And if history serves the press will likely be eager to join the team But this sad little show reveals just how much they are in need of some spring training Loretta Lynch may be a genial public servant in the mold of Ernie Banks but when it comes to scandal management Clinton is Babe Ruth They are going to need to up their game significantly
