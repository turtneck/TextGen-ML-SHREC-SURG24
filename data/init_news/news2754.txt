Last July 4 my family and I went to Long Island to celebrate the holiday with a friend and her family After eating some barbecue a group of us decided to take a walk along the ocean The mood on the beach that day was festive Music from a nearby party pulsed through the haze of sizzling meat Lovers strolled hand in hand Giggling children chased each other along the boardwalkMost of the foot traffic was heading in one direction but then two teenage girls came toward us moving stiffly against the flow both of them looking nervously to their right Hes got a gun one of them said in a low voiceI turned my gaze to follow theirs and was clasping my 4yearold daughters hand when a young man extended his arm and fired off multiple shots along the busy street running parallel to the boardwalk Snatching my daughter up into my arms I joined the throng of screaming revelers running away from the gunfire and toward the waterThe shots stopped as quickly as they had started The man disappeared between some buildings Chest heaving hands shaking I tried to calm my crying daughter while my husband friends and I all looked at one another in breathless disbelief I turned to check on Hunter a high school intern from Oregon who was staying with my family for a few weeks but she was on the phoneSomeone was just shooting on the beach she said between gulps of air to the person on the lineUnable to imagine whom she would be calling at that moment I asked her somewhat indignantly if she couldnt have waited until we got to safety before calling her momNo she said I am talking to the policeMy friends and I locked eyes in stunned silence Between the four adults we hold six degrees Three of us are journalists And not one of us had thought to call the police We had not even considered itWe also are all black And without realizing it in that moment each of us had made a set of calculations an instantaneous weighing of the pros and consAs far as we could tell no one had been hurt The shooter was long gone and we had seen the back of him for only a second or two On the other hand calling the police posed considerable risks It carried the very real possibility of inviting disrespect even physical harm We had seen witnesses treated like suspects and knew how quickly black people calling the police for help could wind up cuffed in the back of a squad car Some of us knew of black professionals whod had guns drawn on them for no reasonThis was before Michael Brown Before police killed John Crawford III for carrying a BB gun in a WalMart or shot down 12yearold Tamir Rice in a Cleveland park Before Akai Gurley was killed by an officer while walking in a dark staircase and before Eric Garner was choked to death upon suspicion of selling loosies Without yet knowing those names we all could go down a list of unarmed black people killed by law enforcementWe feared what could happen if police came rushing into a group of people who by virtue of our skin color might be mistaken for suspectsFor those of you reading this who may not be black or perhaps Latino this is my chance to tell you that a substantial portion of your fellow citizens in the United States of America have little expectation of being treated fairly by the law or receiving justice Its possible this will come as a surprise to you But to a very real extent you have grown up in a different country than I haveAs Khalil Gibran Muhammad author of The Condemnation of Blackness puts it White people by and large do not know what it is like to be occupied by a police force They dont understand it because it is not the type of policing they experience Because they are treated like individuals they believe that if I am not breaking the law I will never be abusedWe are not criminals because we are black Nor are we somehow the only people in America who dont want to live in safe neighborhoods Yet many of us cannot fundamentally trust the people who are charged with keeping us and our communities safeAs protest and revolt swept across the Missouri suburb of Ferguson and demonstrators staged dieins and blocked highways and boulevards from Oakland to New York with chants of Black lives matter many white Americans seemed shocked by the gaping divide between law enforcement and the black communities they are supposed to serve It was no surprise to us For black Americans policing is the most enduring aspect of the struggle for civil rights says Muhammad a historian and director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York It has always been the mechanism for racial surveillance and controlIn the South police once did the dirty work of enforcing the racial caste system The Ku Klux Klan and law enforcement were often indistinguishable Blackandwhite photographs of the era memorialize the way Southern police sicced German shepherds on civil rights protesters and peeled the skin off black children with the force of water hoses Lawmen were also involved or implicated in untold numbers of beatings killings and disappearances of black Southerners who forgot their placeIn the North police worked to protect white spaces by containing and controlling the rising black population that had been propelled into the industrial belt during the Great Migration It was not unusual for Northern police to join white mobs as they attacked black homeowners attempting to move into white neighborhoods or black workers trying to take jobs reserved for white laborers And yet they strictly enforced vagrancy laws catchalls that gave them wide discretion to stop question and arrest black citizens at willMuch has changed since then Much has notLast Fourth of July in a few short minutes as we adults watched the teenager among us talking to the police we saw Hunter become a little more like us her faith a little shaken her place in the world a little less stable Hunter who is biracial and lives with her white mother in a heavily white area had not been exposed to the policing many black Americans face She was about to beOn the phone she could offer only the most generic of suspect descriptions which apparently made the officer on the other end of the line suspicious By way of explanation Hunter told the officer she was just 16 The police called her back once twice then three times asking her for more information The interactions began to feel menacing Im not from here Hunter said Ive told you everything I knowThe fourth time the police called she looked frightened Her interrogator asked her Are you really trying to be helpful or were you involved in this She turned to us her voice aquiver Are they going to come get meSee one of us said trying to lighten the mood Thats why we dont call themWe all laughed but it was hollowMy friend Carla Murphy and I have talked about that day several times since then Weve turned it over in our minds and wondered whether with the benefit of hindsight we should have called 911Carla wasnt born in the United States She came here when she was 9 and back in her native Barbados she didnt give police much thought That changed when she moved into heavily black Jamaica QueensCarla said she constantly saw police often white stopping and harassing passersby almost always black You see the cops all the time but they do not speak to you You see them talking to each other but the only time you ever see them interact with someone is if they are jacking them up she said They are making a choice and it says they dont care about you it tells you they are not here for your people or people who look like you
