GeoEngineering Unlikely to Work Conservation Group Says Posted on Nov 3 2016 By Alex Kirby  Climate News Network Biofilm used in research into carbon capture Doubts persist about geoengineering ENERGYGOV via Wikimedia Commons LONDONThe global watchdog responsible for protecting the world  s wealth of species the UN  s Convention on Biological Diversity CBD has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geoengineering Its bleak conclusion echoing that reached by many independent scientists is that the chances are highly uncertain Novel means in this context describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions by removing them from the atmosphere and altering the amount of heat from the Sun that reaches the Earth Some scientists and policymakers say geoengineering as these strategies are collectively known is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement  This is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2C above their preindustrial levels the Agreements basic goal But the CBD says in a report that geoengineering while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects Many independent analysts have raised similar concernsAttempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans in order to remove GHGs have so far shown disappointing results One report doubted that geoengineering could slow sealevel rise  Another said it could not arrest the melting of Arctic ice  A third study found that geoengineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse  Transboundary impacts The lead author of the CBD geoengineering report is a British scientist Dr Phillip Williamson of the UKs Natural Environment Research Council  He is an associate fellow in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia  UK The CBD originally became involved in climate geoengineering in 2008 because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters The CBDs concern expanded to include other geoengineering techniques especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts Some scientists argue that geoengineering is a hazilydefined term and prefer to speak instead simply of greenhouse gas removal Dr Williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geoengineering on biodiversity is not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties On greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier overshoot of emissions New risks In some cases they say the cure may be worse than the disease The largescale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change When it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation a familiar theme recurs There are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of SRM solar radiation management techniques which could present significant new risks to biodiversity Time and again it seems a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse if SRM benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperatureinduced bleaching as it may in certain conditions it may also increase indirectly the impacts of ocean acidification There could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the Earths protective ozone layer Dr Williamson and his colleagues believe that geoengineering is essentialif it can be made to workbecause of the diminishing chances that anything else will Im sceptical Thats not to say bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is impossible but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible They write It may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2C limit by emission reduction alone However any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing Repeatedly those two words recur a suggested technique or development will be highly uncertain Most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geoengineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation Dr Williamson told the Climate News Network Im sceptical Thats not to say bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is impossible but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible for all sorts of reasons at the scale needed When the CBD member governments meet in December they are expected to call for more research a safe option in most circumstances but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology
