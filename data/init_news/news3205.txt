Unless shes indicted Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nominationThat kind of sentence is rarely written about a major presidential candidate But I dont see a realistic third alternative except for one longshot belowClinton is now hostage to the various investigations  the FBI Congress the courts  of her emails The issue has already damaged her seriously by highlighting once again her congenital inability to speak truthfully When the scandal broke in March she said unequivocally that she did not email any classified material to anyone Thats now been shown to be unequivocally false After all the inspector general of the intelligence community referred her emails to the Justice Department precisely because they contain classified materialThe fallback  every Clinton defense has a fallback  is that she did not mishandle any material marked classified But thats absurd Who could even have been in a position to mark classified something she composed and sent on her own private email systemMoreover whats prohibited is mishandling classified information  not just documents  For example any information learned from confidential conversations with foreign leaders is automatically classified Everyone in national security knows that Reuters has already found 17 emails sent by Clinton containing such born classified information And the State Department has already identified 188 emails on her server that contain classified informationThe truthshaving never stops Take a minor matter her communications with Sidney Blumenthal She originally insisted that these were just unsolicited emails from an old friend Mondays document release showed that they were very much solicited Keep em coming when you can and in large volume  306 emails according to the New York Times Peter Baker more than with any other person apparently outside the State DepartmentThe parallel scandal looming over Clinton is possible corruption involving contributions to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of state There are relatively few references to the foundation in the emails she has released Remember she erased 32000 emails she deemed not workrelated Clinton needs to be asked a straightforward question In sorting your private from public emails were those related to the Clinton Foundation considered workrelated or were they considered private and thus deletedWe are unlikely to get a straight answer from Clinton In fact we may never get the real answer So Clinton marches on regardless Who is to stop herYes Bernie Sanders has risen impressively But it is inconceivable that he would be nominated For one thing hed be the oldest president by far  on Inauguration Day older than Ronald Reagan our oldest president was at his second inauguralAnd there is the matter of Sanders being a selfproclaimed socialist in a country more allergic to socialism than any in the Western world Which is why the party is turning its lonely eyes to joltin Joe BidenBiden who at 72 shares the Democrats gerontocracy problem is riding a wave of deserved sympathy But that melts away quickly when a campaign starts Even now his support stands at only 18percent in the latest Quinnipiac poll For him to win one has to assume that Sanders disappears and Biden automatically inherits Sanders constituencyThats a fantasy modeled on 1968 when Bobby Kennedy picked up Eugene McCarthys antiLyndon Johnson constituency But Joe Biden is no Bobby Kennedy And in a recent Iowa poll Bidens support comes roughly equally from Clinton and Sanders Rather than inheriting the antiClintonite constituency he could instead be splitting itThere is one longshot possibility that might upend Clinton Biden pledges to serve one term only and chooses Elizabeth Warren as his running mate  now Oneterm pledges address the age problem but they are political poison giving the impression of impermanence and mere transition Warren cures that offering the Democratic base  and the Sanders constituency  the vision of a 12year liberal ascendancyWhen asked on Wednesday whether she had discussed such a ticket with Biden Warren answered it was a long conversation a knowing wink in the form of a provocative nondenialI doubt a BidenWarren ticket will happen but it remains the only threat to Clinton outside of some Justice Department prosecutor showing the same zeal in going after Hillary Clinton as the administration did in going after David PetraeusOtherwise the Democrats remain lashed to Clinton Their only hope is that the Republicans selfdestruct in a blaze of intraparty warfare Something for which they are showing an impressive talentRead more from Charles Krauthammers archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
