Megyn Kelly has been none too impressed with Republican presidential candidates reaction to their third primary debate and days long tantrum about the CNBC moderators  after all she did see her own revolt of Fox News viewers following her moderation of the first GOP debate  so on her Wednesday night program Kelly confronted Texas Senator Ted Cruz about his recent demand that future GOP debate moderators strictly be RepublicansMaking clear that he thought the debates so far have been terrific Cruz responded to New Jersey Governor Chris Christies suggestion that Republican presidential candidates stop whining and move on from last weeks debate Cruz said he was happy to debate any of the candidates anywhere and denied that he planned to sign onto a GOP list of demands for future debatesBut then Cruz explained that his only problem with the Republican primary debates has been the fact that they are moderated by what he calls liberalsWhy is it that we have Republican primary debates that are moderated by liberal Democrats Cruz asked repeating the argument he made on Fox News Hannity moments following last weeks CNBC debate I dont think that makes any sense hetold KellyThe one rule change that I think the RNC ought to think about is saying that if you have never in your life voted in a Republican Party primary that you shouldnt be moderating a Republican primary debate Cruz argued Let me challenge you on that Kelly offered Do you have any idea whether Bret Baier or Chris Wallace have ever voted in a Republican primary I have no idea Cruz admitted chucklingly before defending his assertion by revealing the secretthat neither Kelly nor Wallace nor Baier could plausibly be describedas liberals Would we have to submit our voting records to you Kelly shot back after noting that Cruzs proposed rule could potentially box out some Fox News anchors from moderating GOP debates Megynit is not complicated Cruz insisted In a primary dont have liberals moderating Watch Kelly attempt to confrontCruz on his GOP only debate proposal
