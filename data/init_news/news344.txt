The elites in Washington almost uniformly believe Hillary Clinton will be elected president in November The conventional wisdom underlying coverage of 2016 is that Donald Trump will go down in flames and probably take the Republican Senate with himThe presumptive GOP nominee has a welldocumented history of misogyny xenophobia and demagoguery He has alienated women Hispanics Muslims African Americans Asian Americans and Native Americans He has mocked the disabled prisoners of war and Seventhday Adventists The speaker of the House and both living former Republican presidents are withholding endorsementsIt should be a slam dunk for HRC rightBut but but Six months is an eternity in politics and a year ago no one in the chattering class  including me believed Trump had any real shot at becoming the Republican standardbearer With Clinton struggling to sew up the Democratic nomination against a socialist septuagenarian shes expected to lose tomorrows Kentucky primary we cannot foreclose the possibility that she will botch the fall campaign against the billionaire businessmanThe presidency ishers to lose but here are a dozen ways Clinton can snatch defeat from the jaws of victoryRemember the Michigan primary Every poll showed Clinton up double digits but she lost to Bernie Sanders One reason is that supporters and field staffers believed she had it in the bagThe campaign has been using last weeks Quinnipiac polls showing tight races in Ohio Florida and Pennsylvania to shake a greater sense of urgency into donors and activistsClinton is at her worst when she thinks shes at her best She tends to rise to the occasion only when her back is against the wall Remember 2008 Or recall last summer when Sanders looked like nothing more than a nuisance and polls showed her ahead by more than 50 points how she joked about wiping her server clean with a cloth and how her handlers literally used ropes to corral journalists at a parade Over time she found herself neckandneck with Sanders who is a weak candidate by most traditional measures Under heavy pressure in the days before Iowa when it looked like she could lose the caucuses she temporarily became a much better campaigner then backslid after her wins in Nevada and South CarolinaWhen Hillary goes off her carefullyscripted message she has a tendency to gaffe One reason she is expected to lose Kentucky tomorrow is her declaration at a town hall this spring that Were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessDont forget about her other gaffes like when she invoked 911 to defend her coziness with Wall Street when she called Republicans the enemy or when she said she and her husband were dead broke when they left the White House in 2001And there was the time Clinton incensed the gay community by praising the Reagans for starting a national conversation about HIVAIDS prompting a quick retractionClinton cannot just make this election a referendum on Trumpism She must outline a compelling vision for where she wants to take the country to fully activate the coalition that powered Barack ObamaI am not a natural politician in case you havent noticed like my husband or President Obama Clinton said at The Posts debate in MarchThe presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns in prose not poetry And she does not always try to be uplifting in her speechesIts part of the explanation for why so many millennials including young women have spurned her for Bernie While Sanders promises tuitionfree college she talks about extending an obscure tax credit As my colleague David Fahrenthold explained in a story about Clintons wonkiness last week this credit can be worth up to 2500 But only if students find their Form 1098T then fill out the relevant portions of Form 8863 then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of Form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their Form 1040 That is not going to send a thrill up Chris Matthewss legMy colleagues Dan Balz and Anne Gearan spoke with more than a dozen Clinton allies about her biggest weaknesses for a piece on todays front page I bring it down to one thing and one thing only and that is likability said Peter Hart a Democratic pollster who has conducted a series of focus groups for the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania Hart said this is about the lowest bar for a candidate and yet Clinton has lower likability numbers today than she did when the campaign beganBalz and Gearan report that Clinton advisers are working to soften her stiff public image by highlighting her compassion and playing up her problemsolving abilities I mean we cant give her an injection to make her an energetic candidate one longtime Clinton family supporter and donor said on background Read the full piece here5 Moving too far to the rightThe Sanders campaign has circulated stories about Clinton forces reaching out to top Jeb Bush donors to convince them that that she represents their values better than TrumpClinton who used to brag about being aGoldwater Girl in 1964 will be very tempted to appeal aggressively to moderate Republicans who are turned off by Trump On paper the Democrat will actually be more of a hawk and more willing to use military force than the Republican The Donald is all over the place on policy but Clinton is presently to his right on trade and campaign financeShe needs Sanders supporters to unite behind her If it looks like shes shifting rightward to win votes she will look inauthentic and many Bernie people will stay on the sidelines6 Moving too far to the leftClinton has treated Sanders with kid gloves recently She wants him and his people to fall in line after the July convention in Philadelphia and she calculates that antagonizing him is not worth sewing up the nomination earlierThe Vermont senator has made clear he wants significant concessions including very liberal policy planks in the party platform The Clinton people will be inclined to give on a lot because the platform is not binding Just last week for instance she embraced several reforms to the Federal Reserve that are sought by the progressive wing of the partyBut if Hillary continues to lurch leftward to satisfy the Bernie people it will be harder to win those in the middle and woo disaffected RepublicansYou might think its unfair to say Clinton cannot go too far left or too far right But everyone running for president has this problem It is a difficult needle to thread yet the Clintons have proven deft at triangulation Now Hillary needs to be GoldilocksTheres no perfect pick and candidates who look great on paper might turn out to fall flat or have skeletons in their closetCiting four people close to the campaign USA Today reports this morning that Clinton is considering a running mate who could make a direct appeal to supporters of Sanders bridging a generational and political divide and that Clintons chief requirements include a candidates resume and a fighter capable of handtohand combat with Trump The campaigns vetting also prioritizes demographics over someone from a key swing state as she seeks to unify the Democratic voting baseThere are parts of every wouldbe number twos record that will upset at least some portion of the Democratic Party Take this story that just posted on Politico Targeted by progressive activists hoping to kill his chances of being picked as Clintons running mate Julin Castro is set this week to announce changes to whats become a hotbutton Housing and Urban Development program for selling bad mortgages on its books8 Allowing herself to get defined as an insiderClinton lost to Obama in 2008 by underestimating the electorates hunger for change Once again Hillary risks coming to represent the status quo in the eyes of voters who want a renegadeRight now about 6 in 10 Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump But the country is faring even worse  649 percent think we are heading down the wrong track The Posts Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt noted last week in a column warning Democrats not to celebrate Trump So what if even voters who respect Clintons competence reject her as the embodiment of business as usual And what if even voters who do not like Trumps bigotry or bluster care more that he will in their view shake things up  I do have faith in the American voter I really do But when twothirds of the country is unhappy a rational outcome cant be taken for grantedIn trying to stay above the fray Clinton could find herself defined by Trump Remember the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth John Kerry didnt push back forcefully enough early on and he paid a priceLast week Trump called Clinton an enabler of her husbands behavior While objectively offensive the Democratic frontrunner steadfastly refused to respond Im going to let him run his campaign however he chooses she told reporters I have nothing to say about himTrump gives a whole new meaning to term bully pulpit And there is very conventional logic in not responding to every insult and attack it leads to more repetition of the original charge and keeps it in the newsHillary dislikes the media Her impulse is to keep the press away to only give the appearance of access and to focus her attention on friendly outlets that will engage in pufferyTrump to his credit talks to basically everyone It gets him in trouble like when he told Chris Matthews that women who get abortions should be punished But the tradeoff is that he has often gotten to set the terms of the debate If he repeats something enough times however preposterous some may come to believe itI have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak Hillary recently said on CNN A few days later she clarified on MSNBC that she was not referring to her husband but Rick Lazio and Vladimir PutinThe former president has caused fewer headaches for his wifes campaign than he did in 2008 when he called Obamas bid the biggest fairy tale Ive ever seen said the other side was playing the race card and downplayed a loss in South Carolina by noting Jesse Jackson Jr had won there tooThat does not mean he has not ruined news cycles for his wife in 2016 or has the ability toRemember his outburst on the eve of the New Hampshire primary when he accused Sanders of being dishonest and his supporters of being sexistOr when he got into an onstage argument with Black Lives Matter protesters in Philadelphia last month defending his crime bill and his wifes 1996 comment about bringing superpredators  to heel The next day he said I almost want to apologize But then didntThe campaign must manage WJC appropriately Its hard to control any spouse a former president  especially The Big Dog  is even harderTrump will try to make Hillary own all the unpopular elements of the Clinton era Expect to hear a lot about Marc Richs pardon and the Lincoln BedroomHillary will take credit for the popular elements of her husbands tenure and take umbrage when Trump tries to pin the unpopular parts on her as she already has with the crime bill and Wall Street deregulationClinton is not widely seen as trustworthy Her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches at Goldman Sachs will continue to dog her Asked during a debate why she received 675000 for three short appearances she replied Well I dont know Thats what they offeredBut Trumps refusal to release his tax returns along with his evolving answers and lame excuses neutralizesthis potential problem for the Clinton campaignIt is unlikely but the FBI investigation into Clintons possible mishandling of classified information hangs like a cloud over her campaignInvestigators have found scant evidence tying Clinton to criminal wrongdoing although they are still working on the case and charges have not been ruled out my colleague Ellen Nakashimareported last week They have also been interviewing former aides to Clinton including Cheryl Mills who served as chief of staff while Clinton was secretary of state Prosecutors and FBI agents hope to be able to interview Clinton as they try to wrap up the investigationAmong other potential problems identified by supporters in Balz and Gearans story today Clintons unpopularity with white men questions about whether her family philanthropic foundation helped donors and friends and lingering clouds from her tenure at the State Department including  the Benghazi attacks in which four Americans were killed and her support for military intervention in Libya Dont forget history is not on Hillarys side Since World War II only once has a party controlled the White House for three consecutive terms George HW Bush succeeded Ronald Reagan by beating Mike Dukakis in 1988 Bottom line Clinton is more likely than not to be president at this time next year but the election will probably be closer than you think and Trump could actually win if she doesnt play her cards right President Obama delivered an aggressive refutation of Trumpismduring his commencement address at Rutgers University calling on graduates to reject politicians who hark back to better days From Greg Jaffe He mocked Trumps call to Make America Great Again saying that there was never a better time to be alive on the planet and in America College graduation rates were up he said Crime rates had dropped and more women were in the workplace than ever before in the countrys history  He also slammed Trumps proposal to build a wall along the countrys southern border saying the world is becoming ever more interconnected and building walls wont change that At one point clearly referring to Trump and other congressional Republicans who have decried efforts to combat global warming Obama warned that In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue Thats not challenging political correctnessThats just not knowing what you are talking about Obama is expected to begin campaigning for Clinton in earnest as early as June when she is expected to lock up the nomination Balz and Gearan report Trump and Vice President Biden both went to the University of Pennsylvanias commencement ceremony yesterday David Weigel was there For Trump the ceremony was all about Tiffany Trump his daughter with exwife Marla Maples who also attended the commencement Biden was there for his granddaughter Naomi Biden the first of the familys third generation to graduate from college  When some unexpected rain fell Trump disappeared beneath an umbrella while Biden kept shaking handsMORE ON THE REPUBLICAN RACE A band of exasperated Republicansis actively plotting to draft an independent presidential candidate to keep Trump from the White House BUT those involved concede that such an effortat this late stage is probably futile Philip Rucker and Robert Costa These GOP figures are commissioning private polling lining up major funding sources and courting potential contenders  The effort has been sporadic all spring but has intensified significantly in the 10 days since Trump effectively locked up the Republican nomination But these Republicans  including Mitt Romneycommentators William Kristol and Erick Erickson and strategists Mike Murphy Stuart Stevens and Rick Wilson  are so repulsed by the prospect of Trump as commander in chief that they are desperate to take action and they think they have only a couple of weeks to launch a credible bidTheir top recruits are Sen Ben Sasse who denies interestand former presidential candidate John Kasich who today willgive his first TV interview since dropping out Earlier prospects included former Sen Tom Coburn Condoleezza Rice and even realitytelevision star and businessman Mark CubanMany dismissed the idea as political fantasy Again and again though these antiTrump Republicans have heard the same tepid response I dont see it happeningCuban wrote in an emailA potential thirdparty candidate faces enormous risk No one wants to be the next Ralph NaderThe career of the individual would come to an end and he would have a difficult spot in history for being responsible for putting Clinton in the White Housesaid Patrick J BuchananThereare alsoformidable logistical hurdles with deadlines to get on state ballots fast approachingSpoiler alert Some antiTrump Republicans are downsizing their ambitions to a more focused statespecific effort MikeMurphy who ran the Jeb Bush super PACis pushing one such proposal Murphy envisions an independent candidate on what he termed an honorable mission in Colorado New Hampshire and Ohio  three battleground states with relatively lax ballotaccess rulesRunning an antiTrump protest candidate in a handful of swing states really appeals to meMurphy said You could deny Trump the presidency and perhaps help important Senate and other downballot races by giving another choice to Republican voters who abhor Hillary Clinton and cant cross the moral line to vote for Trump Reince Priebus said drafting a thirdparty candidate to run against Trump would be a suicide mission that could wreck the party for generations They can try to hijack another party and get on the ballot but look its a suicide mission for our country because what it means is that youre throwing down not just eight years of the White House but potentially 100 years on the Supreme Court and wrecking this country for many generations the RNC chairmansaid on Fox News Sunday I think its very dangerous and theres other ways to get assurances on the things that theyre worried about Priebus praised the approach taken by Paul Ryan adding that he would be surprised if Ryan did not endorse Trumpsoon Id be surprised if we didnt get there not too much longer in the distant future Meanwhile

Japanese in a cablenews appearance saying that he was trying to critique the uninformed views that Trump espouses From Paul Kane King who supports Trump nominally but is refusing to campaign for him said that his use of the word Japs was meant to criticize the presidential candidates policy positions as out of line with the nuance required to be the leader of the free world and more in line with a workingclass man at the end of a bar espousing his worldview Is Ben Carson the worst or the best surrogate of all time Yes By Ben Terris Ben Carson the neurosurgeon turned presidential candidate turned unfiltered pitchman for Trump now part of his vice presidential search committee sat in the back of a town car with his wife Candy He had just explained that he wanted no role in a Trump administration when news arrived of a new poll naming him as the bestliked of a list of potential running mates The most favorably regarded contenders after himself he was told were John Kasich Marco Rubio Ted Cruz Sarah Palin and Chris Christie Those are all people on our list he said That the Trump campaign might want its potential VP picks held close to the vest didnt seem to occur to Carson Hes not the type to keep his candid thoughts to himselfCarson says he has no plan to pull a Dick Cheney and suggest himself Carson understands hes a lightning rod for controversy and Trump doesnt need help sparking fires Hes not interested said business manager Armstrong Williams And then But miracles can happen  weve seen stranger things right Yes yes we have Not the least of which has been

primaries From Vanessa Williams and Scott Clement African Americans account for a larger share of Democratic primary voters than they did in 2008 but that is because of OLDER black voters Comparing exit polls in 25 states from 2008 and 2016 black voters older than 45 grew from 12 percent of the electorate on average in 2008 to 16 percent this year In those same states black voters younger than 45 made up 11 percent of voters in 2008 vs 10 percent this yearPresident Obama in his commencement address last weekend at Howard University praised young black activists for bringing new energy to the movement for racial justice and equality but he said You have to have a strategy Not just awareness but action Not just hashtags but votes Obamas comments echoed continuing concerns that some young black activists involved in the current wave of political action do not share the belief in the critical importance of the right to voteYounger Americans are the least likely to turn out in

enthusiastic about the value of voting particularly in this years presidential election cycle These activists argued that neither candidate had adequately addressed the issues affecting black

Newt Gingrich again said hes open to being Trumps runningmate I dont think its an automatic yes Gingrich said on Fox News Sunday But Id be hardpressed not to say yes The former Speaker suggested his

Little Cranberry an island of 70 inhabitants and China a nation of 14 billion people increasingly find themselves connected by the shifting currents of the world economy The rise of Chinas middle class has coincided with a boom in Maines lobster population resulting in a voracious new market for the crustaceans succulent sweet meat Exports of lobsters to China nonexistent a decade ago totaled
