According to a report Attorney General Loretta Lynch advised FBI Director James Comey to not send a letter to Congress that would inform them of new emails the agency discovered in their investigation of Hillary Clinton s illegal email server The New Yorker reported  On Friday James Comey  the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation acting independently of Attorney General Loretta Lynch sent a letter to Congress saying that the FBI had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton s private server Coming less than two weeks before the Presidential election Comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Clinton was contrary to the views of the Attorney General according to a wellinformed Administration official Lynch expressed her preference that Comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election  but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise Comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the Department of Justice according to current and former federal legal officials Comey who is a Republican appointee of President Obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections You dont do this one former senior Justice Department official said Its aberrational It violates decades of practice The reason according to the former official who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate even though theres no finding by a court or in this instance even an indictment In the letter that Comey sent to staffers  he expressed that he was under an obligation to inform the peoples representatives of the finding Of course we dont ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed Comey wrote I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record At the same time however given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails I dont want to create a misleading impression he added In trying to strike that balance in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season there is significant risk of being misunderstood What I dont get or maybe I really do is that Comey would not recommend charges against Clinton when he knew for a fact that she broke federal law and had the evidence in hand to prove it So dont be deceived by this recent opening of the Clinton probe into her email crimes  Nothing is going to come of it because all of these people are in bed together and they are merely putting on a show for the American people Mark my words Dont forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook  Google Plus   Twitter  You can also get Freedom Outpost delivered to your Amazon Kindle device here  shares
