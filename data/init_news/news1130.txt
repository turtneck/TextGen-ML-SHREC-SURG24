Voting Machines   Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  by Edmund Kozak  Updated 24 Oct 2016 at 521 PM  Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state The UKbased Smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona Smartmatic Chairman Mark MallochBrown is a former UN official and sits on the board of Soros Open Society Foundations Since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from Smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the Sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in US elections If MallochBrowns Soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic Why then had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50000 voting machines for US elections

BREAKING HillaryClintons EMail Server Company Got Almost 1 Million In Govt Loans After Wiping EMails   OCTOBER 26 2016  BY CHARLES C JOHNSON 6 COMMENTS  Give it up already Its over K J Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story Hillary Clintons email server company got almost 1 million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe Hillary Clintons name from her emails Platte River Networks PRN got a 493000 loan from the Small Business Administration in August 2014 and another 350000 loan in September 2015 Public government data available as USAspendinggov The first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after PRN employee Paul Combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at Hillarys request in July 2014  The second 350000 loan came about one year later You wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media Keep the GotNews mission alive donate at GotNewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom If youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom After getting the first loan PRN moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo The head of the Small Business Administration is Maria ContrerasSweet  a Mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by Barack Obama two months before Hillarys PRN got the first loan WikiLeaks leaks have proven Hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme GotNews has shined a light on how Hillary gets favors from Hispanic and Democratic government bureaucrats before  Did Hillary Clinton pay her email server company Platte River Networks PRN with almost 1 million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them It sure looks like it A Freedom of Information Act FOIA request has been lodged for more information Stay tuned for more K J Gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story WHY BILL CLINTONS 26 TRIPS ON THE LOLITA EXPRESS CHILD RAPE JET MATTER May 15 2016  Daniel Greenfield   We dont know what Bill Clinton did or didnt do in company with Jeffrey Epstein But we certainly know what Epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  Some of the most shocking allegations against Epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an FBI probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three 12yearold French girls were delivered to him as a birthday present But the feds did identify roughly 40 young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to Epsteins Palm Beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the Balkan sex slave Epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just 14 More recently a big cash payment from Mail on Sunday coaxed one of Epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy This victim Virginia Roberts produced a photo of herself with Prince Andrew in 2001 and reported that Epstein paid her 15000 to meet the prince Then 17 years old she claims that she was abused by Epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of 15 Sex crimes of the kind Roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of 10 to 20 years in federal prison Yet when all was said and done Epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the Palm Beach jail and was granted a 16hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work In short Epstein was never actually in jail During his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his New York City place to his private island At least one of Epsteins victims claimed to have met Bill Clinton And it turns out that Bill Clinton was a much more regular passenger on the Lolita Express Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the Lolita Express  even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by FoxNewscom Clintons presence aboard Jeffrey Epsteins Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including Tatiana The trickedout jet earned its Nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls It doesnt help that the Democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting Epstein a pass on child rape that Bill Clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the Clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money Either way weve come a long way from Gary Hart being bounced for Monkey Business to Bill Clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it Social conservatives often get a bad rap But there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window What did Bill Clinton actually do Who knows More importantly these days who cares ABOUT DANIEL GREENFIELD Daniel Greenfield a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam For sure defence counsel have made much of Taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer Whats not in dispute is that Taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of prostitutes lured to the Pickton farm contemptuous of both sextrade workers especially street walkers and drug addicts Shes pure evil says one outreach worker who asked that her name not be used in any story about Taylor  Court has heard that Taylors DNA was found on 113 items retrieved from the Pickton property  including handcuffs condoms clothing syringes  and also on items that belonged to some victims  Brenda Wolfes lipstick Mona Wilsons rosary One witness Pickton pal Pat Casanova told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as Angel whod been brought to the farm by Taylor He said he gave the money to Taylor who shared some of it with Angel Another witness Gina Houston put Taylor on the same bed with victim Sereena Abotsway in Picktons trailer In his lengthy police interview Pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with Taylor On the stand Houston recounted a conversation shed had with Pickton about Taylor shortly before his arrest Willie told me that he believed she Taylor would do the right thing when she came back That she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for Source Jeff Wells points to other odd things A week or so ago a man called Steve Remian committed suicidebycop but The name Steve Remian surfaced at the Robert Willie Pickton murder trial in New Westminster BC last March when jurors were told that Remians name  with a Burnaby BC address  was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in Picktons workshop In April jurors heard further evidence that DNA testing on two hairs found on a Hudsons Bay blanket removed from Picktons motorhome linked one to Pickton and the other to a Steve Remian A source involved in the Oakville shooting investigation told the Star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in Oakville but had been acquitted although a coaccused was convicted Source It does seem like a regular hive of activity Robert Picktons pig farm was a constant buzz of activity with people and vehicles coming and going all the time a woman who lived in Picktons trailer for a time testified on Wednesday Tanya Carr 35 told the jury in Picktons murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the Port Coquitlam BC farm and it wasnt unusual for people to show up late at night looking for Pickton or his brother Dave Source Also there are those Hells Angels and the Piggy Palace It was a rough crowd at Piggys Palace said Brian a musician who played there a few years ago with the hardrock band South City Slam The nightclub he said was inside an old building on a property Dave Pickton and his brother Robert own at 2552 Burns Rd near their pig farm on Dominion Road in Port Coquitlam Even the women were tough looking  a lot of leather and denim It wasnt a cocktailgown kind of place  he recalled Brian who didnt want his last name used recalled that there was a coatcheck girl and a sign saying Check your knives and other weapons at the door  The crowd at Piggys Palace often included men wearing Hells Angels biker club colours They were there a lot said Brian The people who came all seemed to know one another  Super Serco bulldozes ahead  By DAILY MAIL REPORTER UPDATED 2300 GMT 1 September 2004 SERCO has come a long

developing solutions procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making Table Top Exercises These involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line either in realtime or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise Tabletop exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations CommandControl Post Exercises These are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping Ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations and using their communications and information systems Feeling lucky Punk  This could include a mix of locations and varying levels of technical simulation support The Gold Standard system is flexible to allow the tempo and intensity to be adjusted to ensure maximum training benefit or to fully test and evaluate the most important aspects of a plan Such exercises also test information flow communications equipment procedures decision making and coordination Live Exercises These can range from testing individual components of a system or organisation through to a fullscale rehearsal They are particularly useful where there are regulatory requirements or with highrisk situations They are more complex and costly to organise and deliver but can be integrated with Command Post Exercises as part of a wider exercising package  Christopher Rajendran Hyman CBE born 5 July 1963 in Durban South Africa1 was Chief Executive of Serco Group plc from 2002 to October 20132  On graduation he worked for Arthur Andersen In 1989 he won an 18month exchange with Ernst  Young in London who employed him after four months1 Head hunted in 1994 by Serco  Hyman became European finance director and in 1999 was made group finance director In 2002 Hyman became chief executive  Hyman resigned from his role of Chief Executive of Serco on 25 October 2013 following allegations that Serco had overcharged government customers  He was making a

Developments in PKI occurred in the early 1970s at the British intelligence agency GCHQ  where James Ellis  Clifford Cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution 19  However as developments at GCHQ are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mid1990s The public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by Diffie Hellman  Rivest Shamir  and Adleman changed secure communications entirely With the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the Internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting Assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used With the invention of the World Wide Web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute Commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient Taher Elgamal and others at Netscape developed the SSL protocol https in Web URLs it included key establishment server authentication prior to v3 oneway only and so on A PKI structure was thus created for Web userssites wishing secure communications Vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability An American Bar Association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of PKI operations see ABA digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several US states Utah being the first in 1995 and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations Consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others The enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting PKI schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be By the first few years of the 21st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly Operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required The standards that existed were insufficient PKI vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mid1990s and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated20 PKIs have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others PKI has had the most success in government implementations the largest PKI implementation to date is the Defense Information Systems Agency DISA PKI infrastructure for the Common Access Cards program  Base One Technologies  Corporate Strategy  We are a Government Certified WomenOwned Business   We practice Diversity
