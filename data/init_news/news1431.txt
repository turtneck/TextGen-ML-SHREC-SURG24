were looted and hundreds of people were arrestedI understand that everybody is upset I understand that tension is brewing  Im here I get it Harper said But there are better ways that we can handle our frustration And they cant hear us when were behaving this wayFixing it will require more investment in cities criminal justice reform better funding for education and soulsearching for some police departments he saidIf we really want to solve the problem if our society really wanted to solve the problem we could Its just it would require everybody saying this is important this is significant And that we dont just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns the President saidStill no angst can excuse what Obama called the behavior of criminals and thugs who tore up BaltimoreWhen individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot theyre not protesting Theyre not making a statement Theyre stealing he said When they burn down a building theyre committing arson And theyre destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities That robs jobs and opportunity from people in that areaNo repeat of Monday night governor saysProtesters rallied

Hopkins University Baltimore City Public Schools will reopen on WednesdaySeeing my city like this breaks my heart But like so many Baltimoreans my resolve is strong the mayor tweeted We will not let these deplorable and cowardly acts of violence ruin OurCityMeanwhile citizens young and old are stepping up They include people who came out to clean up like Harper and 15yearold Sulaiman AbdulAziz who said he saw some of the mayhemI felt disappointed AbdulAziz said because a lot of that could have been avoided if people would have started thinking before they would have done all that stuffWere talking about years and decades of mistrust of misfortune of despair that its just coming out in anger Scott said No it is not right for them to burn down their own city But that is whats coming out of these young peopleAt least 20 officers were wounded in the unrest according to Capt Kowalczyk One person is in critical condition as a result of a fire he saidIts clear that what we have to do is change the culture within the Baltimore Police Department Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said Tuesday The process has been underway for more than two years but there is more to do he saidDeray McKeeson a community organizer who was active in Ferguson and is now in Baltimore said that while he doesnt condone using destruction and violence he understands it as a way some vent frustrations Broken windows are not broken spines he saidMcKeeson said the Baltimore vandalism even the injuries to some officers doesnt compare to the lost lives of Gray and other blacks at the hands of police Thats why he said protesters will remain out in full force rallying against what they see as systemic injusticePolice have continued to kill people the activist said Tonight will be another night where people come out into the streets to confront a system that is corruptThere were many other secondary casualties  people who saw their neighborhoods torn apart their homes and vehicles damaged their hopes for stability and progress thwarted by the mayhemThere were people like Cindy Oxendine who took to the streets to sweep up rocks glass and more despite her aching backIt started off peaceful and it ends up like this Oxendine told CNN affiliate WBAL Ive seen stuff like this on the news in other cities but I never thought I would see it in front of my doorstep Its crazyIn addition to the clashes with police came the flames and investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives are joining local authorities to look into arson a federal law enforcement source saidThe same source said that dozens of fires that erupted around Baltimore appear to be tied to the unrest This includes one that consumed an affordable housing center for seniors that was just months away from openingPastor Donte Hickman of the Southern Baptist Church which owns the facility said 60 units of senior housing were lostWhat happened  destroyed so much of the progress that the people who actually live here have been working for said Mayor RawlingsBlake calling Monday a very dark day for our cityBut she found light in what she saw TuesdayToday I think we saw a lot more of what Baltimore is about We saw people coming together to reclaim our city to clean our city and to help heal our city I think this can be our defining moment the mayor said
