John White may be the silvertongued boy wonder of the school reform movement lauded for his political acumen and often mentioned as a future US secretary of education But last fall Louisianas whipsmart and occasionally cantankerous education superintendent found himself on a lonely mission driving his stateissued Prius along the Bayou States twolane highways stopping at churches schools and Chamber of Commerce meeting halls promoting the embattled Common Core learning standards to a state whose governor no longer wants themAs rain pounded down outside Scott Middle School in Lafayette White in khakis and a navy blazera uniform reminiscent of his prep school dayslooked like he was gaining ground Buoyant and selfassured he told a gaggle of local reporters that the standards were going forward just fine and praised a math lesson he had just witnessed insideIm going to tell everyone I meet with that I just saw 25 sixthgraders knock it out of the park on the Common Core standards he boomedMeanwhile back in Baton Rouge Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal who once praised the standards as a way to raise expectations for every child was denouncing them and taking potshots at White Thats the same White who was appointed by the state board of education in 2012after much Jindal lobbyingto roll out a roster of education initiatives among them yes the Common CoreToday White once called Jindals boy by political insiders is the governors most celebrated public enemy and a statewide education reform initiative years in the making may end up falling by the wayside adding chaos and confusion to Louisianas already beleaguered school systemAll this could easily be chalked up as an onlyinLouisiana tussle to be expected in a state whose education system is near rock bottom and whose political brawls have a tradition of being both colorful and callous But this battle is bigger than Louisiana Across the country the Common Core standards a set of rigorous K12 English and math benchmarks designed to improve the state of the nations schools have become increasingly divisive Sponsored by the National Governors Association and state education chiefs they were voluntarily adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia starting in 2010 But the standards have since become red meat for everyone from Tea Party activists who cry government overreach to lefty soccer moms who rail against their corporate approach The pushback is pitting political allies who came together years ago to support the standards against each other And it is seriously undermining the power and persuasion of the nations education reformers who have long seen the standards as the crown jewel of their national efforts to improve American public schoolsWhether the 39yearold White can squash the rebellion in his own state is no small matter It may well indicate whether other progressive reformersless politically skilled than hehave any shot at salvaging the standards in their own states and whether Louisiana and other lowperforming states really have the stomach for widespread school reform after allThe ailing state of Louisianas public school system was once an unfortunate but accepted reality Parents who could afford to send their kids to private and parochial schools did Those who could not suffered through the spotty and unreliable public system often holding their nosesThat all changed in the 1980s when the state got badly burned by the now infamous oil bust Oil and gas revenues counted for as much as 41 percent of the states budget in 1981 and when the industry faltered the state nearly went bankrupt To reignite the economy government heavies knew they needed to diversify But they soon discovered that the states bottomofthe barrel education ranking was a billboard sign telling corporate America that Louisiana had a dearth of qualified workers Fixing the schoolsand fastbecame everybodys goalIn fits and starts and with some backward movement Louisiana began overhauling its community college system increased teacher pay rolled out new K12 testing regimes and eventually took over failing schools closing some and turning others into chartersThe blow from Katrina in 2005 reinforced the improveschools urgency as dozens of flailing schools in New Orleans were shuttered by the storm and media outlets flocked to the city shining a discomfiting light on their subpar quality That helped drive even more legislative support for charter school expansion and a more defined teacher evaluation system which Jindal helped push through in 2010A lot of these measures were spurred on by George W Bushs 2002 No Child Left Behind act which strongarmed states into passing reform bills But they were also the result of careful bond building between Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as disparate lobbying groupsfrom big business to civil rights activists Traditionally on opposite sides of the aisle and sometimes openly hostile toward each other they were now in alliance longtime foes suddenly together in their efforts to better educate Louisianas neediest students many of them AfricanAmericansLane Grigsby a Republican and the founder of a wellknown construction firm here says he stood behind these measures because youve gotta have educated kids for the workforce Standing with him were social justice leaders like Kenneth L Campbell president of the Black Alliance for Educational Options who calls education reform an equity issueBut despite the acrosstheaisle handholding and the sheer boldness of many of these measures they fell short on many counts From 1990 to 2010 the states education ranking didnt budge much And in 2010 the states college readiness score was still trailing behind the national averageThe grand hope for the Common Core adopted by the state board of education in 2010 and first introduced to schools in 2011 was that it wasnt punitive or piecemeal like many of the states earlier efforts Instead it was an ambitious and unambiguous road map outlining the skills and knowledge every student ought to have at the end of each year And because it asked every teacher in the state to present material that was more rigorous than what had been taught before many thought it might have the curative effect these other measures had notBut it was also just one partalbeit a large oneof the states education reform agenda And in the beginning it was shrouded in limited controversy seen as the best way to finally boost Louisianas sour education reputationJohn White arrived on the scene in the spring of 2011 just as the standards were first appearing in schools Recruited from New York to run Louisianas Recovery School District a reformbacked postKatrina effort White was widely perceived as a shining star of the progressive reform movement one of many young ambitious intellectuals who had been dispatched to outposts around the country to battle what they saw as the movements most pernicious enemy low expectationsBut from the onset White who has degrees from the University of Virginia and DCs tony prep school St Albans seemed more politically astute than many of his allies There was the brash Michelle Rhee who had gotten famously booed out of Washington the beleaguered Newark Superintendent Cami Anderson who by the summer of 2011 was struggling mightily to contain critics of her charter school expansion plans and Los Angeles John Deasy who was ousted last fallYes Whites rsum read like a near carbon copy of these likeminded reformers with stints in Teach for America Eli Broads education leadership academy and Joel Kleins New York City Department of Education But White had a roster of other line items to recommend him While in New York he had risen fast helping to roll out some of the districts most innovative tech initiatives He was often dispatched to the Upper East Side to appease parents enraged by overcrowding and the South Bronx to sooth those distraught over the shuttering of their childrens failing schools He was quickwitted goodlooking and when he wanted to be charming Further the word on the street was Klein one of the movements gurus loved him  This is not to say that White did not have his critics In 2011 during his time in New Orleans running the states Recovery School District he was sued by three fired principals At the same time the state was involved in a protracted lawsuit in what eventually became a classaction lawsuit with 7500 school employees laidoff after Katrina And he was frequently attacked by parents and educators who said he bulldozed through his education agenda items without consulting the people most impacted by them It is a claim he fiercely deniesBut even then his enemies recognized his political might The head of the state teachers union told me last fall that White excelled at behindthecurtains work to the point of being autocratic suggesting Whites enemies hated him for the same reason his allies liked him so much He was dogged about getting what he wanted
