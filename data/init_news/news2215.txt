Does anyone like Trump as a person  The answer in No Its not about that it never was This is about a giant middle finder to the DC Establishment As a Citizen we only have one way to express our displeasure with DC We are as divided as Ive ever seen This is not acceptable If young people cant open businesses we have failed them They cant Trump is a tool we need for real change He blew up the GOP Our friends on the other side wanted Bernie But it was rigged against Bernie Now you are going to support the very person who rigged your Primary You almost blew up the DNC but the job is not complete We can not hand this crap to our younger generation We will not Only a billionaire can get this far on his own He will be checked by Congress Join us in giving the middle finger to the slave masters controlling our future This Country belongs to us Not a handful of wealthy families This isnt about Trump Hes a tool in more ways than one This is about cutting restraints and letting the American People go At least thats the way I see it
