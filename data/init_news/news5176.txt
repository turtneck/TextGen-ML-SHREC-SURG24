On 23 September 1952 vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon gave a speech laying out everything I have earned everything I have spent and everything I ownHe concluded by challenging the Democratic candidate for president Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson to do the same Governor Stevenson took the challenge one step further releasing his personal tax returns  the clearest account of an individuals income for the yearThe move was not reciprocated by Nixon or his running mate for president Dwight EisenhowerTwo decades later though at the height of the Watergate scandal and under audit by the US tax authority  the Internal Revenue Service IRS  thenPresident Nixon made his tax returns public in hopes of clearing the airThe move did not work but it set a precedent for making tax filings publicIts proof you have nothing to hide says Joe Thorndike a tax historian at Tax AnalystDonald Trump says he needs no such proofClaiming to face his own audit the presumptive Republican nominee has refused to release his tax returns even as public pressure mounts for him to do soEvery US presidential candidate since 1976 has released their tax returns but there is no law requiring itMr Trumps refusal to release them has led to mounting speculation about what he could possibly be hidingTax returns are sort of black and white and you sign your name to say this is accurate Its not open to interpretation says Mr ThorndikeThe first thing the public would find is what tax rate Mr Trump pays The candidate has bragged about paying a very low tax rate and taking advantage of the complex US tax code with its many loopholesMr Trump is proud to pay a lower tax rate the lowest tax rate possible one of his top aides has saidAn investigation by the Telegraph newspaper found Mr Trump was involved with a deal to evade 20m 135m in US taxesIts possible his returns may hold similar bombshells but Mr Trumps admission that he does his best to avoid taxes will likely make these less explosiveOne line of thinking has it that the returns would give a better sense of how much Mr Trump is worth The New York billionaire has given several different figures for his net worth which have all been higher than estimates by financial experts and publications like Forbes magazineBut discovering whether Mr Trump is inflating his net worth may not be as easy as some hope from his tax returnsTax forms focus on income for the year not total worthIt may be possible to tell how much income Donald Trump made in a given year but the complex way his companies earn money will still make this difficult US real estate professionals can take tax losses based on the depreciation and other expenses for their buildings This could allow Mr Trump to report having less income and therefore place him in a lower tax bracketWhile we may not get an exact number for Mr Trumps wealth it is likely the returns would give a more detailed picture of his businessesThe forms would show how much profit and loss the companies he owns distributed to him in a year It would not give a full account of the worth of those businesses because not all profit is distributed to the owners  some is put back in to grow the business  but it would give a sense of the activityOne thing a tax return would definitely show is how much Mr Trump gives to charityMr Trump claims to give millions to charitable causes and organisations if true his tax form would prove that Americans are allowed to deduct charitable donations of over 250 170 from their tax bill If the real estate mogul donated as much as he claimed it should appear on his tax deductions formMr Trump has said he will release the returns after the audit but doing so before would hurt his interaction with the IRSA person is not prohibited from releasing their tax returns during an audit  President Nixon was facing an audit when he released his  but many tax professionals do advise against itEveryone is going to look at them and find something suspicious If the statute of limitations is open the IRS might feel pressured to do an audit says Robert Kovacev from the law firm SteptoeThe IRS has three years in most cases to decide whether to audit a person Mr Trump claims to have faced audits on a continuing basis for nearly a decadeBut others argue Mr Trump would have to be particularly unlucky or bad at filing his taxes to come under the IRSs microscope so oftenThe IRS uses a computer program which scores tax filings If there are a number of unusual signals on a particular form it is then evaluated by a human who decides whether to do an auditIndividuals who are audited are also typically given a pass in the following year if the same issues are flagged by the computer because IRS officials have already looked into themAs audits can take months and even years Mr Trumps tax returns may not be made public until after the election  if at allThe bombastic candidate has bucked most political precedents until now and its possible releasing his tax returns could be yet another
