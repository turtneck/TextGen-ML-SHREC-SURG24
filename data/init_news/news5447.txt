President Obama uttered more than 3600 words on the stage of Washingtons Marriott Wardman Park ballroom on Tuesday but his message could be summed up in three You wouldnt dareHe was speaking not to the hundreds of hospital administrators assembled for the Catholic Health Associations conference but to five men not in the room the conservative justices of the Supreme Court who in the next 21 days will declare whether they are invalidating the most farreaching legislation in at least a generation because of one vague clause tucked in its 2000 pagesObamas appeal to the justices devotees of judicial modesty all Do they really wish to cause the massive societal upheaval that would come from killing a law that is now a routine part of American lifeFive years in what we are talking about is no longer just a law Its no longer just a theory It isnt even just about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare he said This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another This is health care in AmericaWithout mentioning the looming decision Obama warned of its devastating potential Once you see millions of people having health care once you see that all the bad things that were predicted didnt happen youd think that itd be time to move on he said It seems so cynical to want to take coverage away from millions of people to take care away from the people who need it the most to punish millions with higher costs of care and unravel whats now been woven into the fabric of AmericaThe appearance had been scheduled long ago but White House officials elevated the importance of the speech to keep pressure on the Supreme Court which Obama said at a news conference in Germany on Monday shouldnt have even taken up the case Obama said trashing the federal healthcare exchanges as a hostile Supreme Court ruling would do is not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four wordsThe conservative justices like conservative critics of the law generally are unlikely to be persuaded by Obamas recitation of the merits of the law which he repeated at length Tuesday But they may well be reluctant to upend a law that now has broad acceptance in American societyThe Kaiser Family Foundation which tracks public opinion on the matter found in April that more Americans had a favorable view of the law than an unfavorable view 43percent to 42 percent for the first time since 2012 That difference is not statistically significant but the favorable view is up 10 points since the botched HealthCaregov rollout in 2013 and the unfavorable view is down seven points Fortysix percent favor keeping the law as is or expanding it compared with 41percent who favor scaling it back or repealing itMore evidence of the acceptance of Obamacare Health care is fading as an issue Gallup found last month that only 5percent called it the countrys most important problem That compares with 26percent in September 2009Certainly those numbers could change if premiums jump as expected But the recent improvement in the laws standing comes even though most Americans arent aware that the law has cost the government less than forecastWith such broad acceptance of if not fondness for the new healthcare status quo its difficult to imagine the Supreme Court justices taking away health coverage for 6million or 7million Americans causing costs to skyrocket for millions of others and likely plunging the entire American healthcare system into chaos Thats not just judicial activism  it would be a judicially induced cataclysmSuch a cataclysm has no place in the catechism of Sister Carol Keehan head of the Catholic Health Association and a key early supporter of Obamacare who broke with the Catholic bishops to support the lawIt would be unspeakably cruel she said when I asked her after the conference Tuesday what an adverse Supreme Court ruling would produce Millions of people  pregnant women cancer victims heart patients  would lose coverage she said The panic is going to spread the confusion Its going to be incredibly chaotic And with Congress unable to agree even on little things the chaos would persistIt makes me crazy just to think of it Keehan said urging me to light a candle as the justices prepare their opinionIll leave the votive offering to Sister Carol I have faith that the conservative justices even if they detest Obamacare have no wish to throw the country into chaosRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
