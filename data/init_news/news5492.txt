WASHINGTON  In their ongoing efforts to roll back or hamstring Obamacare Republicans probably werent hoping that the first Senate hearing on the matter this year would feature a selfdescribed democratic socialist getting GOP witnesses to back a key argument for universal health careThursdays hearing of the Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions was devoted to the question of moving the fulltime work standard under the Affordable Care Act from 30 hours a week to 40 hours and whether more workers would be hurt by the higher or lower limitBut to Sen Bernie Sanders IVt who has long supported the creation of a universal health care system battling over that particular point began to seem absurd and he opened his remarks by noting that in every other developed country such a debate would make no sense at allThe argument of whether you provide health insurance to people who work 30 hours a week or whether they work 40 hours a week  whoa Sanders said In every major country on Earth health care is a right of all peopleWith that as his premise he then asked three of the hearings witnesses  two business owners and a school superintendent  whether their lives and daily endeavors would be improved if government lifted from them the burden of providing health care to their workersAnd despite all the GOPs cries and criticisms of socialized medicine when the Affordable Care Act was making its way through Congress years ago the two Republican panelists agreed nearly as readilyA question like that  sure said Betsy Webb who runs the Bangor School Department in Maine But what is the realityThe reality is that maybe it should not have to be the responsibility of the Bangor school district to provide health care that maybe it should be a right of all of our people whether they work at McDonalds in Bangor whether they work for the school district to have health care said Sanders before taking up the question with the next witness Andrew Puzder the CEO of CKE Restaurants which runs the Carls Jr and Hardees chainsIf what youre saying Senator is that if we had a bill that was debated that was vetted through congressional committees and we looked at the health care system and really tried to come up with a more rational solution I would say youre absolutely right Puzder saidHe allowed that he and Sanders might not agree on the ultimate solution but when Sanders pressed Puzder on whether he would rather not have to worry about providing health care and instead focus on his products the CEO was emphatic
