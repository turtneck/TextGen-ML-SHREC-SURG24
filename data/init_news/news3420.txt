When Jeb Bush stepped up onto the fabled soapbox at the Iowa State Fair on Friday fairgoers pelted him with questions about the legacy of his brother a former president And his father another former president And one of his foreign policy advisers Paul D Wolfowitz the architect of his brothers war in Iraq And about the war itselfUnder a blazing sun Bush expressed irritation with what he called the parlor game of focusing on Wolfowitz and other past Bush administration advisers who have resurfaced for this Bush campaignIf Im president we will have a strategy on Day One to take out this grave threat to our national security and to the world he said I promise you thatThis was supposed to be the week when Bush would finally lay out his own thoughts on how to combat the Islamic State terror group and put Hillary Rodham Clinton on the defensive  and wrest himself from his family legacy in the process But over several days it has become evident that his ideas on the subject are remarkably similar to George W Bushs ideas and that he firmly believes that Democrats  not his brother  deserve the blame for the unrest in Iraq and neighboring SyriaHis new struggles with the issue also come as he is fading in polls and being drowned out by the angry outsiders dominating the raceAccording to Bush this week the removal of Saddam Hussein from power turned out to be a pretty good deal The 2007 troop surge was an extraordinarily effective strategy By the time his brother left office he said the mission was accomplished in Iraq because security had been restoredBush also said he wont rule out waterboarding in the interrogation of terrorism suspects although he added I do think in general that torture is not appropriateBush faults President Obama for his unwillingness to talk directly about radical Islamic terrorists and Clinton for visiting Iraq only once as secretary of state He said it might be necessary to deploy more US forces to both Iraq and Syria  and that troops already on the ground should be embedded more closely with local forcesAs for questions about advisers Bush told fairgoers Friday that he has a young team working at his campaign headquarters in Miami Shrugging Bush said any veteran GOP foreign policy advisers had to deal with two Republican administrations run by his brother and fatherI mean this is kind of a tough game to be playing to be honest with you he said Im my own personIn an interview Friday radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Bush whether its easier or harder for him to talk about national security given his last name Bush shot back It doesnt matter Im the first candidate to have a view on this with enough detail for people to see what the world would look like if Im presidentBut Democrats are eager to exploit Bushs remarks this week to remind voters of his family ties During a town hall in Dubuque Iowa on Friday afternoon Clinton took aim at Bushs criticism of her noting that his brother signed an agreement as president to withdraw combat troops from the country by 2011I do think that its a little bit surprising to hear Jeb Bush talk about this she said He expects the American people to have a collective case of amnesiaLater in the town hall Clinton sought to single out Jeb Bushs comments on womens issues but mistakenly referred to him as George BushI get confused she said seeming to relish her error Oh wellMost Americans still believe the Iraq war was a mistake and are opposed to new military engagement  making Jeb Bushs approach to national security risky But polling suggests that his positions are popular among most Republicans especially if it means raising doubts about Clintons tenure as secretary of stateJeb is going to talk about the threat of radical Islamic terrorism and how to defeat it said Tim Miller Bushs campaign communications director If the Democrats want to talk about the past thats their prerogative but the American people are looking for someone who will address todays growing terror threat and they didnt get it from ObamaClintonThe world according to Jeb BushAmong his GOP rivals Sen Rand Paul RKy has said that it was a mistake to topple Hussein while New Jersey Gov Chris Christie says it makes no sense for us to be relitigating yesterdayBusinessman Donald Trump has it both ways blaming George W Bush for invading the country in the first place and Obama for pulling troops out in 2011 The war should have never happened he told Fox News earlier this year Once it did happen you should have left the troops in Its really a double faultIn Iowa  where Bush polled seventh in a CNNORC poll released this week  there are some Republicans who appreciate his approach and think his dynastic lineage is a positive attributeHes going to be our man because hes presidential he knows whats going on said Belinda Schlueter a 56yearold homemaker He comes from a family that actually knows what the countrys all about and how the office runs We need somebody there that knows what theyre doingBush launched his discussions of national security Tuesday in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley Calif He faulted Obama and Clinton for their blind haste to withdraw US forces from Iraq a premature decision and a fatal error that disrupted the fragile progress his brother helped forge in Iraq He did not mention his brothers role in starting the process for withdrawalWhile there are about 3500 US support troops in Iraq now more may well be needed Bush said He endorsed deploying troops to work more closely with Iraqi forces including as forward air spotters to help identify targets We do not need and our friends do not ask for a major commitment of American combat forces he said But we do need to convey that we are serious that we are determined to help local forces take back their countryIn Syria he called for more active US involvement in the brutal Syrian civil war  including a nofly zone and the expansion of safe zones in the countryOn Thursday at a national security forum in Davenport Iowa he said Iraq was fragile but secure when his brother left office in 2009 He added that the mission was accomplished in the way that there was security there and it was because of the heroic efforts of the men and women in the United States military that it was soThat answer immediately prompted comparisons to George W Bushs 2003 Mission Accomplished speech on the deck of a Navy carrier that critics say prematurely declared the end of the Iraqi military campaignAt the forum Jeb Bush would not say for certain whether he would preserve the executive order Obama signed banning enhanced interrogation Later Thursday he told reporters that he would not rule out using waterboarding during interrogations of terrorism suspectsFormer House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers RMich whose group hosted the forum credited Bush with presenting the most nuanced approach to a really hard problemOpEd To defeat the Islamic State the US will have to go bigRogers who is neutral in the GOP primary contests said Campaigns now are so tapped in to 140 characters and Twitter its very difficult to have a thoughtful conversation about national securityPeter Feaver who advised George W Bush on Iraq applauded Bush for delivering a detailed speech and suggested he represented views advocated by serious Democrats and RepublicansHe pointed to a recent Washington Post oped cowritten by Michle Flournoy Obamas former undersecretary of defense for policy who has been touted as a possible defense secretary for Clinton Writing with Richard Fontaine a former foreign policy adviser to Sen John McCain RAriz Flournoy advocated a series of proposals similar to what Bush called for to provide more military aid to Sunni tribes and the Kurdish peshmerga in Iraq to embed more Special Operations forces with Iraqi security forces to deploy forward air controllers to identify targets and to build a stronger global campaign against the Islamic StateAfter parrying questions lobbed at him by Iowans Bush donned a red apron and flipped pork chops with Iowa Gov Terry Branstad R Carl Owens a hog farmer stood off to the side taking in the sceneI dont know if hes like his brother and dad or not said Owens 59 I wasnt too happy with them Mr Bush the last president look at the mess he got the United States into over there where we shouldnt have been Kind of like the Vietnam War We shouldnt have been thereOKeefe reported from Washington Sean Sullivan in Iowa contributed to this report
