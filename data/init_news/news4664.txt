After suspending its Arctic program for years following the grounding of one of its drilling rigs the company announced Thursday that it plans to start drilling this summer inAlaskas Chukchi SeaWill we go ahead CEO Ben van Beurdensaid during the companys fourth quarter results conference Yes if we can Id be so disappointed if we wouldntIts a perplexing decision For one thing Arctic drilling is an inherently risky activity and Shell has a poor track record of getting it right And even when it is done right says Mackenzie Funk who reported an indepth ebook on the companys 2012 Arctic fiasco its incredibly expensive Simply the practicality of getting giant rigs up there the practicality of getting oil from that far away from the rest of us to market is a huge huge undertaking Funk recently told SalonWe will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly van Beurden told the BBC adding I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks But Funks take on Shells prospects for safe drilling basically came down to whether the companys going to be willing to invest enough money in the project to do it right Seeing as how the announcement comes at a time when the price of crude oil is at a sixyear low its hard to imagine how they expect to do both that and profit at the same timeShell already plans to cut spending by more than 15 billion over the next three years due to dwindling revenues Despite that Shell hasnt taken the opportunity to cut its most highcost highrisk projectGreenpeaces Charlie Kronick said in a statement Its time for investors to recognise that its impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oilIn the same meeting moreover Shell made the unprecedented decision to back a resolution from activist shareholders to analyze whether its business model is compatible with the global effort to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius To reach that goal scientists say were going to have to leave threequarters of our remaining fossil fuel reserves in the ground  and according to a major study recently published in the journal Nature that includes all of the oil and gas in the Arctic So what gives Shell According toChief Financial Officer Simon Henry the companys already invested 1 billion preparing to tap the Arctic and just keeping things operational since the moratorium has cost it several hundred millions more each year But even if thats enough for it to decide its worth it to go ahead and drill it still has a number of legal hurdles to overcome chief among them being the ruling of a US federal appeals court last January that the Interior Departments sale of Chukchi Sea leases back in 2008 didnt take sufficient account for the environmental risks posed by drilling A final environmental impact statement is due out soon in the meantime federal regulators are informally reviewing the companys drilling plans The environmental group Friends of the Earth meanwhile points to the absurdity of the 10 billion in US subsidies thats the lowball estimate from which Shell partakes each year The last thing the Arctic needs is an invasion from Big Oil and the last thing those invaders deserve are taxpayer dollars Lukas Ross the groups climate and energy campaigner said in a statement Shells dismal record of accidents and safety violations demonstrates an inability to operate in the unpredictable Arctic waters If we are going to avoid climate catastrophe we must make the Arctic off limits to drilling
