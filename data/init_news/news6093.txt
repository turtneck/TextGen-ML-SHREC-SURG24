The Benghazi Committee set out to investigate why four Americans died in Benghazi September 11 2012 not to damage a presidential candidate Rightly or wrongly their credibility has been called into question including by statements from fellow RepublicansWhat Ill be watching for on Thursday is not questions about Hillary Clintons emails but the fundamental question What were the Americans doing in Benghazi in the first placeConsulates and embassy annexes are where diplomats issue visas and find lost luggage and thats clearly not what former special forces Americans were doingWho was Ambassador Stevens supposed to meet in Benghazi and who was responsible for his securityWhich Libyan militia groups were we partnering with and who vetted themFor over a year there have been unconfirmed reports that the Benghazi was a gun running operation to take Qaddafis abandoned weapons and turn them over to Syrian rebels Is this what the American contractors were doing  running gunsWere we working with and arming Libyan rebels who turned out to be Al Qaedatype terrorists If thats true then not only was this foolish it was illegalSome have said that all of this is reminiscent of Watergate And yes Secretary Clinton worked House Judiciary Committee as a 27yearold staff attorney during the Watergate investigation But these are echoes not of Watergate as some have claimed but of the IranContra affairThe committee should focus on what happened in the weeks leading up to the Benghazi attackThey should ask why Ambassador Stevens repeated calls for more security were ignoredThey should question why there was no rescue mission mounted while our men were under attackAnd yes they should ask who decided to lie about the events on September 11 2012 being a planned terrorist attack and instead of using the lame excuse that they were the result of a YouTube video sparking a demonstration that got out of handThese questions have all been asked before but they have never answeredNow fast forward to October 22 2015 the committee has new evidence including Ambassador Stevens own emails This time it will be difficult for any witness to keep dodging the questionsFinally and perhaps the most fundamental question of all  was the fiasco of the Libyan war another example of the Obama administrations love affair with moderately radical Islamists Has the Obama administration been willfully blind  from the start  to the dangers posed by all radical Islamists in Libya in Egypt in Syria in Iraq in IranThere is an overwhelming temptation for any politician in todays Washington to be partisan But it was the same forty years ago during the Watergate scandalI know because I was there working for Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger as a young aide in the West Wing It was a dark time not just for the Nixon team but for the countryThe nations business was put on hold for well over a year while we investigated the president and his closest associatesIn the end the system worked Nixon resigned a new president was sworn in and the rift was healed It was due in no small part to the integrity of the Watergate Committee members  both Republican and DemocratMost of them were able to rise above politics and serve the nations business A few however learned a different lesson  not the lesson that no one is above the law but as long as you dont get caughtWas Secretary Clinton trying to hide something with her private email system Perhaps But thats for the FBI to decide not the House Republicans
