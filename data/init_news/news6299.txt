Something incredible happened at the frontline of Standing Rock in North Dakota today The brave men and women who are protecting water and attempting to stop the Dakota Access pipeline from being built on treaty land just received assistance from a large herd of wild buffalo that seemed to appear out of nowhereThousands of people are sacrificing their livelihoods and safety for a much greater cause by being there Seeing those wild buffalo meant so much because in traditional Native culture the Tatanka Oyate American Bison is a sacred symbol The bison always gave their lives to provide food shelter and clothing through the use of their meat and their hidesCeremonies were always conducted to honor their sacrifice and many blessings they providedIts being reported that Tatanka Oyate were prayed to and called upon for support and by the people at Sioux While the sweeping arrests pepper sprays violence with batons and shots of rubber bullets was happening a huge eruption of uplifting cheers excitement and laughter could be heard when the Bison were spotted by the peopleThis was such a spectacular sight to behold The peaceful path of affirmative nonviolent civil disobedience isnt being adequately responded to by higher level governmental authorizes The whole world is watching Sioux tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and stop the exploitation of the indigenous communities and the entire planetThe bison represents abundance of the Creators bounty and respect for all creation knowing that all things are sacred The bison also represented their spirit and reminded them of how their lives were once lived free and in harmony with natureIt should remain that waySourcesPhoto Credit USuncutcom httpusuncutcomresistancethousandswildbuffaloappearnowherestandingrock httpwwwwhitewolfpackcom201610giversofcouragethousandsofwildhtml
