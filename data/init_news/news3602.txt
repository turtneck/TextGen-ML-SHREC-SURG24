Facebooks 144 billion users rely on the site for lots of things keeping in touch sharing photos casual stalkingBut if you get your political news through Facebook as more than 60 percent of millennials do please browse with extreme caution Thesite doesnt show you everything and may subtly skew your point of viewThis is not of course a new fearmoral panic overecho chambers and filter bubbles is as old as the social Web itself Buta new survey by the Pew Center released on Monday suggests there may be some new urgency here Per that survey amajority of American Internet users now get political news from Facebook  and the 2016 elections as we know are in just over a yearThats really important and important to understand because Facebook is quite unliketraditional conduits of news Think your local ABC affiliate your gossipy neighbor this page what have you As in those more traditional settings Facebook gives you a great deal of control over which sources you follow and what you choose to read But unlike those other traditional sources Facebook also hides manystories selectively According to a recent Washington Post experiment as much as 72 percent of the new material your friends and subscribed pages post never actually shows up in your News FeedWhich might be fine when were talking about your excoworkers baby pictures  but what about if were talking about a political scandalA longerterm question that arises from this data about Facebook as a political news source the Pew report says is what younger Americans reliance on social media for news might mean for the political systemBy nowit should be common knowledge that the News Feed does not show you every post your friends put on Facebook Unfortunately theres still a major misconception aroundhow News Feed worksin a recent study from the University of Illinois 625 percent of participantshad no idea Facebook screenedout any postsFacebook has a good reason for doing this mind youIf you saw everypost youd be overwhelmed Thered simply be too many to read This is a problem Twitters having incidentally So instead Facebook does a little math and based on a range of engagement factors tries to predict the posts youre most interested in and only places those in your News FeedThe math behind the News Feed changes constantly and Facebook regularly rejiggers it to meet user needs You may recall a certain outcry over manipulative algorithmic changes in July 2014Anyway none of this is inherently bad or nefarious In factfor thecasual social Facebook user its probably really good The problem is that more and more people are using Facebook for more and more important things  like informing how they vote  without entirelyunderstanding how it worksIts kind of like waking up in The Matrix in a way said one newly enlightened participant in that University of Illinois studyI mean you have what you think as your reality  but its actually filtered moderatedFacebook has unsurprisingly worked very hard to shed the impression that this filtering may somehow hurt its users or their media literacy In May researchers working for the site published a very highprofile very controversial paperon the ideological diversity of information in the News Feed The communications scholarChristian Sandvig called it the its not our fault study  a peculiarly deliberate attempt to prove that even if filter bubbles do exist their algorithm isntto blameAs Sandvig and others have pointed out though that isnt actually what Facebooksdata shows For one thing the study wasnt conclusive It only looked at a small and highly nonrepresentative user sample On top of that the study shows that the algorithm does tweak political news in three important if modest ways To witAgain none of this is necessarily nefarious or shocking What else would a good filter algorithm be doing other than filtering for what it thinks you will like Sandvig wrote But it does mean that when you use Facebook as a source for political newsthat news is modestly more likely to flatter your existing point of viewSelectivity and polarization are happening on Facebook sums up Sandvig and the news feed curation algorithm acts to modestly accelerate both of those thingsIts no wonder really that highly partisan news sources tend to do very well on Facebook  they speak to the biases of both users and the networkIt might be hard to see the big sowhat in all of this After allif youre just one user cruising along through your News Feed you want a service thats pleasant and comfortable for you You dont want to be bombarded with rageinducing partisan news in between your memes and your momsstories and your petvideosBut consider for a minute that more than half of all Americanadults use Facebook  enough people some scholars theorize to swing a national election As more of those people use Facebook for news we risk accelerating polarization for a large slice of the US populationAnd thats too bad really both because political polarization can be blamed for a host of ills and because social networks could really be a force for good hereOne analysis of Twitter found for instance that ideologically diverse networks tend to yield more moderate people proof positive its author wrote that social media has rich potential  to transform the political processThere are at least in theory technical ways around this problem The sociologist Zeynep Tufekci has called for Facebook to hand more filtering control directly over to its users At a personal level she wrote Id love to have the choice to set my newsfeed algorithm to please show more content Id likely disagree with Balancer a browser extensionresearch project that took this approach toward news site reading is the only known tool to increase diverse exposure clearly and measurablyMeanwhile Jonathan Zittrain  a law professor at Harvard  has called for Facebook to declare itself an information fiduciary much like lawyers and doctors do already In exchange for say a tax break the site would promise to offer a depersonalized unfiltered News Feed experience among other thingsUnfortunately these solutions seem unlikely for now  and in the meantime the available fixes are both very individual and far less ambitiousIf you use Facebook to access political news consider toggling from top stories to most recent That options in the
