Donald Trump praised Vladimir Putin and Hillary Clinton defended her 2003 vote for war in Iraq in a televised QA Wednesday on national securityDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with Today show coanchor Matt Lauer left speaks at the NBC CommanderInChief Forum held at the Intrepid Sea Air and Space museum aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid New York Wednesday Sept 7 2016Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton confronted their key weaknesses in a televised national security forum with the Republican defending his preparedness to be commander in chief despite vague plans for tackling global challenges and the Democrat arguing that her controversial email practices did not expose questionable judgmentMr Trump also renewed his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his disdain for President Barack Obama saying that the Russian enjoyed an 82 percent approval rating The man has very strong control over a country Trump said Its a very different system and I dont happen to like the system but certainly in that system hes been a leader far more than our president has been a leaderSpeaking to reporters in Laos Obama said Thursday that Trump confirms his belief that Trump isnt qualified to be president every time he speaks and added The most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions to what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed or outright wacky ideasTrump and Mrs Clinton spoke backtoback Wednesday night each fielding 30 minutes of questions While the candidates never appeared on stage together the session served as a preview of sorts for their highlyanticipated presidential debatesBy virtue of a coin flip Clinton took the stage first and quickly found herself responding at length to questions about her years in government She reiterated that she had made mistakes in relying on a personal email account and private server as secretary of State and in voting for the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a senator But she defended her support for US military intervention to help oust a dictator in Libya despite the chaotic aftermathIm asking to be judged on the totality of my record said Clinton who grew visibly irritated at times with the repeated focus on her past actionsClinton who has cast Trump as dangerously illprepared to be commander in chief tried to center the discussion on her foreign policy proposals She vowed to defeat the Islamic State group without committing American ground troops to Iraq or Syria And she pledged to hold weekly Oval Office meetings with representatives from the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs to stay abreast of health care for veteransTrump did little to counter the criticism that he lacks detailed policy proposals particularly regarding the Islamic State group He both insisted he has a private blueprint for defeating the extremist group and that he would demand a plan from military leaders within 30 days of taking officeBut he was also harshly critical of the military saying Americas generals have been reduced to rubble under Obama Asked to square his request for military options with that criticism Trump said simply Theyll probably be different generalsTrump stood by a previous comment that appeared to blame military sexual assaults on men and women serving together but added he would not seek to remove women from the military And for the first time he opened the door to granting legal status to people living in the US illegally who join the militaryI think that when you serve in the armed forces thats a very special situation Trump said And I could see myself working that outThe Republican also repeated an incorrect claim that he was opposed to the war with Iraq before the invasion That assertion is contradicted by an interview Trump did with Howard Stern in September 2002 in which he was asked whether he supported the invasion He replied Yeah I guess soWith just two months until Election Day national security has emerged as a centerpiece issue in the White House race Both candidates believe they have the upper hand with Clinton contrasting her experience with Trumps unpredictability and the Republican arguing that Americans worried about their safety will be left with more of the same if they elect Obamas former secretary of StateThis event  and the upcoming presidential debates  could be particularly important in the closing days of this election As The Christian Science Monitor reports this year an unusually large percentage of the electorate says it hasnt made up its mind or will vote for a thirdparty candidate Thats a big chunk of folks who might swing in one way or another when the pressure of choosing on Election Day actually nearsFor instanceWall Street JournalNBC pollingshows 13 percent of voters undecided in 2016 The corresponding figure from this time in 2012 was 8 percentWe are seeing a historically high number of potential voters who arent committing to either major party candidate at this point writes Middlebury College political science professor Matthew Dickinson on hisPresidential Power blogWhile GOP candidates are often seen by voters as having an advantage on military and national security issues Trump is far from a traditional Republican He has no military experience and has repeatedly criticized the skill of the armed forcesA flood of Republican national security experts have instead chosen to back Clinton helping bolster her case that Trump is broadly unacceptable Earlier Wednesday former Defense Secretary William Cohen joined the list of GOP officials supporting ClintonAhead of the forum Trump rolled out a new plan to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars including major increases in the number of active troops fighter planes ships and submarinesHis address earlier in the day included plans to eliminate deep spending cuts known as the sequester that were enacted when Congress failed to reach a budget compromise in 2011 Republicans and Democrats voted for the automatic acrossthe board cuts that affected both military and domestic programs though the White House has long pressed Congress to lift the spending limitsTrump expressed support for the sequester in interviews in 2013  even describing them as too small  but seemed to suggest at the time that military spending should be exemptAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Erica Werner in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report
