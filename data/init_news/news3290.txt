Back in the early days of the Great Recession there was a lot of foreign policy pundit panic that China would somehow use its holdings of Americandebt as an economic lever to force Washington to kowtow to Beijing Also back in those early daysI argued that this was nonsense Seven years later I like to occasionally bring upthis fact mostly because its one of the raretimes I think I was unequivocally rightToday however Im bringing it up because weve just witnessedSaudi Arabia exercise a weakecho of that gambit The New York Times Mark Mazzetti reported late last week that the Saudi government has warned US officialsabout the economic repercussions of a bill moving through CongressSaudi Arabia has told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it will sell off hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be held responsible in American courts for any role in the Sept 11 2001 attacks The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bills passage according to administration officials and congressional aides from both parties and the Saudi threats have been the subject of intense discussions in recent weeks between lawmakers and officials from the State Department and the Pentagon The officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout from the legislationThe Los Angeles Times Michael Hiltzik provides some useful context behind Saudi concernsSince the Saudis long have been suspected of complicity in the attacks its fair to say theyre the prime target of the legislation But the Saudis immediate concern is that their USbased assets could be frozen by a court for the lengthy period it would take for lawsuits fordamages to make their way through the judicial system That makes their representation about US assets look a bit less like a threat than an expression of defensive strategyRegardless of the Saudi threat the Obama administrations resistance to this bill makes a bit more senseWhats interesting about all of this has been the American reaction to the revelation of the Saudi economic threat Seven years ago all China had to do was clear its throat on the matter and there were paroxysms of news coverage about threats to the US economyThis time around there has been some minor handwringing but most of the analyses have echoed what the New York Times Binyamin Appelbaum wrote about the threatIf Saudi Arabia follows through on its recent threat to sell off its investments in the United States the financial maneuver could be painful  mostly for Saudi Arabia Such a fire sale might roil financial markets or cause problems for companies that lost funding but experts say it is hard to imagine a significant or lasting impact on the American economy Global investors continue to shovel money into the United States if the Saudis go the experts say others will take their placeTo elaborate a bit more the current Saudi threat is wayweaker than the implicit Chinese threat of seven years ago becauseThe one difference in the Saudis favor is that the kingdom is a US ally while China is viewed as a rival This helps explain the administrations position on this issue though I suspect its concern is about the precedent this bill would set if it became law The thing is recent Obama interviews and news stories highlight the ways in which these ties are fraying And the very fact that this threat got publicized is not going to improve US attitudes toward RiyadhNo the most interesting thing about the revelation of this threat has been the lack of pundit panic in Washington If anything the response has been either a shrug of the shoulders or an insistenceon calling the Saudi bluffMaybe this is just the fact that memories of 911 trump appraisals of economic statecraft Or maybe just maybe Washington has learned not to panic as much about these kinds of empty threats
