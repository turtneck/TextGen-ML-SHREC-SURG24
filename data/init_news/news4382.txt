Quinn begins with what is almost a standard critique of politically correct culture Im tired of humorless activist people decreeing that we only use these words and never those and that we check our privilege in case we say the wrong thing and trigger someone he writes Across the country the sexist office asshole has been replaced by the flataffect deadeyed modernday Puritan Both groups  the oldschool assholes and the neoPuritans  share a common goal to wipe the smile off everyones facesBut the rest of the book is playing a subtler and more sophisticated game Quinn wants to talk about race Hes outraged that theres no dialogue  or that the dialogue veers only to the extreme poles of either angry or pandering And he wants to tell his personal story of growing up in a multiethnic New York as an example of how people can get along when they talk openly with each otherHis frustration seems less with pc culture than with anything that stands between a problem and honest conversation about it His real war is against papering over words and pretending weve fixed a problem This is a decent and nobullshit guy Maybe we need to admit the sad truth he says over coffee last week in lower Manhattan which is that we are not smart enough to solve any of these thingsGive this guy a Sunday morning talk show and you get the feeling hed unfreeze the conversation in a really provocative way  or go down tryingWe spoke before Quinns good friend Jerry Seinfeld talked about creepy pc culture in interviews Quinns take is more nuanced That there has been political correctness on campus for decades and that its the comedians job to make an audience uncomfortable and to think Hes not a defender of the cheap provocation and understands that people can take offense at a joke but he sees through easy outrage as well  and sees it as getting in the way of really talking to each other If you watched him on Fox and Friends yesterday deftly deflecting Steve Doocy and Elisabeth Hasselbeck you only come away with more respectWe talked about all of this and more  including his Girls colleague Lena Dunham his thoughts on Bill Maher and religion and memories of his years on Saturday Night Live The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity And sorry but the amazing story he told about Sam Kinison Remote Control host Ken Ober strippers Las Vegas and cocaine came after we turned the recorder offSo are you ready to be the most hated man on Twitter Comedy race humor outrage  its a recipe for becoming a trending topic or like Trevor Noah landing on the front page of the New York Times Why is this a third rail you want to leap on top of right nowThird rail I like that phrase I dont really know why exactly It just feels like everything has always pointed that way to me Ive always been into discussing race The conversation has been in neutral since I was a little kid Since the 60s its been in neutral This conversation doesnt exist So at least people should stop lying and pretending theres a racial dialogue That would make me happyAnd I like to joke I dont like how the climate has gone jokewise I understand totally when people are offended by jokes I get it I dont like when people make blanket statements For instance the whole rape joke controversy But nobody admits nobody even discusses that most rape jokes are made by female comediansI dont like comedy being determined by people who are not comedians It was becoming a situation where whoever is the fastest typist decides whats offensive and whats not with comedy Its just too much Its too much Dont step in and start telling me what humor is Its like any job Everyone wants to secondguess I do the same thing to politics to everything Comedy has become that sort of thing  but with humorless peopleWhy is it that everyone who secondguesses a joke is immediately branded humorless Sometimes what I see from comedians watching this is a defensiveness after being told Hey maybe thats not funny Or that a joke failed Is it possible that comedians have their backs up in such a way that thats stopping a dialogue that might be useful Because sometimes it seems to me that we are having a conversation about race and other topics when people say Hey Im not sure thats funny and let me tell you why That leads to honest conversation  and maybe it is the joke that started the conversationThere is no conversation about race There is no conversation Thats the first lie that there is a conversation All there is is a point of view that you are supposed to have  and if you deviate from that point of view people goWhoa whoa whoa Thats not what humor isAnd punching up punching down Once again these terms were not created by humorous people Activists are activists They are great and a big part of American society Humorists and activists dont very often meld Humorists and activists have two very different mentalities Activists are very sincere very positive Thats how activists should be Humorists are supposed to look at everything and see the bullshit in all sides This is my opinion We are not supposed to see 100 percent right and wrong Everything is middle ground Everything is hypocrisy in all people and all situationsI feel like people get on Twitter and they get gripped by selfrighteous indignation  which is fine Its just not becoming in my opinionPunching up and punching down That seems like a fair point to me keeping the target In mind Im not suggesting anyone impose rules on comedy of course or that anyone is offlimits for a joke But it does seem like theres humanity in at least thinking before making a punchline out of a victimSo lets say you make fun of a white plumber or Kanye West Which is punching up and which is punching down Societally historically context is everything Thats another annoying statementBut if its Trevor Noah making a dumb fat joke on Twitter Thats punching downThere are the lines of cruelty right Its asinineDoes that line of cruelty matter Or is it the comedians job to poke through bullshit somehow free of someone turning around and calling bullshit on themNo Thats what we would like to be of course Ideally Id love it At the same time what is the biggest argument Its over free speech Is Trevor Noah making a fat joke yelling fire at a crowded movie theater Then people go We are not the government oppressing people No but if you still get people fired from their job thats also a certain amount of powerTheres a difference between getting someone fired from their job and saying Thats kind of an asshole jokeRight but some people do get fired Trevor Noah some people wanted him to get fired All Im saying is there is a certain amount of power that comes on Its not just an average Joe Citizen There are things that go on on social media in general Lets not pretend its just outrage What the rightwing fundamentalists were throughout the history of our country from the time of the Puritans to the 1980s  the left is becomingIm with you on about twothirds of this our frozen racial conversation the lack of context and history from some in the politically correct crowd And on the important role satirists and humorists play  imagine the Bush years without Stewart and Colbert But F it And the other piece of it that to me feels like people have the same First Amendment rights that Trevor Noahs got to make that joke to speak up and say Not really funnyThe other side is people saying Cant you do better You are better than that Theres so many lines to be drawn The day any artist  dare I call comedians artists  but the day that anybody starts deciding that people can draw those lines how are we different from pandering from the old idea that you have to please the crowd I thought the whole point was that you dont please the crowd you please yourself artisticallyLet me throw this out there If you listen to the comedy podcasts sometimes you can get the sense that comedians are trying to outoutrage each other But then you also follow comedians on Twitter or read interviews and it also sounds like theres a lot of fear that if they say one wrong thing their career could be ruined Is there a chilling effect going on right now that is affecting writers rooms Is all of this affecting the way comedians think and workOh yeah I think so I dont have any particular examples of it but a lot of people are scared of their career or that people will take what they say out of context or in context It manifests itself across the board but its interesting to watch these unspoken elephantintheroom situations that people accept I said it 11 years ago on NPR Its called substitute shock The audience wants to feel edgy People dont want to feel like Puritans So people make disabled jokes or rape jokes or child molester jokes But if you bring up race there is a silence in the room So its like where is this coming fromIm trying to be funny Thats my goal Its definitely a weird time as far as more and more things are being determined by people who dont necessarily have a great sense of humor It was bad enough when we had these asshole executives Its not even that Im disagreeing with a lot of what people are saying online I just disagree that they are pretending to be an average person No You are coordinating efforts all the time to stop people that are not necessarily harmful to the United States First of all if they want to say we are not going to have a discussion  and that they believe in oppressing people and admit that  I will feel better Im the kind of person that believes in suppressing thought I believe is offensive Admit you are that kind of person Thats all I mean Lets all put it out there Thats why I think a racial discussion will be great If we had a racial show every week itll bring it on boardLarry Wilmore is doing some of it Some of it But if you want to bring it on board lets bring it on board Like I said racially in terms of personalities black and white in particular This book all about black and white Theres a chapter on every other ethnic group but no one is going to care about anything except black and white Either way the fact isand its been in neutral since the 60sno interaction People just want to change the subject Its just the way it is And its probably never going to change It hasnt so far But I just dont like that people act like they are having these conversations These might be two different things But so much of what gets written off as politically correct outrage culture is a really interesting conversation The outrage over Bill Cosby for example Yes but those things are things Im talking about words The Duggars Cosby those are actions Not words Neither of those is part of anything I do for a living Bill Cosbys actions are rape Its not rape culture Its actual rape Im not saying there arent interesting behavioral things being brought up I would never say that But in the grand scheme of things theres still a thing going onsince I started comedywhere there is a tendency that used to come from fundamentalist rightwing attitudes Now it comes from the left Mostly If the right had cultural power they would be doing it too in a different way Liberals are being Puritans Theres no other way to describe it All the things you are talking about I agree with except for the fact that the people making these decisions are starting minor digital hysteria Digital hysteria I want people to be honest and say I dont like it and we are going to put a stop to it Admit it I talk to people who monitor websites And Im like Really Thats interesting You fucking monitor with your free time This is what people do Thats all Im saying When I was doing Tough Crowd we had racial discussions every day We got nothing accomplished in the long run but it was the beginning of something interesting You talk in the book about Tough Crowd getting you branded as a conservative and that hurting you careerwise You cant prove anything but I would say it did Anyway that discussion ended when it ended and its one of those things Blacks and whites got off on a bad foot to put it mildly and now its never going to be fixed Either way its fine if people dont want to discuss it but dont pretend we need a race dialogue There is none Thats what people say about absolutely everything Its like politicians saying we are going to have a blueribbon panel on something Its a way of acting like you are serious about something without actually having to do anything Or maybe we need to admit the sad truth which is that we are not smart enough to solve any of these things None of us has solutions Nobody has solutions to any of these problems How can comedians help The subtitle of the book is a comedian solves race relations I dont know if we can Obviously when you discuss things with humor interesting thoughts come out People say interesting things with comedynot big consequential thingsbut things I didnt think of in a certain way Ultimately comedians arent going to solve the worlds problems but its hard to say I feel like we intuitively want to do this but we are just not bright enough Its depressing but we are not that swift So many of the stories in the book are about the way different ethnic and racial groups got along in New York when you were growing up in Brooklyn As you describe it people were really direct with each other and made jokes and knew how to get along They maybe didnt like or trust each other but they said so to each others face Less so now you suggest So are things better or worse than they were when you were growing up There was just as much racial tension in many ways It wasnt some idyllic thing But because Park Slope was so mixed we were much more racially mixed People arent racially mixed now In the 70s maybe people had more hope People now are hardened I guess it wasnt that different It really wasnt We got along a little better because we were in close proximity Like I said everyone started to move away from each other in high school and that was a thing It wasnt because of an incident There should be a once a week racial summit but people would be afraid to say how they really felt Lena Dunham is back in the middle of controversy right now with Sarah Palin going after her and tying her into the Duggar scandal Youve been on Girls Have you ever seen a young writer and actress be turned into a lightning rod like this Do you have any idea how she handles it I was just thinking about her today Shes one of those people that seems like a light person Shes always got a light to her an energy She made the mistake of telling the truth I made a whole routine about how when youre little kids it can be like a Roman orgy I noticed that a few people were shocked but most people laughed But the right and the left there is a war going on Its constant Its every day everything Its terrible but this is how ignorant we are All it shows is our ignorance as a society Weve got these great technological things and people articulate better than they did 30 years ago but its the same thing People love to hate People love to fight You like to feel like you are on the right side of history of things Its just terrible So the role for comedians is to be a reality check Exactly In an ideal world we are a reality check In the best of circumstances Thats what we are supposed to be in an ideal world You write in the book that perhaps its OK to be a little bit racist The example you use is of an older woman clutching her purse tighter if she sees a young black person Explain that to me It depends on their experience as a personif she ever got robbed if she got robbed by a black guy she is going to clutch her wallet It doesnt make her racist I saw so many people growing up that would be circumstantially racist and have black friends And their black friends would tell them to watch out for the black kids when going down to a certain neighborhood We knew it wasnt everyone Now if you speak some kind of shorthand you are automatically racist And like I said if the past 20 years of whitewashing on languageexcuse the expressionif that had actually had an effect of societys racial ills I guess Id say it does work But its bullshit Its just childish It has nothing to do with peoples interactions Thats just linguistic bullshit Thats the problem Its getting to be another surface layout another laminated layer of bullshit Tell me about SNL 40 and the moment where most of the Weekend Update anchors reunited Not a lot of people have had that desk It wasnt about the desk It wasnt about the show It was about my memories of how muchits all delayed reaction for me Life is like delayed reaction I was like fuck man That was such a great time and I guess I sort of knew it Thats how everything is in life I sort of knew it then but I was sitting there the whole night so overwhelmed by everybody that I worked with Jesus It brought back all these memories It was like a high school reunion in the sense that it was really powerful The show itself it was fine The power came from everyone in that room It was very emotional for me I was struck in the book that you sound very at ease with your years there Sometimes people look back and theyre bitter We all had our conflicts there But your take is interesting You say that everything gets a shot on Wednesday in readthrough And if it cant make a room of smart people and comedians laugh well it gets cut  but it had a chance At the time I didnt appreciate Lorne Michaels I was like everyone else Thats the posture you take with anyone in charge of everything Nobody else in show business would let you come that close to democracy I dont care who it is Nobody in the history of show business I look back wistfully because I wasnt one of those people who went back I should have but thats just my nature When Im done Im never thinking about coming back and doing a sketch Its not for me Back to the book What would you do if you were in charge to unstick the race conversation If there was a real show on every week where you can have these interactions some of them funny some of them serious discussing black and white that would be an interesting thing to do for a couple of years To have forums That would be good Who would you put on that show Only comedians Political people have to be more careful than comedians because they really have to answer for the rest of their lives With comedians its different you are expected to be provocative Provocative is part of the game You are supposed to have a little conflict with comedians The worst insult in comedy used to be the crowd pleaser Thats the hack Sometimes the people that are attacking comedians are the very people that should understand that we are supposed to be a little provocative I dont excuse a lot of horseshit Im not trying to get away with something Whatever I have to say I will say upfront Im not trying to slip one by anybody Its a muddled line right now Hopefully it will work out but its a muddled line with social media What do you think about what Bill Maher is up to with religion With the Muslims Islam is a weird religion but that being said theres billions of Islamic people that dont do anything wrong But I have no problem with him saying it The conversation is certainly direct Its direct Its not racially direct If that was talked about in Europe that would be an interesting show Theres no Muslims here If you do that show in France or England thats provocative Its not our thing as much It doesnt feel like it to me at least Maybe it is
