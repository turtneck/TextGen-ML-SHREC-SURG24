After Donald Trump presented a dark picture of the country at his convention in Cleveland last week Hillary Clinton and the Democrats plan to project a more optimistic and inclusive vision of the future when they convene here starting MondayBut the challenge for Clinton and her newly minted running mate Sen Timothy M Kaine Va will be to avoid becoming cheerleaders for the status quo and instead infuse that hopeful tone into an argument for change that could galvanize a frustrated and divided electorateDemocrats promise four nights of speeches and entertainment that will highlight the core theme of Clintons campaign Stronger together The program will alternate among political heavyweights led by President Obama and former president Bill Clinton celebrities such as Katy Perry and Lena Dunham and everyday Americans whose aim will be to make Clinton appear more appealing and approachableClintons advisers are confident that the Philadelphia festivities will present a far more united Democratic Party than Republicans were able to display at their convention which was repeatedly marred by outbursts of dissent and divisionCentral to that mission is the Monday night speech by Sen Bernie Sanders Vt who is charged with trying to rally his fervent supporters behind Clintons banner after a bruising primary battle although there is lingering resistance to Clinton among some of his loyalistsThe harsh tone of Trumps convention  symbolized by the antiClinton chants of Lock her up  gives the Democratic nomineeinwaiting and her allies an opportunity to expand her appeal to disaffected voters who are hungry for change but perhaps reluctant to embrace Trump and the brand of politics he enunciated in Cleveland At the same time the Democrats similarly risk overreach in their denunciations of TrumpAnother danger is that if protests outside the arena turn violent it could mar the partys effort to provide a united and relatively peaceful contrast to the Republican eventThe Republicans painted a black canvas with maybe a little stripe of red which would be Donald Trumps tie Democratic pollster Peter Hart said Unexpectedly the Democrats end up with a white canvas and a chance to paint it in any direction that they wishIn his most important speech ever Donald Trump echoes Richard NixonAll year Clinton has struggled to find a message that both energizes the Democratic faithful and reaches to a different part of the general electorate disenchanted with politics as usual This will be her challenge on Thursday night when she becomes the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major partyIf she is so concerned about the progressive revolt that days one two three and four of the convention are saying Im Bernie Sanders Lite with pantsuits then this whole group turned off by Trump has nowhere to go said Henry Olsen a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy CenterBut Housing Secretary Julin Castro who was in the competition to become Clintons running mate noted the importance of energizing the coalition that helped Obama win two electionsWe need an infusion of motivation and energy to remind folks that we cant take this election for granted he said The nature of modern presidential elections given the countrys partisanship is that these are close elections Its probably not going to be a blowout and people need to understand how important their individual vote isFour days of programming at the Wells Fargo Center will showcase the Democratic Partys diversity and progressivism designed to help as many voters as possible identify with Clinton and the rest of the ticket The speakers will be white black Latino and Asian Christian Jewish and Muslim old and young gay and straight male and female There is expected to be a heavy focus on issues such as immigration gay rights and gun controlHaving watched the Republicans fight among themselves in Cleveland Democrats will arrive in Philadelphia full of confidence But some in the party suggest that like much about Trump over the past year what looks to be a problem for him does not always become oneWe need to be agnostic on just how negative its consequences will be or indeed whether theyll be negative at all said William Galston domestic policy adviser in Bill Clintons White House and now a senior fellow at the Brookings InstitutionGalston added The idea that Donald Trumps convention speech allows Democrats to put any product they want on the shelf and expect the consumers to buy it is an optimistic proposition that I cant embrace and I hope the Clinton campaign wont eitherDemocratic leaders have no doubt that their convention will contrast sharply with that of the RepublicansWe just saw four days of some of the angriest people possibly in the United States of America  chaos vitriol confusion plagiarism mismanagement of a convention the likes of which weve not seen in either party in modern times said former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter DClinton enters her convention with a majority of Americans questioning her honesty She has an opportunity to speak to a huge audience beyond the delegates assembled at the Wells Fargo Center but many of those voters will be looking on skepticallyWhit Ayres a Republican pollster noted that the underlying mood in the country puts Clinton at some risk as she campaigns to extend the Democrats hold on the White House to a third consecutive termWhat Clinton cannot do is get herself in the position of defending the status quo and thats going to be a challenge because she is the essence of the status quo Ayres said If she lets this election get defined as change versus status quo where Trumps change and she is not thats one way she can lose this thingTrumps coalition potentially cuts across traditional party lines and as a political outsider he has shown a particular ability to attract support from what he called forgotten Americans many of them white and working class People who work hard but no longer have a voice I am your voice Trump said in ClevelandDonald Trump positions himself as the voice for the forgottenOlsen suggested that Clinton could peel away some of that support with the right message aimed at the right segment of Trumps base  such as white workingclass women He said Trumps daughter Ivanka set him up to talk to these women with her introductory speech but that the candidate failed to do soOn Friday in Tampa Clinton previewed how she would rebut Trumps declarations including his suggestion that he alone could fix what ails the country I cant really imagine him on a white horse she quippedClinton said We will offer a very different vision Its about building bridges not walls between people Its about making the economy work for everyone not just those at the top Its about embracing our diversity that does make our country greatThe conventions nightly themes focus on unity Opening night Monday will be United together Putting families first and feature addresses by first lady Michelle Obama and Sanders as well as Astrid Silva from Nevada a dreamer brought to the United States as a child by parents who are illegal immigrantsTuesdays theme is A lifetime of fighting for children and families and will be headlined by Bill Clinton and the mothers of the movement whose sons and daughters were killed in police and other shootingsWednesday night Working together will star Kaine President Obama and Vice President Biden Many Democrats expect that Obama will reprise the role Bill Clinton played at the 2012 convention in Charlotte by delivering not only a fullthroated endorsement of onetime rival Hillary Clinton but also a pointbypoint defense of his record and the economic gains under Democratic leadershipOn Friday Obama gave a taste of how he would respond to Trumps dark portrayal of the state of the country This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse this vision of violence and chaos everywhere doesnt really jibe with the experience of most people he said I hope people the next morning walked outside and birds were chirping and the sun was outThe convention will reach its crescendo on Thursday night with the theme Stronger together when Clinton will give her acceptance speech and be introduced by her daughter ChelseaClinton spokesman Glen Caplin said This convention will crystallize the fight that shes already fought and what she will do going forward for American families as president Hillary Clinton and Democrats will effectively make the case over these four days for an America thats at its best when we work together to solve our problemsDemocrats thought the Republican convention focused too much on Trumps personality and offered generalities but few policy proposals to back them up  especially on the economy and jobsIn Philadelphia Democrats are expected to remind voters that the economy was roaring during Bill Clintons presidency and has improved considerably during Obamas Yet they also will acknowledge that there is more to doThere is an opening for someone who can create some hope that she knows how to make things better with some specific ideas said Ayres the Republican pollsterStriking the right tone on the state of the country and the proper balance between a celebration of the Democratic base and an appeal for broader unity remain the biggest tests for ClintonI dont think the American public desires to have Happy days are here again Democratic pollster Hart said The ability to condense the Clinton message into something which is both hopeful and realistic would make a huge difference
