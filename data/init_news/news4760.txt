Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday seemed to dial back his preelection remarks opposing the creation of a Palestinian state  but that did little to ease the emerging standoff between his government and the Obama administration which reportedly is considering going to the UN to pressure Israel on the matterThe Israeli prime minister shortly before Tuesdays election had said he would not allow a Palestinian state on his watchBut on Thursday Netanyahu claimed he hadnt actually changed his positionI didnt retract any of the things I said in my speech six years ago calling for a solution in which a demilitarized Palestinian state recognizes a Jewish state Netanyahu told Fox News Megyn KellyHe clarified that he thinks the conditions for a twostate solution today are not achievable  since he said Palestinian leaders do not accept Israel as a Jewish state and terrorists could occupy any territory Israel withdraws fromBut he also told MSNBC he ultimately wants a sustainable peaceful twostate solution if circumstances changeThe latest comments however were greeted with skepticism by Obama administration officialsHe made clear the administration is focusing on what Netanyahu said before the election and not on what hes saying now Earnest accused Netanyahu of backing away from the commitment to a twostate solution with those earlier commentsIt does raise questions about his commitment to that solution Earnest saidIn a stark warning Earnest said the position the US historically has taken before the United Nations  protecting Israel from intervention  was based on the idea of a twostate outcome He said that foundation has now been eroded and the US is reevaluating its positionThe White House said late Thursday that Obama had called Netanyahu to congratulate him on his winand reiterated the US commitment to a twostate solution that results in a secure Israel alongside a sovereign and viable PalestineEarnests comments came amid reports that the Obama administration is indeed considering looking to the UN to pressure Israel into a peace deal with the Palestinians despite historically blocking such action at the world bodyForeign Policy reported Thursday that the US is looking at supporting a UN Security Council resolution calling for peace talks and a comprehensive settlementThe more the new Israeli government veers to the right the more likely you will see something at the United Nations in New York a Western diplomat told Foreign PolicyNetanyahu told Fox News he hopes the Obama administration is not seriously considering thisI hope thats not true and I think that President Obama has said time and time again as Ive said that the only path to a peace agreement is an agreement a negotiated agreement You cant impose it he told Fox News You cant force the people of Israel whove just elected me by a wide margin to bring them peace and security to secure the State of Israel to accept terms that would endanger the very survival of the State of Israel I dont think thats the direction of American policy I hope its notBut Obama administration officials are leaving the door openAfter the election the Obama administration made clear it still supports a twostate solution and would work to achieve it  somehow Officials would not say whether that means going through the United Nations But they didnt rule it out eitherWe havent made a decision State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday Its just natural that we would be looking at the different optionsBased on PM Netanyahus comments we will need to reevaluate our position and the way forward Were not going to get ahead of any decisions about what the United States would do with regard to potential action at the UN Security Council a senior administration official also told Fox News on ThursdayThe potential shift comes after Netanyahus Likud Party won big in Tuesdays election  positioning him for a third consecutive term as prime ministerThe consideration of going to the UN underscores the growing rift between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations The two already at odds over a pending Iran nuclear deal Netanyahu staked out a new area of disagreement with his Palestinian state commentsThe prospect of UN interference already is raising the hackles of the IsraelisAfter a UN spokesman on Wednesday said it is incumbent on the Israelis to pursue a peace deal and support the creation of a Palestinian State among other conditions Israels ambassador to the UN Ron Prosor fired backThe United Nations may disagree with the policies of the Israeli government but there is one fact that cant be disputed  that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East he said If the UN is so concerned about the future of the Palestinian people it should be asking why President Abbas is in the tenth year of a fiveyear presidential term or why Hamas uses the Palestinian people as human shieldsThe Palestinians had urged the UN Security Council to accept a resolution demanding that the Israelis leave Palestinian territories The US opposed itForeign Policy reported however that France is now pressing the US to take another look at a separate resolution which they offered calling for resumed peace talks toward a final dealDiplomats told Foreign Policy there are still significant differences between the US and French approaches but suggested they could be resolved Foreign Policy reports that the US delegation also could simply abstain on a UN resolution voteThe dynamic on the council also has changed in recent monthsWhen the Security Council last voted on the Arab nationbacked measure to set a deadline for peace talks and Israels withdrawal from the territories supporters could not secure the nine votes needed for adoption from the 15member council  meaning the US which opposed it did not have to exercise a veto to block it However with Venezuela now on the council supporters could have the needed nine votes today  forcing the US to make a decision on whether to vetoFox News Jonathan Wachtel and Kimberly Schwandt contributed to this report
