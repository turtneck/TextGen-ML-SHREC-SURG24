Thats one way to quickly characterize the difference between a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton and Bernie SandersWhen Democrats visit political events for these two presidential candidates its a markedly different experienceFor months crowds have been a central part of the Sanders strategy a critical ingredient in how he has overtaken Clinton in early New Hampshire polls come within striking distance in Iowa and has raised nearly as much money The idea behind the big rallies  in college towns and elsewhere across the country  was hatched by his small team of advisers to elevate Sanders surrounding him with tens of thousands of peopleFor Clinton the calculation has been different Democrats have already seen her on the big stage so the decision was made to intentionally make her events small so she could build a more direction connection with votersShe holds far more holds far more questionandanswer sessions with voters than big speeches allowing her to demonstrate her wideranging knowledge and readiness to be president But lost along the way has been some of the outward enthusiasm for her candidacy Crowds can be like campaign yard signs Reading too much into the size is fraught with peril The only number that counts of course is on Election Day But until then Sanders is filling the stadiums
