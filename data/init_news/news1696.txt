Originally appeared at The Blog Mire Following on from her recent piece for Time magazine  in which she so eloquently explained why America is indispensable and exceptional TheBlogMire brings you an exclusive piece in which Mrs Clinton explains why an indispensable and exceptional nation must have an indispensable and exceptional leader Warning May contain traces of satire If theres one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of my career in public service its this I am an exceptional woman A great unselfish compassionate woman to paraphrase Robert Kennedy And when you add up all my advantages its clear Im indispensable too  someone all others can look to for leadership And what Im really excited about is not just that Im indispensable but that Im about to become President of the indispensable nation An indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman An indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation Its a match made in heaven which is why I am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on November 8th  so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are So what makes me so indispensable Im indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces Our military is the greatest in history with the best troops training and technology and I believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential Its essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform and I intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency Im indispensable because of my commitment to the truth Throughout my career Ive always sought to stay close to the truth I know that theres a lot of folks out there who say Im corrupt But those who know me closest will tell you that this isnt the real Hillary Ask those who know me best Ask my husband Bill Hell tell you Ask my campaign chairman John Podesta Hell tell you Ask Lloyd Blankfein CEO at Goldman Sachs Hell tell you Ask some of our closest allies in places like Saudi Arabia Theyll tell you They will all tell you about the real Hillary and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none It may even be my most exceptional quality Alongside humility Im also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters You only have to look at who they are Has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate America I dont think so But it does tell you something doesnt it I humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me Im indispensable because unlike Donald Trump I dont need to rely on the help of people like Vladimir Putin and countries like Russia to help get me elected Can you imagine me having to rely on Putin and Russia to get elected Of course Ive had to bring Putin and Russia up in this campaign from time to time not because I want to keep bringing Putin and Russia into it In fact the only reason Ive occasionally mentioned Putin and Russia is not because I want to keep talking about Putin and Russia but because I have to keep taking about Putin and Russia because Trump is depending on Putin and Russia to get him elected and so I have to draw attention to Putin and Russia But trust me if I had my way I wouldnt bring Putin and Russia up at all Im indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators and establishing democracy and peace Like Libya for example We came We saw He died And the Libyans got their liberty Most of all Im indispensable  and exceptional  because of my values Take my commitment to human rights which I have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a womans right to terminate her pregnancy right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human Take my commitment to raising money which my husband and I have shown through our tireless work with the Clinton Foundation and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations Take my commitment to making the world a better place which Ive shown time and time again by saying things like love trumps hate Which it does doesnt it Im proud of that expression But with all of these advantages comes responsibility  I need to lead the world You need me to lead the world Because if I fail to lead I will leave a vacuum that lets extremists Putin and Russia haters bigots the intolerant Putin and Russia the severely backwards  the Julian Assanges of this worldPutin and Russia  Baskets of Deplorables  take root everywhere Of course being exceptional doesnt mean that other people dont also have something to offer  maybe they do But I have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace progress and prosperity around the world which I intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency by standing up to Putin and Russia and showing Putin and Russia whos boss Ill never stop doing good Never Thats what makes me great Im good because Im great and Ill tell you one thing Ill never stop Thats why Im indispensable Lets keep me exceptional Did you enjoy this article  Consider helping us Russia Insider depends on your donations the more you give the more we can do 1 10
