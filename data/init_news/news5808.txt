One of the biggest mysteries about the long con of Donald Trumps presidential campaign is how he has convinced millions of middleclass white Americans that he truly gives a shit about them How can it be Ive often wondered that a billionaire who lives in a pinkmarble triplex high above Fifth Avenue one who flies around in his own aging Boeing 757 and who owns a weekend home in Palm Beach and property in New Jersey horse country can somehow become the hero of the people left in the wake of the new digital economy These voters indeed have every right to wonder what happened to their American dream They have every right to be worried about their livelihood and their future They have every right to be equally terrified and aggrieved about the slow growth of the real economy and how it has made the life that we have come to expect for generations all but unattainableTrump of course has never quite evidenced sympathy for the common man According to a recent bombshell report in The Washington Post in fact we now know that Trumps own foundation reportedly spent 20000 to purchase a sixfoot portrait of Trump himself Perhaps Trumps appeal to the Rust Belt results in part from the fact that he is a former television star who showed up in our living rooms every week in a fictitious corporate boardroom Sara Flynn a 55yearold mother of four sons in Hebron Kentucky recently explained to reporters from The New York Times that she has liked Trump ever since she watched him on The Apprentice She said that she believes Trump when he says he can make America great again She seemed wistful Thats a bygone era thats when America was great she said of the old days It hasnt been like that for meI suspect part of the reason that Flynn and others like her feel an affinity for Trump is because of the promises he makes in his speeches like the one he gave on Thursday to the Economic Club of New York at the Waldorf Astoria hotel which is now owned by a Chinese insurance company The speech was likely written by one of the Reaganera economic disciples who whisper in Trumps ears these days Maybe it was Larry Kudlow the exBear Stearns economist and CNBC veteran he was on the dais over Trumps right shoulder Or maybe it was Stephen Moore formerly a columnist at The Wall Street Journal who is now a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation Trumps words certainly sounded a bit like Reagans Fresh from his twohour photoop in Flint Michigan the day before he told the invitationonly crowd in New York It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldnt drink the water in Mexico Now the cars are made in Mexico and you cant drink the water in FlintIts a good line and Trump presumably knew it He had in fact also used it in Flint the day before Like some of what Trump says it is funny But like much of what he says it isnt true We make millions of cars and car parts in America A recent study by the Center for Automotive Research in fact revealed that the auto industry accounts for about 3 percent or nearly 75 billion of all foreign direct investment in the United StatesBut Trumps brand depends upon fever dreams more than realities Trump laid the promises on thick at the Waldorf We are going to turn this around he continued My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise and that all thats left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources Everything that is broken today can be fixed and every failure can be turned into a great successTrump subsequently promised to create 25 million new jobsmore jobs than certain credible economists believe that there will be workers to fill He promised to cut taxes He promised to cut regulations He promised to repatriate the trillions of dollars in corporate profithe estimated the figure at 5 trillionand to make childcare costs tax deductible He promised to rip up the trade agreements that he despises NAFTA and the TPP He promised that the economy which has been stuck at around 2 percent annual economic growth for the last 10 years or so would start growing at 35 percent per year and maybe 4 percent per year if everything goes as he predicts it will Should that happen Trump suggested our 600 billion annual deficit would decreaseHe also promised to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created he said It will be amazing to watch He then engaged in a little voodoo economics We are proposing a 44 trillion tax cut that will score as 26 trillion under a dynamic growth model which is how taxes should be scored he said If Larry Kudlow is around could he please translate that sentence into a language one of Trumps supporters or even mere journalists might understand Trump then promised to put coal miners and steel workers back to work despite the fact that so many of the companies that operate in the coal sector face existential struggles and those that operate in the steel sector are a shadow of their former selves
