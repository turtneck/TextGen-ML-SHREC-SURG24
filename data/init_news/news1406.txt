Political scientists have known for years that political polarization is largely a onesided phenomenon in recent decades the Republican Partyhas moved to the right much faster than Democrats have moved to the left As Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution has described it Republicans have become a radical insurgencyideologically extreme contemptuous of the inherited policy regime scornful of compromise unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts evidence and science and dismissive of the legitimacy of their political oppositionThe data backing this claim up are pretty solid The most widelyused measure of political polarization a score of ideology based on voting developed by Kenneth Poole and Howard Rosenthal has shown that the Republicans in the Senate and especially the House have drifted away from the center far more rapidly than Democrats The chart below taken from the most recent slice of their data released just last month illustrate this pretty clearlyRight around 1975 the Republican party sharply turned away from the center line and hasnt looked back The Democrats have been drifting away from the center too but nowhere near as quicklyEvery once in awhile an oped writer will come along and make a qualitative argument along the lines of no really its theDemocrats who are polarizing Peter Wehner a former official in three previous Republican presidential administrations did just that in the pages of the New York Times last week His argument amounts to the notion that since PresidentObama has pursued some policies that are more liberal than Bill Clintonsthe Democratic Party has moved substantially further to the left than the Republican Party has shifted to the rightWell no  just look at the chart above Heres another way of looking at it How many moderates are in each party Heres another interesting chart from the PooleRosenthal data showing the number of House members in each party who arenotcentrists  that is whose ideological scores put them on the more extreme ends of the partisan scaleAs you can see in the most recent Congress nearly 90 percent of Republican House members arenot politically moderate By contrast 90 percent of Democratic membersare moderates Its quite difficult to square a chart like this with a claim that Democrats are abandoning the center faster than Republicans As the chart shows there are plenty of centrist Democrats left in the House  but hardly any centrist RepublicansIts worth pointing out that none of this is happening in a vacuum  House Republicans are become more extreme because Republican voters are electing more extreme candidates We see many of these same patterns playing out among the electorate as well as a massive Pew Research Study demonstrated last year
