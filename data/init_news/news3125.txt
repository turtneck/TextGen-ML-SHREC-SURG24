We Are Change North Dakota had nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years none of which were reported to the publicFrom January 2012  September 2013 these pipeline spills were just a part of approximately 750 oil field incidents that took place in the state without the publics knowledge according to a report by The Associated Press  Its estimated that around 4328 barrels worth of oil were spilled in this period In an another case a break in a Tesoro Corp pipeline resulted in approximately 20600 barrels of oil spreading over an area the size of seven football fields Officials claimed that no wildlife or water sources were harmed by the spill which apparently led them to conclude that the public did not need to be notifiedThe only incident in which the public was notified was an instance in which an oil truck was involved in a collision in 2012While many of these spills were relatively small and arguably had little environmental impact landowners expressed outrage that they were kept out of the loop North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources director Lynn Helms said that they didnt want the public to become overwhelmed by little incidentsHowever landowners like wheat farmer Louis Kuster said it is absolutely important for us to know if spills of any kind occur particularly given his livelihoods reliance on the health of his land Even a single barrel of spilled oil has the potential to ruin water sources and acres upon acres of valuable croplandRight now you dont know if there is a spill unless you find it yourself Kuster saidWhile the release of APs report ultimately led to more regulations obliging the public release of reported oil spills including an online database of spills accessible to the public  this history of secrecy provides a troubling context for the Sioux Tribes distrust of the DAPL pipeline constructionThe Sioux Tribe says that the pipeline threatens the Tribes environmental and economic wellbeing and would damage and destroy sites of great historic religious and cultural significance to the TribeIn a tense standoff with heavily armed police forces dozens of protesters  referring to themselves as peaceful water protectors  were arrested today for demonstrating against the construction of the pipeline on what police say is private propertyNathan Wellman is a Los Angelesbased journalist author and playwright Follow him on Twitter LightningWOW Ht httpusuncutcomnewsnorthdakota292oilspills2yearsofficialsdisclosed1public The existence of an officially listed endangered species a small butterfly called the Poweshiek Skipperling  Oarisma poweshiek   with federally designated Critical Habitat areas in North Dakotas McKenzie County has been flagged by activists as possibly relevant to challenging the pipeline permit  More species info The endangered Poweshiek Skipperling Oarisma poweshiek Photo via US Fish and Wildlife Service by Gerald Selby Nine other endangered species present in McKenzie County are referenced in the US Army Corps of Engineers documents  but not the Poweshiek SkipperlingAccording to the US Fish and Wildlife Service two units of Critical Habitat lie near the Missouri River in McKenzie County Along the entire pipeline route residents fear erosion and runoff problems including many Iowa farmers but there is no mitigation mentioned in official documents for the butterflys sensitive federally protected areas in McKenzie CountyBesides bulldozing areas near protected species enclaves private capital has brought with it private agents of violence to impose its will Controversial private security forces involved with violently forcing aside pipeline opponents include 10 Code LLC  based in nearby Bismarck ND The shocking attack dogs unleashed on Indigenous water protectors including a child and pregnant womanRELATED BREAKING The NEW Election FEC Violation That Should End Clintons Campaign  Russia Trolls The US Offers A Helping Hand In Overseeing Elections Follow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat LukeWeAreChange fbook httpsfacebookcomLukeWeAreChange Twitter httpstwittercomLukewearechange I nstagram httpinstagramcomlukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1 a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too  12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post North Dakota had 292 oil spills in 2 years officially disclosed 1 to the public appeared first on We Are Change
