By Lambert Strether of Corrente  TTP TTIP TISA CETA The provisional application of CETA refers to the fact that some thingslike the tariff reductionswill come into operation immediately assuming the European Parliament agrees But other areas notably the ISDSICS must wait for full ratification of the deal That requires all of the EUs 28 member states to go through national ratification processes which will probably take several years  Ars Technica  And despite what the commission would have you think it is by no means certain that all the national parliaments will approve CETA More For example a tweet by Katharina Nocun pointed out that leftwing and green parties could block its passage in Germany At various times there have been hints that other countries parliaments may not agree to the deal but its not yet clear what the current situation is around the EU Another serious threat to CETAs coming into force are legal challenges As part of the deal to obtain Wallonias permission to sign CETA the EU agreed that the ICS framework would be examined by the EUs highest court the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU If the CJEU finds that the approach is incompatible with the EUs fundamental principles it will either have to be dropped from CETA and TTIP  or CETA itself will fall as will TTIP In addition there are two constitutional challenges to CETA one in Canada  and one in Germany Good wrapup of the state of play TTIP  A muchdebated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new US administration after Novembers elections EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday  Reuters  TTIP dresses up for Halloween As a zombie TPP new Zealand Prime Minister John Key believes

Representatives this year but with well over a dozen competitive races still viewed as tossups just one week before Election Day the extent of that gain  and whether Republicans can stem the bleeding and keep a strong grip on their majority  remains uncertain  RealClearPolitics  GOP insiders say their polling in swing districts has stabilized and they feel energized by the news Friday that the FBI

the Podesta emails show how America is run Thomas Frank Guardian  The emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clintons campaign chair John Podesta They are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest they are by and large pretty satisfied pretty contented Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live on the contrary they are the ones for whom such stories are written This bunch doesnt have to make do with a combover TV mountebank for a leader for this class the choices are always pretty good and this year they happen to be excellent They are the comfortable and welleducated mainstay of our modern Democratic party They are also the grandees of our national media the architects of our software the designers of our streets the high officials of our banking system the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or finetune the Middle East with precision droning They are they think not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones the people who must be answered to but who

increase in orders is centered in domestic demand though export orders also improved Backlogs are another plus rising to the best level in three months Based on this report the manufacturing sector after a flat year is now accelerating into year end But There is nothing in the ISM or Markit reports that would leave one to think manufacturing is on the mend  Econintersect  Institute For Supply Management Manufacturing Index October 2016 ISMs manufacturing sample reported no better than moderate conditions below consensus But new orders are a disappointment still showing monthly growth but at a much slower rate  Econoday  The construction sector despite unusually low mortgage rates has been struggling this year with the softness in singlefamily housing posing continued challenges for

can lead the BLS data up to one year  Econintersect  New Normal Another factor too is the productive capacity that was built up to support a consumption engine that is no longer running at full tilt Companies have more equipment and infrastructure than they are currently using and with unused capacity there is little reason to invest in new equipment or technologies This helps explain the weak rate of capital spending in GDP  and may also help answer the vexing question of why productivity gains are so anemic After all productivity might be enhanced by innovation which requires research and investment  Econintersect  Construction Spending September 2016 Construction spending remains weak but indications on housing do show limited improvement  Econoday  And well below the consensus forecast  Econintersect  But Overall however  construction is now contracting after spending nearly 5 years expanding yearoveryear Still note that the rolling averages did improve  Econintersect  But
