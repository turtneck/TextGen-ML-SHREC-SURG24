Washington CNN Even before the debris from the Paris terrorist attacks was swept away politicians began sounding the alarm that Syrian refugees could be a national security threat to the United States The issue has dominated the US political conversation during the week since gunmen and suicide bombers terrorized Paris on a Friday nightAll Republican presidential candidates called on President Barack Obama to renege on his pledge to admit 10000 refugees fleeing Syrias brutal civil war into the US and argued instead for a full stop fearing terrorists could infiltrate their ranksThirtyone governors have declared Syrian refugees unwelcome in their states and on Thursday the House passed a bill to bar refugees from Syria and Iraq from entering the US Nearly 50 Democrats joined 242 Republicans to pass the bill which the White House has threatened to veto Sen Ted Cruz a Republican presidential candidate suggested the US only accept Christian refugees  Ben Carson another candidate likened refugees to rabid dogs threatening the neighborhoodBut those responses ignore one very important fact the refugee program is quite simply the toughest way for a foreigner to legally enter the United States There are other security gaps that would be easier for wouldbe terrorists to exploitWere any of the Paris attackers refugeesAs of now none of the Paris attackers have been confirmed as having entered Europe as refugeesIn fact most of the Paris attackers were European citizens born in France or Belgium Two of them appear to have entered Europe through Greece although it doesnt appear that they came in through a refugee programPerhaps more importantly the European refugee admission system is dramatically different from the US system for Syrians in large part because the US is geographically separated from Syria The US has the opportunity to do far more vetting before refugees arrive on their shoresHow does a refugee get into the USRefugees must undergo an 18 to 24month screening process minimum that the United Nations refugee arm oversees And thats before individual countries even begin to consider a refugees application and conduct their own additional interviews and background checksThe screening process generally includes multiple interviews background checks and an extensive crossreferencing process that tests refugees stories against others and accounts from sources on the ground in their home countryThroughout that process UN officials and local government officials in temporary host countries like Turkey Jordan and Lebanon look to determine the legitimacy of asylum seekers claims and ensure that they meet the criteria of a refugee including that they are not and have not been involved in any fighting or terrorist activitiesRefugees also have their retinas scanned and have their fingerprints liftedChristopher Boian a spokesman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees called the process stringent and long and complexIf at any stage in that process there is ever the slightest shadow of a doubt or the slightest whisper of suspicion they are removed from the process That is that Boian saidThe very very few Syrian refugees who are accepted and referred for consideration for resettlement in another country  there simply is no more closely scrutinized population on earth these days he addedThats because other countries have so far pledged to resettle just 159000 of the more than 4 million Syrian refugees  setting an extremely high bar for resettlementAnd refugees arent automatically considered for resettlement only the most vulnerable refugees  such as torture victims female heads of household people with serious medical conditions and other especially vulnerable groupsSo after they go through that process by the UN the US does an additional screeningThats right After a rigorous screening process and several interviews carried out by the UN refugee agency refugees the US agrees to consider for resettlement have to undergo an additional interview medical evaluation and security screeningAccording to one US government official theres an additional layer of vetting thats specific to Syrian applicants including special briefings for interviewers and information from the US intelligence communityThe security screening involves checks against several government agencies databases and terrorist watch lists using biographic and biometric information Its a process Mark Toner a State Department spokesman recently called the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United StatesAnd Syrian refugees get an additional more targeted layer of screening involving the US Intelligence agency according to a government officialSounds pretty rigorous How does the refugee process stack up to other ways of getting into the USThe refugee program is simply the toughest way for any foreigner to enter the US legallyFor most people getting a tourist visa to enter the United States is much easier but still requires an inperson interview and involves a typical background check The process takes anywhere from a few days to a couple monthsBut theres an even easier way to get into the US if youre a citizen of one of 38 mostly European countries including France and BelgiumAs a sign that the Obama administration agrees that there are gaps that need closing one of the US officials said in the coming days the administration expects to announce plans for additional steps to be taken with European countries that participate in the visa waiver programSen Angus King an independent from Maine who sits on the intelligence committee said it would be much harder for a terrorist to get into the country through the refugee program than with a passport from one of the 38 countries in the visa waiver programThe refugee process would take 18 months to two years Under the visa waiver program it could take 24 hours King told CNN in a phone interview The target of our work should be strengthening the visa waiver programWe do need to pay attention to whether the terrorists could infiltrate the refugee flow I dont think its something we should ignore but the amount of vetting that goes on there already is very through King addedSo is that program getting strengthenedA bipartisan proposal to do just that is gaining momentum on Capitol HillNoting that 20 million people each year use the visa waiver program to visit the United States Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalifornia said in a Thursday news conference that a bill she is proposing with Sen Jeff Flake RArizona would help guard against terrorists trying to exploit the programTerrorists could exploit the program could go from France to Syria as 2000 fighters have done come back to France use the visa waiver program and without further scrutiny come into the United States said Feinstein a senior member of the intelligence committeeThe FeinsteinFlake bill which is set to be formally introduced after Thanksgiving would keep foreigners whove traveled to Syria or Iraq in the last five years from using the visa waiver program It would also mandate fingerprinting for all travelers entering the US from visa waiver countries and requires all foreigners from those countries to have a modern passport that has an embedded echip that is more secure and includes an individuals biometric information and other dataFlake the bills Republican sponsor told reporters Thursday the refugee program could be strengthened to include better tracking of refugees once they arrive in the country but said touted the rigorous process as something that shouldnt be a source of concernOn the front end it is a very thorough vetting that they get So of all the things that we ought to be concerned about that is not at the top of the list he said
