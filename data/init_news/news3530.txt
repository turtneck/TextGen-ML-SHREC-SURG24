Fargo North Dakota CNN Ted Cruz claimed a majority of delegates in North Dakota on Sunday  though the delegates are not bound to him so their loyalty remains uncertainNorth Dakota Republicans selected 25 national delegates and of those 18 were on a list of preferred delegates that Cruz circulated  a clear win for the Texas senatorThe delegates met Sunday evening just as the convention ended and selected State Party Chairman Kelly Armstrong to be chair their convention delegation and chose Republican National Committeeman Curly Haugland and RNC Committeewoman Sandy Boehler to serve on the powerful convention rules committeeParty leaders make up many of the slots including Gov Jack Dalrymple First Lady Betsy Dalrymple Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem and top party donors But party activists won a good number of slots tooThe delegates who said they were supporting Cruz Sunday were adamant in their support Rick Becker who ran a close race for the Republican nomination for governor at the convention said he didnt want to hold out making a decision in order to be wooed by candidatesShould I play that game No I dont care If I was actually undecided Id say that but I just kind of Im always standing by principle as boring as that might be I know Im going to support Cruz I cant fathom what would occur Becker said Holding out for a helicopter ride or the goodie bags or all that kind of crap Im just Im not interested in thatWith the delegates formally unbound and free to make their own decisions at the national convention it would be impossible to declare North Dakotas results a clear win for any of the three campaigns But the race was on Sunday evening to do just that anyway The Cruz campaign sought to portray the results as an unequivocal winIm thrilled to have the vote of confidence of Republican voters in North Dakota who delivered such a resounding victory today Cruz said in a statement As I met them over the weekend North Dakota Republicans recognized that I am the only candidate who can move this country forward by protecting freedom and liberty Whether we defeat Donald Trump before the convention or at it Im energized to have the support of the vast majority of North Dakota delegatesEven though none of the 17 national delegates contacted by CNN said they were voting for Kasich the Ohio governors campaign claimed a victory of sorts Sunday eveningCruz strong arm tactics fail in ND where he lost key floor vote  helped elect delegates who will vote johnkasich in Cleveland NDGOP16 tweeted top Kasich strategist John WeaverCruz himself addressed the North Dakota Republican gathering Saturday The other campaigns sent surrogates Former candidate Ben Carson rallied the more than 1600 state delegates for Trump Sunday morning with a speech focused heavily on faith and his efforts to teach Trump religion and spirituality But behind the scenes he lobbied North Dakota Republican brass oneononeAhead of Sundays speech he pulled Haugland into a private meeting he also met privately with former Gov Ed Schafer the night beforeWe had an opportunity to really explain things to explain rationale for doing things Carson told CNN backstage at the Scheels Arena I said the proof will be in the pudding well see how it all comes outAs the delegates packed into this Fargo hockey arena for the final day of their state convention the Trump Cruz and Kasich campaigns worked furiously to identify supporters Republicans were scheduled to vote for 25 national delegates from a list of 74 nominated delegatesBut the states unique delegate selection process  which lets delegates vote for whichever candidate they prefer at the national convention  led to much battling between the campaignsNorth Dakotas lone congressman Rep Kevin Cramer endorsed Trump Sunday shortly before North Dakota Republicans began selecting the delegates to the national conventionIts something Id been processing for a long time and it really culminated with my online straw poll where I really did want to give voice to the people who cant be here Cramer saidBecause the delegates will be unbound they are not formally committed to any campaign But that didnt stop the campaigns from working to set expectations so they could claim victoryTrump adviser Barry Bennett told CNN that a plurality on the list of 25 preferred were leaning toward Trump after a strong lobbying effort from Cramer who Bennett called the Trump operations Sherpa over the course of the hectic weekendWell be drinking champagne here all day Bennett said if the slate of 25 delegates picked by party leaders earlier this weekend passes in the convention Of the 25 people the party leaders put forward 16 were chosen and nine new delegates were selectedStill as is the case on the ground in states around the country Cruzs campaign has had a strong presence in and around the convention In addition to Cruzs speech on Saturday Carly Fiorina the former presidential candidate and top Cruz surrogate has been meeting publicly and privately with potential delegates since FridayAs many as 10 of the delegates on the preferred list have indicated some or solid public support for CruzKasichs delegate wranglers were equally optimistic Saturday after reviewing the list of party picks saying they saw at least 20 on their who could be swayed to their sideIn the end however the decisions will not be known until the delegates place their vote on the first ballot at the national convention in Cleveland
