by Brian Shilhavy Editor Health Impact News 15 years ago I was the first one to import a high quality saturated fat called Virgin Coconut Oil from the Philippines and market it in the US market Coconut oil is a traditional fat that has been consumed for thousand of years in tropical climates where historically western diseases like heart disease diabetes obesity and others were not common in spite of their high saturated fat diet During World War II when the Japanese cut of the supply of the high saturated fat edible oils like coconut oil and palm oil with their occupation of the Philippines and other Southeastern nations industry in the US developed the expellerpressed method of extracting oil from seeds that had not previously been a source of dietary oil mainly the US cash crops of soybeans and corn These polyunsaturated oils were not shelfstable edible oils so the industrial process of homogenization was developed to make them more shelf stable and behave more like shelfstable saturated fats Politics not science influenced government agencies like the USDA to promote these new polyunsaturated oils as more healthy than saturated fats A new dietary dogma of lowfat was developed and history now shows that Americas health greatly suffered as a result Until even today we have seen very high numbers of obesity diabetes and heart disease plaguing Americans So it was with much opposition 15 years ago that I presented the real science behind coconut oil and saturated fats but many now are waking up to the terrible consequences of following the governmentsponsored lowfat diet dogma for so many years One can truly turn their health around by simply making a dietary choice as to the types of fats one consumes and increase the consumption of healthy fats particularly when those fats in the diet replace harmful processed carbohydrates The Science of Fats Information that Could Change Your Life From November 7  14 Dr Mark Hyman  Dr Carrie Diulus and over 30 of the worlds top experts on fats will participate in an online FREE summit dispeling the biggest MYTHS about fat and revealing the latest research about how to eat move and supplement your diet for improved health and longevity Join these worldrenowned experts such as Aseem Malhotra MD one of Britains top cardiologists Amy Myers MD  Gary Taubes famous science author that challenged mainstream medias dogma on fats Sayer Ji Founder of GreenMedInfocom bestselling author Nina Teicholz  Peter Attia MD  and dozens of others Theres so much confusion and misinformation out there about FATboth the fat on our bodies and the fats we eat Youve been told that eating fat makes you fat  and increases your risk for heart disease and other chronic illnesses  but fat is NOT the enemy The truth is eating MORE FAT can help shut down cravings accelerate weight loss and potentially prevent or reverse disease Register today for FREE to watch this online summit Published on November 2 2016
