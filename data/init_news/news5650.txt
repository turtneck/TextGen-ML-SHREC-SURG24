geoengineeringwatchorg The power structure is continuing to fracture from within Like feuding mafia families that no longer have enough turf to exploit they will begin to turn on each other There are many predicting the manner in which the dominos will fall but who can know with any certainty There are simply too many variables and too many factors that are already far beyond the breaking point The noose is being tightened around all our necks from countless directions The ATT purchase of Time Warner and thus CNN News is just another sign of the rapid power structure consolidation Those who attempt to stand up to the fascist state are treated brutally as the Dakota pipeline protesters now know The hypocrisy of environmentalists like Leonardo DiCaprio and organizations like National Geographic is perplexing and disappointing The newly released film After The Flood by DeCaprio and National Geographic was disappointing and unfortunately only a half truth The US military continues to bomb the forces that are actually fighting ISIS why Has the human race overshot the planets ability to support the population If so who bears the blame and where do we go from here The latest installment of Global Alert News is below As the battle for the greater good becomes ever more difficult and the horizon grows darker many unfortunately abandon their post and passively sit down on the bench There is no solace in walking away from the most important struggle ever faced by the human race and at the most critical time We must never turn away we must never yield we must never give up make your voice heard in the fight for the greater good
