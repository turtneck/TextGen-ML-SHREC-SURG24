Posted on October 28 2016 by Jay Syrmopoulos Portland OR  The group of men who seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  in rural Oregon were found not guilty late Thursday vindicating brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy after the 41day standoff that brought nationwide focus to longrunning dispute over federal control of rural land in the Western United States According to a report in by the Associated Press  A jury found brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy not guilty a firearm in a federal facility and conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the 300 miles southeast of Portland where the trial took place Five codefendants also were tried one or both of the charges Ammon Bundy has a house in Emmett Despite the acquittal the Bundys were expected to stand trial in Nevada early next year on charges stemming from another highprofile standoff with federal agents Authorities rounding up cattle at their father Cliven Bundys ranch in 2014 because of unpaid grazing fees released the animals as they faced armed protesters The Bundy family initially made headlines in 2013 when the Bureau of Land Management brought armed agents in to seize rancher Cliven Bundys cattle after his refusal to pay federal authorities a massive debt  which he claims is illegitimate In response to the militarized response in Nevada by the BLM militia from across the US mobilized and coordinated a response which saw hundreds of armed Americans stand up to what they perceived as vast federal overreach What the government thought would be an openandshut case was anything but The group never denied they seized the refuge while armed or that they made demands of the government Ladies and gentlemen this case is not a whodunit Assistant US Attorney Ethan Knight said in his closing argument making the argument the group illegally commandeered a federal building The AP reports On technical grounds the defendants said they never discussed stopping individual workers from accessing their offices but merely wanted the land and the buildings On emotional grounds Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an outofcontrol federal government that has crippled the rural West Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff An FBI agent testified that 16636 live rounds and nearly 1700 spent casings were found Ammon Bundy spent three days testifying in his own defense focusing on the fact that federal overreach is destroying rural Western communities that have relied on the land  for generations in many cases Bundy made clear that the plan was to simply take control of the refuge by occupation while eventually returning it to local control Originally 26 occupiers were charged with conspiracy Eleven pleaded guilty while another had the charge dropped Seven defendants have not yet been tried Their trial is scheduled to begin February 14 according to the AP Shortly after the verdict was announced an Oregonarea reporter posted to Twitter that Ammon Bundys attorney Marcus Mumford was tackled by US Marshals after insisting that Bundy should be allowed to be released from custody with the judge subsequently ordering the courtroom cleared The armed occupiers took control of the remote bird sanctuary on January 2 in response to the prison sentences given to two local ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond after being convicted of arson in relation to an ongoing dispute with the BLM Upon occupying the refuge the group demanded that the father and son be freed and that federal officials cede control of publicly held lands to local control Ultimately the Bundy brothers and a number of their fellow occupiers were arrested in an ambush style attack while on the way to negotiate with a Sheriff It ended with officers gunning down Robert LaVoy Finicum  a charismatic group spokesman Currently numerous federal SRT agents are under investigation for lying about firing at the occupiers vehicle during the ambush The majority of the remaining occupants left the refuge in the wake of Finicums killing  with four holdouts negotiating their surrender until February 11 In the wake of the verdict both the FBI and US Attorneys Office also expressed disappointment US Attorney Billy J Williams said his office respects the verdict of the jury and thanks them for their dedicated service during this long and difficult trial For many weeks hundreds of law enforcement officers  federal state and local  worked aroundtheclock to resolve the armed occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge peacefully We believe now  as we did then  that protecting and defending this nation through rigorous obedience to the US Constitution is our most important responsibility Although we are extremely disappointed in the verdict we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system  Greg Bretzing Special Agent in Charge FBI Oregon Regardless of the sentiments of those in government and law enforcement the jury carried out justice  with this verdict solidifying that the killing of LaVoy Finnicum was nothing less than criminal  Revealing exactly why the 2nd Amendment is so important to a free people Bundy testified that the reason occupiers chose to carry guns was because they understood that they would be immediately arrested otherwise and needed to protect themselves against possible government violence There is no mistaking the difference in law enforcements response to unarmed protestors  versus those that exercise their right to bear arms One need look no further than the ongoing protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock  which has been met with numerous militarized and violent crackdowns on nonviolent water protectors  to see exactly how differently armed protesters are treated Dont forget to follow the DC Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter
