As they navigate their respective crises both Greek and Iranian governments are trumpeting a historical narrative that portrays them as the victim of bigpower efforts to subjugate the less powerfulWho do Greece and Iran think they areAs global powers find themselves locked in faceoffs with two relatively small states  economic powerhouse Germany and the European Union with Greece over its debt and the United States and five other world powers with Iran over its nuclear program  exasperation is growing among the bigs that their smaller counterparts are not bowing to reality and accepting compromise faster than they areAfter all its Greece that risks a full financial collapse without another European bailout and Iran whose economy has been slammed by international sanctions that will only be lifted if Tehran agrees to a deal limiting its nuclear ambitions and opening its nuclear facilities to inspectionThe major powers in both crises see mounting brinkmanship and intransigence where they feel reason should prevail But both Greece and Iran are engaging their more powerful interlocutors in a manner that suggests how much they are driven by the more ephemeral motivations of dignity and mutual respectThe Greek and Iranian examples arent the first instances where smaller states have used the scenario of the little guy being stepped on by big bad bullies to further their cases particularly with domestic audiences The imbalance of power in both diplomatic confrontations has seemed to reinforce the determination in Athens and Tehran to stand firm on what they see as their sovereign interestsBut even if the appeal to a sense of national dignity resonates some diplomatic analysts say taking pride too far can end up closing off escape routes to countries in crisis  ultimately working against their publics interestsIn both these cases of highpowered negotiations  Greece over its debt crisis and Iran over its nuclear program  the smaller country feels its facing the opprobrium of the rest of the world says Mark Hibbs a Berlinbased senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace That has led to an usversusthem sentiment that has fed off of each countrys strong sense of national pride and in both cases the leaders have played that card with their populationsBut in both cases too much focus on national dignity has helped push the negotiations to the brink of failure Mr Hibbs adds  an outcome he says does not serve the interests of either countryIn the Iran case international negotiations in Vienna that faced a Tuesday deadline were extended to the end of the week with both sides saying significant progress was made in recent days but that critical sticking points remainedAs for Greece a referendum Sunday that screamed nationalist pride as voters rejected Europeimposed austerity measures has been followed by Greek calls for renewed debtrelief talks and a European cold shoulder particularly from GermanyAs they navigate their respective crises both the Greek and Iranian governments are trumpeting a historical narrative that portrays them as the victim of bigpower efforts to subjugate and dominate the less powerful some analysts sayIn both Iran and Greece they have spent decades cultivating a narrative of grievance says Peter Feaver a professor of international relations at Duke University in Durham NC So in that atmosphere you have German Chancellor Angela Merkel transformed into Adolf Hitler and the America of Obama turned into the America of the 1950s when the US engineered a coup in Tehran that installed the late Shah Reza Pahlavi in power he addsTo the Western powers and international institutions dealing with Iran on nuclear ambitions and Greece on its debt that narrative is beside the point of the matters at hand its not todays story Dr Feaver says But to the Iranian and Greek delegations that longer historical context does make sense he adds It serves as a filter for distorting the policy optionsThe narrative of smaller countries confronting the injustices of the worlds arrogant powers is a longtime staple of Iranian rhetoric in particular Carnegies Hibbs says Iran has claimed an international right to an indigenous nuclear power program since the early 2000s he notes and has portrayed international efforts to investigate Irans nuclear facilities as a veiled attempt by the Great Satan and other world powers to deny Iran an international rightTo a large extent that narrative fell into disuse in Greece as the country joined the powerful club that is the European Union and then entered the even more restricted inner circle in the Eurozone But the narrative of the aggrieved has returned with a vengeance Hibbs says as Germanys powerbroker role in the countrys debtrelief negotiations has revived memories of Nazi Germanys occupation of GreeceBut Hibbs says that both Greece and Iran are picking and choosing among historical facts to suit their narrative leaving aside those that dont fit the story they wish to tellIn both cases theres a kind of historical amnesia he says You hear about rights and dignity but you dont hear Iranians acknowledging their countrys two decades of systematically violating international obligations related to the nuclear program he saysYou dont hear the Greeks saying theyre in this mess because of past financial commitments they didnt honor Hibbs adds At some point youd like part of the picture to be the Greeks facing their responsibilities in addressing their problemsDukes Feaver agrees that Greece has played up the powerful narrative of big countries imposing things on a smaller country when it should be looking at its own role in its difficultiesBut he also sees a danger in equating the Greek and Iranian cases when the game he sees Iran playing is much more about expansive ambitions than about addressing grievancesIran is a country with imperial ambitions and it plays a much more problematic role in the region and that does figure in the nuclear talks Feaver says Greeces peccadilloes are much more of the ordinary sort he adds things like a dysfunctional public sector and overspending and petty corruption So in that sense its not fair to lump them togetherMoreover he says that the Greeks face reallife upheaval and impoverishment as a result of coming to terms with Germany and the EU that go beyond the ephemeral injuries of a supposed wounded national prideThe Greeks are being asked to do things that are not just a matter of pride but which would be very disruptive of Greek citizens lives he says But in material terms what is being asked of Iran in the nuclear talks does not put in jeopardy the average Iranian citizen  although it may be problematic for the military part of the Iranian stateThe injured dignity argument may have won the Iranian regime some points at home and it may even resonate with other small statesBut Feaver says Western powers and in particular the US should stand up to it and address it for the negotiating tactic that it isI think President Obama wants to say Wait a minute Iran this is not about the little guy defying the strong its not about the powerful trying to dominate the weak this is about the rule of law
