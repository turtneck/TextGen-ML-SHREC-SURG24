Ever since AfricanAmerican men were granted the right to vote with the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870 programs were enacted to make it impossible for them to exercise the franchise And needless to say the passage of the 19th Amendment 50 years later which opened the franchise to women only resulted in even more programs to deny AfricanAmericans their ability to vote in many states All of this was quite legal under the states rights doctrine until the 1960s when President Johnson and Congress finally passed the Voting Rights Act which put the federal government in charge of monitoring the election processes of jurisdictions thatwere proven to have discriminated in the past Trying to keep racial and ethnic minorities from voting is as American as apple pieOver the years the right wing which has always been hostile to the idea of too much democracy worked to create an illusion that there was a great threat of voter fraud in America thatneeded to be dealt with by enacting extremely restrictive voter eligibility requirementsThere is no evidence of systematic voter fraudanywhere in America but that hasnt stopped therightfrom doing everything in itspower to make it difficult for ordinary people to exercise the right to vote If only they were as vigilant about preventing the very real threat of gun violenceAnd they have been helped in this task unbelievably by Democrats who are so afraid of rightwing hysteria that they actually helped the Republicans destroy one of their voting rights institutions ACORN when a rightwing con artist produced a doctored video to tarnish its reputation They didnt even wait for the facts they immediately wrung their hands and joined the metaphorical lynching It was a low point in recent civil rights history and it proved that voting rights activists cannot count on the political class to have their backs even when it means their own party will sufferVote suppression was of course the way they kept AfricanAmericans from voting during Jim Crow so even as they destroyed ACORN the usual suspects simultaneously worked to undermine the VRA and finally succeeded in having a rightwing Supreme Court majority overturn it Now Republican state governments are much freer to restrict voting so that the undesirable minorities whom they assume will vote for the Democratic Party and rightly so since Republicans are openly hostile to them will have a much more difficult time voting They will naturally keep up their assault on the ability of urban black voters to participate by eliminating polling places and reducing early voting which makes it difficult for hardworking people to participate But the latest attacks are coming from a number of other directions some of which are openly undemocratic and are increasingly focused on HispanicsFor instancethe argument inEvenwel v Abbott the latest voting case to come before the Supreme Court is that only eligible voters are entitled to representation by the government This means essentially that children legal residents former felons or the mentally ill have no representation Obviously it will mean that undocumented workers many of whom are counted in the census will not be represented As a practical matter this will have the fortuitous result for Republicans of making voting districts more rural and more white And that is the pointNobody knows how such a thing can be implemented because there is no count of eligible voters  the census doesnt ask the question and there would be no way of determining its validity anyway But the consensus among legal observers seems to be that the court will likely divide along the usual partisan lines and thus change the way representation is apportioned to favor white Republicans once againThats not the only thing they are doing For obvious reasons the biggest fear among Republicans these days is no longer the threat of black Americans voting They will certainly continue to do everything in their power to make it hard for them to exercise their rights  they are the Democrats most reliable constituency But the major threat today comes from the fastgrowing Latino population Indeed the campaign to deport immigrants and endbirthright citizenshipis hugely influenced by their fear that they will be demographically smothered in a few years by the American offspring of undocumented workersThe path to citizenship has them terrorizedas they see it as an obvious electoral advantage for the Democratic PartyThere was a time when this prospect was actually considered an opportunity for Republicans who believed that they could appeal to this voting bloc through their shared belief in family values and small business entrepreneurship One of George W Bushs greatest assets was considered to be his ability to attract Hispanics and he managed to get almost 40percentof the vote in 2000 Unfortunately for Republicans their older white constituency wants nothing to do with this  indeed they are repelled by the idea of being in the same party as a group of immigrants who dont look and sound like them George W Bush was abandoned by his party not only because of his Iraq debacle but becausehe was widely considered to be soft on immigrationAs you can see from the presidential campaignnotwithstanding the party leaders understanding of their electoral challenge this has hardened into a litmus test within the party Republican voters want immigration stopped they want a wall they want deportation of undocumented immigrants and they want birthright citizenship to be repealed The last may require a constitutional amendment although there are some cranks who insist it can be done legislatively With this rightwing majority they may even be able to get that endorsed by the Supreme Court GOP presidential candidates are required by the older white base to be openly hostile to Latinos which ensures they will not get their votes In that case since the Latino population is growing very fast and isyounger than the white population the only option aside from ethnic cleansing is to try to prevent them from voting for Democrats by making it difficult at the voting booth and diluting their representation Jim Rutenberg is writing a series on this subjectfor the New York Times Magazine thatexposes the depth and breadth of this program Its being roadtested in Texas where there exists a serious possibility if they are unable to succeed in turning back the tide of a Democratic majority in a very few years due to the rapid growth in the Hispanic population They are pulling out all the stops from local reapportionment of city council seats to the abovementioned Supreme Court case attempting to deny representation to people who are ineligible to vote And unfortunately the Republicans have one very big advantage fear They have managed to make the process so harrowing that many Latinos dont feel comfortable voting even though they have a perfect right to do so And perhaps more relevantly they are discouraged and depressed about participating in the system because of the invective and hostility coming from so many white Americans particularly those in power Getting them to turn out to vote is a huge challenge But then thats nothing new eitherHistorian Rick Perlstein quoted documentationon the subject back when he was researching his book Before the Storm about the 1964 Goldwater campaign and the rightwing takeover of the Republican Party Its a memo written by a Johnson staffer outlining the GOP vote suppression scheme called Operation Eagle Eye This quote from the memo says it all Lets get this straight the Democratic Party is just as much opposed to vote frauds as is the Republican party We will settle for giving all legally registered voters an opportunity to make their choice onNovember 3rd We have enough faith in our Party to be confident that the outcome will be a vote of confidence in President Johnson and a mandate for the President and his running mate Hubert Humphrey to continue the programs of the JohnsonKennedy Administration But we have evidence that the Republican program is not really what it purports to be It is an organized effort to prevent the foreign born to prevent Negroes to prevent members of ethnic minorities from casting their votes by frightening and intimidating them at the polling place Operation Eagle Eye was in every state in 1964 for all the good it did them One Republican lawyer very assiduously worked in Arizona that year to keep Hispanic voters from the polls and was reputed to have been very effective at intimidationHis name was William RehnquistHe went on to become chief justice of the Supreme Court His successor John Roberts worked with the recount team duringthe infamous election theft of 2000 presided over the2008 voter fraud casethat allowed states to require ID andwrote the opinion overturning the Voting Rights Act in 2014 These people play a very long game But its unlikely they will be able to suppress the Latino vote forever Their hostility may be intimidating to an older generation but the new generation is not going to accept this And there are a whole lot of young Americans of Hispanic descent If they vote this rightwing program will finally fail and fail spectacularly And it will likely take the whole Republican agenda down with it These young Americans will never identify with such a party These conservative bigots are sowing the seeds of their own demise
