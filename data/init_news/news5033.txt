Super Pacs backing Donald Trump are off to a slow and rather rocky start as they try to raise funds because the candidates rhetoric and policy pronouncements are still so incendiary and he has sent mixed signals about how much financial help he wants from outside groupsTrumps campaign war chest is dwarfed by Hillary Clintons who had 425m in the bank at the start of June compared with her Republican rivals 13m according to the Federal Election Commission Trump has taunted big donors repeatedly and bragged for months that his campaign was not going to rely on them or Super Pacs before appearing to change his tune more recentlySeveral donors backing Trump told the Guardian that the candidates errors are piling up Hes got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth said Stan Hubbard a billionaire broadcaster who has donated 100000 to the proTrump Great America Pac He needs a clearer message without namecalling Hubbard also called Trumps recent trip to Scotland  where he was criticized for hailing the plunge in the pound postBrexit as good for his golf course there  a mistake He should have let his kids do itLikewise potential Super Pac donors say Trump badly needs to curb his bombastic rhetoric and craft a better message Michael Epstein who raised big money for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and plans to vote for Trump but also hold my nose and pray said that he might back a Super Pac if Trump has a strong GOP convention next month and really turns it around But Epstein added Im less and less hopeful He cant get out of his own way Hes going to have to demonstrate more presidential behavior Theyre behind the eight ball and theyve got to move fastFour key proTrump Super Pacs have been formally launched but between them they have run only about 5m in ads By contrast the leading proClinton Super Pac Priorities USA Action in midMay began a massive television and digital ad blitz in key states reportedly slated to cost almost 130mSigns of turmoil and

met with Trump said that the candidates top fundraiser had signaled to them that a new Super Pac Make America Number One backed by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer was deemed the official one In a twist Make America Number One will seek big checks from GOP donors who are not ready to back Trump but want to stop Clinton according to BloombergDeason said that he and his father would probably write a check to a Super Pac but stressed that were waiting to see what Sheldon Adelson does a reference to billionaire Adelson who has pledged some 100m to help Trump  which Deason thinks is the amount needed for a Super Pac to really have an impactAdelson has been considering setting up his own Super Pac and talking to key Republican operatives about cobbling one together to help Trump fundraising sources told the GuardianBut the casino baron has been typically cautious and slow in opening his checkbook after at least two meetings with Trump since late MayAdelson is said to be talking to some other wealthy donors  including Home Depot cofounder Bernie Marcus and energy investor Toby Neugebauer  about teaming up on a Super Pac say fundraising sourcesOne GOP operative with ties to Adelson told the Guardian that the casino mogul may put up his funds in installments predicting that about half would come after Trump picks his running mate The operative said Adelson has been pressing Trump to choose the casino owners longtime ally Newt Gingrich the exHouse speaker or another staunchly pro Israel figure who shares Adelsons hawkish views on Israel Adelson is very succinct about his expectations said the operativeMeanwhile the existing Super Pacs are trying mightily with mixed success to bring in big checks The Great America Pac which boasts veteran GOP operative Ed Rollins as a strategist organized two events in June to woo big donors in Dallas and New York where a luncheon at the 101 Club was hosted by Peter Kalikow a wealthy real estate executive

Trumps who played a big role in getting the Super Pac launched and told CNN it had 32m in commitments met with Adelson in June to woo him but it is unclear if they will get a check Gay said that it was no secret that were well behind in fundraisingMore broadly veteran money man Fred Malek who has been a top fundraiser for GOP governors cautions that Trumps policies and temperament pose obstacles for Super Pac fundraising Malek stresses that GOP donors and voters want to see a nominee who is more inclusive rather than divisive and recognizes that politics is a game of addition and not a game of subtraction
