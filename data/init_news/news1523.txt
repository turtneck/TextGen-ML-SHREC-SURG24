The Drudge Report has aggressively portrayed Ted Cruzs sweep of all the delegates from Colorados Republican convention as a corrupt power grabThe site named for Matt Drudge who broke the story of Bill Clintons affair with Monica Lewinsky and still runs it links to nine stories this morning with salacious headlines about the convention Among them Savage Cruz should disavow rigged Colorado election  Buchanan Apparatchiks thieve delegates for Ted  1 MILLION REPUBLICANS SIDELINED  Border Patrol Agents Colorado Voters Disenfranchised Keep in mind that this is three days after the Colorado conventionOur analytics partners at Zignal Labs say the Drudge attacks are breaking through on social media in a significant way This word cloud which tracks all Cruz mentions since Saturday shows the extent to which Drudge has shaped the conversation about Cruzs win in Colorado Note the prominence of the words cheating and drudgeThis kind of squabbling will only get louder as the delegate wrestling and wrangling intensifies And it has clearly gotten under Cruzs skinIn a radio interview yesterday the Texas senator ripped into Drudge as an arm of Donald Trumps campaign In about the past month the Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Trump campaign he told conservative host Mike Slater So every day they have the latest Trump attack Theyre directed at me  Most days they have a sixmonthold article that is some attack on me and its whatever the Trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on DrudgeBy the way they no longer cover news Cruz added of Drudge When we win a state suddenly the state doesnt matter You know Colorado  there was no red siren on Drudge when we won all 34 delegates in ColoradoDrudge responded by posting a link to a January Fox Newsinterview in which Cruz praised the conservative site for breaking the mainstream medias strangleholdIts never good to pick a fight with a guy who buys ink by the barrel as they say Or whatever the 2016 version of that line isIf it was just Trump complaining about the crooked system it would seem like sour grapes from a guy who got outhustled But The Donalds allies in the rightwing media including Drudge and Breitbart are trying tomake Cruzs wins seem illegitimate in the eyes of the conservative baseIf Cruz wins the nomination at a contested convention in Cleveland he will need these grassroots activiststo rally around him If regular Drudge readers believe he did not win fair and square they will be less inclined to do soInterestingly the increasing scrutiny from Drudge comes as the Democratic National Committee begins to train more of its fire at Cruz After focusing almost singlemindedly on Trump for months the DNC held a press call yesterday to blast the Texan ahead of campaign stops in California Ironically they pushed a similar message as Drudge Cruzs campaign is proving to be just as divisive for the Republican Party as his tenure in the Senate has been for our country said the DNC communications director Thats why there just isnt a whole lot of excitement for Cruz being the Republican nominee Donald Trump says he identifies with Howard Roark from Ayn Rands The Fountainhead He praised the novel and its protagonist in a broader interview with USA Today that posted yesterday It relates to business beauty life and inner emotions That book relates to  everything the GOP frontrunner told the paper Columnist Kirsten Powers writes that she pointed out that The Fountainhead is in a way about the tyranny of groupthink Trump reportedly sat up and told her Thats what is happening hereFor those who havent read the booksince high school Roark is an architect who dynamites a housing project he designed because he is angry about changes that others made to his blueprints Hes then put on trial for arson but a jury acquits him after he delivers an eloquent speech about the need to always stay true to ones self Gary Cooper delivered the courtroom monologue in the 1949 film adaptationBottom line Roark is a selfcentered individualist who steadfastly refuses to submit to the will of others He is presented as the authors version of an ideal man  one who embodies the virtues of Rands objectivist philosophy the CliffNotes character analysis explains Roark is an example of free will  the theory that an individual has the power by virtue of the choices he makes to control the outcome of his own life A mans thinking and values are not controlled by God or the fates or society or any external factor  but solely by his own choiceIs The Donald threatening to blow up the Republican Party if hes spurned in Cleveland He almost certainly has not thought through the implications of publicly identifying with Roark and embracing objectivism But its nonetheless another revealing window into his psycheIts also a reflection of how Trump does not play by the same rules that normal politicians mustIn2012Paul Ryan tried hard to distance himself from Rand whose work he had often praised I adored her novels when I was young and in many ways they gave me an interest in economics he told the New York Times Magazine in 2014 But as a devout practicing Catholic I completely reject the philosophy of objectivismWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING Forty percent of former NFL players show signs of traumatic brain injuries according to a groundbreaking

THREE NEW YORK POLLS With one week until the primary Trump and Clinton are dominatingSo much for homefield advantage ThatMonmouth survey finds only 29 percent of voters consider Clinton  who has lived in the state for 16 years and served as senator for eight years to be a real New Yorker while 28 said the same for Sanders who left the state after high school Tensions continued to escalate in the battle for New YorkClinton devoted a Long Island campaign event entirely to gun control all but blaming Sanders for crime in New York CityFrom Philip Rucker and Abby Phillip Clinton convened a round tablestyle discussion  where she along with the local congressman Rep Steve Israel D and gunsafety advocates hammered SandersHeres what I want you to know Most of the guns that are used in crimes and violence and killings in New York come from out of state The state that has the highest percapita number of those guns that end up committing crime in New York come from Vermont Clinton said eliciting gasps So this is not Oh no I live in a rural state We dont have any of these problemsThe Posts Fact Checker gives Clinton Three Pinocchios for this line of attack Clinton has carefully crafted the talking point to find the particular government data that support her point which gives a wildly different view than how trafficking flows are tracked Michelle Ye Hee Lee writes We do not find the per capita measure as a fair assessment of gun flows from Vermont into New York The difference between this point using per capita calculation and the raw number 1 percent of crime guns with source states identified in 2014 came from Vermont is so stark that it creates a significantly misleading impression to the publicSanders called for a national ban on fracking The Vermont senator released a new ad

Bernie Sanders is the only candidate for president who opposes fracking everywhere Joe Biden said Sanders calling Clinton unqualifiedwas notsexist but something saidin the heat of a campaign During an interview with Miccomthe vice president was asked about Sanders comment and if he thought Hillary is held to a higher standard because she is a woman No I dont think shes held to a higher standard he repliedThis countrys ready for a woman Biden elaborated Theres no problem Were going to be able to elect a woman in this countryWhen the female interviewer asked Biden if hed like to see a woman elected a male aide to the VP interrupted from off camera and tried to end the interview Thats it he said I would like to see a woman elected Biden said I dont mind he told the staffers standing off camera The president and I are not going to endorse because we both when we ran said let the party decide But gosh almighty theyre both qualified he added Hillary is overwhelmingly qualified to be president Past cases suggest Hillary wont be indictedby PoliticosJosh GersteinA review of dozens of recent federal investigationssuggests that its highly unlikely but not impossibleThe examination  found some parallels to Clintons use of a private server for her emails but in nearly all instances that were prosecuted aggravating circumstances existedthat dont appear to be present in Clintons case The relatively few cases that drew prosecution almost always involved a deliberate intent to violate classification rules as well as some addon element  a Boeing engineer who brought home 2000 classified documents and whose travel to Israel raised suspicions a NSA official who removed boxes of classified documents and also lied on a job application form And former prosecutors investigators and defense attorneys generally agree that prosecution for classified information breaches is the exception rather than the rule They always involve some plus factor one former federal prosecutor said Bill de Blasio intimated in an interview with Katie Couric that his kids are supporting Sanders even though hes backing ClintonMy kids will speak for themselves he told the Yahoo anchor but Ill say
