This has been a rough year for pollsters and pundits with prediction after prediction going painfully awry Even those supposedly unflappable data journalists have found themselves stepping in itBut its not just the journalists and pollsters Since Im a professor of statistics as well as a blogger who often comments on academic papers that I think misuse numbers I have a frontrow seat to some of the least persuasive academic takes on politics and elections And its been a big year for bad studiesIn journalism and polling premature obituaries of Trump have been one common problem In July 2015 the New York Timess Nate Cohn remarked on a shift that will probably mark the moment when Trumps candidacy went from boom to bust That was a reference to Trump crudely dismissing the war record of John McCain the former Republican presidential nomineeHis support will erode Cohn wrote confidently as the tone of coverage shifts from publicizing his antiestablishment and antiimmigration views  to reflecting the chorus of Republican criticism of his most outrageous comments and the more liberal elements of his recordWhoops Only a month later famed number cruncher Nate Silver gave Trump a 2 percent chance of winning the Republican nominationA couple of months after that Gallup made the historic announcement that the organization would no longer do horse racestyle election polling You can see why this might be a smart time to get out of the predictions gameId love to claim that Im above all this myself but really I too had no idea what would happen during the primary season Whenever anyone asked me Id point them to an article I wrote in 2011 explaining why primaries are hard to predictIn short in the general election voters have months to make their decisions the choice is between two candidates who are ideologically distinct and most voters can rely on party cues In contrast primaries come in a rushed sequence competing candidates tend to be similar in ideology and of course they come from the same party And with multiple candidates comes the opportunity for strategic voting casting a vote for someone you dislike to defeat someone you dislike even more which is a hard thing to modelIn recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles and smiley face iconsIn short I avoided making any embarrassing predictions about primary election winners only by the tactic of avoiding making predictions period  an option that was not so available to the Nates Cohn and Silver who were expected to make realtime predictions and who to their credit examined their errors afterwardBut academia has had no shortage of errant findings as well This year perhaps more than others the internet has been swarming with conspiracy theories  some of these defended with statistical argumentsIn June various people pointed me to a paper by Axel Geijsel and Rodolfo Cortes Barragan graduate students at Tilburg University and Stanford respectively with the portentous title Are we witnessing a dishonest election A between state comparison based on the used voting procedures of the 2016 Democratic Party Primary for the Presidency of the United States of America Yes indeed that presidencyThe paper issued before the primary race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders was decided made the case that Sanders tended to win in states where electronic voting could be doublechecked with a paper trail Clinton suspiciously  or suspiciously  tended to win when there was no paper trail Moreover Geijsel and Barragan wrote the inaccuracy of exit polling supposedly rose in states without a paper trail and the official results seemed biased toward ClintonThe paper itself did not convince me as there can be all sorts of differences between different states and theres no reason to pick just one of these factors and give it a causal interpretationIts what we call an observational comparison You never know fraud could always happen but the paper supplied no useful evidence that this difference was the one driving the election resultsNot that youd need an explanation as to why a 74yearold socialist fails to win a major party nomination in the United StatesBut if going viral among Bernie followers counted in academia these students would have tenure alreadyCloser to the mainstream in June economics professors Ray Fisman and Andrea Prat of Boston University and Columbia posted a piece in Slate claiming that Fox News support for Donald Trump could erase a 12percentagepoint Democratic lead in the popular voteIm skeptical that this number is anything close to reasonable After looking at the cited study by professors Gregory Martin political science Emory and Ali Yurukoglu Stanford Business School it seems to me that Fisman and Prat improperly extrapolated an estimate that was already probably too highMartin and Yurukoglu estimated that watching Fox News an extra 25 minutes a day increased a voters probability of voting Republican by 03 percentage points But its not reasonable to assume that if the time watching the channel continued to grow the shift in vote preference would continue to be strong and linear  all the way to 12 percentIn addition while I trust that the authors found what they reported there is a wellknown tendency for small but variable effects to be overestimated in this sort of statistical study In general estimates near zero are discarded and high estimates are reported We call this the statistical significance filter which can turn weak results into robustseeming onesRegarding partisan news sources I have more trust in a study by political scientists Dan Hopkins andJonathan Ladd of Georgetown University who analyze data from a 2000 preelection poll and find a positive effect of Fox News on support for George W Bush but only for Republicans and independents In summarizing this study Hopkins writes that media influence fosters political polarization For Republicans and pure independents Fox News access in 2000 reinforced GOP loyalties Not a lot of room for a 12 percent swing in that claimThe next month came a piece based on work by the research psychologist Robert Epstein  Epstein also publicized it last year  called How Google Could Rig the 2016 Election It claimed that Googles search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more  up to 80 percent in some demographic groups  with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated  Given that many elections are won by small margins this gives Google the power right now to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwideQuite a claim The numbers however came from a highly artificial set of lab experiments in which participants were asked questions about unfamiliar political candidates after being shown unrealistically rigged search results The researchers put extremely biased articles favoring one candidate on page one moderately biased articles on page two and so on so participants had to go to pages four and five of a fivepage search to find anything strongly favoring the other candidateEpstein then compounded his exaggerations by claiming ridiculously that the realworld impact of Google on elections would undoubtedly be larger than in his loaded experimentsIn fact the real presidential election is not being held in an isolated lab Voters have many sources of information about Clinton and Trump beyond those found in hypothetically rigged search results Full disclosure Some of my research is funded by GoogleAnd its still only early September Just wait till next month when just about any electionrelated study will get 15 minutes of fame In recent years we have seen claims that political attitudes and preferences were determined by menstrual cycles smiley faces displayed near survey questions for subliminally short durations and the mood swings caused by the results of college football games really All of these studies struck me as flawed either in design or in the analysis of the data Follow the links for more details about my doubtsIm not saying that these studies shouldnt have been done well in most cases Researchers should be free to try out all sorts of outsidethebox ideas and indeed in some of these cases Im not criticizing the studies so much as the accompanying hype But respected news organizations should think twice about dramatic claims about voting and elections even if they are published in reputable scientific journalsWhen it comes to research election season is silly season and there always seems to be room for one more story about how irrational those voters are Who knows what else theyll come up with before November 8Andrew
