On Friday the White House released its2015 National Security Strategy an official document defining the administrations approach to international politics A lotof the document is pretty uninformative the ratio of substance to platitudes our economy is the largest most open and most innovative in the world is low But this sentence pretty early on in the report is actually a pithy but insightful encapsulation of President Barack Obamas core approach to foreign policyThis cuts to the core of what can often confuse people about Obamas approach to the world Though hes constantly intervening in foreign crises  toppling Libyas Muammar Gaddafi bombing alQaeda in Pakistan Yemen and Somalia and so on  hes also deeply invested in reducing Americas involvement in major wars like Iraq and AfghanistanTo understand this approach you have to look at each half of the above sentence in turn Each reflects a core tenet of the way the Obama administration approaches the worldLets focus on the first half of the sentence there are no global problems that can be solved without the United States Thats meant pretty literally On basically every major world crisis  containing the fallout from the global financial crisis rolling back climate change combating ISIS punishing Russian expansionism or curing Ebola  the United States has played a major role in organizing the international responseThats because Obama like basically every president since the Cold War began has bought into whats now called the bipartisan consensus on foreign policy To most people the consensus is basically invisible Thats because almost no one on either side of the aisle bothers to debate its basic premises But nonetheless its defined American foreign policy for decades It rests on basically three ideasIf these statements sound banal its because for the most part they are Foreign policy intellectuals on both the left and the right regularly criticize these ideas but no one with serious power in the US government does at least in publicYou see this pretty clearly in Obamas actions Bombing ISIS organizing a coalition to end Libyas civil war and sending US troops to West Africa to help stop the spread Ebola are all premised on the assumption that the worlds problems are also AmericasThe general consensus on principles obviously doesnt translate into bipartisan agreements on specific policy issues Thats where the second part of the sentence comes in there are few global problems that can be solved by the United States aloneThis is a pretty unmistakable reference to the Bush administration Obama rode to power as a critic of the Iraq war a core part of his administrations strategic doctrine is to avoid Bushs aggressive unilateral uses of American power If Bush pushed the hawkish bounds of the bipartisan consensus Obama is at times  though not always  somewhere on the dovish endIn some cases that means avoiding military action and trusting in multilateral diplomacy and deterrence to resolve conflicts Iran East Asia In others it means relying on nonmilitary means of punishing bad actors Iran again Russia In others still it means marshaling global coalitions but limiting Americas upfront military role as much as possible and consistent with the missions objectives Libya ISISObamas approach to each of these global crises is shaped by a keen desire to avoid Bushstyle protracted wars Even in cases where Obama really does act unilaterally such as with targeted killings or the Afghanistan surge he tries to put limits on those actions to keep them from escalating beyond controlYou might think this approach is too cautious  or for many critics of the consensus too aggressive still But one thing its not is withdrawing from the world or abandoning Americas allies as some critics have allegedBy virtuallyevery statistical measure imaginable the United States is the worlds leading power and deeply entangled in political conflicts around the world Obama has done nothing to change that His approach may or may not be to your liking on specific issues but as the NSS reinforces the broad strokes of his approach are pretty consistent with what America has been doing in the world for decades
