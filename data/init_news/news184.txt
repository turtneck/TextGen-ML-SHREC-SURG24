On Monday I made the case thatAl Gore should run for president But theres another obvious contender out there too Joe BidenOver at Yahoo Matt Bai makes the case for Biden Biden he writes is a better candidate than most pundits have ever given him credit for Yeah hes sloppy and meandering and says some nutty stuff But thats all part of being genuine and threedimensional which may be the most valuable trait in modern politics and not a bad contrast to Clintons robotic disciplineAnd Bidens certainly got the resume When President Barack Obama wanted to make sure stimulus money didnt disappear to fraud he turned to Biden  nobody messes with Joe he said  and Bidensucceeded When the White House wanted to avoid the fiscal cliff it was Biden whoclosed the deal with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell When Obama flubbed the first debate against Mitt Romney it was Biden who restored the tickets mojo by bullying his way past Rep Paul Ryan When the Democrats held their 2012 convention it was Bidens speech that pulledthe highest ratings  beating both Bill Clinton and ObamaBidens most offthereservation moment meanwhile is the kind of thing that should help him in 2016 He pushed the Obama administration to embrace gay marriage before it was quite ready At the time it looked like a gaffe Now it looks prescientAnd yetaccording to a recent Marist poll Biden is running 47 points behind Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016  and only one point ahead of Sen Elizabeth Warren A quick scan of RealClearPolitics roundup of Democratic primary polls shows thats no outlierIts not like Biden has been out of the public eye for the last seven years So why if hes such a good politician doesnt he command more support in the Democratic PartyHeres my guesstheres a cultural gap between Biden and the party he seeks to represent Biden is an oldschool white male politician in a party thats increasingly young multicultural and female Bidens gaffes matter because they tend to reinforce the perception among Democrats that he belongs to a different eraWhen Biden calls shady lenders Shylocks or says Obama is the first mainstream AfricanAmerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy he ends up coming off as in New York Magazine words your accidentally racist grandma That leaves Biden facing something more toxic than opposition condescensionWhat I wrote of Biden inJanuary 2013 is still true today I think In the continuing drama that is the Obama presidency Biden often appears as comic relief Hes the zany neighbor the adorable uncle As a result his presidential ambitions which burn brightly even today have mostly been laughed off Somehow the sitting vice president of the United States the former chairman of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee a man whos on a nickname basis with many of the worlds most powerful leaders is seen in many quarters as lacking the gravitas to be presidentThere is much thats weird about this Hillary Clinton is a powerful candidate but theres nothing about the last few months that makes her look invulnerable Shes shown real rust in interviews pissed off liberals and found herself in an email scandalBut while Biden isnt much older than Clinton shes somehow been more adept at signaling cultural affinity with young Democrats than hes been though shes occasionally struggled too most notably inher interview with Terry Gross on gay marriage She also has a connection to female voters he cant touch Even hermemes are betterI dont know exactly how Biden fixes this or even if he can Clinton isnt inevitable and Biden should by all rights pose a real threat to her But though Bidens always been known as a great speaker he needs to learn to talk to a different party than the one he grew up in
