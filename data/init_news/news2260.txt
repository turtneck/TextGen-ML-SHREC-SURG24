After he managed to win support from his warring caucus the full House is expected to elect Ryan as speaker on Thursday But he wont have much time to celebrate because he will immediately confront a series of divisive issues that could undermine his hold on the speakership just as he reaches the pinnacle of his careerAt the heart of the list fiscal fights that have badly divided the GOP since it took control of the House in the 2010 elections Congress must raise the national borrowing ceiling  or risk the firstever default on US debt  by November 3 and then pivot to a highstakes debate over funding the government the following monthThe outgoing speaker John Boehner of Ohio is trying to take the debt limit off the table for Ryan but hes running into familiar obstacles that could force the Wisconsin Republican to deal with the matter after he takes the top jobIf you think about what the debt is  its what happened in the past  so I think that the speaker is trying to clean that up for before he leaves Republican Rep Tom Rooney of Florida told reporters but he admitted that might not be possible with time running out before Boehners last day at the end of this weekAnd Ryan will soon command the lead House GOP role in budget talks with the White House  a discussion centered on raising domestic and defense spending by roughly 76 billion and one bound to anger the same conservatives the likely new speaker wooed last week President Barack Obama and Democrats on the Hill are insisting that any increase in national security spending be matched dollar for dollar with more money for domestic programsBut a deal with the White House could undermine the pledge Ryan has privately been making that he would restore regular order and let congressional committees drive policy  not the speakers officeRep Mark Sanford a South Carolina Republican and member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus told CNN that if Ryan agrees to get rid of budget caps it will be a mixed bag since it will please defense hawks but anger smallgovernment conservativesI suspect it would stir up the rank and file And when you get the rank and file at the grassroots level other folks get stirred up within the conference Sanford saidSources familiar with the leadership discussions with the White House say there remains a possibility of a deal to scrap the automatic cuts known as sequestration for one year but the two sides still are not in agreement over how to pay for the spending increasesMoreover everything is on hold until House Republicans try to raise the debt ceiling this week  and there is no consensus within the ranks on how to proceed Senate Republicans want to extend the debt ceiling until 2017 to take the issue off the table during an election year House Republicans were forced last week to pull back a proposal crafted by a group of conservatives that conditioned any debt increase to more spending cuts and a regulatory freeze because it didnt have enough support to pass GOP leaders are still trying to come up with a proposal that includes some type of reforms their members can point to in return for increasing the nations borrowing authorityAll but two House Democrats signed a letter to Boehner on Friday demanding he move a clean extension of the debt limit  one without conditions  and warning that failing to do so will plunge the nation into default for the first time in American history risking economic catastropheBut some House Republicans say that a shortterm increase should be pursued potentially putting the issue in Ryans lapRep David Brat the Virginia Republican who unseated thenMajority Leader Eric Cantor last year said Ryan should pair a debt ceiling increase with dollarfordollar spending cuts  an idea Democrats strongly rejectLeadership promised the American people that Brat said We dont want to go back on that if we give our wordRooney said its possible that leaders could be forced again to take up a clean debt limit to avoid a default While hell oppose that approach and noted Ryan voted against it last time the Florida Republican said no one should blame Ryan for the struggle to avoid an economic crisisIf you really hold Paul Ryan responsible for a clean debt limit vote in his first day on the job I think thats a little unfair to say that thats on him especially since hes worked so hard at the issues which really do directly deal with the debt and trying to fix that problem Rooney saidYet if Ryan or Boehner try to jam a debt ceiling bill through they can expect outrage from their right flankI cant vote for a bill dropped on my desk 24 hours before the vote said Rep Mick Mulvaney RSouth Carolina a member of the House Freedom Caucus
