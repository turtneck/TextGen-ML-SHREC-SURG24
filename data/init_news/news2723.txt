Less than two months after the 2014 elections the 2016 Republican presidential race is taking clear shape  with several major players moving quickly to carve out their space and maybe keep others from carving it up in the contestNo one typifies that early movement better than former Florida governor Jeb Bush who has formed a leadership PAC said he is actively exploring a presidential bid and resigned all his roles on corporate and nonprofit boardsThat flurry of activity took Bush from well maybe he might run to hes definitely running in the minds of Republican activists political professionals and potential rivalsAnd he was far from the only one Outgoing Texas Gov Rick Perry who flopped in his 2012 presidential bid has made it clear for many months that he plans another run for the White House Ditto his Lone Star State colleague Sen Ted Cruz Sen Rand Paul Ky has been aggressively organizing for his presidential bid almost since arriving in the Senate in 2011On Saturday former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee joined that growing group by announcing that he was ending his show on Fox News Channel to seriously consider running for presidentAs much as I have loved doing the show I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run Huckabee said in a statement on his Web site Saturday night I say goodbye but as we say in television stay tuned Theres more to comeAll the sudden movement  particularly from Bush and Huckabee  has the potential to dramatically alter the face of the justbeginning race to be the next Republican presidential nomineeBush is without question the favorite son of the GOP establishment  a group that includes most important many of the major donors who helped propel his brother George Sen John McCain Ariz and Mitt Romney to the Republican nomination over the past decade and a halfAlthough no one has said that Bush being in means they are out  Sen Marco Rubio Fla a Bush protege has been most outspoken about that  theres no debate that Bush takes up lots of space that others would like to occupyRubio Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal Ohio Gov John Kasich Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie are all affected  to varying degrees  by Bushs aggressive move toward the race And its hard not to see the decision by Sen Rob Portman Ohio not to run  announced in late 2014  as anything other than a reaction to the increasing likelihood that Bush is inThe effect of Huckabees active consideration of the contest is less obvious than Bushs but no less important Although it has been more than six years since he last ran for president Huckabee remains the preferred candidate of the same social conservatives who propelled him to a surprise win in the 2008 Iowa caucusesHuckabees appeal among social conservatives  particularly in Iowa  will mix up the plans of people such as Cruz neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former senator Rick Santorum Pa who won Iowa in 2012So why all the early movement in the 2016 raceAt one level its not all that unusual Remember that thenIowa Gov Tom Vilsack D got into the 2008 presidential race just two days after the 2006 election ended But Bush and Huckabee are not the long shots that Vilsack clearly was Vilsack was out of the race by February 2007 before most people knew he had gotten in Both are wellknown figures who rank at or near the top of most national polling on the raceTheir decisions to move as aggressively as they have is probably the result of two major factors fundraising and Hillary ClintonTo raise north of 75 million which looks like the floor of what it might require to win the Republican nomination takes lots and lots of time Romney raised and spent 766 million to capture the nomination in 2012 The sooner a candidate starts building a national cashcollection operation  not to mention infrastructures in early states  the betterThen there is Clinton who looms as the nearcertain Democratic presidential nominee  a fundraising and polling juggernaut who is striking fear in the hearts of Republicans who fret about the prospect of spending 16 straight years without control of the White HouseClintons lack of any serious primary competition should  emphasis on should  allow her to not only conserve cash but also position herself messagewise for the general election almost from the minute she becomes a candidate No her running isnt a done deal But its damn closeThe GOP knows that and the party has acted to counter that edge  seeking to limit the number of presidential primary debates and strictly control the nominating calendar in hopes of producing a nominee sooner rather than laterSome of the major Republican candidates are following that lead  trying to get the jump on their potential competitors and prove their readiness to take on and take down Clinton in the general electionWhat remains to be seen is what the early actions by Bush and Huckabee  among others  mean for the race as it goes forward Does Bush keep other establishment candidates out Does Huckabee actually run and if so what does that mean for Cruz and Santorum How will the Republican electorate react to such a quickstarting raceMore questions than answers But if the early pace of the 2016 field is any indicator we will get answers sooner than you might think
