This is a story about the swing voter The voter who days before the election doesnt know if she wants to vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton  or hell maybe Jill Stein or Gary JohnsonYoure going to hear a lot about these mythical middleground people in the runup to the election You can just search swing voter to see how common this narrative isThis is because many pundits think swing voters decide elections They think swing voters  or floating voters  are large in number and just sitting in the middle waiting to be convinced by one party or the other to vote for them So this is the picture in their headsBut increasingly this picture is wrong As the parties polarize its becoming much easier to for Americans to choose sides even if they dont identify as Republican or Democrat So when they go to vote they act like partisansBack when there were more voters who might change their minds campaigns were based on persuasion and persuasion pulls you toward the middle But when everyones mind is already made up that means the way to win an election is to rile up people on your own teamA few years ago Smidt who works at Michigan State University was trying to reconcile two thingsOne was that there were more and more people identifying as independents rather than Democrats or RepublicansThat shouldve meant that there were a huge number of people who were willing to change their minds since they werent partisanBut Smidt also noticed that over this time period the presidential election maps didnt change much It was much more rigidOne way to reconcile these two things was to believe that independents were no longer participating which means there were fewer nonpartisan votersBut Smidt had another question Are these selflabeled nonpartisans actually willing to vote for Republicans one election and Democrats in anotherSo he decided to study historical surveys that asks Americans about how they voted He came up with four groups for the respondentsHe did this for every year going back 50 yearsWhat he found was simple though shocking Even though more and more people dont align with a party they still consistently behave like reliable partisans and repeatedly vote for the same partyIn other words swing voters are dyingMost voters look at where the parties stand on the issues and then they pick one that best reflects their own views But if you dont pay enough attention to tell the parties apart then you wont know which party you agree with That makes you more likely to swing between partiesSo if we redraw the picture at the top it would look like this Notice how similar the two sides look to herAnd it used to be common for people with less political knowledge to switch the party they supported from election to election  whether or not they votedBut over time this party switching has become far less commonThis is because now even lowinformation voters can tell the two parties apartIn 1960 both partisans and nonpartisans were much less likely to say there was a big difference between Republicans and DemocratsNow almost all strong partisans would say yes  and even half of nonpartisans would say yesIn short voters are more confident that they know exactly what theyre voting for when they look at the D or the R next to a candidates name  no matter how partisan they areAnd its not just about partisanshipA modernday person with low political awareness can tell the parties apart just as well as someone who had high awareness in 1968Its not that the people have changed Rather its the partiesLets go back to the drawing at the top of the story Heres where we were in the 1950s where a lowinformation voter would look at the parties and not be able to tell the differenceBut over the past 50 years the two parties have evolved very distinct platformsIn the 1968 election neither Republican Richard Nixon nor Democrat Hubert Humphrey articulated clear views on what he would in Vietnam This ambivalence and deliberate obfuscating can create opportunity to win voters over Smidt saidBefore Ronald Reagan the Republican Party didnt have an antiabortion positionAt the 1996 State of the Union Bill Clinton said The era of big government is overIt was a lot harder to pin down each party to specific issues especially for those who werent paying close attention But now the party lines are clear on abortion taxes climate change health care samesex marriage  the list goes on Thats why when we look at how much Republicans and Democrats agree in the House and Senate we see more and more polarizationYou could argue that voters clearly knowing which side theyre on is a good thing But in the 1954 study Voting A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign political scientists argued that what we need from an electorate is diversity  in other words we cant just have rigid voters with ideal views but also detached voters with rational views Those are the people who allow our political system to more efficiently get things doneAs Smidt writes Even the least admirable voters enrich our democratic political system by providing it with the flexibility and indifference that it needsIf more and more voters are either on your side or the opponents side that means winning elections is simple You have to get your people more excited and get the other side less excitedThis means that candidates have little incentive to talk to people in the middle  people who dont make consistent partisan decisions in the voting boothJust think about the 2016 election in this framework Voters in Utah who are traditionally Republican dont like Donald Trump But because the party positions are so polarized its too far a jump for them to support a Democrat like Hillary Clinton So as Smidt points out many would rather jump to a third party candidateTrump was supposed to be the most nontraditional candidate in modern American politics  someone who was shaking up the electorate But on November 8 when you look at the election map itll probably look a lot like past election maps Maybe a few states will switch over but most of America will likely have voted the same wayThe presidentelect will have won on the backs of riled up partisans and people would be swing voters  except theyre not because they picked a side long agoClarification I initially called Smidts research an experiment but its more so a study of historical data which Ive clarified in the piece
