Ying and Yang the Gold and Silver SetUp Posted on Home  Silver  Silver News  Ying and Yang the Gold and Silver SetUp No this is not a post about some new Chinese law firm Instead its just an update on the gold and silver markets which while refusing to go further down arent making much progress to the upside either From Craig Hemke TFMetalsReport  Todays message A few more slightly positive US economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a December FF rate hike a fait accompli Again thoughand I cant stress this enough we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last October and November in the run up to the most recent FF rate hike And what happened beginning the very next day Well by now you know the story The week of the October 2o15 FOMC produced a high trade in the Dec15 contract of 1183 As the Fedlines were digested later that week it became clear that the Fed was going to raise the FF rate at the December 2015 meeting come hell or high water And they did However take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the Oct15 FOMC and the December rate hike Price fell from 1180 to 1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual news of the FF rate hike This 10 drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the Specs at the Comex How bad was it From the CoT survey of 102715 just one day before that fateful FOMC and Fedlines the Large Specs in gold were NET long more than 157000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short nearly 166000 Just five weeks later the NET position of the Large Specs was down to only 10000 contracts with the Commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2911 contracts NET short We even speculated at the time that there were some days intraweek where the Gold Commercials were actually and historically NET LONG Well now compare last autumn to our current situation Just as back then a FF rate hike is a near certainty at the FOMC in December However as you know the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50day and 100day moving averages in late September Take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above In 2015 we had the October FOMC and then two stout down weeks Before price turned we slogged through 56 weeks of consolidation and CoT improvement before the blast higher began In 2016 we had the September FOMC and then two stout down weeks Price is attempting to bottom and turn while the CoT improves but it doesnt seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher In 2015 the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place The rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength which led to Chinese devaluations which led to emerging market crises which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 510 off its lows by late January before the real fun began with the USDJPY falling 10 in early February Are we headed down that same path again It certainly appears so as the first major salvos of Chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week httpwwwzerohedgecomnews20161020dearjanetchinadevaluesmostaugustyuantumbleslowestsept2010 And just as in 2015 the CoT is certainly undergoing a makeover too From the survey of 92716 the Large Specs in gold were NET long 292000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short 325000 As of last Tuesday and just three weeks later the Large Specs were down to 180000 NET long for a reduction of 38 and the Commercials were NET short 203000 To be sure these are still hefty positions but much more bullish than the levels seen through the past summer And now check the full longterm chart You can see again the similarities between now and last fall Also be sure to note however that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher So while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longerthe Ying and Yang mentioned in the title of this postit is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the nowexpected FOMC FF rate hike will be simply another selltherumor buythenews type of event for gold and silver This current period of relative quiet should be used to prepare for the next leg UP not some sort of new bear market where paper prices are sharply falling Use your time wisely and continue to preparestack accordingly TF On Sale At SD Bullion This Week Only This entry was posted in Gold News  Silver News and tagged Craig Hemke  December Rate Hike  gold update  silver update  TFMetals Report  Bookmark the permalink  Post navigation
