The Volcker Rule bars banks operating in the US from speculating in securities markets for their own profit  a risky activity that can put taxpayers on the hook for big bailouts if the bank bets turn sour But there are exceptions to the rule For instance banks are allowed to hold US government debt in their own accountsBut those same banks arent allowed to trade in Canadian government debt Oliver thinks thats a NAFTA violation Although he didnt lay out his argument in detail on Wednesday NAFTA like the TPP generally bans countries from discriminating against each others financial services NAFTA prohibits policies that limit crossborder trade in financial services and requires the US to treat Canadian companies the same way that it treats US companiesThe Volcker Rule is clearly not a violation of NAFTA or any other trade agreement all of which explicitly safeguard the ability of the United States to protect the integrity and stability of our financial system a Treasury spokesperson said The Volcker Rule is a key prudential financial regulation that prohibits risky proprietary trading while protecting taxpayers and the depth liquidity and stability of US capital markets NAFTA does not weaken our ability to implement Wall Street Reform now or in the future and neither would any trade agreement were negotiating  Its true that NAFTA contains an exemption for prudential regulation and financial reform watchdogs strongly agree with the Treasury Departments interpretation But its not an airtight caseSorting out whether the Volcker Rule qualifies for that exemption is the sort of thing that a court would traditionally determine under US law and US courts typically give significant deference to the views of the executive branch US courts however dont have jurisdiction over NAFTA or any other free trade pact International tribunals doThe administration can say whatever it wants about its interpretation of these trade agreements said Marcus Stanley policy director at Americans for Financial Reform a Wall Street watchdog group The problem is under the terms of these agreements they are not going to be interpreting them Private tribunals of trade lawyers are going to be interpreting them and there are going to be plenty of openings as this shows to make claims that critical prudential regulations conflict with trade agreements And eventually one of those is going to win outTreasury has known about Olivers objection to the Volcker Rule for more than a year As far back as 2011 a lobbying group representing Canadian banks claimed that the Volcker Rule runs afoul of NAFTA in arguments presented to US regulators But none of this turmoil prevented Obama from flatly rejecting Warrens contention that trade agreements particularly the TPP can be used to attack financial standardsThe notion that corporate America is going to be able to use this provision to eliminate our financial regulations and our food safety regulations and our consumer regulations  thats just bunk Obama told reporters in an April conference call Its not trueCanada may not opt to pursue a NAFTA case against the US over the Volcker Rule If it doesnt Canadian banks wont have the right to sue on their own because NAFTA bars individual companies from suing sovereign nations over most financial services violationsBut the TPP would be different according to congressional briefings by the US Trade Representative which are reflected in a December letter from Warren to Ambassador Michael Froman the top Obama trade official The TPP wouldnt just empower foreign governments to sue the US over bank regulations it would allow individual companies and investors to bring such casesUnder the investorstate dispute settlement process an international tribunal cannot overrule a law or regulation but it can assess financial penalties to encourage countries to change said law or regulation In the past under other trade deals the mere existence of such cases has sometimes pressured governments into abandoning nonfinancial services regulationsMoreover the TPP would reportedly allow foreign banks to sue the US government for failing to provide them with a minimum standard of treatment The term is vaguely defined but international tribunals have interpreted it very broadly to make corporations eligible to receive damages for lost profits caused by policy changes that occurred after they invested in a country Rep Maxine Waters DCalif raised similar concerns in her own December letter to Froman over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership a pending trade deal with Europe
