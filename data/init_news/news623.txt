Could Hillary Clinton be the next Richard Nixon Now thats a provocative question but it isnt quite what you thinkThe other day I watched Hillary and Bill Clinton take in their close friend Terry McAuliffes inauguration as governor of Virginia Neither Clinton spoke but their presence said it all Virginia the Mother of Presidents long before it was a modern swing state will be seeing a lot of the Clintonsand now they have a readymade homeawayfromhome in the gubernatorial mansion that adorns Richmonds Capitol SquareEvery time you observe the Clintons you cant help but ponder the long and winding road of their 40year electoral saga beginning with Bills unsuccessful 1974 run for Congress in Arkansas Their lives are so suffused with politics that it seems incredible to consider that Hillary might not run in 2016After all with just one exception a Clinton has always tried for public office whenever a tantalizing opportunity presented itself The rulebreaker was Bills aborted run for president in the 1988 cycle On the eve of his expected candidacy announcement in July 1987 with the national press gathering in Little Rock his longsuffering chief of staff Betsey Wright she later told PBS huddled with her boss and presented a list of women he was alleged to have been seeing After a number of responses along the lines of shell never talk Clinton belatedly awakened to the reality that he could selfdestruct in the postGary Hart worldHart had been forced out of the Democrats presidency sweepstakes just a couple of months earlier following allegations of adultery The next day Clinton declined to run stunning the news media with the unconvincing excuse that he had decided to spend more time with his familyNearly three decades later Hillary needs no cover story should she surprise us and spurn another White House tour Now in her mid 60s she knows as much as any human being alive what an arduous journey lies ahead even for a heavily favored contender Inevitably she will consider how much she wants or is able to keep going at a killer pace throughout her 70s and more important her chances of prevailing in November 2016Much of it is out of her hands Low job approval numbers for President Obama should they persist will make it difficult for any Democrat to win even with the partys seeming Electoral College edge and growing demographic advantages among minorities and the young Just ask John McCain how President George W Bushs unpopularity affected his 2008 White House bid Of course you cant rule out the very real chance that the Republicans will rescue the eventual Democratic nominee by putting forward an outofthemainstream nomineeThe Clintons are nothing if not shrewd and theyve lived through the entire era of postwar American politics So Hillary Clinton would be the last to believe what I have heard with increasing frequency that in the end no one of real heft even Vice President Joe Biden will challenge her for the Democratic nomination she nearly won in 2008 and she will steamroll over the minor contenders who do Most frequently mentioned in the minor category are former Gov Brian Schweitzer of Montana and Gov Martin OMalley of Maryland OMalley also made a littlenoticed appearance at the McAuliffe inauguration Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would be a major opponent should she run but she insists she will not When California Gov Jerry Brown also bowed out NBC Newss First Read called it a reminder that Hillary Clinton will probably face little to no serious competition if she runsPossible Sure But historys guide tells us otherwise A consensus choice for a majorparty presidential nomination is exceedingly rareand this is where the Nixon comparison comes inIncumbent presidents often find their secondterm nominations nearly unopposed though even in this rarefied group there are notable exceptions Harry Truman Lyndon Johnson Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush Truman and Johnson withdrew in 1952 and 1968 respectively partly because of intraparty oppositionBut when no incumbent was running the only precedent for a consensus choice in the entire postWorld War II era is Richard Nixon in 1960 This impressive feat was nonetheless achieved with some difficulty and embarrassment Nixon thought he had averted a serious GOP challenge when New York Gov Nelson Rockefeller withdrew as a potential candidate in December 1959 But Nixons unappealing persona and substantial baggage from the political wars of the 1940s and 1950s worried many Republicans eager for a third consecutive White House victory Rockefeller sensed it and reconsidered toying with a surprise candidacy on the eve of the 1960 Republican National Convention At the last instant Rocky relented mollified by the socalled Treaty of Fifth Avenue a series of concessions by Nixon negotiated in an allnight session and announced by the New York governor himself
