A grim new Ministry of Defense  MoD  report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forwardlooking Military Research and Development  SFLMRD  have now placed the United States in the  active zone  of nations currently undergoing a  Colour Revolution  as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of Presidentelect Donald Trump  Note Some words andor phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian wordsphrases having no exact counterpartAccording to this report SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using  modernsophisticated  technologies to ensure and protect the Federations national security interestsand of which the MoD has previously identified  Colour Revolutions  as being one of the gravest threats not only to Russia but the entire worldDuring the MoDs 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security  this report explains Federation military commanders labeled  Colour Revolutions  as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties The some of first of these Western  Colour Revolutions  to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world this report continues was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the  Rose Revolution and that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who in 2008 launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation  but that was quickly and decisively defeatedNext to be attacked by a Western  Colour Revolution  this report notes was Ukraine in 2004 whos  Orange Revolution  resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor aka The Shadow CIA  called  the most blatant coup in history and like Georgia before it has likewise been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation In 2005 this report continues the West then launched a  Colour Revolution  against Kyrgyzstan called the  Tulip Revolution but that ultimately failed leading that nation in 2014 to expel the US military from its territory Once the subversive tactics of the West in their using their  Colour Revolutions  against other nations was  deciphereddiscovered  this report says both Iran 2009 Green Revolution  and Russia 2011 White Snow Revolution  were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of lifeTo exactly how the West  engineeredmanipulated  their  Colour Revolutions  this report explains was through the use of what are called nongovernmental organizations  NGOs  using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millionsofdollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellionand which in 2015 President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation Heading nearly all of these Western backed and financed  Colour Revolution  NGOs this report details is the HungarianAmerican billionaire George Soros who has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives he was also recently exposed as being Hillary Clintons puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president Unlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led and USEU funded NGO  Colour Revolution  this report grimly warns the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of  rebellionwarfare  as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values And immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States this report states these George Soros funded NGOs launched their newest  Colour Revolution  intended not only to destroy President Trump but the entirety of AmericaLed by the George Soros funded MoveOnorg NGO  this report continues this new  Colour Revolution  striking American began with tensofthousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities and that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of Presidentelect Donald Trump and Vice Presidentelect Mike Pence before they can take office To the main  purposereason  behind these protests this report explains is to initiate a  brutalviolent  response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish orderwhich in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because its killing innocent people and therefore must be overthrownNot being understood by the American people about how these  Colour Revolutions  work this report continues is that they are intended to last for yearslike in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrownTo the most basic reason why this  Colour Revolution  is now targeting the United States this report details are the USEU elites fear of Presidentelect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in  complete horror  as the populace revolution he Trump is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearingwith Holland being the first fall  and France soon to follow  and whose next leader Marine Le Pen  just proclaimed  Congratulations to the new President of the US Donald Trump and the American people  free With the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of Presidentelect Donald Trumps victory and Google now reporting that their top search term is  How did Donald Trump win   this report further states it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would winand as we had detailed in numerous reports including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns American Revolution Has Now Begun May Last Entire Decade But to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States this report concludes and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders If Its Hillary Clinton Its War  was President Putins advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was  Americans had two choices World War III or multilateral peace Clinton was a symbol of war and Trump has a chance to change this course Lets all hope President Trump can indeed change this course because the world literally now hangs in the balance if he doesntSource
