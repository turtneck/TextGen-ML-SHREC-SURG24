Frances bid to unite the world against the Islamic State was always going to be difficult Turkeys shooting down of a Russian fighter jet shows whyCould the juvenile suspects in the Tennessee wildfires be tried as adultsA deputy commander in a rebel Syrian Turkmen brigade holds handles believed to be parts of a parachute of the downed Russian warplane near the village of Yamadi Syria near the Turkish border on Tuesday Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border on Tuesday saying it had repeatedly violated its airspaceTurkeys shootdown of a Russian fighter jet that it says strayed into its airspace from Syria Tuesday demonstrates why building a broad international coalition to destroy the selfproclaimed Islamic State is so difficultWell over a year after President Obama announced creation of a coalition of more than 50 countries designed to degrade and ultimately destroy IS also known as ISIS there still is no effective alliance of major powersNow French President Franois Hollande who was at the White House Tuesday and will be in Russia Friday has made building a coalition his goal in the wake of the Paris attacks But the same challenge remains The major players deeply mistrust one anothers intentions and visions for a postIslamic State SyriaIt was never going to be easy to build a coalition against ISIS given the complicated relations and competing alliances around the Syrian conflict says Barry Strauss a military historian at Cornell University in Ithaca NYBut clearly an event of this seriousness between Russia and Turkey will only make that effort more difficultTurkey and Russia exemplify the complex and often contradictory motives that Mr Hollande will try to manageThe antiIS coalitionsupposedly has similar aims to Turkeys the removal from power of Syrian President Bashar alAssad as a key step toward reducing ISs allure for Syrian Sunnis But ittook months of sustained diplomatic effort for theUnited States to bring Turkey on board Even now the differences between the US and Turkey remain pronouncedFrom the US perspective perhaps the most effective fighters against IS have been Syrian and Iraqi Kurds  so much so that the US has sent special operations forces to the region to help them But Turkey has a large Kurdish population and worries that empowering Kurds anywhere in the region might create trouble at homeIn factTurkey has been friendlier towards ISIS than Russia because of Turkeys satisfaction with the setbacks that IS has dealt Syrias Kurdish rebelsSimilarly many countries in the region find ISIS useful to have around and are in no rush to get rid of it because it is virulently antiShiite Professor Strauss notes In that way IS acts as a counterbalance to Iran and the Shiite parties in the regionFor its part Russia says it entered the Syrian conflict to defeat Syrias terrorists but analysts say its airstrikes in Syria have focused on Assads opponents Only about a quarter have been against IS experts sayFor those reasons getting Turkey and Russia on the same page for destroying IS  a priority for neither  was always going to be difficult After the Russian jet shootdown the task will be even harder whenHollande meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin FridayMr Putin called the downing of the Russian jet a stab in the back carried out by accomplices of terrorists and he warned that the perpetrators of the crime will face serious consequencesRussia canceled Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovs visit to Turkey Wednesday while NATO called an emergency meeting of alliance ambassadors Tuesday afternoon Tuesdays incident was the first shootdown of a Russian aircraft by a NATO country since the 1950s officials saidRussia insists the fighter jet did not stray outside Syria while Turkish officials said the jet was warned 10 times to turn back from its trajectory into Turkish airspace Mr Obama called on Russia Turkey and NATO countries to discourage any escalation but also asserted that Turkey like every country has the right to defend its territory and its airspaceRussia is likely to look at the aftermath of the incident as validation that all groups arrayed against Assad are terroristsA video released following the shootdown shows Syrian Turkmen rebels claiming to have shot dead two Russian pilots as they parachuted to the groundA separate incident further illustrates thedifficulty of building a united antiIS coalition that includes RussiaA group of Syrian rebels armed by the US claims to have damaged a Russian military helicopter forcing it to make an emergency landing in Syrian governmentheld territoryYet Strauss says perhapsthe more formidable impediment to an effective coalition is the widespread ambiguity in the region toward the Islamic StateThe regions Sunni powers may worry about ISIS in the long term but to some extent they see its usefulness in the short term he says That calculation does not fit with Western powers that  now more than ever want to see ISs demise sooner rather than later
