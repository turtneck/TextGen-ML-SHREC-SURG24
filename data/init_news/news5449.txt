Print As cities nationwide grapple with fatal police shootings many involving unarmed black men Pennsylvanias legislature on Thursday passed and sent to Gov Wolf a bill that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents The measure sponsored by Republican state Rep Martina White of Philadelphia and approved by the GOPcontrolled legislature stoked sharp opinions and drew votes largely along partisan lines Supporters say the bill supported by several local police unions is necessary to protect police officers and their families after such incidents We are the protectors of our protectors said one proponent Rep Dominic Costa a Pittsburgh De mocrat Opponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency which they believe is even more critical in tragic circumstances involving police shootings Do not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color said Rep Margo Davidson D Delaware during a floor debate This legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion
