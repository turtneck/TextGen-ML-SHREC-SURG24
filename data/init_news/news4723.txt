Washington CNN Compromises on some of the crucial issues that have long divided the West and Iran over the latters nuclear program  including the number of centrifuges Tehran can keep in any deal  are being reached in ongoing talks according to Western officialsTwo Western diplomats told CNN Thursday that the parties are narrowing in on 6000 centrifuges down from the 6500 that had been under discussionBut both American and Iranian officials strongly denied that there was a draft agreement under review as the Associated Press reported earlier in the dayTheres no draft document being circulated State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday as negotiations ahead of a March 31 deadline for a framework deal continue in Lausanne Switzerland The fundamental framework issues are still under comprehensive discussionTestifying at a congressional hearing Thursday morning Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken also denied the reportMy understanding is that there is no draft Blinken saidA senior Iranian negotiator similarly stated that we havent started drafting yet and that no specific details on issues such as the number of centrifuges have been agreed toThe numbers and figures mentioned here and there are just imaginations Irans Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Abbas Araqchi told Irans staterun Press TVIf Iranian leaders cannot agree to a reasonable deal they will keep Iran on the path its on today he said according to prepared remarks a path that has isolated Iran and the Iranian people from so much of the world caused so much hardship for Iranian families and deprived so many young Iranians of the jobs and opportunities they deserveHe went on to frame the current opportunity to secure a deal as fleeting and historic one he said we should not missThe President also said in his Nowruz message that the days and weeks ahead will be critical for negotiations and acknowledged that while negotiations have made progressgaps remainOne of those gaps in the negotiations concerns the number of centrifuges Iran can use to enrich uraniumWhile Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful in nature the US is determined to restrict the amount of time in which Iran would be able to produce the fissile material for one nuclear weapon  referred to as breakout time  to more than a year Limiting the number of centrifuges would be key to such a goalThe delegations which also include the UK France Germany Russia and China are also seeking to bridge disagreements over how long restrictions would remain on Irans nuclear program before they are phased outThe US is seeking to keep the bulk of restrictions in place for 10 years according to the AP report But Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the timeframe of the agreement is still being discussed by negotiatorsHe also pushed back on the idea that all of the checks on Iran would automatically expire at the end of this periodWhat we are proposing and what we are seeking to achieve is a series of constraints and obligations he explained Some will end after a long period of time others will continue longer than that and still others will be indefinite in perpetuityPreviously US officials have said the US is working towards a doubledigit time frameIn a briefing in Lausanne Thursday on how and when sanctions against Iran would be phased out US officials said they didnt expect that Iran would accept a 15year dealBut they added that a considerable amount of time in which Iran would have established a long history of compliance would have elapsed before the full termination of sanctions would be warrantedSanctions have become a key part of the debate in Washington over the Obama administrations negotiations with Iran as Republican and some Democratic members of Congress have objected to the deal and shown little inclination to lift sanctions legislators have imposed  a key form of leverage on IranUS officials on Thursday sought to allay some of the concernsThe officials said that sanctions relief would be phrased  suspended first and repealed later  in case Iran violates its commitments and be dependent on benchmarks such as verification by the UN nuclear agencyHowever the officials said the US would be prepared to move quickly with relief if Iran moved quickly with compliance and that they wanted to makes sure there was significant relief without too much delay because if only a little were given done up front Iran might feel there is no political benefit in a dealThe officials also described a snapback mechanism that the US wants to accompany the suspension or termination of UN sanctions which are in addition to those Congress has mandated One kind of snapback sanctions would require a UN Security Council vote but officials suggested it might be possible to put a trigger in place in which a full vote wouldnt be necessaryThe US and its five partners known collectively as the P51 are also emphasizing the need for nuclear inspectors to be given full access to Iranian facilities so they can ensure Iran remains in compliance with the terms of the dealWe are pushing tough issues Kerry told a group of reporters Thursday but we are making progressKerry has met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif repeatedly over the past couple weeks in an effort to resolve these obstacles and other points of contention that stand between them and a deal
