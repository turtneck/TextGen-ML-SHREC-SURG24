Americans desperately want something done about mass public shootings Hillary Clinton took a page from President Obamas playbook Monday vowing that as president she will bypass Congress and use executive action to change how guns can be purchasedShe is angry that Republicans refuse to do anything about mass shootingsBut that isnt accurate Clinton isnt the only one to speak out boldly on this topic On Saturday Donald Trump said And by the way it was a gunfree zone  Ill tell you if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room you would have been a hell of a lot better off Others such as Sen Marco Rubio have made a similar pointThe Republican push has at least the virtue of potentially stopping these crimes The Umpqua Community College in Oregon shooting shows yet another case where guns were banned With these killers explicitly picking places where victims are defenseless at some point it should be impossible to ignoreClintons proposals wouldnt have stopped these attacks The universal background checks on private transfers may raise the cost of lawabiding citizens getting gunsThey wouldnt have stopped any of the mass public shootings during Barack Obamas presidency including last Thursdays in Oregon At some point an enterprising reporter might ask Obama or Clinton to name just one of the cases they have used to push this law where the law would have stopped the attackClinton is proposing three other measures1 Prohibiting domestic abusers and stalkers from buying and possessing guns This sounds reasonable but the change from existing law would allow people to have their guns taken from them without a court hearing If people are committing crimes they should be prosecuted for felonies or misdemeanors but Clintons solution is to take away their guns even when they arent being prosecuted2Closing the Charleston Loophole where the federal background check worker didnt contact the right law enforcement agencies But the truth is more complicated First even a perfectly functioning background check system very likely wouldnt have stopped the suspect Dylann Roof from getting a gun Second the current background check system is amuch worse mess than Clinton recognizesRoof allegedly planned his attack for at least six months so its hard to believe he couldnt have figured out some way to obtain a gun Indeed he stole the gun he used in this attackThe truth is the databases the government uses to determine eligibility for gun purchases are rife with errorsFBI Director James Comeys comments in July about the FBIs background check system focus on one type of error where someone who should have been prohibited from getting a gun wasnt stopped But a much more common error involves people who should be able to buy guns but are stopped3 Repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which prevents the manufacturers and dealers of firearms from being held liable for crimes committed with their weapons It might be hard to remember but gun makers were being sued because they specifically geared their weapons to make them attractive to gang members Among the offending characteristics listed are low price easy concealability corrosion resistance and high firepower Suing an industry for making affordable products shows how far the liabilitylitigation madness has goneThe lawsuits were simply an attempt to raise the costs of doing business and to bankrupt the companies Hillary may claim she cares about the poor but poor people in the highestcrime areas benefit the most from gun ownership and they are the people who would be priced out of owning guns for protectionVowing to do something concrete about mass public shootings on the campaign trail may be popular But Clintons proposed guncontrol solutions refuse to address the obvious problem of gunfree zones and will make ultimately make Americans less safeJohn R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission Lott is also a leading expert on guns and opeds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center He is the author of nine books including More Guns Less Crime His latest book is The War on Guns Arming Yourself Against Gun Control Lies August 1 2016 Follow him on Twitterjohnrlottjr
