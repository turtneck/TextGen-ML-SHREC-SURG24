George W Bush famously described himself as a uniter not a divider A few years into his presidency there was a survey that reported that 49percentof Americans thought he was a uniter and 49percentthought him a dividera poignant reminder that Americans are so polarized theyre even polarized about polarizationAnd of course the same goes for Obama who like Bush spent two terms as president trying but failing to be a bipartisan figureA characteristic feature of polarization seems to be the impression that ones own side is reasonable and that all the polarizing comes from the other side of the political aisleI came across an amusing example of this today ironically from a political scientist Gerard Alexander who in an oped entitled Jon Stewart Patron Saint of Liberal Smugness writesThis is just too perfect Its a beautiful paradox If Alexander is right then there is an important asymmetry in American politics which is the thing that hes saying conservatives dont believe If hes wrong then there is no asymmetry which is what hes saying conservatives believe in the first place Its like something out of Lewis CarrollIm reminded of economist Emily Osters quote that economists are different from almost everyone else in society in that they assume everybody is fundamentally alikeI also think its a bit odd for Alexander to describe liberals as fixated on Sarah Palin its not liberals who nominated Palin for vicepresident or who put her on TV Unless you want to describe William Kristol and Roger Ailes as liberalsAlso this from AlexanderMy strongest memory of Mr Stewart like that of many other conservatives is probably going to be his 2010 interview with the Berkeley law professor John Yoo Mr Yoo had served in Mr Bushs Justice Department and had drafted memos laying out what techniques could and couldnt be used to interrogate Al Qaeda detainees Mr Stewart seemed to go into the interview expecting a menacing Clint Eastwood type who was fully prepared to zap the genitals of some terrorist if thats what it took to protect Americas women and children Mr Stewart was caught unaware by the quiet reasonable Mr Yoo who explained that he had been asked to determine what legally constituted torture so the government could safely stay on this side of the line The issue in other words wasnt whether torture was justified but what constituted it and what didntFirst off let me say that this is a horrible thing to say about Clint Eastwood who was never involved in thisIts interesting to see what Alexander did there First he changed the question from crushing the testicles of the persons child which Yoo refused to say the government couldnt do zapping the genitals of some terrorist which is presumably also a treaty violation but doesnt sound so bad Second Alexander didnt even say suspected terrorist he said terrorist But of course one of the concerns with torture is that its not only done on terrorists its also done on people who get picked up on suspicion of terrorism or just people who somebody thinks might have some information Alexander gets to characterize Yoo as reasonable only by shifting the ground of the debate He also describes Yoo as quiet which seems pretty irrelevant to me Personally Id prefer someone who yells but opposes torture to someone who is softspoken and supports it Then again I dont personally know anyone whos been killed by a terrorist maybe if I did Id feel differentlyAnyway the point is that Alexander demonstrates political polarization in his column in the very way that he is castigating liberals for unreasonable for seeing themselves as more reasonable than conservatives And if youd like you could characterize this post as even more polarization in that of all the things I could write about today Ive chosen thisMy point though as a political scientist is that along with our very reasonable concerns about difficulties of communication between the left and the right  an often disturbing lack of national unity  comes a corresponding split in perceptions Alexander is correct to see a tendency among many liberals to think of themselves as more reasonable than conservatives But his column ironically demonstrates the symmetric tendency of many conservatives to see themselves as the reasonable ones So instead of mere disagreements on policy we get disputes about the legitimacy of each sides concerns as well as ahistorical views such as an attribution to liberals of Sarah Palins fameNone of this is new but it has been getting worse in the past generation and this particular column reminded me of itFinally its data time This is the Monkey Cage after all Here are some graphs from my book Red State Blue State on partisan polarization during the Korean Vietnam and Iraq wars
