A president hellbent on destroying human decency would be toxic for my son and daughtersListen up fellow Republican moms its time to say enough is enough It was time even before Donald Trumpsvulgar boastsabout what he could do to women because of his status before a parade of women accused him of actions matching those words No mother shouldever vote for this manDont get me wrong I do get your initial hesitancy You disagree with much of the Democratic platformAnd you probably arent too fond of Hillary Clinton Fine I dont love her politics much either but come on now Its time to wise upI have stood with the Republican Party since my first election back in 1984 when I pulled the lever for the originalMake America Great Againcandidate Ronald Reagan I am the daughter of a longtime Republican a man who worked under George W Bushwas fired by President Obama and was a passionate respectful advocate for conservative views until his death inJuneBut this is now the party of Donald Trump and I can tell you for this cardcarrying diehard Republican this time around its got nothing to do with platforms and politicsI am a mom of three children a son who is 16and two daughters ages13 and 11 And I know there is no wall that will protect my kids from a man hellbent on destroying the common core of human decencyThink about it From the moment they are born we teach our children how to actWe demonstrate through our words and our actions how to speak with respect embrace kindness work for change with a humble and open heart Then along comes Trump and the Republicans who so sheepishly stand behind their candidate simply because he is a Republican Almost overnight they have legitimized a cesspool of hypocrisy and hatredThese are the facts If we let Trump become presidentwe are saying to our children that respect for others doesnt matterWe are saying to our daughters that it is OK when a man belittles a woman based on her gender or her body type and that your value is solely based on your looksWe are saying to our children that money is power and power is a license to bully to punch him in the face just because he may disagree And we are saying to all our children forget everything we have ever taught you forget that compassion and morals matter forget that our differences are what make our country great forget the need to stand up for what is rightIf we elect Trump we are telling our kids thatits OK to be a narcissistic antagonistic egotistical SOB and that there are no rules if your tongue is sharp enough and your pocket is deep enoughAnd by blindly supporting a nomineejust because he has the stamp of approval from your party we are saying to our children just stand in line join the masses do whats expected Because in the end there is nothing you can do so why bother caringExcept I do care And I will never accept a candidate who uses power and words to intimidate rather than to protect Instead I will teach my children to always be willing to stand upbecause idle threats are but a shield for insecurity and incompetence I will never allow a man to condemn an entire community simply because of a skin color gender or faith instead I will remind my children that we are all the same on the insideI will never accept a man who shouts insults from his pedestal andI see no need to support his statements Instead I will require my children to speak intelligently to always back up their arguments with real evidence and to listen and engage with respect I will never supporta man who seemingly believes women are mere sex objects and says When youre a star they let you do it And I will never vote fora person who believes that I alone can fix it Instead I will help my children look for what they can do together to make a difference because it does take a villageI am a RepublicanBut I am also a momAnd as I watch Donald Trump and the Republican Party this election year I cannot allow the destructiveness of his words and lessons to take root within my children I may be a Party girl but I sure as hell am not an idiot So I sayto all my fellow Republican moms I am jumping ship and for the sake of our kids I hope you do tooJenny Tananbaum is a New Jerseybased mom writer and community volunteerYou can readdiverse opinions from ourBoard of Contributorsand other writers ontheOpinion front pageon TwitterUSATOpinionand in our dailyOpinion newsletterTo submit a letter comment or column check oursubmission guidelines
