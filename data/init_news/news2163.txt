Heres Why All These Political Cattle Calls MatterStop us if youve heard this one before  the vast field of GOP presidential hopefuls is gathering in a critical early state this weekend to give speeches woo voters and court activists Thats whats been happening nearly every weekend since the beginning of the year with Republican groups influencers and politicians each hoping to attract toptier candidates to their eventWith national Republicans trying to limit debates this year the multifaceted events have become the new normal for both candidates and the media On Saturday both announced and likely GOP candidates will head to Iowa for the next one where freshman GOP Sen Joni Ernst will hold her inaugural Roast and RideSo far there have been at least a dozen different cattle calls since January And if it feels like theres been a lot of cattle calls this year maybe thats because theres a lot of cattle For lesserknown candidates in such a crowded field the different events offer a chance to try to and catch fire with often little investment or infrastructure neededYou have a megaphone from the inside out said longtime Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht Theres no other place these candidates can go where they will see 200 media confined to one location Thats potentially 200 stories they wouldnt have otherwise gotten With these kinds of events its a very low bar to participate and to even be invitedAnd in Iowa  a state where GOP voters insist on meeting their candidates early and often  the guaranteed national attention has also been a boon for state and local RepublicansEverybody is a beneficiary of these events whether its the local county party the state party the campaigns and the voters Albrecht said because this gives Iowans the opportunity to see these candidates and potential candidates on the same stage back to back to directly compare how each of them would handle a particular situation These are a wonderful way for Iowans to gauge candidates on an Iowa stage who eventually want be on the world stageTo national observers the cattle calls have become the new debates and a way for hopefuls who havent been getting as much attention to boost their profile so they can ultimately make it onto the debate stage later this yearA lot of the folks in the field not named former Florida Gov Jeb Bush Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker or Florida Sen Marco Rubio they dont have very high name ID national GOP strategist Ford OConnell said Thats why the cattle calls are taking on an added importance in the way we havent seen beforeThe field will naturally be winnowed down after the first few states vote early next year But until then if candidates arent able to get momentum before the debates donors arent going to open up their wallets OConnell saidThe burst of early events in 2015 helped some candidates jump to the head of the pack nationally Albrecht pointed to Walkers breakout performance at the Iowa Freedom Summit this past January as one example While he noted that Iowans had been wowed by his speeches already the previous year the first major cattle call gave the Wisconsin governor the momentum he neededThere was serious buzz after that event said Albrecht a former top aide to Gov Terry Branstad RIowa Scott Walker has real star powerHe also pointed to former HewlettPackard CEO Carly Fiorina  who performed well at last months Iowa Lincoln Day Dinner and had a big crowd outside her room  and former Texas Gov Rick Perry  who needs a comeback after not living up to the hype in the state four years ago  as candidates who have shone at the eventsBoth will be at Ernsts event this weekend  only Perry and Walker will be riding motorcycles along the GOP senator though Seven candidates will be in attendance including Rubio South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Arkansas Gov Mike HuckabeeFiorina and Perry have yet to see much evidence of what activists say have been good performances Both are still mired in single digits in both early state polls and national surveys the latter of which will determine whether they make it onto the debate state during the first faceoff in AugustThat makes their continued performance in such cattle calls all the more important along with building their political operationsEverythings been turned on its head because of the capping of the debates and the calendar OConnell warned You know if youre not on the first one or two debate stages its going to be hard to get past New Hampshire
