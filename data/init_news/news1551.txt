Posted on November 4 2016 by DCG  1 Comment Seattle proggies love to push businesses out of their city From MyNorthwestcom  Seattle City Councilmember Tim Burgess proposed a 241 percent business license fee hike for pot shops citing inspection and enforcement costs associated with regulating the twoyearold retail marijuana industry The proposed increase introduced at Wednesdays budget meeting would raise the annual licensing cost within Seattle to 3450 from the existing 1000  Cannabis retailers  and one council member  immediately questioned the proposal saying that the math doesnt make much sense So what justified the increase other than the fact that we can do it asked District 2 Councilmember Bruce Harrell citing Mayor Ed Murrays more modest proposal for a 500 increase Weve done a cost analysis that actually reflects the increase It seems like weve exceeded it quite significantly The citys Finance and Administrative Services department defended the cost saying that even with the mayors proposed increase the licensing fee falls 430000 short of the citys cost to regulate pot The finance department projected that pot retailers will cost the city more than 700000 next year Pot growers and retailers wondered why this industry from a license fee standpoint must pay for its regulation in a way that other businesses such as pawn shops and strip clubs do not Moreover the city finance estimate misses a key point said KC Franks owner of Stash pot shops What about the 2 million in new sales taxes to the city Franks asked Why doesnt their math reflect that Seattle Council TaxRaisingAdvocate Tim Burgess Burgess who said he has no independent confirmation of the sales tax figures conceded that the pot retailers have raised some legitimate objections so Im sure we are going to look at all of that But he added the pot issue speaks to a larger policy discussion about how cities pay for the cost of regulating local businesses Typically he said a city uses a blend of licensing fees and taxes to get the money for necessary inspections and enforcement Pot he said costs Seattle about 1 million a year to regulate an amount which he characterized as a big burden This proposal was made to try to offset some of those costs he said Burgess said the licensing fee likely will go up but he is not sure if the full council will support his proposed increase The measure as it is or modified could come to a vote next week Franks and other marijuana retailers characterized the proposal as a simple cash grab directed at an industry without much political clout  or as much money as people seem to think Philip Dawdy of the Have a Heart pot shop wondered why an industry that is a net contributor to city coffers doesnt have more council support When the city raised business license fees to help pay for more police he said they consulted retail business organizations first The pot fee he said was a complete blindside We are actually helping to balance the citys budget thanks to sales taxes he said Why are we not someones priority DCG
