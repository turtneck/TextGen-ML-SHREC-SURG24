CNN My son served in the army for four years In Iraq He served because we love our country As we should Now look at usMuna Mansour is gesturing around her at the slatted cargo hold she and her family  all nine of them  are trying to get comfortable in Theyre squeezed in with two other families On the ground by my feet Munas middle grandchild is sleeping curled up beside an oil drumTheres nowhere to sleep theres no food  you can see how people are just thrown around all over the place she saidMuna is from Buffalo in upstate New York Her family is among the dozens of Americans caught in the crossfire of warring parties in Yemen And although many other countries evacuated their citizens India most notably ferrying out around 5000 the United States has said it is too dangerous for them to directly evacuate American nationalsFor more than three weeks neighboring Saudi Arabia has been conducting airstrikes in Yemen They want to drive out the Shiite Houthi rebels whose opposition to the government grew from protests to a takeover of government buildings and some territory At one time the Houthis held Yemens President under house arrest before he escaped and fledThe bombings have decimated some cities including Aden and foreigners find themselves trappedI was there when the Indians picked up 200 of their people from the port It was embarrassing We were just sitting there waiting for someone to come and say OK where are the Americans lets pick them up  she saidI called the Riyadh embassy she adds referring to the US Embassy in neighboring Saudi Arabia I told them there were about 75 families here waiting at the port My family has been waiting there for two weeks We ran out of money we ran out of foodThe State Department said it is too risky to conduct an evacuation of citizens from the areaWe have to make a decision based on the security situation and what is feasible to do State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said earlier this month And given the situation in Yemen is quite dangerous and unpredictable doing something like sending in military assets even for an evacuation could put US citizen lives at greater riskA group of US organizations including the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations and the AmericanArab AntiDiscrimination League have filed a lawsuit against the State Department and Defense Department over the governments stance on evacuationsIt was purely coincidence that led to Muna being on board this ship a wooden vessel chartered by CNN to reach the port city of Aden in YemenMuna was visiting her sick father in Aden when fighting broke out around her With the Houthi forces to the north and the waters of the Gulf of Aden to the south the city is essentially besieged It took us over 30 hours of travel  and a lull in the fighting  for us to be able to dock at one of Adens smaller portsShe has a nice normal life in New York and said she couldnt wait to get backOur ship was the first the port had seen in over a week We agreed to take back 60 refugees  including 15 Americans  who had gathered at the ports gate when news of our arrival spread But of course thats nowhere near enough So many more are desperate to leaveI asked Muna what life in Aden was like My daughterinlaw would crouch down and hide in the kitchen she recalls It was just bombs all the time Gunshots People running down the streetShe trails off into silenceFor everyone here with us on the boat there are families left behind Mothers and fathers Daughters and sonsThe first night on board our boat had an almost festive air Our new passengers were laughing and sharing cigarettes euphoric at their escape One woman though was sitting alone on deck and I realized she was crying She told me her 15yearold son was trapped on the other side of one of the many front lines that are now etched into the citys streetsTheyd waited for 10 days but neither her son nor her parents could cross over to the port in Al Tawahi district Too scared to risk missing the boat and endangering the lives of their other three children her husband had convinced her to board When they called to tell her son he also had news for them Hed joined the fight against the Houthi forcesFor Muna her ordeal ended at Djibouti Port where Christina Higgins the US Deputy Chief of Mission was among the embassy staff waiting to meet them I asked Higgins about the sense of abandonment Muna and many of the other Americans trapped in Yemen said they feltWe have one of the branches of al Qaeda thats especially active Theres the Houthis  neither of these two groups friendly to US citizens Weve had to weigh very very carefully what is the safest way the best way for us to help themHiggins said ultimately each US citizen is going to have to judge what is best for themselves and their familiesFor many US citizens thats going to mean sheltering in place For other US citizens were actively working at getting information to them on different avenues for travel out of YemenWatching them hand out cookies water and phones to reassure those waiting at home its clear the staff here are overjoyed to have some of their citizens safe and sound There are many more though of course who are still in dangerThere are no definitive records but the 15 Americans on board our ship said they had counted 75 more families waiting in Aden port who couldnt afford an exittransport fee being charged to depart AdenIn this time of crisis the 300aperson fee wasnt an official tax but something that local fishermen were charging to ferry passengers to the boat to boardThats 75 more families waiting for another happy coincidence to dock at Adens deserted ports
