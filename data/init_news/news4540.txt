The shooting in San Bernardino California on Wednesday was the 353rd mass shooting of 2015 according to the crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker that Vox uses for our maps documenting mass shootings Or it was the 29th if you use data from USA Today Or it was the fourth if you use a database maintained by Mother JonesHow are three news outlets coming up with such different answers It all comes down to definitionsThere are other differences too  for example Mother Jones says it generally only includes single gunman incidents though it includes San Bernardino and the Columbine massacre in its database But those are the main onesWhats happening here a dispute not about the facts but over what the appropriate definition isThe Mass Shooting Tracker definition is fairly new but the dispute between Mother Jones and USA Today is older and more ideologically fraught Thats because the Mother Jones definition suggests that mass shootings are rising in number and the USA Today definition doesntIf you look at all killings in which four or more people died there doesnt appear to be a strong upward trend according to estimates by Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox who uses a similar definition to USA TodayBut other researchers like Amy P Cohen Deborah Azrael and Matthew Miller of the Harvard School of Public Health argue that Mother Joness more restrictive definition is appropriate Cohen et al analyzed Mother Joness data and concluded that mass shootings were becoming more frequent They measure the average period of time between mass shooting incidents rather than the number of incidents themselves mass shootings of the kind theyre studying are rare enough to make the latter untenable They find that the period of time separating mass shootings by their definition has been shrinkingSo whos right Well Fox is right about the phenomenon hes studying Cohen et al are right about the phenomenon theyre studying and the Mass Shooting Tracker is right for the phenomenon its studying Declaring one or the other definition the right one is too pat each is right for the thing it tracks Foxs data tells us that shootings of four or more people didnt decline in the 1990s the way shootings as a whole did thats concerning Cohen et als data tells us that highprofile public mass shootings like Aurora or Newtown have not only failed to decline the way normal shootings have but have increased in recent years thats also concerning And the Mass Shooting tracker tells us that mass shootings deadly or not are a daily occurrence in the US that is obviously concerningBut people still care about determining the right definition in cases like this for the purpose of ideological proxy warfare Declaring Fox or Cohen et al right in particular has a certain political valence in the wider gun control debate You see something similar in discussions around school shootings wherein gun control skeptics are as eager to declare that gangrelated shootings in school are not real school shootings as they are to embrace Foxs definition in which gangrelated mass shootings are real mass shootings  and vice versa for gun control supportersThe best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings and isnt necessarily focused on homicides at allWhats frustrating about this is that whether mass shootings are increasing or decreasing in frequency has very little to do with the generalized case for gun control Mother Joness Mark Follman  who has done extraordinary work on gun violence in America including compiling the data set used by Cohen et al  is not wrong when he writes that the Mother Jonesdefined mass shootings are a unique phenomenon that must be understood on its own And its worth studying both the phenomena identified by Fox and those identified by Mother Jones to find specialized ways to prevent themBut mass shootings are very rare By Foxs definition there are between 50 and 125 victims a year compared with11068 total gun homicides in 2011 by the Mother Jones definition there are substantially fewer than thatMass shootings can and should be prevented and their comparative rarity makes them no less monstrous or tragic But the best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings and isnt necessarily focused on homicides at all Of the 33636 firearm deaths in 2013 63 percent or 21175 were suicides The evidence that the presence of additional guns contributes to more firearm homicides is persuasive but research from the Means Matter Project at the Harvard School of Public Health much of it done by Azrael and Miller themselves along with Cathy Barber shows that the evidence that guns contribute to higher levels of suicide is considerably strongerSuicide contrary to popular belief isnt typically planned and thought through extensively in advance Its impulsive one survey found that 90 percent of respondents deliberated for less than a day before attempting suicide And 90 percent of people who survive suicide attempts end up dying by other means They didnt make a considered choice and then seek to follow through by whatever means they made an impulsive decision and got lucky Ken Baldwin who survived a jump off the Golden Gate Bridge once told the New Yorkers Tad Friend that as he was falling he instantly realized that everything in my life that Id thought was unfixable was totally fixable  except for having just jumpedAmericas gun homicide problem is real frightening and must be addressed But its gun suicide problem is considerably worseGuns make it likelier that these impulsive decisions end in death rather than in survival and recovery Studies suggest that suicide attempts using guns are fatal in the vast majority of cases while attempts using cuts or poisoning are only fatal 6 or 7 percent of the time So its perhaps unsurprising that areas with more guns tend to have higher suicide rates or that a number of gun control measures have been successful in preventing suicides In one particularly dramatic case the Israeli Defense Forces stopped letting soldiers bring their guns home over the weekend and suicides fell 40 percent primarily due to a drop in firearm suicides committed on weekendsThe dominant focus of gun control efforts then should be on keeping guns and particularly handguns out of the hands of suicidal people Americas gun homicide problem is real frightening and must be addressed But its gun suicide problem is considerably worse My concern is that disputes over whether this or that incident counts as a mass shooting reaffirms the myth that Jared Loughner and Adam Lanza are the face of Americas gun violence problem Theyre not The tens of thousands who die every year because of depression and a nearby gun are They are rarely if ever mentioned in the gun debate and they deserve better
