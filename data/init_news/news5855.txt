Hillary Clintons nightmare is not the sudden resurgence of Bernie Sanders It is the fidelity to the rule of law of the FBIThe recent revelations of the receipt by Clinton of a Special Access Program email as well as cut and pasted summaries of state secrets on her server and on her BlackBerry nearly guarantee that the FBI will recommend that the Department of Justice convene a grand jury and seek her indictment for espionage Here is the backstoryIt seems that every week more information comes to light about Clintons grave legal woes Her worries are in two broad categories One is her welldocumented failure to safeguard state secrets and the other is her probable use of her position as secretary of state to advance financially her husbands charitable foundation The FBI is currently and aggressively investigating both What I will describe below is in the state secrets category It is apparently not new to the FBI but it is new to the publicAmong the data that the FBI either found on the Clinton server or acquired from the State Department via its responses to Freedom of Information Act requests is a topsecret email that has been denominated Special Access Program Top secret is the highest category of state secrets the other categories are confidential and secret and of the subparts of top secret SAP is the most sensitiveSAP is clothed in such secrecy that it cannot be received or opened accidentally Clinton  who ensured all of her governmental emails came to her through her husbands server a nonsecure nongovernmental venue  could only have received or viewed it from that server after inputting certain codes Those codes change at unscheduled times such that she would need to inquire of them before inputting themThe presence of the SAPdenominated email on her husbands server whether opened or not shows a criminal indifference to her lawful obligation to maintain safely all state secrets entrusted to her care Yet Clinton has suggested that she is hopelessly digitally inept and may not have known what she was doing This constitutes an attempted plausible deniability to the charge of failing to safeguard state secretsBut in this sensitive area of the law plausible deniability is not an available defense no judge would permit the assertion of it in legal filings or in a courtroom and no lawyer would permit a client to make the assertionThis is so for two reasons First failure to safeguard state secrets is a crime for which the government need not prove intent The failure can be done negligently Thus plausible deniability is actually an admission of negligence and hence in this case an admission of guilt not a denialSecond Clinton signed an oath under penalty of perjury on Jan 22 2009 her first full day as secretary of state In that oath she acknowledged that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawfully required care and keeping of state secrets Her briefing and her oath specified that the obligation to safeguard state secrets is absolute  it cannot be avoided or evaded by forgetfulness or any other form of negligence and that negligence can bring prosecutionWhat type of data is typically protected by the SAP denomination The most sensitive under the sun  such as the names of moles spies working for more than one government and their American handlers the existence of black ops illegal programs that the US government carries out of which it will deny knowledge if exposed codes needed to access state secrets and ongoing intelligence gathering projectsThe crime here occurs when SAPs are exposed by residing in a nonsecure venue it does not matter for prosecution purposes whether they fell into the wrong handsClintons persistent mocking of the seriousness of all this is the moral equivalent of taunting alligators before crossing a stream SAPs are so sensitive that most of the FBI agents who are investigating Clinton lack the security clearances needed to view the SAP found among her emails Most FBI agents have never seen a SAPShortly after the presence of the SAPdenominated email was made known the State Department released another email Clinton failed to erase wherein she instructed her subordinates to take state secrets from a secure venue to cut and paste and summarize them and send them to her on her nonsecure venue Such an endeavor if carried out is a felony  masking and then not safeguarding state secrets Such a command to subordinates can only come from a criminal mindEqually as telling is a littleknown 2013 speech that recently surfaced given by one of Clintons former subordinates The aide revealed that Clinton and her staff regularly engaged in digital conversations about state secrets on their BlackBerries This is not criminal if the BlackBerries were governmentissued and secured Clintons was neither It was purchased at her instructions off the shelf by one of her staffCan anyone doubt that Clinton has failed to safeguard state secrets If her name were Hillary Rodham instead of Hillary Rodham Clinton shed have been indicted months agoWhat remains of the rule of law in America The FBI will soon tell usAndrew P Napolitano a former judge of the
