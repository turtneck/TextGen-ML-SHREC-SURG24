Venezuela Throws In The Towel On Hyperinflation Will Print 200x HigherDenominated Bills   Zero Hedge While several years ago it was perhaps debatable in polite society that Venezuelas socialist economy would collapse ultimately unleashing hyperinflation any doubt was put to rest early this year when the IMFs own inflationary forecast confirmed as much However while the international community had long accepted the inevitable fate of Maduros socialist paradise the local government sternly refused to admit reality and to avoid confirming what the local population already knew it insisted on keeping the highest denomination bill in circulation at 100 bolivars whose worth is approximately 8 cents on the black market turning the most basic transactions into logistical nightmares and saddling banks with crippling moneyhandling costs Economists and central bank employees say Mr Maduro didnt want to acknowledge the countrys inflation problem by printing bigger notes This has finally changed and as the WSJ reports  Venezuelas government slammed by hyperinflation has finally thrown in the towel and is planning to issue new bills in December with larger denominationsup to 200 times higher than the current biggest bill according to people familiar with the plans The move marks an implicit acknowledgment by the government that skyrocketing prices have slashed the value of the currency The new coins and notes will go up to 20000 bolivars according to people close to the central bank the finance ministry the countrys banks and bill suppliers This would make the biggest note worth 15 on the black market And since by doing so the government will tacitly admit that it has lost control over prices It will also create a selffulfilling prophecy of even higher prices sending the countrys hyperinflation into overdrive As the WSJ adds earlier this year the government began informally allowing shops in the outer provinces to sell food at free market prices reducing shortages at the cost of higher inflation which the International Monetary Fund expects to rise above 1600 next year Further liberalization followed after the state oil company gradually rolled out higherpriced gasoline at gas stations in the border regions to reduce the cost of subsidizing the cheapest car fuel in the world according to the companys executives Venezuelas loss however is a big gain for the companies contracted to print the money In recent weeks several companies including UKbased De La Rue the worlds largest commercial printer won contracts to print the new set of notes which the government wants in time for the annual December spending spree according to a person familiar with contract negotiations Its a very big deal Its a big package the person said Meanwhile the central bank remains stuck in denial and hasnt published price statistics for almost two years Instead Mr Maduro has blamed the skyrocketing prices on the economic war waged against his government by shopkeepers and financiers This has forced people to brave one of the worlds highest crime rates by shopping with backpacks full of cash and spend hours lining up outside ATMs which give out less than 10 per withdrawal Many provincial banks have reduced daily withdrawals to 30000 bolivars which would buy a Venezuelan couple a lunch at a midscale restaurant Amusingly as we reported last year the high demand for nearly worthless currency notes has also presented a financial burden for the cashstrapped government which also lacks raw materials to print its own money Since last year Venezuela has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to printing companies to feed its economy with bolivar currency The shipments arrived to Venezuela from private printing presses around the world on several dozen windowless Boeing 747 jets Given the crime risks the air shipments arrive at the Caracas airport at night before the notes are loaded onto armored trucks and transported to the central bank vaults in Caracas protected on the 18mile route by soldiers Indicatively a fully stocked ATM is emptied in just three and a half hours on average now according to the Venezuelan Banking Association The good news for the insolvent nation is that all local denominated debts are now just as worthless as the currency which incidentally is what the BOJs Kuroda would call mission accomplished Sadly Venezuela is the canary in the coalmine for what will happen to all currencies in a world where there is now simply too much debt
