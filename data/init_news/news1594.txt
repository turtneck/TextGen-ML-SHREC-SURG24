CNN Donald Trumps campaign is undergoing a major staff shakeup with less than three months to Election Day adding two officials to top posts overseeing his struggling campaign and signaling a shift toward campaigning as a scorched earth outsider in order to winTrump has named Steve Bannon the executive chairman of Breitbart News and a former investment banker to the post of chief executive and promoted Kellyanne Conway a senior adviser and pollster to his campaign to the position of campaign manager Conway confirmed to CNN early Wednesday morningThe addition of Bannon  known for his brassknuckled demeanor and his websites sharp tone  came hours after reports surfaced that Roger Ailes the recently ousted head of Fox News will begin to advise Trump as he prepares for the presidential debates The influence of both men lays the groundwork for unleashing Trump this fall from the more traditional presidential candidate framework which Campaign Chairman Paul Manaforts leadership was brought on to createManafort the campaigns chief strategist will stay on in his campaign chairman role Conway saidI look at it as an expansion of the team Paul remains as chairman Conway told CNNManafort himself said it was an exciting day for Team Trump in an emailed memo to the campaign staff that was provided to CNN by a campaign source He added that he will provide the big picture longrange campaign vision that will guide the campaign to victory in NovemberBut sources close to the campaign told CNN that while Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates will remain on staff they will return to their Washington DC base largely sidelinedInstead of Manaforts attempts to make Trump a more traditional candidate Bannon will take over as Trumps top adviser giving Trump free rein to run as the outsider candidate who won the Republican primariesBannons ascension solidifies an informal mutually beneficial relationship between Breitbart which has unapologetically championed Trump and the campaign The website which Bannon has been closely involved with since its launch in 2007 has also been a center for conspiracy theories about Clintons health as well as stories about Bill Clintons alleged treatment of womenThe campaigns changes came as tensions mounted inside Trumps campaign in recent weeks and as Trumps relationship with Manafort soured to the point that several people close to the campaign warned that a major staff shakeup might be imminent sources close to the campaign told CNNThe staffing shakeup follows several weeks of negative headlines and alarming polls for Trump who is trailing Hillary Clinton the Democratic nominee in nearly every key battleground state and lagging in the latest national pollsTrump decided on the changes this weekend after speaking with campaign donors at a fundraiser in The Hamptons including Rebekah Mercer a highprofile GOP donor with longstanding ties to Conway who shared her concerns with Trump about the direction of the campaign a source told CNNTrump then called Conway on Sunday from his golf club in Bedminster New Jersey to express his displeasure with the direction of his struggling campaign sources close to the campaign saidNotably he made the decision without input from his adult children who were off traveling during the weekend sources close to the campaign saidDonald Jr Eric and Ivanka Trump have been influential advisers in the campaign and key mediators between Trump and Manafort often also guiding their father to mollify his rhetoric and run a more conventional campaignTrumps call to Conway came the same day Trump also met with Ailes at the same golf clubReturning from an overseas vacation Trump soninlaw Jared Kushner a top campaign official convened a meeting at Trump Tower with Manafort Gates Bannon and Conway on Trumps orders to announce the shift in roles sources saidThe Trump campaign denied that Ailes would be taking on any role with the campaign and campaign aides also received a memo Tuesday slapping down those reports according to a source close to the campaignIn a statement from the campaign Wednesday morning outlining the changes Trump said he was willing to do whatever it takes to win this electionI have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years They are extremely capable highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win Trump said in the statement I believe were adding some of the best talents in politics with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and continue to share my message and vision to Make America Great AgainSecond major shakeup of the summerThe shakeup marks the second major change in the top rungs of the billionaires campaignTrump just two months ago fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski after weeks of internal fighting between Lewandowski and Manafort who was initially brought on to oversee Trumps efforts to stave off the possibility of a contested conventionAs the campaign shakeup neared campaign aides pointed fingers at each other the campaigns pollsters quarreled over strategy and the friction between Trump and Manafort became apparentBoth Trump and Manafort discussed the friction in their relationship with friends in recent days and a close associate described Trump as frustrated at the state of the race leveling complaints that he has been the victim of bad advice from his political teamMr Trump doesnt trust him anymore Thats it Pure and simple a source familiar with the tensions told CNN adding that Trumps gaffes and controversial statements in recent weeks have been fueled in part by his exasperation with the campaigns managementWhen Mr Trump doesnt feel comfortable with the way things are managed or the way things are he has a tendency to try to do everything thus his exasperation becomes apparent It manifests itself the source saidSeveral people in touch with Trump or his top political advisers in recent days said they had heard a shakeup was possible But some cautioned that such chatter was predictable and inevitable when any campaign faces tough timesTrumps decision to overhaul his campaigns leadership came as recent polls showed Clinton thrashing Trump in the key battleground states and even gaining a lead in several states that typically lean Republican such as GeorgiaAnd the decision also follows a slew of selfinflicted wounds since the Democratic National Convention wrapped with Trump exchanging barbs with the parents of a slain US soldier reigniting intraparty tensions by initially declining to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan in his reelection bid and ultimately suggesting that Second Amendment people could act to keep Clinton from appointing liberal Supreme Court justices should she become presidentTrumps campaign advisers have sought to refocus him including through a pair of scripted policy speeches on the economy and terrorism that offered a stark contrast to Trumps freewheeling styleBut Trump has repeatedly said he is resistant to change and reiterated that Tuesday in an interview with a local news station in WisconsinI am who I am Its me I dont want to change Everyone talks about Oh are you going to pivot I dont want to pivot You have to be you If you start pivoting you are not being honest with people Trump told WKDTLewandowski who is now a CNN political commentator has continued to informally advise Trump according to sources familiar with their ongoing conversationsLewandowski said Tuesday evening on CNN that while Trump may try to be more inclusive Trump knows who he is internallyWhat hes going to do is remain true to himself which is what this campaign has been about Lewandowski saidInternal finger pointing abounded in recent days as recent media accounts have portrayed a campaign in disarray and attimes feuding with frustrated GOP leaders Differences between the Trump campaigns pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Conway who was promoted to campaign manager were also the source of recent tensionsThe source noted that Lewandowski had issued a similar campaign memo when Manafort was hired in a volunteer capacity with the campaign
