Tuesdaynights Republican presidential debate was the first since the Islamic Stateinspired terrorist shooting in San Bernardino California and not surprisingly most of the questions tossed out by CNN moderators dealt with national security and terrorism In the days since San Bernardino public fears over terrorism have grown and President Obama has been doing what he can to tamp down anxiety and encourage people not to give in to the fear that terrorists work to inspire But as the CNN debate made painfully clear the Republican presidential candidates have quite the opposite goal in mind They want everyone to be scared witless by the looming terrorist menace and worried that they will be the next to dieNew Jersey GovChris Christie back on the main stage thanks to CNNs expansive inclusion rules and his own improved poll numbers in New Hampshire did the most to actively scare the shit out of every person unfortunate enough to be watching In his opening statement he announced that America has been betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have provided to this country As proof of that betrayal and treason Christie pointed to yesterdays closing of the Los Angeles Unified School District based on a threat He never got around to mentioning that the threat had long since been revealed as a hoax But still Christie was worried about the children filled with anxiety and the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop and the the fathers of Los Angeles who tomorrow will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children They live in terror these nameless gendered stereotypes because Obama couldnt protect them from the threat posed by madbombercockliAsked what he would do to ensure that fear does not paralyze American in the aftermath of terrorism Christie explained that paralyzing fear is unfortunately the new normal under Barack Obama Everywhere in America is a target for these terrorists he said giving everyone a reason to be afraid always Christies closing statement was a riff on 911 Many of our friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day Christie even offered himself as a menacing presence leaning forward and shifting back and forth behind his lectern like a rhinoceros sizing up a Jeep full of safari tourists His message all evening was blunt and terrifying you will die unless you vote for meNot far behind Christie was Sen Marco Rubio who made a point of spelling out in detail the menacing nature of the Islamic State This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America he warned This is a very significant threat we face And the president has left us unsafe He made a special point of noting the Islamic States sophistication This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability for example to radicalize American citizens This is not just the most capable it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced He warned about the next time there is an attack on this country while pushing for reinstatement of metadata collection provisions in the Patriot Act Sen Ted Cruz went a slightly different route linking Republican panic over Syrian refugees to both the San Bernardino terrorist attack which had nothing to do with refugees and the 2013 Senate immigration reform bill to score a bankshot hit on Rubio CRUZ Because the front line with ISIS isnt just in Iraq and Syria its in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande Border security is national security And you know one of the most troubling aspects of the RubioSchumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees including Syrian refugees without mandating any background checks whatsoever Now weve seen what happened in San Bernardino When you are letting people in when the FBI cant vet them it puts American citizens at risk All in all it was a grim bleak and frightful debate that saw several leading candidates try to stoke heightened public anxiety over terrorism There were no acknowledgements that acts of terrorism are exceptionally rare with just 45 Americans killed in jihadist terrorist attacks since 911 More Americans have died as a result of homegrown rightwing terrorism but that threat didnt earn a single mention at the debate even though one such attack took place just days before San Bernardino This was more about resurrecting the national security politics of the Bush years when Republicans would conjure the threat of imminent terrorist slaughter on American soil to cast Democrats as weak and to justify the rollback of civil liberties in the interest of safety A scared voter is a motivated voter and Republicans have every interest in keeping people as terrified as possible
