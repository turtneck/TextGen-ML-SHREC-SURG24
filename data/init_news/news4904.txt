Jan 1 2016 is 859 days away But judging from the headlines about the 2016 presidential race blaring across news Web sites and cable channels this August you might think it were next monthHillary Rodham Clinton along with her husband and daughter is trying to raise 250million for the familys philanthropic foundation prior to 2016 in hopes of avoiding bad optics if she runs for president Sen Ted Cruz RTex spent last weekend in Iowa and was in New Hampshire on Friday Vice President Bidens political team is making clear that he is thinking seriously about the next presidential contest and hell be in Iowa next month to show just how serious he isAll of the early machinations by Republicans and Democrats who want to be the next president  even though President Obama won reelection just 292 days ago  have spawned a cottage industry of people wondering whether this is the earliest start ever for a presidential race and whether thats a good or a bad thing Almost everyone The Fix most definitely excluded says its a bad thingWhile the 2016 race may have started earlier than most American presidential politics have been governed for some time by what we like to call The Fixs Iceberg Theory Heres the theory in a sentence Like an iceberg the bulk of a presidential race happens underwater or out of sight of the average personNow for the longer explanationMost regular people  even those living in states such as Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina that play an outsize role in picking presidents  are paying absolutely no attention to what the people who might run in three years time for the nations highest office are doing right nowThat lack of interest tends to drive a narrative that what happens now simply does not matter for the 2016 race Thats wrong Simply because the average voter isnt aware of whats happening in presidential politics at the moment doesnt mean it doesnt matterThe truth of presidential races is that the dominant story line for each of the potential candidates is built out of sight of the average voter crafted years in advance of the political iceberg popping above the surface for everyone to seeIt was during the 2006 midterm elections that buzz started to build around Barack Obama the freshman senator who was drawing massive crowds everywhere he went to stump or raise money for Democratic candidatesIt was during his 1998 Texas gubernatorial reelection campaign that George W Bush built and honed the compassionate conservative message that he rode to the Republican nomination and the presidency in 2000On the other side of the equation it was in 2006 that thenSen Evan Bayh DInd was cast as a vanilla centrist a characterization that played a major part in his decision not to run for president in 2008 Biden battled the perception that he was not serious enough to be the nominee throughout the 2008 race an impression drawn from years of bluntimpolitic commentsFastforward to the present day Is Sen Marco Rubio Fla a conservative who can broaden the Republican Partys reach to crucial Hispanic voters or a moderate in conservatives clothing as evidenced by his key involvement in the Senate immigration bill Is New Jersey Gov Chris Christie R a blunttalking problem solver or a bullying blowhard Is Sen Rand Paul Ky a danger to the GOP or its savior Is Clinton the inevitable nominee or the same flawed politician that Obama exposed during the 2008 Democratic primariesAll of these questions will be answered  or come close to being answered  before a single vote is cast  and in many cases before the average person even begins to think about the 2016 presidential raceAnd its not just narratives that get formed years in advance of actual votes Building a national fundraising operation that can collect tens  if not hundreds  of millions of dollars takes massive amounts of time Constructing a political team that has the right combination of experience and fresheyed insight can be the work of a political lifetime Courting key activists in Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina or Nevada is an arduous process in which time spent can make all the differenceIgnoring the iceberg nature of the presidential race then can have huge negative consequences In 2008 former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee R became the momentum candidate after winning the Iowa caucuses But because he and his team either didnt understand or ignored the iceberg theory he was unable to build on that momentum in New Hampshire where he finished a distant third After a runnerup showing in South Carolina Huckabees chances at the nomination vanishedSmart candidates  and their campaigns  understand that the bulk of the work that goes into winning the presidential nomination happens well out of sight of a single voter Momentum still matters  a lot  but without a structure to take advantage of that momentum it can peter out as quickly as it comes And if the primary fight drags out  a la the 2008 Democratic primaries or the 2012 Republican fight  what a candidate and hisher campaign team did years before when no voters were watching can be the difference between winning and losingIf you remember one thing about the presidential race then remember this Whats going on below the surface can  and almost always does  make or break the candidates
