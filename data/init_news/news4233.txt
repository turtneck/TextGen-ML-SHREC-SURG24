State trooper Michael Keyes was once involuntarily committed which bars him from owning a gun But with a clean bill of health hes now suing for his 2nd Amendment rightsAnd the Pennsylvania state trooper knows how to use one he carries several on duty rotating between his Sig Sauer 227 handgun a fullyautomatic AR15 and a Remington 870 shotgun But while a very armed Keyes is trusted to serve and protect Pennsylvania as soon as he clocks out he is banned by state law from owning a gun for personal useAt issue for Keyes are laws governing firearm ownership for the mentally illa rallying cause backed by practically everyone including the National Rifle Association But Keyes along with his coplaintiff in a new federal lawsuit corrections officer Jonathan Yox may now be the new poster boys for a contingent of gun rights advocates who argue mental illness provisions of the 1968 Gun Control Act GCA are too strict and infringe on the Second Amendment Rights of thousands of perfectly sane individualsKeyes and Yox have both been involuntarily committed to a mental institution which in the eyes of both federal and state law makes them forever dangerous to themselves and othersdespite both men having since been cleared by mental health professionalsFor Keyes it was a pair of bitter divorces that triggered depression heavy drinking threats of suicide and an eventual twoweek commitment Following that dark period he fought for and won his reinstatement with the state police and has earned outstanding marks in performance reviewsSince 2008 Keyes attempts to restore his rights for personal firearms use have been unsuccessful Though a county court judge found Keyes to no longer be a threat to himself or others he ruled there was no way to expunge his record or overcome the federal ban State superior court judge Kate Ford Elliott echoed the lower courts ruling in 2013 but went further The dangers inherent in the possession of firearms by the mentally ill are manifest she wrote and even more so in the case of Keyes who was involuntarily committed and thus failed to recognize and act upon his own illness Further she noted a present clean bill of mental health is no guarantee that a relapse is not possibleYox was also hospitalized in 2006 twice by his parents when he was just 15 years old for an incident where he bought cocaine into school and a brief period of depression that included cutting himself and a suicide pact with a girlAfter Yoxs release he graduated from high school joined the Army and served in Afghanistan and now actively carries a firearm as a State Correctional Officer In a 2012 mental health review a psychologist found him to be a pleasantcleancut outgoing young man with future goals and a strong support system Though Yox was committed as a juvenile his 2013 attempt to expunge his recordso that he could purchase a weapon for home defense and pursue a career in governmentfell short The judge in Yoxs case cited the Keyes ruling in his decisionState laws vary widely in regard to how they restrict firearms for the mentally ill Pennsylvania is one of 21 states that have accepted a court order or an involuntary commitment as a barrier to gun ownership according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Five other states including California and Connecticut include voluntary commitment in their bansa move that gun rights advocates argue keeps gun owners who need professional help from seeking itReforming these blanket bans may just be an issue that even gun control groups can supportThere should be an process whereby people whove lost their rights to guns because of mental illness should be able to get them back and weve supported that said Shira Goodman Executive Director of gun violence prevention group CeasfirePA But in part I blame the gun lobby itself who she says has hijacked gun bills in Pennsylvania that addressed similar mental health issues In 2013 Pennsylvania provided the FBI with 643167 records representing people banned from purchasing firearms because of involuntary mental health commitments in the stateThis new federal case is asking a judge to find that the mental illness disability does not exist for Keyes and Yox and that the absence of any method of relief is in violation of their Second Amendment rights Still their attorney sees wider implicationsThis is going to be the first step in getting the Federal courts to address this type of situation said Keyes attorney Joshua Prince We have an individual who we can show possess firearms without threat to himself or others and does so on a daily basis and the fact is there is no reasonable basis for denying that person the ability to defend himself in his home
