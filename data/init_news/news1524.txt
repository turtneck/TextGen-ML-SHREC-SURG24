Why A Vote For An Establishment Candidate Could Be A Vote For Trump In NHA lot of Republicans will head to the polls in New Hampshire on Tuesday motivated to vote against Donald TrumpBut because of a quirk in how the state party allocates delegates and how fractured the establishment field is it could mean that an antiTrump vote will actually be a vote for the New York billionaireThe state party awards delegates on a proportional basis to presidential candidates based on their vote statewide and by congressional districtBut it also has a 10 percent thresholdWhat does that mean It means that if a candidate does not get 10 percent of the vote he gets no delegates And this is a hard threshold  no roundingWhats more not only do those underperforming candidates get no delegates but whatever delegates they could have gotten based on their vote share go to the winner of the primary And right now the favorite is TrumpTrump after all has been leading in the polls in New Hampshire by double digits for six straight monthsMeanwhile the socalled establishment candidates  the kind of mainstream Republicans that usually prevail in New Hampshire  are split And after Saturday nights debate with Marco Rubios lackluster performance that establishment vote could be fractured even furtherThere are 20 delegates at stake in New Hampshire on primary night Heres a look at how the candidates are performing in the polls currently what that could translate to delegatewise and how the 10 percent threshold could affect thingsAccording to the RealClearPolitics polling average heres the order of the candidates with a line inserted to represent the 10 percent cutoffSo lets do some math Everyone below the 10 percent threshold  Bush Christie Fiorina and Carson  add up to 22 percentSo 22 percent of 20 is 44 Round down and that means roughly another four delegates would be added to Trumps totalInstead of a 63 delegate win Trump would get 10 Thought about another way Some 40 percent of Trumps delegates could be coming from people who cast their votes explicitly in opposition to him  or at least for candidates running very different campaignsAnd by the way those delegates are bound to vote for Trump at the Republican National Convention in July because of changes to the Republican National Committees rules  that all states that hold their nominating contests before March 15 must award their delegates on a proportional basis and they must be bound to the candidates
