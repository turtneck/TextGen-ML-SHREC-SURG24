The Supreme Court on Mondaydecided that Oklahoma may continue the use of the controversial sedative midazolam for lethal injections  even after the drug was linked to several botched executions in 2014The Supreme Court case dealt with the botched execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma The Lockett execution which took 43 minutes after experimental lethal injection drugs were administered led four inmates  one of whom was executed before the Supreme Court decided the issue  to file a lawsuit challenging Oklahomas lethal injection protocol The Supreme Court ultimately decided the botched execution along with other evidence wasnt adequate proof that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishmentBut Oklahoma didnt always use midazolam for executions The use of the controversial sedative is actually a response toan ongoing lethal injection drug shortage which has left the future of the death penalty unclear in Utah Oklahoma Tennessee and the 29 other states where executions are legal and added a new angle to the perennial debate about the morality and effectiveness of capital punishmentOver the past few years a shortage of sodium thiopental a key drug in lethal injections has left states scrambling for alternative ways to execute prisoners and has inspired some to shroud the process in secrecyThe shortage began around 2010 when drug suppliers around the world including in the US began refusing to supply drugs for the injections  out of either opposition to the death penalty or concerns about having their products associated with executionsThe drugs were being cut off right and left Deborah Denno a death penalty expert at Fordham University saidThe drugs were being cut off right and leftHospira Inc was the sole US supplier of sodium thiopental according to Denno But Hospira stopped producing the drug in 2011 after struggling to procure active ingredients for its production and fielding legal threats from authorities in Italy where the death penalty is vehemently opposedSome states still managed to import sodium thiopental from shadier overseas sources But beginning in 2012 the US District Court of the District of Columbia issued several rulings banning imports of the drugs deciding that the imported supplies didnt meet FDA regulationsAs the shortage continued states turned to other European companies for alternative drugs such as phenobarbital and propofol that are typically used as sedatives for surgeries But these companies  under pressure from a European Union export ban activists like Reprieve and foreign governments that prohibit the death penalty  over time refused to supply the drugsAs these companies either stopped supplying drugs or were unable to export to the US states began to look for new  and sometimes untested  ways to execute prisonersWith pharmaceutical companies out of the picture states resorted to compounding pharmacies to make the drugs which until nowescapedmost regulations since they did small mostly outofsight transactions with individuals not major customers The USbased pharmacies began to produce experimental sometimes secretive cocktails for states executionsCompounding pharmacies were originally meant to make custom drugs for individual people not major buyers like state governments Denno said As a result their drug cocktails can often be very shoddy  Georgia stopped an execution because its lethal injection drug was cloudy  and have been decried as experimental and dangerous by civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties UnionBut even compounding pharmacies may soon stop providing execution drugs to states The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists on March 24 announced that it discourages its members from participating in the preparation dispensing or distribution of compounded medications for use in legally authorized executionsProducing lethal injection drugs is only going to invite further scrutinyThe stance may be a way for compounding pharmacies which are largely unregulated to avoid the extra regulatory scrutiny that can come with producing lethal injection drugs These compounding pharmacies already have enough of a public relations issue Denno said Massachusetts for instance in 2014passed a law cracking down on compounding pharmacies after a local companys drugs were implicated in the deaths of more than 60 people Producing lethal injection drugs Denno said is only going to invite further scrutinyBut instead of stepping up regulations some death penalty states have adopted measures to shield compounding pharmacies that provide lethal drugs from outside scrutinyIn December Ohio passed a law that will keep suppliers of lethal drug injections anonymous John Murphy executive director of the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association which supports the law said last December that the changes are not meant to make the execution process more secretive This just protects the identity of the people involved so they dont get harassed intimidated or attacked he saidThe drug shortage hasnt only led to concerns about market forces regulations and supply and demand Its also raised important constitutional questions about cruel and unusual punishment as the shortage has led some states to try experimental and unpredictable drugs for executionsSince 2014 there have been several highprofile botched executions  described in gruesome detail in the press  all of which have involved secretive experimental uses of midazolamHere are some of the casesThese botched executions drew criticism and put an unwanted spotlight on the use of experimental lethal drugs which critics say is a violation of constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment Some states including Ohio and Oklahoma have delayed further executions as they review their practicesDenno expects these problems to continue as states struggle to replace superior drugs like sodium thiopental Every time a state changes to a new drug it introduces a degree of uncertainty Denno said These drugs arent the first choiceBotched executions have been around as long the death penalty About 7 percent of lethal injections and 3 percent of all executions between 1890 and 2010 were botched according to Austin Sarats Gruesome SpectaclesPart of the reason states began using lethal injection drugs is because the previously preferred method of execution for many states electrocution often had horrifying results including the eruption of burned flesh and even live fires as prisoners gasped for air and slowly diedWe have really incompetent people doing thisBut lethal injections carry problems beyond the drugs used for the procedures that may make them even more prone to being bungled For one most doctors  who are likely the most qualified to administer the deadly drugs  wont participate in executions because administering a deadly drug to kill someone would violate professional ethics In 2010 the American Board of Anesthesiologists voted to revoke the certification of any member who participates in executing a prisonerAs a result states arent typically able to bring in the besttrained doctors particularly anesthesiologists to administer drugs that are very dangerous when mishandled We have really incompetent people doing this Denno saidPerhaps as a result lethal injection has always been one of the riskier forms of execution  even before the drug shortage forced states to experiment with alternative substancesIn Oklahoma the doctor and paramedic who participated in Clayton Locketts botched execution said they received no training theAPs Sean Murphy reported The execution team administered needles that werent long enough for the procedure and caused what a state official called a bloody mess when the doctor tried to set an IV line in Locketts groin and blood gushed outIn addition to physically botching an execution its always possible the state will execute an innocent person An April 2014 study published in PNAS a scientific journal suggested that at least 4 percent of people sentenced to death in the US are likely innocent At least six people were exonerated of death sentences in 2014 according to a January report from the National Registry of ExonerationsSo far Denno of Fordham University has tracked three states that are moving toward alternatives to lethal injection should they run out of drugs Tennessee reinstated the possibility of the electric chair Utah hasallowed the firing squad again and Oklahoma haspermitted nitrogen gasThese methods of executions were largely abandoned 50 years ago After the Supreme Court forced states in 1972 to reform their execution procedures to be less racially discriminatory states began mostly using lethal injections as this fantastic chart posted by John West at Quartz showsStates could potentially seek out different drugs to continue using lethal injections and avoid execution methods that are widely seen as more gruesome But states are also likely wary of repeating the same problems theyve experienced with the current batch of drugs The same thing is going to happen Denno said This has been a cycle every time states have tried to do it theyve been cut offBut many of the methods of execution that dont involve injected drugs have major problemsDenno predicted gas executions will likely turn into a disaster She said gas has the same issues as lethal injection drugs its unclear where states would get the chemicals required for the executions and whatever chemicals are used may not be suitable for a quick relatively painless death It also recalls ghastly memories of World War II when the Nazis used gas chambers to kill prisoners in death campsThe firing squad is the quickest the surest and you have trained executioners to do itElectrocution and hanging were abandoned in the first place because they often resulted in botched executions Electrocutions caused burned skin or live fires during multiple executions and hangings could go very wrong when the rope broke or the prisoner was decapitated Both can also takelonger than 10 minutes to kill a prisonerDenno argued the firing squad may turn out to be the most humane of the available options even above lethal injections Its the quickest the surest and you have trained executioners to do it she saidDunham executive director of theDeath Penalty Information Center said states are dealing with the reality that theres no humane way of killing someone All the methods of execution have problems Dunham said The involuntary termination of another persons life by execution is an inherently violent actOf course states may be able to come up with another method entirely  or repeal the death penalty altogether But at least for now states appear to be sticking to the traditional ways of executing prisonersCapital punishment persists through drug shortages and botched executions because it still has strong public support in the US which puts pressure on lawmakers to find alternatives to lethal injection drugs rather than abolishing the death penalty in the 32 states where its still legalAmericas support for the death penalty stands in sharp contrast with Europe where only Belarus a proMoscow dictatorship still allows capital punishmentAn October 2014 Gallup poll found 63 percent of Americans support the death penalty while 33 percent oppose itSupport for the death penalty gets a little more complicated when Americans are asked about specific methods of execution An NBC News poll from May 2014 found nearly twothirds of voters support alternatives to lethal injection if the needle isnt an option But most US adults told YouGov in a February 2015 survey that the gas chamber electric chair firing squad hanging and beheading are cruel and unusual punishment while lethal injection isntSupport for the death penalty also varies from state to state Executions are much more culturally and legally ingrained in the South and to a lesser extent the West than in the rest of the country Eighteen states have abolished the death penalty most of which are in the Northeast and Midwest according to the Death Penalty Information CenterSo while popular support generally pressures lawmakers to find alternatives to lethal injections thats not necessarily true in all parts of the country and most US adults dont appear to support all methods of executionRegardless of what lawmakers do the number of executions has been dropping for years A report from the Death Penalty Information Center found the number of executions hit a 20year low in 2014But even if thats the case the death penalty as a whole remains very popular and culturally ingrained in the US  and thats led states to seek alternatives like experimental drugs the firing squad and nitrogen gas rather than abolishing executions altogether
