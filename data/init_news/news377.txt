in Natural Medicine We all know that its important to eat our vegetables At least thats what most of us have heard since we were kids What our mothers told us as when we were young our doctors tell us as we get older Sometimes though it helps to have a more specific reason than high cholesterol or even a motherly because I said so Especially for people who arent big fans of eating organic greens According to a study conducted at Oregon State Universitys Linus Pauling Micronutrient Research Institute confirms that sulforaphane a phytochemical found in broccoli and related cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbage  have a natural ability to target and attack prostate cancer cells without harming neighboring cells  1   Unconnected studies suggest it may have similar promise for breast cancer The active chemicals found in everyday foods  such as broccoli  are often much more potent than people would imagine If fact determining how to safely adapt these chemical ingredients for medical use is one of the biggest hurdles researchers face Even edible plants that are considered rich in a given nutritional substance contain relatively low amounts of it by volume The vast majority of these compounds may also become toxic to humans if taken in large enough concentrations While a number of previous investigations have proven that sulforaphane is able to attack both benign and malignant cancer cells the Oregon State study is one of the first to prove that it is effective without disrupting otherwise healthy tissue This gives researchers a tremendous tool for developing new lowrisk treatment options and is likely to encourage additional research into the healing potential of other seemingly mundane edible plants Realistically it could be some time before these findings are applied to any sort of drug development or cancer treatment in a traditional hospital setting Meanwhile though the researchers behind the study recommend that we all eat more organic cruciferous vegetables Besides broccoli a number of readily available cruciferous vegetables contain naturally large amounts of sulforaphane Some good examples of foods high in this important phytochemical include mild and spicy radishes turnips watercress cabbage arugula kale chard and most other leafy greens Unrelated studies also suggest a variety of other cancerfighting compounds may be present in other herbs and garden vegetables Celery and parsley  for instance are especially rich in apigenin  a substance that has shown remarkable promise for fighting breast cancer Trace amounts of apigenin are also found in oranges apples and some tree nuts The problem is its very difficult for the body to effectively extract it from any of these foods on its own References Oregon State University Study confirms safety cancertargeting ability of nutrient in broccoli  News  Research Communications 2011 June 9 Submit your review
