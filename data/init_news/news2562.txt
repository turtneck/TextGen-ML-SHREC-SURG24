New York CNN Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will face off in CNNs Democratic presidential debate in Brooklyn Thursday night as they spar ahead of a critical contest in New York  a state where both candidates have deep rootsThe April 19 primary here will come as Clinton  whose campaign has been dogged by Sanders unexpected endurance  is on an urgent mission to widen her delegate lead and lock up her partys nominationNext weeks contest will serve as one of Sanders last opportunities to change the dynamics of the Democratic race And in turn it will offer Clinton a crucial opening to once and for all shake the pervasive narrative that her rival  even as he lags behind in the delegate count  continues to enjoy real momentum tens of thousands of Sanders supporters rallied in Washington Square Park in Manhattan Wednesday nightIn a sign of the mounting pressure for both candidates over the past few weeks their exchanges on the campaign trail have grown increasingly bitter Sanders has publicly questioned Clintons judgment and credibility while Clinton has hit back by accusing her rival of being inexperienced and promoting an unrealistic platformNext weeks contest will also be an especially personal one for both Democratic hopefulsClinton who served as the states senator for eight years currently has a home in Chappaqua and chose to base her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Sanders meanwhile was born and raised in Brooklyn and still has a thick New York accentBoth candidates are also insistent that they are best equipped to take on Republican frontrunner Donald Trump  another New YorkerHere is to watch when the two square offThursdays Democratic debate could be the feistiest yetOver the past few weeks Clinton and Sanders have ramped up their attacks hitting each other harder on both character and policy The new tenor of the race is in stark contrast to the earliest stages of the race when the two candidates were cordial and made painstaking efforts to avoid going after each otherSanders in particular prided himself in running a positive campaign constantly reminding voters that he had never run a negative ad in his political careerBut with the Democratic race dragging on into the spring fresh tensions are bubbling up to the surfaceThings grew even more heated when the Sanders campaign put out a press release questioning Clintons credibility this week  an attack that was met with ferocious pushbackHe was born here She was elected hereFor each Tuesdays contest is something of a homecoming And with 247 delegates at stake the stakes are higher than ever Clinton is expected to come out on top but with momentum at his back after winning six out of the last seven contests Sanders believes New York could provide a chance for him to prove that he can stay in the raceI am enormously proud to be the senator from Vermont but I have not forgotten where I was born and that is Brooklyn Sanders told a crowd in Brooklyn last week I think we have the campaign that has the momentum  And with your help we will win New YorkA Sanders victory here would be a huge psychological blow toun the Clinton campaign which has posited that the state is solidly her territory Sanders advisers are basing their strategy on convincing superdelegates that he can overtake Clinton over time and victory here would help him make his case However with Clintons lead in pledged delegates her team knows that Sanders not only needs to win at least 56 percent of the remaining delegates to catch upThursdays debate will be the largest platform yet for Clinton and Sanders to make their case to a state that could be pivotal in the race Look for both of them to make major appeals to Democratic voters here based on their personal backgroundsJust across the river from the site of Thursdays CNN debate looms something that has engulfed the 2016 Democratic race Wall StreetVowing to break up the big banks and railing against the outsized role of Wall Street in the American political system are at the core of Sanders campaign His unlikely bid for president has attracted a massive following in large part because of his populist message and promises to help poor and lowerincome familiesBut the fight between Clinton and Sanders over Wall Street has not only unfolded over policy disagreementsSanders has consistently used the financial industry to paint Clinton as an establishment insider in the pocket of special interests He has slammed the former secretary of state for accepting donations from financial institutions suggesting that she is beholden to bigmoney interestsOne major Wall Street bank has found itself in the middle of this flashpoint Goldman SachsAt issue are three speeches Clinton made to Goldman Sachs for which she was paid 675000 Sanders has repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts from those speeches saying the public has a right to know what she said in those private settingsClinton said she would only do so if all of her rivals running for president are also held to the same standardsRecently Clinton has found a fresh line of attack against Sanders on the issue of Wall StreetAsked whether she thinks her connections to Wall Street will play a more central role in the debate now that the race has come to New York Clinton told reporters this week Bring it onLet it happen I have a record As your senator I spoke out I called for changes I have the best policy toward dealing with what needs to happen to prevent Wall Street from ever wrecking Main Street again she said Sen Sanders couldnt even answer questions about whatever his plan is so well talkIn an extensive interview with the New York Daily News Sanders struggled to answer in detail questions about financial reform  one of the pillars of his campaign Clinton seized on the interview to raise questions about Sanders readiness to be presidentPresident Barack Obama made a candid admission over the weekend his administration wasnt adequately prepared to handle the fall of Libyan dictator Moammar GadhafiThe United States helped oust Gadhafi in 2011 As secretary of state Clinton was a major actor in those efforts and as a presidential candidate has remained a defender of US actions in Libya But her tenure at the State Department has been a significant vulnerability for Clinton Republicans and critics have persistently criticized her handling of the 2012 attacks at a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi which killed US Ambassador Christopher StevensSanders for his part has more broadly targeted Clintons views on regime change This tension could resurface Thursday night if Clinton chooses to defend Obama administrations engagement in LibyaA key fight between Sanders and Clinton spilled out into the open with the recent release of a video showing Clinton angrily responding to a climate activist who accused her of accepting fossil fuel money while the candidate shook hands with supporters after an eventWhen the activist who is affiliated with environmentalist groups Greenpeace and 350 Action asked if Clinton would reject funds from those industries Clinton responded that she did not accept money directly from fossil fuel companiesan action that is illegal anyway since corporations cant directly contribute to political campaignsbut that she did take money from individual donors who work in those industries Im so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me Im sick of it Clinton saidIn truth oil and gas industry employees have donated to both Clinton and Sanders Clinton has received more than 300000 Sanders about 50000But Sanders has not backed down from the attack line and his campaign has pointed to lobbyists and bundlers for the industry who have donated to Clinton and donations to super PACs supporting ClintonSecretary Clinton owes us an apology We were not lying We were telling the truth Sanders said during a rally on April 1 in Sheboygan WisconsinAlthough the candidates and their surrogates have answered questions about the issue since Clintons altercation with the climate activist Thursdays debate could be the first time they address it with one another directly in public If Sanders confronts Clinton on it it could be an opportunity for Clinton to try to put the attack to rest before a large audience
