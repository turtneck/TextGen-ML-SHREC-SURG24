The House passed a nearly 612 billion defense policy bill Friday despite President Obamas veto threat and Democratic worries that the measure opens the door to sharp cuts in domestic spending later this yearThe vote was 269 to 151 for the bill which maps next years military and national security programsA 2011 bipartisan budget deal placed caps on defense and domestic spending The defense bill that passed skirts those limits by putting 89 billion of the total into an emergency warfighting fund which is exempt from the caps Democrats predict that Republicans wont attempt to do endruns around the spending caps when it comes to domestic spendingRep Adam Smith of Washington state the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee urged his colleagues to vote against the billIt doesnt fix the problem Smith said The president has promised to veto all the appropriations bills and the defense bill that are based on this flawed approach to the budget So what we are doing here is ultimately not going to be successful until we come up with a better longterm solution to dealing with the budget capsRep Mac Thornberry RTexas chairman of the House Armed Services Committee has acknowledged in recent days that the approach is not the best way to run a railroadBut he urged the Democrats Friday to vote for the bill anyhow by quoting the last line of an editorial published Friday in The Washington Post Far better for him Obama and his partys leadership in Congress to help an adequate defense budget keep moving through Congress rather than perpetuate a fight all Americans whether Republican or Democrat might later regretOverall the House bill authorizes 515 billion in spending for national defense and another 892 billion for the emergency warfighting fund for a total of 6042 billion Another 77 billion is mandatory defense spending that doesnt get authorized by Congress That means the bill would provide the entire 6119 billion desired by the president but he and Democratic lawmakers still oppose itHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote a letter on Thursday urging her colleagues to vote against the billThe Republican defense authorization bill before the House is both bad budgeting and harmful to military planning  perpetuating uncertainty and instability in the defense budget and damaging the militarys ability to plan and prepare for the future the California Democrat wrote As Defense Secretary Ash Carter said last week Republicans approach is clearly a road to nowhere managerially unsound and unfairly dispiriting to our force The White House pushed back against a host of provisions in the bill including one that would make it harder for Obama to close the military prison for terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay Cuba On Ukraine it calls for arming Ukrainian forces fighting Russianbacked separatists a move the Obama administration has so far resistedThe administration also opposes measures that aim to bypass the Iraqi government in Baghdad and give money directly to Iraqi Kurdish fighters That has angered Shiite cleric Muqtada alSadr who threatened to attack US interests if the provision passesThe Senate version follows the same approach to funding the military The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 224 on Thursday to authorize 523 billion in base funding for the Defense Department and other national security programs and an additional 902 billion for the emergency warfighting fundIn the House lawmakers debated 135 amendments to the measureThe House voted 221202 to strip an immigration provision opposed by conservatives The nonbinding provision would have encouraged a Pentagon study on allowing immigrants brought illegally to the country as children to enlist in the military Conservatives who pushed the vote say the measure would have encouraged amnesty and validated what they consider to be unconstitutional actions Obama has taken to protect millions of immigrants from deportation
