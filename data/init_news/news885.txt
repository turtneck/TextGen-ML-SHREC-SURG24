Two of the Republican Partys top White House hopefuls clashed sharply Friday over President Obamas new Cuba policy evidence of a growing GOP rift over foreign affairs that could shape the partys 2016 presidential primariesSen Rand Paul Ky who backs Obamas move to normalize relations with communist Cuba accused Sen Marco Rubio Fla of being an isolationist with his hardline opposition to opening up trade and diplomatic engagement with the island nation Paul suggested that Rubio wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moatPauls comments came after Rubio  the son of Cuban exiles who has stepped forward as a leading voice of resistance to Obamas policy  told Fox News that Paul had no idea what hes talking about when it comes to CubaThe feud is the loudest public dispute so far between potential GOP 2016 candidates and lays bare the divergent world views of traditional hawks  including Rubio and past Republican presidents and nominees  and the emerging younger libertarian wing represented by PaulFor decades Rubios position has been the GOPs natural default But Paul is testing that conventionAre we still cold warriors or are we entering a brave new world in diplomacy Republican strategist John Feehery said Rubios perspective is we have Cuba we have North Korea we need a bold internationalist Americaled world that fights the bad guys Rand Paul is taking his fathers position to a new level which is constructive engagement but America isnt really the policeman of the worldHawkish Republicans have long called Pauls foreign policy isolationist a label he rejects In this weeks Cuba debate Paul applied the label to RubioPauls comments were unusually personal beginning with a series of tweets aimed at Rubio followed by a twoparagraph message on his Facebook page Senator Rubio is acting like an isolationist and does not speak for the majority of CubanAmericans he wrotePaul followed up with an oped on Times Web site Friday afternoon in which he wrote that he grew up learning to despise communism but over time concluded that a policy of isolationism against Cuba is misplaced and hasnt worked He noted that public opinion has shifted in favor of rapprochement  especially among young people including young Cuban Americans  and that US businesses would benefit by being able to sell their goods in CubaCommunism cant survive the captivating allure of capitalism Paul wrote Lets overwhelm the Castro regime with iPhones iPads American cars and American ingenuitySen Jeff Flake RAriz who traveled to Cuba this week with the US entourage to secure contractor Alan Grosss release shared Pauls sentiments Flake said that he supported Obamas decision to normalize relations and that after a fivedecade embargo it was time to try something differentRubio responded to Pauls comments Friday evening telling conservative radio host Mark Levin I think its unfortunate that Rand has decided to adopt Barack Obamas foreign policy on this matterFor both Paul and Rubio there are shortterm political benefits to the tussle With potential donors and other influential Republicans deciding between roughly a dozen presidential hopefuls the pair are generating media attention and staking out ground on a highprofile policy issueThe spat was also the latest example of Pauls combative tendencies He has been the most aggressive GOP presidential contender in taking on Hillary Rodham Clinton a former secretary of state and likely Democratic candidate and showed Friday that he will not hesitate to throw punches at fellow Republicans as wellAna Navarro a Miamibased Republican strategist close to Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush said it was an example of the silly seasonThere are some issues like eye surgery and Kentucky bourbon Paul knows something about she said of the ophthalmologist turned lawmaker But to try to outdo Rubio on Cuba policy  and to do it by trolling him on Twitter in 140character spurts  is frankly not productive mature or senatorialPaul is trying to chart a new course for Republicans on foreign policy and areas such as race relations working with Democrats on legislation to address drug sentencing guidelinesPaul is going to stretch the limits and try to grow the party in directions Republicans arent used to said Ari Fleischer a former White House press secretary to George W Bush I think the only upside hell have is with young people Outside of that I think its going to be tough going for him  The history of the party is much more interventionist muscular strong Ronald Reagan foreign policyPauls aides said the senator considers Cuba policy an economic and diplomatic issue and not a partisan oneBut GOP primary voters may see it differently Theres a certain willingness among conservatives to reconsider our Cuba policy but the fact that its been negotiated by Obama  whom we have no confidence or trust in  makes it suspect said Richard Viguerie a longtime conservative leader If this had been done by a trustworthy conservative Republican it would have been differentRubio as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has worked to distinguish himself as a leading voice on international affairs Almost immediately after Wednesdays Cuba announcement Rubio spoke out aggressively and in personal terms Raised in Miami by parents who fled Cuba in the 1950s Rubio grew up surrounded by other Cuban American families and now represents them in WashingtonIt is just another concession to a tyranny by the Obama administration rather than a defense of every universal and inalienable right that our country was founded on and stands for Rubio told reporters on Capitol HillMost 2016 GOP hopefuls  including Bush Texas Gov Rick Perry Sen Ted Cruz Tex and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker  issued statements similar to Rubios New Jersey Gov Chris Christie has not spoken specifically on Cuba but generally shares Rubios more hawkish worldviewWilliam Kristol a prominent neoconservative and editor of the Weekly Standard noted that most of the potential candidates as well as the partys congressional leaders are all in the same neighborhood on foreign policyRand Paul is a lonely gadfly he said Rand Paul speaks for a genuine sentiment thats always been in the Republican Party but maybe its 10percent 15percent 20percent I dont think hes going to be a serious competitor for guiding Republican foreign policy
