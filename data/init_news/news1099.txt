CNN Hillary Clinton declared victory early Tuesday morning in a razorthin contest against Bernie Sanders in Iowa But Democratic party officials have not yet declared a winnerHillary Clinton has won the Iowa Caucus the Clinton campaign said After thorough reporting  and analysis  of results there is no uncertainty and Secretary Clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegatesThe state party indicated in a separate statement that it was not ready to make a callThe results tonight are the closest in Iowa Democratic caucus history Iowa party chairman Andy McGuire said We will report that final precinct when we have confirmed those results with the chairOne thing is clear after Monday nights Iowa caucuses theres a long volatile election season ahead before two deeply fractured parties can unite behind a nomineeCruzs victory sets him up as a formidable force in delegaterich Southern states to come and offers movement conservatives hope that one of their own can become the Republican nominee for the first time since Ronald ReaganClaiming victory Cruz fired immediate shots at both Trump and the party elites he has so infuriated by waging an antiestablishment crusade that has nevertheless endeared him to the GOPs rank and fileIowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States will not be chosen by the media will not be chosen by the Washington establishment Cruz saidWith about 99 of the GOP vote in Cruz was ahead of Trump 28 to 24 Rubio was at 23It is breathtaking to see what happens when so many Americans stand up and decide theyre fed up with what happens in Washington and they want something different They want a leader they can trust they want a leader that stands for them against the corruption of Washington Cruz told CNNs Dana Bash in an interview aired Tuesday on New DayTrump hours after predicting a tremendous victory delivered a short but gracious speech that lacked his normal bombast saying he loved Iowa and vowed to bounce back next week in New HampshireWe will go on to get the Republican nomination and we will go on to easily beat Hillary or Bernie Trump told supporters We finished second and I have to say I am just honoredRubio will also leave Iowa with a leg up over other establishment rivals including former Florida Gov Jeb Bush New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and Ohio Gov John Kasich who have a lot at stake in New HampshireThis is the moment they said would never happen For months they told us we had no chance a jubilant Rubio said They told me that I needed to wait my turn that I needed to wait in line But tonight here in Iowa the people of this great state have sent a very clear message  after seven years of Barack Obama we are not waiting any longer to take our country backOn the Democratic side Clinton and Sanders are deadlocked at 50 with 99 of the votes counted Clinton the national frontrunner admitted breathing a big sigh of relief after escaping Iowa  the state she handily lost to Obama in 2008  but promised a vigorous campaign with SandersIts rare that we have the opportunity we do now she said in a speech that didnt explicitly claim victory but sought to position her as the authentic progressive in the raceSanders who trailed Clinton in Iowa by 30 points three months ago told a raucous crowd chanting Bernie Bernie that his campaign made stunning progressNine months ago we came to this beautiful state we had no political organization we had no money we had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of AmericaAnd tonight he said while the results are still not known it looks like we are in a virtual tieThough Sanders fared well in Iowa and is nicely posited in New Hampshire his hurdle is proving that he can appeal to more ethnically diverse electorates in later contests in places such as South CarolinaSanders made the case to CNNs Chris Cuomo when he campaign plane landed in New Hampshire early on Tuesday morning that he expects to challenge Clinton among nonwhite votersWe lost the nonwhite vote but that gap is growing slimmer and slimmer between the secretary and myself I think youll find as we get to South Carolina and other states that when the AfricanAmerican community the Latino community looks at our record looks at our agenda were going to get more and more support Sanders told Cuomo on New DayThe caucuses resulted in two casualties  one on each side Former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley a Democrat and former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee a Republican both dropped their candidacies after faring poorlyEven before the caucuses began Ben Carsons campaign said he wouldnt go directly to New Hampshire or South Carolina  the site of the next primary contests Instead the retired neurosurgeon who was briefly the Iowa frontrunner last fall will go to Florida to rest and see his familyFormer Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum is also skipping New Hampshire but will go straight to South Carolina which holds its Republican presidential primary on February 20
