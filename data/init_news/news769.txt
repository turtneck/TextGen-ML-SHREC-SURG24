President Barack Obama on Tuesday addressed the eruption of protests and riots in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray condemning the violent demonstrations while acknowledging that the underlying problems plaguing the city are not new and will require national soulsearching to solveDuring a press conference with Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe Obama was asked by NBC News Chris Jansing about the growing frustration that not enough is being done in communities like BaltimoreObama said his thoughts are with Grays family as well as the police injured in Mondays protests and he criticized the violent approach taken by some demonstratorsTheres no excuse for the kind of violence we saw yesterday he said It is counterproductive When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot theyre not protesting Theyre not making a statement Theyre stealing When they burn down a building theyre committing arson and theyre destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities that rob jobs and opportunities from people in that areaThey were constructive and they were thoughtful he said of those demonstrations And frankly it didnt get much attention And one burning building will be looped on television  and the thousands of demonstrators who did it the right way have been lost in the discussionHe continued Since Ferguson and the task force that we put together we have seen too many incidences of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals  primarily AfricanAmerican often poor  in ways that raise troubling questions It comes up it seems like once a week now Or once every couple of weeks So I think its pretty understandable why the leaders of civil rights organizations but more importantly moms and dads might start saying this is a crisis What Id say is this has been a slow rolling crisisWe have to own up to the fact that occasionally there are going to be problems here he saidWe cant just leave this to the police I think there are police departments that have to do some soulsearching I think there are some communities that have to do so some soulsearching But I think we as a country have to do some soulsearching This is not new Its been going on for decades he said If we are serious about solving this problem then were going to not only help the police were going to have to think about what we can do the rest of usThats hard That requires more than just the occasional news report or task force he said If we really want to solve the problem we could its just it would require everybody saying this is important this is significant and that we just dont pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns And we dont just pay attention when a man gets shot or has his spine snappedViolent protests broke out in the Maryland city on Monday following the funeral for Gray the 25yearold who died last week after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody At least 15 police officers were injured and 27 individuals were arrested during Mondays protests
