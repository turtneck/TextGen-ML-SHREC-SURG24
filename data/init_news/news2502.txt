Washington The Democratic candidates for president gathered in Des Moines Iowa for their second debate Saturday and CNNs Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the testThe team of reporters researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them True Mostly True True but Misleading False or Its ComplicatedPrevious CNN Reality Check coverage of the Democratic and Republican candidates can be found here  This story will be updated throughout the nightFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton threw her support behind a 12 hourly minimum wage at Saturdays debate Thats lower than the 15 an hour minimum backed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley as well many progressive activists nationwideClinton defended her stance saying If you go to 12 it would be the highest historical average weve ever had Thats the smartest way to move forward she addedVermont Sen Bernie Sanders said When you talk about the longterm consequences of war lets talk about the men and women who came home from war the 500000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injuryVermont Sen Bernie Sanders said The Muslim nations in the region  Saudi Arabia Iran Turkey Jordan  all of these nations theyre going to have to get their hands dirty their boots on the ground They are going to have to take on ISIS  Those Muslim countries are going to have to lead the effort They are not doing it nowLaunched in September 2014 the USled coalition fighting ISIS consists of more than 60 coalition partners including more than a dozen Muslimmajority countries All of the countries Sanders mentioned are part of that coalition  with the exception of Iran which has been countering ISIS in separate initiatives that include training advising and supporting Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISISThe actual contributions of each member of the USled coalition vary widely As of October 2014 Saudi Arabias contribution consisted of warplanes and training for Syrian rebels fighting ISIS They also donated 500 million to UN humanitarian efforts in Iraq Turkey has allowed foreign troops to launch attacks against ISIS from within its borders and in July began launching its own airstrikes against ISIS in Syria Jordan launched airstrikes against ISIS early in the campaign but later suspended its participation when one of its aircraft went down in Syria and one of its pilots was taken hostage Jordanian strikes resumed after ISIS announced it had killed the Jordanian pilotFew of the coalitions members have contributed active ground troops In 2014 Egypt sent forces to Libya to bomb ISIS positions there In late October the United States authorized the deployment of about 50 special operations forces to northern Syria to fight ISIS The Obama administration is also considering a special forces task force to fight ISIS in IraqIn June of 2014 Iraqi officials said that Iran had sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to fight alongside Iraqi troops against ISIS The Iranian Foreign Ministry denied this but Irans president said Iran was prepared to help advise Iraq if askedSanders is correct that at present the primary coalition fighting ISIS is led by the United States But several of the Muslim countries in the coalition have lost soldiers and civilians in the battle against ISISFormer Gov Martin OMalley said The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero He then challenged viewers to factcheck him and we couldnt resistAdditionally the actual number of Mexicans living in the United States consistently declined throughout 2014 The US Border Patrol also reported that in the 2014 fiscal year the number of Mexicans apprehended along the border decreased 14 when compared to the 2013 fiscal yearThe information we have suggests that the net immigration rate is negative  which is actually not zero  but it is close and probably still supports OMalleys pointFormer Maryland Gov Martin OMalley often goes back to his record as governor to explain how he would best shepherd the nations economy in the White House But he went a step further than he typically does during Saturday nights debate and took credit for Marylands high median incomesOMalley was answering a question of how precisely he would freeze college tuition around the nation and whether his blueprint from Maryland would work across the USThe blueprint in Maryland that we followed is we raised the sales tax by a penny and made our public schools the best public schools in America for five years in a row with that investment And yes we did ask everyone  the top 14 of earners in our state  to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a pennys increase to college tuitions OMalley saidThe answer nationwide is paying for priorities by taxing capital gains income like normal income he saidI believe capital gains for the most part should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work sweat and toil OMalley said And if we do those things we can be a country that actually can afford debtfree college againBut in the exchange he also took credit for the states median income level  long the highest in the nationSo while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do I actually got these things they would like to do I actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a AAA bond rating but the highest median income in America OMalley saidTheres no question that Marylanders have done on average much better than those in other states since the recession Its actually had the highest median income every year since 2006 when the median income was 65144 to last year when it was 73971In his answer OMalley did not explain how his economic plan kept highwage jobs in MarylandBut President Barack Obama and former President George W Bush may be better able to make that claim because of the large share of federal employees in Maryland A Governing magazine analysis of federal employment statistics from 2013 determined that Maryland had the largest share of federal workers for the total workforce of any state something that the governor has nothing to do withMaryland had 145300 people working for the government equal to 55 of the states total nonfarm employment Virginia had more federal employees  172500  but they only accounted for 46 of the total state employmentAnd a Washington Post review of federal salaries found that federal workers do quite well compared to many other industries  earning an average salary of 78500 as of 2012
