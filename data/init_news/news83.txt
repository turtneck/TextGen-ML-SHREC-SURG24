Is Trump the lesser of two evils or are both candidates equally unelectable THE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS Well know who is right tomorrow SARDONICUS to Flopot  I know it makes your blood boil to consider the lesser of two evils scenario But LD has always been a conscientious nonvoter and is therefore unlikely to be voting for either Trump or Hillary Nor am I for that matter since I am a UK resident and do not get to vote in the American elections You really must reconcile yourself Flopot to the fact that Hillary is held in such visceral loathing that her millions of haters feel they have no option but to vote for her opponent Donald Trump even though they are aware of the Donalds many faults and his Zionist connections Its either not voting at all or voting for the lesser of two evils FLOPOT  You dont understand the meaning of lesser of two evils It is a con trick it doesnt exist Donald will pursue the same globalist wars and cultural revolutions as any other Zionist puppet It is a meme that exists to get your consent to continue the same evil HARBINGER Hear hear Exactly Flopot As Ive stated umpteen times Trump is good cop Hillary is bad But sadly Sardonicus does not see the grand plan even though the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carroll Quigley do both very much part of that process There is not one politician in the west who becomes what they are without a careful vetting procedure Classic example is Jeremy Corbin  whom many thought was going to be the saviour of Labour and take it to the Zionists when he has proven without any shadow of a doubt that hes a rampant Zionist even though who goes on pro Palestine marches Trump is a puppet Clinton is a puppet May is a puppet Merkel is a puppet There is not ONE politician in the west who isnt part of the grand plan and its why everything works according to plan SARDONICUS to Flopot and Harbinger  Yes I understand exactly what both you and Harbinger are saying and I can sympathize with your viewpoint You are saying there is NO LESSER OF TWO EVILS here since both candidates are EQUALLY EVIL Because both are Zionists and will deliver a program to further Jewish interests Thats what youre saying right The only difference as Harbie indicates is that one of these two candidates is playing the bad cop Hillary and the other is playing the good cop Trump So its nonsense to vote for the good cop as the lesser of two evils when both cops are equally evil when the chips are down This is your argument and I can sympathize with it only if you are correct in your initial assumption that Trump has no redeeming features whatever and is a total charlatan and liar who will break every single promise of his if he gets into the White House You are entitled to that assumption but you are NOT entitled to believe that your assumption is universally shared Kevin MacDonald certainly doesnt believe that Trump is a thorough scoundrel who will sell all White America down the river as soon as he is elected Nor do the thousands of White Nationalists and other White Americans who share MacDonalds perfectly acceptable and intellectually defensible views These millions of Trump supporters do NOT believe that Trump is an unmitigated scoundrel who will break his promise to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out Trump has said he has no intention of starting a war with Russia Hillary has made no such promise Trump has said he will crack down on illegal immigrants especially Muslim immigrants from hostile Muslim states Well MacDonald and his White Nationalists are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt I for one refuse to think that Kevin MacDonald and the millions who are hoping for a resurgence of White ethnic interests are deluded and mistaken in their advocacy of Donald Trump They could be right Trump could be their man and actually deliver the goods ie improve the lives of millions of White Americans who are now suffering under Jewish hegemony and a multiculturalism that has gone mad The pessimism both of you share in regard to the irredeemable character of Donald Trump is simply a subjective state of mind Its an opinion not a fact I may choose to say I cant stand garlic and onions This makes me a garlicandonion pessimist My subjective viewpoint that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables does not make it a scientific fact that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables The garlic and onion eaters of the world are entitled to tell me to get lost if I told everyone to give up eating garlic and onions So it is with Flopot and Harbinger with their Trump pessimism They are making a logical mistake in confusing impressions with facts It is not a FACT that Trump is a scoundrel at the most it is a subjective opinion HP  Trump is not a politician who has been a politician who grew up a politician and lived and breathed politics all his adult life Apart from businesssocial of course Hes an Alpha businessman who just happens to be waaay more intelligent and personally powerful than 99 of the political mediocres who envy and hate him He came from out of nowhere and like a freight train rolled right over them before they could even cry foul or man an offense against him based on their default slime factor MO Hell he vetted them  Even as the entire weight of the political MM Hollywood Academia foreigners etc etc set upon him like no other in memory near or far But they couldnt even put a dent in him or scare him off and you know the vile demons tried very hard He didnt scare But he did and does scare them A lot Being a uberquick study he easily overtook and surpassed the halfbright bureaucrat politicians and within one solitary year he IS The Alpha Politician Putin and his 12 time zones full of natural resources will no doubt enjoy Trump Putin will respect his intelligence embrace his personality utilize his uberbusiness talents and skills and very very importantly hugely importantly share their big big patriotism for their nations their citizens In other words The world gets an early Christmas present this year UNGENIUS Well said HP I would add only one statement Trump is not a murderer but Killery is a murderer of long standing which should make a choice simple between the two GILBERT HUNTLY Sardonicus thanks for your healthy and sane perspective Well said  LOBRO Seconding that And add HPs perceptive comment  above  to the score for level headed reason ARIADNATHEO Sardonicus Harbinger and Flopot You are all wrong as I used to be I admit Jewish hegemony zionism  are nothing but red herrings that distract our
