Posted on October 30 2016 by DavidSwanson Picture if you will video footage of vintage early 2016 Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major medias choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates It may not be good for America but its damn good for CBS Thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the US media A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie Truth Deception and the Spirit of IF Stone  The website AllGovernmentsLiecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about Id have made various changes and additions to the film In particular Im tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003 This film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence Still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the United States It includes and is driven by Noam Chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all Its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media Its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm And its an introduction to IF Stone It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stones tradition One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin nonIncident Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense That is had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a US ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war Id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea the Red Sea and every other part of the earth today But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the US ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the US role of Global Policeman Someone had to make the lies transparent Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of SoCalled Defense and the President were lying Sadly nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did Yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew And they knew it because of IF Stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin Stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964 The United Nations including its US ambassador had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia And President Lyndon Johnson even at the time of Tonkin Stone notes was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other Stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the League of Nations Covenant the KelloggBriand Pact and the UN Charter The latter two are still theoretically in place for the US government The United States in Vietnam Stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats And indeed the US ships Stone reports were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the US military and the good old American tax payers Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees He found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical It made no sense that the US ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships Stone didnt believe it Stone also filled in the background information The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the nonincident And Stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the US ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military something nobody could explain though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is IF Stones work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War Weve learned more since he wrote it but seen little more insightful relevant or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today This entry was posted in General  Bookmark the permalink
