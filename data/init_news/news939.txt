It turns out that one of the Grand Old Partys biggestand least discussedchallenges going into 2016 is lying in plain sight written right into the partys own nickname The Republican Party voter is oldand getting older and as the adage goes there are two certainties in life Death and taxes Right now both are enemies of the GOP and they might want to worry more about the former than the latterTheres been much written about how millennials are becoming a reliable voting bloc for Democrats but theres been much less attention paid to one of the biggest getoutthevote challenges for the Republican Party heading into the next presidential election Hundreds of thousands of their traditional core supporters wont be able to turn out to vote at allThe partys core is dying off by the daySince the average Republican is significantly older than the average Democrat far more Republicans than Democrats have died since the 2012 elections To make matters worse the GOP is attracting fewer firsttime voters Unless the party is able to make inroads with new voters or discover a fountain of youth the GOPs slow demographic slide will continue election to election Actuarial tables make that part clear but just how much of a problem for the GOP is thisSince it appears that no political data geek keeps track of voters who die between elections I took it upon myself to do some basic math And that quick backofthenapkin math shows that the trend could have a real effect in certain states and make a battleground states like Florida and Ohio even harder for the Republican Party to captureBy combining presidential election exit polls with mortality rates per age group from the US Census Bureau I calculated that of the 61 million who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 about 275 million will be dead by the 2016 election President Barack Obamas voters of course will have died tooabout 23 million of the 66 million who voted for the president wont make it to 2016 either That leaves a big gap in between a difference of roughly 453000 in favor of the DemocratsHere is the methodology using one age group as an example According to exit polls 5488091 voters aged 60 to 64 years old supported Romney in 2012 The mortality rate for that age group is 10473 deaths per 100000 which means that 57475 of those voters died by the end of 2013 Multiply that number by four and you get 229900 Romney voters aged 60to64 who will be deceased by Election Day 2016 Doing the same calculation across the range of demographic slices pulled from exit polls and census numbers allows one to calculate the total voter deaths Its a rough calculation to be sure and there are perhaps ways to move the numbers a few thousand this way or that but by and large this methodology at least establishes the rough scale of the problem for the Republicansa problem measured in the midhundreds of thousands of lost voters by November 2016 To the best of my knowledge no one has calculated or published better voter death data beforeIve never seen anyone doing any studies on how many dead people cant vote laughs William Frey senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in demographic studies Ive seen studies on how many dead people do vote The old Daley Administration in Chicago was very good at thatFrey points out that since Republicans are getting whiter and older replacing the voters that leave this earth with young ones is essential for them to be competitive in presidential elections But the key question is whether these election death rates will make any real difference There are so many other variables that dead voters arent necessarily going to be a decisive factorThe GOP does rely too much on older and white voters and especially in rural areas deaths from this group can be significant Frey says But millennials born 1981 to 1997 now are larger in numbers than baby boomers born 1946 to 1964 and how they vote will make the big difference And the data says that if Republicans focus on economic issues and stay away from social ones like gay marriage they can make serious inroads with millennialsBut what if Republicans arent able to win over a larger share of the youth vote In 2012 there were about 13 million in the 15to17 yearold demo who will be eligible to vote in 2016 The previous few presidential election cycles indicate that about 45 percent of these youngsters will actually vote meaning that there will about 6 million new voters total Exit polling indicates that age bracket has split about 6535 in favor of the Dems in the past two elections If that split holds true in 2016 Democrats will have picked up a two million vote advantage among firsttime voters These numbers combined with the voter death data puts Republicans at an almost 25 million voter disadvantage going into 2016
