Sen Ted Cruz of Texas scored a hardfought upset win over businessman Donald Trump in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night while former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont were locked in a virtual tie on the Democratic side with most of the votes countedCruz made good on his bet that a methodical campaign organization would eclipse Trumps media dominance in the first test of Republican voters With 99 percent of the precincts reporting Cruz was beating his rival by more than 5100 votes with Sen Marco Rubio of Florida a close thirdCruz appeared to capitalize on deep support from religious and social conservatives and showed that oldfashioned retail politicking could overcome Trumps massive political rallies in the Hawkeye StateGod bless the great state of Iowa Cruz told supporters at his campaigns Iowa headquarters after embracing his wife Heidi Tonight is a victory for the grass roots Tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across Iowa and all across this great nation Iowa has sent notice that the Republican nominee and the next president of the United States will not be chosen by the media will not be chosen by the Washington establishment will not be chosen by the lobbyistsClinton had been a clear frontrunner in Iowa last summer as she hoped to make up for her loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic caucuses But Sanders hammering a message about economic inequities in the middle class narrowed the margin in Iowa into a dead heat in the final days and the results could presage a long grueling fight to the nomination He maintains a polling advantage in New Hampshire which will hold its primaries next weekWith 95 percent of the precincts reporting Clinton had 498 percent of the vote to Sanderss 496 percent Clinton joined by her husband former president Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea addressed supporters before the final tally was in saying she was breathing a sigh of reliefIt is rare that we

Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and AmericaSanders accompanied by wife Jane appeared in front of a jubilant crowd that chanted Feel the Bern He said that his showing against Clinton sent a message to the political and media establishments that given the enormous crises facing our country it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economicsThe night also began to winnow the field on both sides Former Maryland governor Martin OMalley the only other major Democratic candidate had negligible support and suspended his campaign Monday night according to a person close to the campaign Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee a Republican also suspended his campaignThe crowded Republican field and lively debates appeared to boost interest in the race A record 185000 people took part in the GOP caucuses increasing the 2012 turnout by 54 percent according to estimates from Edison Media ResearchTrump had led the Republican polls since last summer shortly after he declared his candidacy and he seemed to rewrite the traditional rules and expectations of national political campaigns Yet his outsider appeal which swelled crowds at rallies failed to translate entirely to the caucus turnout and some political analysts questioned his decision to drop out of the final GOP debate last weekAppearing before supporters at his Iowa headquarters Trump

The Apprentice television show against himWhether Cruz can translate the win into similar success in New Hampshire is uncertain as the past two Iowa winners Pennsylvanias Rick Santorum in 2012 and Huckabee in 2008 failed to win the nominationRubio did far better than expected with a late rally as he sought to consolidate support among establishment Republicans who have doubted Trump and Cruz Former Florida governor Jeb Bush who started the campaign as a prohibitive frontrunner with a massive campaign war chest finished way back in the pack Bush wasnt even in the state on Monday

run it the way its supposed to be run  as a great great countryHeres how the voting in Iowa worksThere was little question that the lack of an incumbent coupled with the unconventional style of several candidates has sparked Iowans interest in the race this year Jeff Kaufmann who chairs the Iowa Republican Party said his office has received five to six times as many calls compared with past yearsThe phone calls at the Republican Party of Iowa headquarters are absolutely unprecedented I mean were looking at 100 an hour literally he said Now obviously not all of that is tied to Donald Trump Theres also a lot of these calls that are going to a variety of candidates But I think thats a sign of the enthusiasm6 Iowans explain how theyre deciding whom to vote forIowa Gov Terry Branstad
