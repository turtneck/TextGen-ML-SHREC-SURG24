In a decision with profound implications the Supreme Court asserted that under the US Constitution legal marriage may not be denied to samesex couples extending this right to all 50 statesAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealFrom left Annie Katz of the University of Michigan Zaria Cummings of Michigan State University Spencer Perry of Berkeley Calif and Justin Maffett of Dartmouth University celebrate outside of the Supreme Court in Washington Friday after the court declared that samesex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the USIn a landmark decision the US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that gay men and lesbians enjoy a fundamental right to marry and that none of the 50 states has the power to defy that constitutional guarantee of freedom and equal protectionIn a 5to4 decision the high court issued the constitutional equivalent of a grandslam homerun for samesex couples across the United StatesThe right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the samesex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinionThe court now holds that samesex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry he declared No longer may this liberty be denied to themThe high court also ruled that in addition to issuing licenses to samesex couples all 50 states must recognize the legitimacy of samesex marriages performed in any other stateCurrently 37 states recognize samesex marriages while 13 states had maintained the traditional definition of marriage as a union between one man and one womanThe high court decision represents a major advance for civil and equal rights for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT community It marks the continued emergence of that community from its closeted secondclass existence for much of human history And it establishes a firm legal foundation upon which gay rights advocates will push for broader freedoms equality and protectionsAt the same time Justice Kennedys majority opinion marks a significant setback for conservatives seeking to maintain the federalist structure of government Rather than allowing the contentious social issue of marriage to be decided by the people and their elected representatives on a statebystate basis the high court decided instead to constitutionalize the issue of samesex marriage and answer the question itselfThe dissenting justices predict that that courts actions in cutting off democratic debate over the issue will inflame opposition rather than lead to national healing and greater tolerance In addition the decision sets the stage for more contentious battles ahead between gay rights activists and religious and social conservatives they warnWhen decisions are reached through democratic means some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say and accordingly are  in the tradition of our political culture  reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a dissenting opinionThat democratic dynamic was cut short by the majority decision the chief justice saidBy deciding this question under the Constitution the court removes it from the realm of democratic decision Roberts said There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound significance Closing debate tends to close mindsKennedy dismissed such concerns Of course the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change he said so long as that process does not abridge fundamental rightsWhen fundamental rights are at stake he said the court has a duty to address the issueKennedy said that marriage was a keystone of the social order in America and that it was intolerable to exclude gay men and lesbians from full participation in that orderIt demeans gays and lesbians for the state to lock them out of a central institution of the nations society he saidThe limitation of marriage to oppositesex couples may long have seemed natural and just but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is not manifest Kennedy said With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding samesex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charterIn his dissent Chief Justice Roberts called the majority decision an act of will not legal judgmentThe right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this courts precedent he saidIf you are among the many Americans  of whatever sexual orientation  who favor expanding samesex marriage by all means celebrate todays decision the chief justice saidCelebrate the achievement of a desired goal Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner Celebrate the availability of new benefits Roberts saidBut do not celebrate the Constitution he said It had nothing to with itThe chief justice said the Constitution leaves to the people and their elected representatives the authority to define marriageThe fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a state change its definition of marriage And a states decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational Roberts saidIn short our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage The people of a state are free to expand marriage to include samesex couples or to retain the historic definition he saidFridays decision stems from lawsuits filed by samesex couples in four states  Ohio Michigan Kentucky and Tennessee  challenging their exclusion from traditional marriage lawsSome couples sued to be allowed to marry Others sued to have samesex marriages performed in other states recognized in their new state of residenceLawyers for the states had argued that marriage is aimed at headingoff the societal problem of unwed mothers and fatherless children They argued that it has existed through much of human history to encourage a man and woman to remain together as a family to raise their biological offspringLawyers for samesex couples dismissed that explanation arguing that allowing samesex couples to marry would in no way undercut the ability of oppositesex couples to marry and raise their own childrenKennedys majority decision comes less than two months after he commented during oral argument about the difficulty of a judge ordering the nation to change a definition of marriage that had existed throughout most of human historyThis definition has been with us for millennia Kennedy said during oral argument in late April And its very difficult for the court to say oh well we know betterBut that is essentially what Justice Kennedy did on FridayIn a dissent Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority opinion represents a threat to American democracy by a majority of nine lawyers on the Supreme Court who claim the power to create liberties to be protected under the ConstitutionScalia said when the high court wields power to revise the Constitution it robs the American people of the freedom to govern themselvesUntil the courts put a stop to it public debate over samesex marriage displayed American democracy at its best Scalia said He said the courts decision to end the debate and resolve the issue itself was a naked judicial claim to legislative  indeed superlegislative  powerA system of government that makes the people subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy Scalia saidIn his majority opinion Kennedy said that if rights were defined only by those who exercised them new groups would never be able to invoke those rights once they were denied He said the right to samesex marriage was part of the liberty promised in the Fourteenth AmendmentThe right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition but rights come not from ancient sources alone They rise too from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era Kennedy saidMany who deem samesex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophic premises and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged hereBut when that sincere personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the state itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied Kennedy saidUnder the Constitution samesex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as oppositesex couples and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right he saidJoining Kennedy in the majority were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena KaganDissenting opinions were filed by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito
