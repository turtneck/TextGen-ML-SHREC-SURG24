New York CNN Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled over her judgment and his grasp of policy in a tense and at times personal debate here Thursday less than a week before the pivotal New York primaryHeld in prime time and on a weeknight  unlike most Democratic debates  the CNNsponsored event was the highestprofile opportunity for both campaigns to make their final arguments before Tuesdays crucial vote in a state where both contenders have strong roots Clinton is looking to New York to solidify her role as frontrunner while a strong showing  or a victory  for Sanders would deal a significant blow to her confidence and bolster his campaigns argument that the partys socalled super delegates should switch their allegiance to himHere are six takeaways from the most combative Democratic debate yetThe Democratic candidates took sharp aim at one another almost immediately over a series of issues including the Iraq War Wall Street and questions about judgment and qualifications to be presidentBoth contenders shifted back and forth between offense and defense a sharp departure from the calmer tone of the partys earlier debatesSanders began by explaining a recent comment he made on the campaign trail in which he suggested Clinton was unqualified to be presidentDoes Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president Of course she does But I do question her judgment Sanders said pointing to her Senate vote for war in Iraq her willingness for her campaign to benefit from millions of dollars spent on her behalf by super PACs and her relationship to Wall StreetSenator Sanders did call me unqualified Ive been called a lot of things in my life That was a first Clinton responded pointing to the fact that she was elected twice to the Senate and chosen as secretary of stateClinton then counterattacked citing an interview Sanders gave to the New York Daily News in which he struggled to provide specifics about his plans for breaking up banks and other issuesTalk about judgment and talk about the kinds of difficulty he had answering questions including his core issues Clinton saidThe sparring continued throughout the night so much so that at one point CNN debate moderator Wolf Blitzer moved to break up the fightersIf youre both screaming at each other the viewers wont be able to hear either of you Blitzer said after Clinton and Sanders spent several seconds talking over each other2 Clinton further than ever from a general election pivotJust a month ago Clinton appeared poised and eager to pivot to the general election and start building a case against a Republican nomineeBut Thursdays attacks on Sanders showed that her campaign realizes that she has to turn all of her attention to her left flankAt previous debates she seemed to spend as much time talking about Republicans as Sanders Not in BrooklynClinton arrived at Thursdays debate with policy knives sharpened and ready An hour before the contest her campaign released a memo outlining the case she would make against Sanders and repeatedly released briefings throughout the night that both tried to defend her from attacks At every turn possible she criticized him on gun regulation the release date of his tax returns how he would break up big banks provide Medicare for all and other issuesHer campaign knows that next weeks primary could be a major opportunity for her to stop Sanders fastgrowing momentum  or else With time running out before Democrats go the polls Clintons aggressive tactics suggest that she knows she needs to start making some of the blows against Sanders count3 Think big or get things doneA key difference in Clintons and Sanders approaches to governing was on full display during the debate over climate changeClinton is a politician who is content with incremental change seeing it as the most realistic  if not the only  way to achieve her goals The Vermont senator wants sweeping change and believes the nations problems are too big for singles and doubles He wants to swing for the fencesTheir debate over climate change in particular highlighted their contrasting philosophiesIncremental steps are not enough Sanders said after Clinton knocked him for faulting the recent international Paris agreement on climate changeClinton fired back I dont take a back seat to your legislation that you have introduced that you have been unable to get passedOnce again Clinton came under fire for keeping the content of her highly paid speeches to financial firms under wraps after she left the State DepartmentSanders has hammered her for refusing to release transcripts of remarks she made to companies like Goldman Sachs gigs that have earned her millionsWhy not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed CNN comoderator Dana Bash asked ClintonClinton tried to use the question to criticize Sanders over financial reform but Bash continued to press the issue Clinton said she only would release transcripts if Republicans did the sameThere are certain expectations when you run for president This is a new one And Ive said if everybody agrees to do it  because there are speeches for money on the other side I know that Clinton said and again pivoted to Sanders by criticizing him for not yet releasing his tax returnsSanders responded that he planned to release a year of tax returns Friday and would unveil more soon which turned the attention back on Clintons unwillingness to release the transcriptsThe exchange highlighted Clintons struggle with transparencywhether its over her State Department emails or what she tells Wall Street behind closed doors5 One place where Sanders and Clinton agreed RegretsClinton and Sanders both acknowledged that the aggressive measures they championed in the 1990s to fight crime have proven to have disproportionately negative affects on African American communities a fact for which she apologized ThursdayWhen asked if the move was a net positive in the fight against crime Clinton defended the good intentions of the measure saying it had some positive aspects to it but conceded that as new information has come to light about the adverse affects of policy so should approaches to problemsIf we were to have the balance sheet on one side there are some positive actions and changes On the other side there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct she said adding later Im sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on peoples lives Ive seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities Thats why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to makeIn a rare moment of agreement during an otherwise contentious night Sanders also expressed regret for some of the outcomes of the billMuch of what Secretary Clinton said was right We had a crime bill I voted for it It had the Violence Against Women Act in it he said But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth And in my view what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up And that means for a start  and we dont talk about this The media doesnt talk about it  you got 51 percent of AfricanAmerican kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed You know what I think Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids not jails and incarceration6 But no apology from Sanders on gunsThe apologies largely stopped there however as Clinton took on Sanders over gun policyWhen Blitzer said that a parent of a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings had called on Sanders to apologize for opposing a measure that would allow victims of gun violence to sue firearms companies he declinedI voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody and that person then goes out and kills somebody I dont believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued Sanders said But what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them  somebody walks in They want thousands of rounds of ammunition or they want a whole lot of guns yes that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liableSo Senator do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology Blitzer askedNo I dont think I owe them an apology They are in court today and actually they won a preliminary decision today They have the right to sue and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue
