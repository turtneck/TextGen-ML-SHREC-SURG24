Pressure Is On Trump Sanders In Crucial Contests TuesdayDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton currently lead the delegate counts for the presidential nomination But because of the difference in how both parties award their delegates Clintons is the more commanding leadTuesdays Democratic contest in Michigan the biggest prize of the day is key for Bernie Sanders to show he can turn things around His campaign has argued that Clinton has ballooned her lead because of black voters in the SouthNow many of those Southern contests are over though there is another Tuesday in MississippiBut the question remains Can the Vermont independent senator appeal to Northern black voters They make up roughly a quarter of Michigans Democratic electorate He believes his economic message can resonate with them and workingclass whites hurt by trade Polls though have shown the former secretary of state with doubledigit leads going into TuesdaySanders is facing a difficult problem This past weekend he won three of four contests but because his wins were in smaller caucuses and Clinton won by a huge margin in the primary in Louisiana Sanders only wound up winning three more pledged delegates than Clinton Pledged delegates are derived from the margins candidates win in voting in various state primaries and caucusesMaintaining that kind of pace will not help Sanders catch Clinton who is 195 delegates ahead Sanders needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win a majority of pledged delegates And with each passing contest that hill becomes even steeper With superdelegates those unpledged party leaders and elected officials factored in Sanders needs a whopping 60 percent of all remaining delegates Thats a very difficult aircraft carrier to turn around given the Democrats proportional system of allocating delegatesYes superdelegates can change their votes and its true they have never not gone with who won the pledged majority but even in 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Clinton and won more superdelegates not all that many superdelegates peeled off from Clinton Whats more Clinton has a far bigger lead with them now than she ever did in 2008 Clinton already has nearly twothirds of all superdelegates publicly in her corner And by the way they were created in the 1980s for precisely this purpose  to give party leaders a lever to prevent the nomination of what they view as an unelectable candidate after Democrats were soundly defeated in 1984All that said the pledgeddelegate margin remains the most important number to watch Clinton would prefer to win the nomination outright based on voting  and not because party leaders put her over the top Theres lots of talk of the GOP civil war but if there was an outcome in which one candidate won the delegates from actual voters and the other won the nomination because of party insiders you can bet there would be an equally ugly Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summerBut unless Sanders starts winning soon and big thats all theoretical and moot The Democratic race at this point doesnt look close to heading toward anything like thatFor Republicans though Trump is ahead his lead is less dominant because its a fourperson race  and the candidates keep splitting the voteOn Tuesday Michigan has the most delegates in play with 59 far less than on the Democratic side in part because Republicans have far fewer delegates overall but also because of the states history of voting DemocraticTrump has been leading the polls there by double digits and he needs another big win The other contests of the day though  in Mississippi Idaho and Hawaii  hold far more delegates combined 91 than Michigan There hasnt been any good polling in Mississippi but Trump hopes to pull off a win there like he did in neighboring Louisiana over the weekend If Louisiana is an indicator though Cruz could give Trump a run for his moneyIf Cruz pulled that off it would be yet another example that he could use to say hes the principal alternative to Trump  and not Marco Rubio This past weekend Cruz who trails Trump by 84 delegates made a strong case for that He won the biggest share of the delegates out of a handful of contests with wins in Kansas and Maine  and he nearly picked off Trump in Louisiana and KentuckyRubio finished third everywhere on Saturday except in Maine where he finished fourth He made up for it some in Puerto Rico on Sunday winning there by such a big margin that he took all of the territorys 23 delegatesThe GOP political establishment couldnt think of a worse possible choice than having to pick between Trump and Cruz who might be the least liked person in Congress among his colleaguesAnd then theres John Kasich The Ohio governor is hoping to surprise the field in Michigan He should do well there Hes a Midwesterner But hes polling double digits behind Trump and some polls have had Cruz either in second or a close third If Kasich is far behind in Michigan or even finishes third behind Cruz its hard for him to make a case that he has a real chance at the nominationHell likely stay in for the winnertakeall March 15 contest in his home state of Ohio but whats his sell for staying in after that  aside from maybe trying to keep Trump below a majority heading into the convention by picking off votes and delegates where he can in more moderate placesBecause of the crowded field unlike the twoperson race on the Democratic side Trump currently still needs 53 percent of all remaining delegates to win the nomination But he has only won the majority of delegates in five of 20 states so farThats not to say anyone else on the GOP side has a better chance of winning a majority  Cruz needs 59 percent of all remaining delegates Rubio 68 percent and Kasich 75 percentThe candidates hope to start racking up more lopsided wins as the contest rules change on March 15 Thats when states can pick however they want to award delegates Some states like Florida Ohio Arizona and New Jersey are winner take all others are more hybrid All of that is to say there could be some funky results spikes and dips ahead that could sway the race in a potentially unknown directionBut clearly at this point Trump is in the drivers seat He has solid support with his hardened base that will get him a lot of delegates before June when the contests are eventually over The question that still remains for him is Will he grow his supportThrough 20 contests he has averaged 35 percent of the vote Hes cracked 40 percent in five states so far and 50 percent in just one New Hampshire Thats why hes been publicly calling for candidates like Rubio to get out of the raceThe theory of the establishment coalescing behind a single candidate to beat Trump might not hold true but what might be true is Trump needs the field to shrink to get a majority before the conventionHow many states vote Four Hawaii Idaho Michigan and Mississippi All four vote on the GOP side but just Michigan and Mississippi vote on the Democratic sideWhen do polls close 8 pm ET Mississippi 9 pm ET Michigan  most polls close at 8 pm ET but some counties are in Central 11 pm ET Idaho 1 am ET HawaiiHow many delegates are at stake 316 combined 338 if 22 Democratic superdelegates are includedRemind me what happened on Super Tuesday Trump won big picking up victories in Alabama Arkansas Georgia Massachusetts Tennessee Vermont and Virginia Cruz won his home state of Texas and also Oklahoma and Alaska Marco Rubio eked out his first victory  in the Minnesota caucuses That was enough to guarantee that both senators would be in the race until at least March 15 when more states become winnertakeall including Rubios mustwin home state of FloridaFor the Democrats Clinton won Alabama Arkansas Georgia Massachusetts Tennessee Texas and Virginia Sanders won Colorado Minnesota Oklahoma and his home state of VermontDid anything happen after Super Tuesday Yes On the Democratic side Sanders won the caucuses in Maine Kansas and Nebraska Clinton won by a huge margin in the Louisiana primaryOn the GOP side Cruz won the most delegates out of this past weekend with wins in Kansas and Maine on Saturday Trump pulled off narrow victories in Louisiana and Kentucky Rubio won the Republican primary in Puerto Rico on Sunday by more than 50 percent of the vote giving him all 23 delegates which by the way is as many delegates as in New HampshireWhat is the current delegate count On the GOP side Trump has 384 delegates In second place is Cruz with 300 Rubio has 151 and Kasich 37 Remember the Republicans need 1237 delegates to get the nominationOn the Democratic side Clinton leads with pledged delegates 672 to 477 for Sanders With superdelegates factored in 458 for Clinton her total balloons to 1130 to Sanders 499 with just 22 superdelegates
