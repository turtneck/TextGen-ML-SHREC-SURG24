Hillary Clinton won at least four of five primaries on Tuesday pushing her closer to the Democratic presidential nomination as her considerably weakened rival Bernie Sanders vowed to press on with his insurgent campaignClinton won big in Florida North Carolina and Ohio while claiming a narrower victory in Illinois Missouri remained too close to call Sanderss campaign had hoped his raw message of economic justice would prevail in the industrial heartlandBut with her victories Clinton was on track to collect a large share of the more than 1000 delegates she still needed to lock up the contest Sanders ended the day further behind in the delegate count  and needing to win a slew of upcoming states by improbably large marginsWe are moving closer to securing the Democratic Party nomination and winning this election in November Clinton said at her victory party here Tuesday As if to prove the point she quickly pivoted to the Republican frontrunner Donald TrumpOur next president has to be ready to face three big tasks First can you make positive differences in peoples lives Second can you keep us safe Third can you bring our country together againClintons indictment of Trumps policy positions sounded like a preview of arguments to comeWhen we hear a candidate for president call for the rounding up of 12 million immigrants banning all Muslims from entering the United States when he embraces torture that doesnt make him strong it makes him wrong Clinton saidClinton has been eager to refocus her campaign to confront Trump more directly But asked Tuesday if she was concerned that a protracted primary fight with Sanders would hobble Democrats ahead of the contest against a Republican nominee she declined to encourage Sanders to leave the raceHer campaign emailed a fundraising pitch Tuesday evening warning of the dangers of a Trump presidency and of complacency among DemocratsTonight Donald Trump could become the presumptive Republican nominee for president the donation request began Too many Republicans tried to ignore him until it was too late it saidItd be easy for us Democrats to do the same thing now  Trump is so offensive so vulgar so selfevidently awful You could look at him and think theres no way hell ever get elected and then just wish him away But we cantSanders held a rally before about 7000 people in Phoenix on Tuesday night a week ahead of Arizonas primaryHe said his campaign had defied all expectations but made no mention of the three states that had already been called in Clintons favorWhat excites me so much as I go around the country is to see the incredible energy of people who love this country but know we can do so much better Sanders said to loud screamsIn a statement several hours later Sanders vowed to fight on saying With more than half the delegates yet to be chosen and a calendar that favors us in the weeks and months to come we remain confident that our campaign is on a path to win the nominationSome of his diehard supporters expressed hope that he could still pull out the nominationI still think the revolution is coming said James Homan 55 a sound engineer for rock musicians who has homes in Illinois and ArizonaHoman expressed frustration that as he saw it the fix was in for Clinton among Democratic Party leaders but he said he could see paths for Sanders to prevail including the possibility of more fallout from the FBI investigation into Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of stateDemocratic primary voters were split on the candidates key attributes with Clinton seen as more electable and Sanders as more honest according to preliminary exit polls reported by ABC NewsBy roughly 2 to 1 voters across Ohio North Carolina Florida Illinois and Missouri said Clinton had a better chance than Sanders of beating Trump in a generalelection matchup But roughly 8 in 10 said Sanders was honest and trustworthy compared with about 6 in 10 who felt that way about Clinton Sanders has dominated among honestyfocused voters all year while Clinton has won by a wide margin those who care more about electabilitySanders an independent senator from Vermont had scored an upset victory last week against Clinton in Michigan and saw Tuesdays contests as a chance to pull off more comefrombehind wins in states where voters feel damaged by globalizationRepeating his playbook from Michigan Sanders hit Clinton hard on her past support for disastrous trade deals starting with the North American Free Trade Agreement when her husband was in the White HouseAfter Clintons loss in Michigan called her economic message into question her campaign moved to retool her stance on trade by strengthening her opposition to the TransPacific Partnership and emphasizing support for manufacturing in her jobs plan In Ohio Clinton took specific aim at elements of the pending trade package seen as harmful to the auto and steel industriesJust over half of Ohio Democratic primary voters said free trade takes away US jobs according to the early exit polls In Michigan Sanders won among voters with that view by double digits The antitrade cohort was slightly larger in Michigan 57percent than in most states voting Tuesday with less than half of Democrats in Illinois Missouri and North Carolina saying trade costs US jobsI lost my house when the stock market crashed said Williams a member of the local cement finishers union Im an angry voter how bout that Im angry about the way the country is working for the bluecollar worker Hillary gets a big fat zero on thatIn Missouri Sanders aides were optimistic in part because much of the state closely resembles Kansas where the senator easily defeated Clinton in the Democratic caucuses early this month Its worth noting however that Missouri was the smallest of the Democratic delegate prizes TuesdayBefore the polls closed in Missouri Clintons campaign announced that she had been endorsed by the mother of Michael Brown the teenager whose 2014 shooting by police in Ferguson Mo brought more attention to officerinvolved slayings of unarmed black menMultiple polls in the days leading up to Tuesdays contests showed Sanders closing in on Clinton in the three states in the industrial MidwestIn Chicago where Clinton spent her childhood Sanders sought to leverage support from voters disenchanted with the tenure of the citys embattled Democratic mayor Rahm Emanuel a Clinton ally Emanuels approval ratings have dropped to alltime lows amid controversies over a police shooting and school closings and his popularity with African American voters has taken an especially big hitIn the closing days of the race Sanders blasted Emanuels decision to close schools in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods and Sanders ran television ads featuring some of the mayors criticsAnd Tuesday Sanders had breakfast with Cook County Commissioner Jess Chuy Garca who ran unsuccessfully for mayor against Emanuel in the Democratic primary last yearClintons lead in Florida was never in doubt and she ended up capturing almost the same number of votes as the Republican winner Trump  perhaps a preview of how competitive the state will be in NovemberFlorida posed several challenges for Sanders It held a closed primary meaning independent voters who have propelled him to victory in other states were not allowed to participate The states voting population also includes a large number of older voters who have sided with Clinton in previous contestsSanderss aides have argued that the back half of the nominating calendar is more favorable to him with several potential victories in the West and no contests remaining in the Deep South which has been Clintons strongest region by farSanders thinks he is wellpositioned in all three states with contests next Tuesday Arizona Idaho and Utah His decision to spend election night in Arizona signaled his intention to vigorously contest that state in the coming week
