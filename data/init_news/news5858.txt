It is endlessly suspicious when politicians control the process by which they and their allies are elected Yet Arizona lawmakers had been battling their own citizens for precisely this power in a lawsuit that culminated Monday in a 54 Supreme Court decision upholding the right of voters  not legislators  to control how electoral districts are drawnIn 2000 Arizonans voted to take the state legislature out of the redistricting process They hoped to curb partisan gerrymandering by creating an independent bipartisan commission that would handle the duty of redrawing state and federal voting districts after every CensusThe commissions redistricting plan led to Democratic wins in 2012 which upset the GOPcontrolled legislature Republicans claimed that the whole process was unconstitutional because the founding fathers specifically commanded state legislatures to run electionsThey were referring to the Constitutions Elections Clause which reads as followsYes this is another Supreme Court case that hinges on the meaning of a word Here the word is legislature Does the Constitution refer solely to a states body of elected representatives Or does the term legislature here lend itself to a broader interpretation one that would allow citizens to have a direct say in how elections are conductedWriting for the majority Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg argued that the power of regulating elections should ultimately lie with the people  such is the spirit of democracy after allIt would be perverse to interpret the term Legislature in the Elections Clause so as to exclude lawmaking by the people particularly where such lawmaking is intended to check legislators ability to choose the district lines they run in she wroteIn his dissent Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr accused his fellow justices of fudging the law to bless a policy that they liked The majority today shows greater concern about redistricting practices than about the meaning of the Constitution he wroteLets stop there for a second Regardless of how the decision was achieved it protects an important attempt by citizens to ensure fair elections at a time when politics isbecome increasingly bitter and undemocraticOne unfortunate fact of American politics is that election districts are becoming more and more misshapen Recently Stephen Ansolabehere a professor at Harvard and Maxwell Palmer an assistant professor at Boston University crunched the numbers on the past 200 years of congressional district shapesThe researchers used several different ways to measure how convoluted a districts borders are All of the methods tend to agree that district complexity has substantially increased since the 1970s The changes occurred across the board Both simple and raggedy districts are starting to look weirder and weirderOf course just because a district looks ugly doesnt mean its unfairly drawn Its important to create districts that represent natural communities and communities often have irregular boundaries Its equally important to preserve minority representation and sometimes districts look like spaghetti in order to prevent the minority vote in a state from being dilutedPartisan gerrymandering cant be detected solely by examining geography and geometry Theres culture and history to consider Thats also why courts and lawmakers have struggled to define what is an unacceptable level of gerrymandering The process is subjectiveFor instance Ansolabehere and Palmer also found that the weirdestlooking districts tend to vote Democratic That doesnt prove that Democrats are the more shameless gerrymanderers thoughBesides Democratic voters tend to concentrate in urban areas which can make it hard to draw compact voting districts that are also fairA 2013 paper published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science argued that the clustering of Democratic voters creates a natural Republican bias when districts are drawn up Political scientists Jowei Chen of the University of Michigan and Jonathan Rodden of Stanford call the phenomenon unintentional gerrymanderingTo demonstrate Chen and Rodden used a computer to randomly draw district plans using data from the 2000 presidential election in Florida Famously the popular vote in Florida split more or less evenly between George W Bush and Al Gore So in a fair representative plan you might expect half the districts to go for Bush and half for GoreBut across hundreds of versions of these randomly generated district maps  paragons of disinterested district making  a bias emerged On average threefifths of districts went for Bush even though half of the population was voting for GoreThe explanation according to Chen and Rodden is that Democratic voters are at a disadvantage by dint of their living patternsDemocratic voters concentrate either in big cities or in Democratic enclaves black suburbs college towns scattered across the state The downtown districts are overwhelmingly Democratic while the small Democratic outposts tend to get engulfed by their Republican neighborsMore equal representation might result if planners could better distribute Democratic voters  perhaps say by appending some solidly Democratic urban neighborhoods to purplish suburban districtsBut at some point that starts to look like gerrymandering doesnt itThe complex crosscutting considerations involved in redistricting provide cover for partisan shenanigans When legislators start to get creative with district borders are they adjusting for a states uneven political geography Or are they angling for an advantagePutting the process in the hands of an independent body is one way to make matters a little more fair Political scientists have generally observed that courts and independent commissions tend to design more competitive districtsIn a study of congressional elections from 19722012 researchers at the University of Georgia and the University of Texas at Austin found that districts drawn by legislators are significantly less likely to result in close elections even after controlling for polarization candidate quality and regional differences But this effect is only prominent from 1992 onwardThe researchers suspect that computers deserve much of the blame By 1991 all but four states were using geographic information programs to guide their redistricting efforts Nowadays any legislator with a laptop can call on software to concoct districts with whatever characteristics they like Gerrymandering has never been this easy or datadrivenPerhaps then it is no coincidence that some of the most torturedlooking districts were designed in recent years as these maps from Ansolabehere and Palmer showIndependent redistricting commissions are supposed to curb gerrymandering but most lack full control of the redistricting process Some are restricted to making suggestions which legislatures can vote down or amend Others step in only after the legislature has stalemated Like the filibuster the power of redistricting is a political tool that both parties are loath to give up Legislatures in 42 states still have the final say when it comes to determining districts for House seats in Congress And in 37 states legislators control the redistricting process for their own state legislative districtsIn Arizona and California citizens used ballot initiatives to wrest that power away from their legislators The independent commissions in these states are completely in charge of redistricting Their maps cannot be changed or overruled by the legislature To keep politics at bay these committees are kept strictly bipartisan with reserved seats for Democrats Republicans and independents Selection rules exclude politicians and those who work for them California went as far to use a lottery to pick some of the commissionersDespite the cautionary measures these committees have been the site of considerable partisan bitterness There have been allegations that the nonpartisan members on the commission secretly favor one side and that the technical staff assisting the commissions introduced bias into the process For these and other reasons the resulting district plans have consistently been challenged in court As political scientist Bruce Cain writesIn fact Mondays case was merely the first of two GOP lawsuits before the Supreme Court involving redistricting in ArizonaNow after the Court has established that Arizonas independent commission is constitutional it will consider whether the commissions most recent redistricting map apportioned Republicans fairly On Tuesday the Court announced that it will hear this second lawsuit some time next sessionMany political scientists say that all the fuss over gerrymandering amounts to wasted breath Recent decades have seen large decreases in the number of competitive House districts and large increases in political polarization  but these twin trends cant be blamed on gerrymandering aloneIn a 2006 paper published in the Journal of Politics Emory researchers pointed out that House elections have been getting less competitive even during years when district boundaries havent changedIf gerrymandering alone were the culprit the number of competitive seats should plummet after each redistricting  between 1990 and 1992 or 2000 and 2002 or 2010 and 2012 But the changes that happen between redistricting years have been modestFurthermore Princeton political scientist Nolan McCarty has noted that political polarization increased just as fast in the Senate as in the House Since senators are elected in statewide races they arent affected by gerrymandering Yet the Senate too has been paralyzed by partisan rancorWhat we know and dont know about our polarized politicsGerrymandering it seems is a symptom of increasing viciousness in politics  not the root causeBut thats even more of a reason for states to safeguard the districtmaking process from partisanship The ongoing fight in Arizona has demonstrated that political parties will battle tooth and nail to tilt the electoral map in their favorArizona and Californias experiments in independent redistricting attemptto depoliticize redistricting by appointing citizen committees Its possible to take that idea one step further These days software and cheap computing gives every citizen the power to create their own district maps Opening up the redistricting process to public participationand review would offerone more check against legislators acting in their own self interestThat tracks thespirit ofMondays decision in which Ginsburg borrowedliberally from founding father James Madison The genius of republican liberty seems to demand   not only that all power should be derived from the peoplebut that those intrusted with it should be kept in dependenceon the people she quotedShe wrote The people of Arizona turned to the initiative to curb the practice of gerrymandering and thereby to ensure that Members of Congress would have an habitual recollection of their dependence on the peopleIndependent redistricting commissions wontheal the nasty rift inAmerican politics But at the very least theywouldensure that anynastinessbe entirely representative of the American public
