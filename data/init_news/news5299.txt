Des Moines Iowa CNN No one ever really doubted that Donald Trump could pull off a major counterprograming feat  even when competing with a GOP debate that was expected to draw millions of viewersHe did it Thursday night dazzling a crowd of hundreds of enthusiastic supporters by announcing that he had raised more than 6 million for veterans in one day  1 million of it from his own checkbook We love our vets he saidYou know my whole theme is make America great again and thats what were going to do  and we wouldnt have even been here if it werent for our vets Trump saidEven Trump seemed a bit surprised that he had pulled off his stunt Look at all the cameras This is like the Academy Awards the real estate magnate said as he took the stage in an auditorium at Drake University about 20 minutes after the debate began a few miles away Were actually told that we have more cameras than they do by quite a bit and you know what thats really in honor of our vetsThe rally was a restrained performance by Trump standards He dispensed with his usual riff about his poll numbers and mostly avoided jabs at his fellow candidates with the exception of a lowenergy shot at Jeb BushInstead he delivered a speech mostly focused on the problems veterans have faced when returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  inadequate healthcare and housing drug abuse mental health issues and homelessnessOur vets are being mistreated Illegal immigrants are treated better in many cases than our vets and its not going to happen any more Its not going to happen any moreClearly enjoying his evening away from the debate Trump also told the audience what could be another media sensation for his campaign the fact that his daughter Ivanka is pregnant Ivanka I said it would be so great if you had your baby in Iowa It would be so great  Id definitely winIn a somewhat extraordinary move for someone who has reveled in taunting his rivals he invited Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum  two candidates who had been relegated to an earlier undercard debate  to join him on stage to speak about veterans issues While appearing generous it was also politically savvy maneuver given that the two men were the respective winners of the past two Iowa caucuses but stuck in the bottomtier this time aroundHuckabee and Santorum are still wellliked and admired by core Republican voters here in Iowa even if their campaigns have failed to ignite this time And their presence on stage with Trump could go a long way toward negating the criticisms from Trumps rivals like Ted Cruz whose allies have claimed that Trump will be punished by Iowans on Monday for skipping the debate stageSantorum who narrowly defeated Mitt Romney here in 2012 tried to stand to the side of Trumps podium noting to laughter that he didnt want to be photographed in front of a Trump signIm supporting another candidate but that doesnt mean we cant work together to honor Americas veterans Santorum saidTrump has regaled in the media spectacle that he created over the past few days after withdrawing from the Fox News debate with complaints that hed been mistreated by the network He told the crowd that he wished that hed been able to participate but once he had withdrawn  no amount of cajoling even by the likes of Fox News host Bill OReilly  could bring him backWhen youre treated badly you have to stick up for your rights he said to cheers And thats what our country has to do We have to stick up for our country when were being mistreatedOnce this started and it was for our vets there was nothing I could do he added reflecting on whether the pundits were right that his maneuver might damage his campaign I dont know Is it for me personally a good thing a bad thing Will I get more votes Will I get less votes Nobody knows Who the hell knowsHe predicted that the amount of money that he had raised through a website and through personal calls to wealthy friends who contributed to the cause would impress Iowans I think this money is going to continue to pour inThe organizations run the gamut from groups focused on helping veterans with disabilities and mental health problems to those aimed at helping veterans reintegrate into civilian societyTrump supporters who waited hours in the cold to see him roundly disputed the notion that he would see any attrition in his support in Iowa where he has led in recent pollsIn interviews many voters here said the controversy was yet another example of Trump bucking the establishment  a trait that has endeared him to them from the beginning  and that they were proud of him standing up to Fox NewsErnie Ratcliffe an army veteran who served two tours in Vietnam drove in from Kansas City for the rally scoffed when asked for his thoughts on Texas Sen Ted Cruzs contention that Trump skipped the debate because he was afraid of taunts or difficult questions from the Fox moderators or rival candidatesDonald Trump isnt scared of anything Hes not scared of absolutely anything said Ratcliffe who has signed up with his wife to call New Hampshire voters on Trumps behalf next week Donald J Trump said he was going to do this and hes done it Hes a man of his wordRatcliffe said he was convinced that Trump was the only candidate who could clean up the Department of Veterans Affairs and that it would be one of the first things he does when he gets into officeHes going to get it squared away he said Its not going to take him very long to do it Hes going to put the right people in He knows how to manage things Hes a very successful businessman Hes going to get it done very quickly and very very wellRandal Thom a former Marine who was among the first admitted to Trumps event said he loved it that Trump refused to back downWhen it came out yesterday that he was actually doing this rally in less than 24 hours it was amazing Thom said It just shows he has the ability to rally and get things doneThom who raises Alaskan Malamute and Pomalute puppies in Minnesota and plans to spend Monday in Iowa volunteering for Trump dismissed Cruz as a Canadianborn citizen and described the Texas senator as well as the other GOP contenders as weakTrump is a 100 strongman Hes bullet proof Thom said People say Oh look at his background Look at the number of wives hes had You know what I dont care about that What I care about is his future
