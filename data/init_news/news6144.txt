Donald Trump and Newt Gingrich are both mavericks but with complementary skills And they have a good personal rapportRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump l and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich r acknowledge the crowd during a campaign rally at the Sharonville Convention Center on July 6 2016 in CincinnatiVice President Newt Gingrich It has a certain ring to it especially if you are Mr Gingrich And clearly the former speaker of the House would love to be Donald Trumps running mateGingrich has acknowledged that hes being vetted for the job and is widely seen as a top prospect Mr Trump is expected to announce his choice this week ahead of the Republican National Convention which opens July 18Would it be a mistake for Trump to put someone as controversial as Gingrich at his side The rap sheet on Gingrich is a mile long As speaker in the 1990s he presided over two unpopular shutdowns of the federal government In 1995 at a Monitor breakfast Gingrich showed a lack of discipline when he whined about being seated in the back of Air Force One on a flight to Israel inspiring the famous Cry Baby cartoonIn 1997 the House reprimanded Gingrich on ethics charges and fined him 300000 Then GOP colleagues launched an unsuccessful coup to force him out of the speakership By late 1998 he had resigned from Congress altogetherThen theres Gingrichs messy personal life including three marriages just like Trump As a presidential candidate in 2012 Gingrich won two GOP primaries but he was widely disliked by the general public and his campaign ran agroundSo why are we arguing that Gingrich might just be the perfect running mate for Trump Start with the fact that he meets Trumps rsum requirement someone with Washington political experience someone who could truly be good with respect to dealing with the Senate dealing with Congress getting legislation passed the billionaire said in MayBut didnt Gingrich mishandle his time as speaker In important ways yes but he also got some things done He and President Clinton reached a deal that resulted in four straight balanced budgets They also cut capital gains taxes and reformed welfare So in Gingrich Trump would get deep knowledge of how Washington works and the lessons an older wiser Gingrich learned from past mistakesBut wouldnt putting a controversial running mate next to a controversial presidential nominee make for well too much controversy Maybe But the public is clamoring for change Gingrich was all about change when he led the Republican Revolution of 1994 with his 10point platform the Contract with America  ushering in a GOP majority in the House for the first time in 40 years More than 20 years later Gingrich is still in a way an outsider despite his insider experienceNone of the above however gets to why Gingrich might be Trumps most effective running mate which is this He is great at capturing media attention and could use that to go after Hillary Clinton relentlesslyWith an untethered attack animal such as former Speaker Gingrich on his ticket Trump can set down his Twitter account and start behaving presidential says John Gizzi chief political columnist at NewsmaxOr Trump and Gingrich could doubleteam Mrs Clinton reinforcing the message of lying crooked HillaryThey can sing from the same hymn book says Republican strategist Ford OConnellAs Trump considers whom to pick  Indianas lowkey governor and former House member Mike Pence is another reported finalist  personal rapport also looms large Trump is a relationship guy says Mr OConnellTrump and Gingrich have a bond formed in part at the Trump National Golf Club in northern Virginia which is near Gingrichs home Gingrich and his wife are members and when Trump was visiting the club they would socializeLast week the outlines of a potential TrumpGingrich ticket began to take shape when the two campaigned together in CincinnatiNewt has been my friend for a long time Trump said And Im not saying anything and Im not telling even Newt anything but I can tell you in one form or another Newt Gingrich is going to be involved with our government That I can tell youIf he selects Gingrich to be his running mate Trump added nobodys going to beat him in those debatesUltimately running mates dont matter to presidential nominees chances  except when they do Lyndon Johnson helped John F Kennedy win Texas in 1960 Sarah Palin was a drag on John McCains campaign in 2008 With the political novice Trump at the top of the ticket putting someone at his side with policy and governing experience seems a mustBut beyond that Trumps candidacy will rise or fall based on Trump and nobody else His largerthanlife persona will not be eclipsed by anyone even a big personality like Gingrich
