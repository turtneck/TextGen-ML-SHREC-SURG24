Sunday nights public proclamation that Sen Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov John Kasich had reached a truce aimed at ceding states to one another was not predicted but also entirely predictable With his failure to gain any delegates in New York Cruz is no longer able to win enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination a position in which Kasich has found himself for weeks So the only viable path to the nomination for each is a contested convention which necessitates that Donald Trump not win enough delegates to clinch it himselfAnd so on Sunday the public revelation that the two candidates would split upcoming states Cruz will be cleared to win Indiana with Kasich canceling upcoming events in the state and Cruz will allow Kasich to win in Oregon and New Mexico Each needs Trump to fall short of the 1237 delegates it would take for him to winthe nomination with Cruz poised to potentially win on the second ballot and Kasich in a more nebulous set of circumstances to win somewhere else down the line Allowing for Cruz to gobble up as many of Indianas 57 delegates as he can and for Kasich to scoop up Oregon and New Mexicos 52 would put a dent in the 391 delegates Trump still needs to hit 1237But the plan isnt as foolproof as it might seemThe two made it public in part so that the various super PACs supporting each candidate would get the message As our Matea Gold notes Kasichs announcement was explicit in suggesting to his super PAC supporters that they should allow Cruz to win Indiana writing in his statement that the campaign would expect independent thirdparty groups to do the same and honor the commitments made by the Cruz and Kasich campaigns But the announcement was also meant to present a united Not Trump front of the kind that Trump opponents have been seeking for a while though usually by virtue of hoping either Cruz or Kasich dropped outThe problem though is that the math is much trickier than simply handing one state to Cruz and another to KasichLets start with Indiana It was one of the four states that we identified in March as being key to the Republican contest by virtue of the number of delegates it offers Two of those four New York and Pennsylvania will have voted by Wednesday morning with Trump almost certainly winning over 100 of the pledged delegates the two have to offer Most of Pennsylvanias delegates are unpledged meaning they could vote for Casper the Friendly Ghost if inclined to do so The fourth state still outstanding is California which well get toA Fox News poll released Friday showed Trump with an eightpoint lead over Cruz in Indiana But FiveThirtyEights forecast including factors besides polls has Cruz as a slight favorite Trump has won most of the states around Indiana save Ohio by small margins and Cruz should similarly be close in the state Getting Kasich out of the picture means that the states delegates given out to whoever wins the state or its nine congressional districts are much more likely to go to Cruz Indiana has 8 percent of the delegates left to acquire and 15 percent of the delegates Trump needs to clinch Handing them to Cruz would be a big win for those who want a nonTrump nomineeThe delegates in Oregon and New Mexico though Ehh There hasnt been good polling in either state recently but each state allocates its delegates proportionally Meaning that if Trump would get say 33 percent against Kasichs 33 and Cruzs 33 consolidating behind Kasich so that he gets 66 percent of the delegates doesnt really subtractfrom Trumps total at allWhere the two really need to stop Trump is in winnertakeall states such asNew Jersey where Trump currently has the support of a majority of the states Republicans Thats 51 delegates 13 percent of what Trump still needs that Cruz and Kasich want to disrupt And the big prize California where the winner of the state gets 13 delegates and the winner of each of its 53 congressional districts gets three The idea apparently is that Kasich and Cruz might target specific congressional districts Thats optimisticAfter all Cruz tried to target specific districts in New York and still got gooseegged Those Fox polls released Friday showed Trump with a wide lead in the state making the task for Kasich and Cruz trickier Kasich had only about 11 million on hand at the end of March meaning that his ability to campaign anywhere much less in specific congressional districts is limited Its part of the reason that his pulling out of Indiana helps his campaignThis also raises the question of how much of an effect the will of the candidates might actually have on the outcomes Theres a lot of talk about strategic voting particularly from surrogates but theres not much evidence that voters really care Here are the apparent talking points for Cruzs campaign via the Wall Street Journals Reid EpsteinThats political fingercrossing Primary voters are more engaged than your average voter but will thousands of Cruz supporters in Oregon mark their ballots for Kasich simply to help fulfill the campaigns grand strategies If I were a betting man which I am Id probably take the underWhats at the heart of this plan is the simple fact that Trumps got a narrow path to those 1237 delegates There are a number of scenarios where he hits the mark and perhaps more where he doesnt Cruz and Kasich have little choice but to try to keep him from getting there and have few options for doing so beyond trying to parcel out states like poker chipsBut as the Republican Party has learned repeatedly since the Iowa caucuses Feb 1 voters are impressively immune to the whims of party poobahs Cruz and Kasich need Trump to fail in his push for delegates This could theoretically help It could also be another few strands of spaghetti clinging tenuously to the wall for a brief instant but then like so many strands before them dropping to the ground impotent At least Cruz and Kasich can say they tried
