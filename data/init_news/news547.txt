CNN Sometimes political change comes from unexpected people and at unexpected moments One of the biggest surprises of 2016 is that Donald Trump is poised to win the nomination of the Republican Party while defying key elements of GOP orthodoxyWhile Trump may very well shift hard to the right in the general election reversing the conventional pattern of running to the hard right in the primaries and then shifting to the center in the fall the fact that he will win the nomination after having run such an eclectic and unorthodox campaign is something that party professionals will take note ofWhether or not Trump really believes any of the heresies hes stated about GOP positions is besides the point at least for the moment And while Trump is a unique case given his celebrity stature one thing is clear  he has made statements that until this year most experts would have characterized as touching a third rail for anyone seeking to win the nominationRepublican politicians have been pretty lockstep on policies for years And Trump has stuck to the right the far right on questions like immigration But the surprise of this year is that on a number of other issues Republican voters have been willing to vote for someone who refused to toe the party lineJust this past week Trump reiterated his statements about being willing to raise taxes an unheardof position for a GOP presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan came to town in the 1980sTrump is certainly no Bernie Sanders His overall tax agenda fits comfortably within the Reagan legacy he would cut taxes for the wealthy and hope that supply side economics will work the magic its adherents claim Yet he has refused to rule out some tax increases Early on he announced that he favored higher taxes for hedge fund managers and last Sunday stated that taxes would go up on the wealthyThis kind of statement was sure to kill a Republican candidacy in years past Ever since antitax activist Grover Norquist pressured Republicans to sign a pledge stating that they would not raise taxesand Reagan blasted the Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in a 1984 debate after he admitted in a debate that he would have to do thisRepublicans on the campaign trail never concede that they would take this stepEven through his vacillations and flipflops Trump has now talked of higher taxes several times and many voters in the party seem willing to back himHe has also avoided the familiar rhetoric about cutting entitlements or privatizing Social Security I want to leave Social Security as it is he said Sounding very much like a Democrat Trump has been pretty insistent throughout that he has no intention of going after these giant programsMore to the point he has offered rhetoric stating his support for what they accomplish It is not because these programs are a third rail according to Trump but because they are goodIn his conflict with House Speaker Paul Ryan Trump has warned that he disagreed with Ryan who wants to knock out Social Security knock it down way down He wants to knock Medicare way downIn addition to being a surefire way to lose the election Trump added that more importantly in a sense I want to keep it These people have been making their payments for their whole lives I want to keep Social Security intact Now I want to get rid of waste fraud and abuse I want to do a lot of things to it that are going to make it much better actually But Im not going to cut it and Im not going to raise ages of eligibility and Im not going to do all of the things that they want to doTrump is on to the secret that many redstate Republicans like their entitlements and are not enthused by party rhetoric about taking those benefits away When tea party Republicans warned President Obama in 2010 to Take Your Government Hands Off My Medicare they meant itSaying no to free tradeOn free trade Trump has been saying things that make a conservatives head spin He has done extremely well in a number of states by talking about how trade agreements like NAFTA were disastrous to US workers destroying jobs and undercutting wages No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers he has saidOf the TransPacific Partnership agreement between the US and 11 other countries which Trump calls ObamaTrade he said The TPP is a horrible deal It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but troubleTrump has made attacks on free trade a core aspect of his campaign against other Republicans as well as against Hillary Clinton His arguments have resonated in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan where workers have watched entire industries being slowly gutted as production moved overseasHe has talked about a return to trade restrictions and trade war with rhetoric that Republicans and most Democrats have rejected for decadesConservative cultural values also have been absent from his stump speeches Trump who has lived a life more suited to Howard Sterns radio show than an evangelical church has not really paid much attention to the religious right or their strand of conservatism apart from a few moments like his visit to Liberty UniversityHe is all about economics and slowing the flow of immigrants and making American great again He has sometimes gone directly against many evangelicals positions such as when he stated his support for transgender people using any bathroom they wantedHe says he opposes abortion but has made statements supportive of Planned Parenthood that are anathema to many on the right You can say whatever you want Trump said but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatlyEvangelicals are certainly nervous with many leaders saying they want a vice presidential pick that they can trust But Trump has survived unscathed even in many southern primary statesWhen it comes to foreign policy Trump has stepped back from the hawkish neoconservative rhetoric that has dominated Republican circles for several decades Although he still brandishes a big stick when talking about what he would do to ISIS and how he would combat the threat of terrorism he has made statements that are skeptical about relying on the military as the prime instrument of US foreign policyIn his America First speech he talked about the need to recognize the limits of US power and to only engage in conflicts that are directly essential to the national interest as he defines itWhen former President George W Bush joined the campaign trail in South Carolina to help his brother Jeb Trump went right after Bushs war in Iraq and blasted it as a mistake All of this talk seems to be just fine with many RepublicansIt is much too early to tell what the longterm impact of Trumps candidacy will be on the Republican Party But with all the attention that has been paid to the risks Trump poses as a leader and the ugly statements that have come out of his campaign we have not looked closely enough at how and why a candidate who refused to accept the partys doctrine has won the nominationThis is a big story in an era of rigid party polarization If Trumps campaign becomes a model for future candidates we might see a very different Republican Party in years to comeOf course if Trump goes on to suffer a landslide defeat against Hillary Clinton rockribbed conservatives might say I told you so and the dynamics of GOP politics in 2020 could return to what theyve been in the past
