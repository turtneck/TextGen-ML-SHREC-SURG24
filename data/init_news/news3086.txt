Many people believe that there has been a wave of individuals being born in order to change the old Iron and industrial way of life to more enlightened and spiritual Youve probably heard about  Indigo Children  and  Lightworkers  across the internetLightworkers are just a consequence the ways of the modern world have brought to the human psycheA Lightworker is a person who can sense that theres a lot of healing to be done on a large scale to the world The modern ways of life are disharmonious and harmful to ourselves and Nature which we are all a part of This results in subconscious awareness that something needs to be done especially in people who are born into the modern societyNewer generations are unbound from the chains people who were constructing the modern society have been imprisoned with The chains I am referring to are actually their investment of energy their mindset and character developed in a different era with far less available information These new generations can clearly see the bigger picture and what doesnt work Thats why they have a heightened sense to fix the worldJust like there are popular terms in the science community addressing these new generations as generation x generation yand generation z there are terms in the spiritual movement addressing these generations as  Indigo Children   Crystal Children  and  Rainbow Children WHAT KIND OF LIGHTWORKER ARE YOU Check what kind of lightworker you are What aspect has most traits that describe you INDIGO CHILDREN Born between the 1960s and the 1990s Rebellious and warrior in spirit

gadgets Loving and hard to contain Loves animals Nature and possibly vegan Free THIS IS WHAT THESE LABELS MEAN Indigo children are born between the 1960s and the 1990s really similar as the baby boomers of the generation xThey are rebellious and unable to conform to dysfunctional situations at home work or school They are warriors in spiritThey want to rage against the corrupted system that governs society and this trait projected itself into the art the music the movies the movements and the lifestyle of their youthThey experimented with psychedelic substances they forced their mind to be openedAll of this resulted in creation of new businesses and inventions that changed the future forever like the internetCrystal children are most likely to be the children of people from generation x They are born around 1990s and 2000s slightly differing from generation y which addresses people born between 1980s and 2000s However the characteristics of crystal children and generation y individuals are almost exactly the sameThey are intuitive spiritually aware and passionate about supernatural subjects They have highly developed imagination and creativity They understand things easily they are extremely empathetic and very easy going This contradictive schism between their emotions forces them to use drugs to visit psychiatrists feel high levels of anxiety have panic attacks and sometimes even more serious issues with their mental healthThey are born in a transition time in a period where humanity made its biggest leap with technological advancement which affected all areas of society They grew up in times without internet and times when you cannot imagine how you lived without internet This transition happened in only 10 years period which is REALLY small amount of time for such great change This affected their way of seeing the world Its like they were forced to raise their consciousness in an accelerated rate But thats ok because they are strong enough like crystals They always see the world with pure eyes which additionally adds to their crystal children descriptionBecause of their imagination purity of heart and strength they are attracted to the superhero phenomena Their art music movies businesses even their lifestyles are inspired and driven by various superheroes they idolized while they were growing upRainbow children are the newest generation of people or generation z born after the new millenniumThey are modern and more technologically advanced than generation x and y because they are raised in a period where humans are more connected than any time in the known human history They had almost all of the information in the world available to them while they were growing up only by pushing few buttonsThese kids are happy and positive They are like a breath of fresh air They are bringing happiness and joy to the whole world through various inventions platforms and mediums that the generation x has developed and generation y perfectedTheir light and positivity makes them freer than any generation in modern history They love traveling they hate being tied up to one person and they cannot stand the old conformistic ways It feel like prison to them Think of them like light they give warmth life and cannot be captured Their whole being is pure and thats why most of these kids are veganTHE GREATEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE 3 GENERATIONS IS THIS The Indigos are here to destroy whats not working and pave the way for a better worldThe crystal children are the ones who need to create develop and build the new ways uniting the best from the old and the newThe rainbow children are here to give life and fertilize the new and improved world thats in harmony with Nature and the human potentialAll of these 3 spiritual archetypes need to work together so there will be a real change to the way humanity further developsHowever it doesnt mean that if you are an indigo you cannot be a crystal or a rainbow child You can evolve through all of these 3 archetypes depending on your environment understanding and purpose And a lot of people doThese are simply 3 different aspects of one larger program called being a Lightworker which works to heal the worldHERE IS HOW WE ARE ALL A PART OF THIS SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION This spiritual revolution is a consequence of the collective human psyche To understand this you must understand how we are all connected You must grasp the fact that EVERYTHING connects to everything else even our thoughtsmile Durkheim first introduced the collective conscious back in 1893 and described as the set of shared beliefs ideas and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society However just like our collective conscious Carl Jung called a phenomena Collective Unconscious which is the subconscious mind shared by all of humanityThis is how we are all connected This is how all of us unintentionally created the perfect environment for Lightworkers to be developed and act as an antidote to the virus that could have destroyed us Maybe that was the defensive mechanism of our collective subconsciounsess or a higher plan of our collective psyche to help us thrive together as speciesLife Coach Code SOURCE
