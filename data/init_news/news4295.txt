The speakerelect walked down the center aisle Thursday morning accepting hugs kisses handshakes and applause Then he did something unexpected He turned leftPaul Ryan the young Wisconsin Republican who in minutes would accept the speakers gavel walked through the Democratic side of the well He accepted a bear hug from RepGene Green Tex and handshakes from RepJohn Conyers Mich and a halfdozen other African American Democrats He reached in to greet RepTammy Duckworth Ill in her wheelchair shook hands with RepSander Levin Mich a frequent critic and hugged RepJohn Lewis Ga the civil rights iconIf you ever pray pray for each other Republicans for Democrats and Democrats for Republicans Ryan told the House To laughter he added And I dont mean pray for a conversion all right Pray for a deeper understanding because when youre up here you see it so clearly Wherever you come from whatever you believe we are all in the same boatThere was rapt silence when a moment later Ryan said Lets be frank The House is broken  And I am not interested in laying blame We are not settling scores We are wiping the slate cleanJust about everybody  even after some hesitation Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi Calif  rose and applaudedI felt goose bumps watching from the gallery for a most unfamiliar sense of hope had admitted itself to the bitterly divided chamber In this dark hour for the House there was a tantalizing glimpse that the institution which has strayed so far from what the Founders created could heal itself Only an ingnue would believe all will be different now But only the most hardened cynic would dismiss the possibility of what Rep Cathy McMorris Rodgers RWash in her speech nominating Ryan called a fresh startFor a day the ideological freak show was shut down Only nine Republicans voted against Ryan a far more unified showing than in January when 25 opposed John Boehner For the moment the Republican speaker was overtly courting Democrats And for once Democrats and Republicans were rising in unison to applaudHow reassuring it would be Ryan told his colleagues if we actually fixed the tax code put patients in charge of their health care grew our economy strengthened our military lifted people out of poverty and paid down our debtPelosi shrugged and looked around Finding nothing objectionable in what Ryan had said she rose and joined in the applauseIt may not be long before Ryan winds up in the same position Boehner was for five years forced to bring up pointless abortion bills and Obamacare repeals and otherwise placating hardlinersBut he may be the only one who has a shot at repairing the chamber because of his youth hes 45 his renown Mitt Romney on whose ticket Ryan ran in 2012 watched the proceedings as Ryans guest in the speakers box and his popularityPelosi handing the gavel to Ryan offered the hand of friendship from Democrats and said This is the speakers house She corrected herself This is the peoples house But her misstatement was apt For now at least this is Paul Ryans houseRyan benefits from a big parting gift from Boehner who in his final days infuriated conservatives one last time by negotiating a bipartisan deal that will postpone budget and debtlimit fights until 2017 The outgoing speaker waved a box of tissues to his chuckling colleagues before his farewell speech and he dabbed his eyes as he pleaded for reason Yes freedom makes all things possible he said but patience is what makes all things realBoehner was not a great speaker  he was often paralyzed by the right  but he is a good man His parting boasts about achievements were dubious but the emotion was real I describe my life as a chase for the American Dream he said his voice breakingThe departing speaker was still wiping his eyes when standing in the back of the chamber he heard Pelosi celebrate him as the personification of the American Dream and Ryan accurately call him a man of characterNow I know how he felt Ryan said confiding that the weight of the office makes him feel that the moon the stars and all the planets had fallen on me He suggested his colleagues should feel the weight of their offices tooAt bottom the speaker said we vindicate a way of life We show by our work that free people can govern themselvesThat proposition is now seriously in question Lets all  Democrats Republicans liberals and conservatives  pray for Ryans success in defending itRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
