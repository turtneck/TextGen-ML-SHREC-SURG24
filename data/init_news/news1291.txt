CNN Mitt Romney delivered a sweeping broadside against Donald Trump on Thursday laying into the Republican presidential frontrunner with a sharper attack than any of the partys 2016 contenders have made against the billionaire business mogulHeres what I know Donald Trump is a phony a fraud Romney said His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University Hes playing members of the American public for suckers He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hatRomney said that dishonesty is Donald Trumps hallmark pointing to his bullying the greed the showing off the misogyny the absurd thirdgrade theatricsTheres irony in Romneys speech Just four years ago he courted Trumps endorsement  even after Trump had led the birther controversy against President Barack Obama insisting that Obama release his birth certificate to prove he is an American citizenHe was begging for my endorsement I could have said Mitt drop to your knees  he would have dropped to his knees he saidHe said of 2012 That was a race I have to say folks that should have been won  I dont know what happened to him He disappeared He disappeared And I wasnt happy about it Ill be honest because I am not a fan of Barack Obama because I backed Mitt Romney  I backed Mitt Romney You can see how loyal he isHe said Romney thought about running again in 2016 but chickened outRomney tweeted after his own speech but before Trumps that had the New York businessman made similar statements about the KKK and others in 2012 he would not have accepted the endorsementIf Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK Muslims Mexicans disabled I would NOT have accepted his endorsementBut now Romney the 2012 GOP nominee is attempting to play the role of party elder during a speech at the University of Utah He said any of the partys other candidates  Florida Sen Marco Rubio Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich  would be suitable choicesHe also amplified the stakes of the election arguing that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be damaging as wellThe remarkable speech reflected the splintering of the Republican Party as party leaders and statesmen increasingly rebuke their frontrunnerRomney didnt endorse a candidate  saying that due to the partys delegate apportionment process hed vote for Rubio in Florida or Kasich in Ohio if he lived in any of those states when they vote on March 15It was in effect an argument for a contested convention which would come only if Trump couldnt win enough delegates to capture the nomination on the first ballotIf the other candidates can find common ground I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism he saidTrump meanwhile is winning over workingclass whites and evangelical voters who are angry with Washingtons political class  breaking turnout records in primaries along the wayDespite Romneys scathing speech there are few signs it will dissuade Trumps loyal core of supporters who so far have greeted his most eyebrowraising antics with swelling supportNonetheless Romney lambasted Trump on foreign policy casting him as very very notsmart in his comments about allowing ISIS to take out Syrias leadership and for proposing the slaughter of the families of terroristsMr Trump is directing our anger for lessthannoble purposes He creates scapegoats in Muslims and Mexican immigrants He calls for the use of torture He calls for the killing of innocent children and family members of terrorists He cheers assaults on protestors he said adding that Trump would trample First Amendment protectionsRomney also said Trumps remarks on CBS 60 Minutes on Syria and ISIS has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season Let ISIS take out Assad he said and then we can pick up the remnantsThink about that Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over a country This is recklessness in the extreme Romney saidThe business mogul who himself has changed positions on abortion continued hitting Romney and the Republican establishment Thursday morning in a series of tweetsI have brought millions of people into the Republican Party while the Dems are going down Establishment wants to kill this movement Trump tweetedRomney also mocked Trumps failed business ventures pointing to his airline his casino bankruptcies and more and attacked his sexual indiscretions tooTheres a dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam war while at the same time John McCain who he has mocked was in prison being tortured he saidAs soon as Romney wrapped up McCain the Arizona senator who was the 2008 GOP nominee said he agreedI share the concerns about Donald Trump that my friend and former Republican nominee Mitt Romney described in his speech today I would also echo the many concerns about Mr Trumps uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues that have been raised by 65 Republican defense and foreign policy leaders McCain said in a statementThe extraordinary effort by Romney to take down the Republican frontrunner comes amid a lastditch rush among the partys donors and loyalists to stop Trump from capturing the nominationAfter the remarks Kasich tweeted Well said MittRomneyHis attack on Trump was an amalgamation of all of the attacks that other candidates and party members have made in recent weeksOne of his top aides in the 2012 race Katie Packer is heading a super PAC that is launching attack ads against Trump Another super PAC and the hardline conservative Club for Growth are also airing ads critical of TrumpIt could be too late Trump has already won 10 of the first 15 states to vote and he has a clear lead nationally over Rubio and CruzRomney cast the coming months elections as a crucial moment in history citing Ronald Reagan and saying that this nominating contest is a time for choosing  laying waste along the way to Reagans fabled 11th Commandment that Republicans not speak ill of other RepublicansAdding to the intrigue Romneys 2012 vice presidential running mate House Speaker Paul Ryan had a private dinner with Romney in Salt Lake City Utah last weekend CNN has learnedThe dinner occurred while Ryan was on a trip out West to help campaign for House candidates an aide said But the aide maintained that the speaker only learned last night that Romney was planning to deliver a speech strongly criticizing TrumpAt his weekly press conference that happened at the same time as Romneys blistering attack on Trump Ryan was asked about any talks hes had with Romney and the 2012 GOPs nominees message about Trump but he said he hadnt seen the content of the speechMitt Romney is one of our party leaders and he cares deeply about the future of the Republican party and the country Ryan said adding that Mitt and I are very close friendsIn his speech Romney called Trumps policy proposals flimsy at best and said hed trigger a trade war drive up the deficit and lead the nation into a recessionEven though Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans what he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and American families he saidNow I know you say Isnt he a huge business success and doesnt he know what hes talking about No he isnt and no he doesnt His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and their workers He inherited his business he didnt create it Romney saidRomney also pointed to Trumps exchange about white supremacists with CNNs Jake Tapper last Sunday on State of the Union as a general election liabilityThe video of the infamous TapperTrump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play 100000 times on cable and who knows how many billion times on social media he said
