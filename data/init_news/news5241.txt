humanitarian aid defended the world organizations actions in Syria laying blame at both the rebels Damascus and Moscow for not allowing the UN humanitarian assistance to take place The United Nations were ready to launch our operations on Sunday 23 October However objections by two nonState armed opposition groups namely Ahrar asSham and Nureddin Zenki scuppered these plans The United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties only for the parties to then fail to agree on each others conditions about how evacuations should proceed said UnderSecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Stepen OBrien In the meantime the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent teams working in Aleppo have complained that delivering the humanitarian aid and treating the wounded has been a challenge as the ICRC failed to secure the security guarantees of some armed groups                pictwittercomhsdfmqLVRK    ICRCar October 26

Mans inhumanity to man been as apt It can be stopped but you the Security Council have to choose to make it stop the envoy added Taking the mic at the UNSC meeting Churkin criticized OBriens report which he said lacked factual information and failed to stress the cessation of Syrian and Russian air raids on the city He asked OBrian not to recite poetry but base his reports on concrete facts If

and Russian planes had not flown over Aleppo staying at least 10 km away from the city This moratorium on the flight lasted eight days now Mr O Brian you did not mention a single word about it You have built your speech so to paint a picture that aerial bombardment did not stop for one day and that it is happening now as we speak said Churkin
