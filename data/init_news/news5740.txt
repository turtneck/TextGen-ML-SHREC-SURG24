By Nathaniel MaukaCongress overwhelmingly voted for the Patriot Act nearly 16 years ago and our civil liberties have never been the same since As if this singular bill passed by George W Bush wasnt invasive enough allowing big banks to demand our internet data and more  the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act  CISA  makes cyberspying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it a forgone conclusionAs with most shadow government legislation the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances CISA was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will It also allows companies to mine data under the auspices of governmentcreated urgencyThe mere fact that this act passed in late 2015 is monumental since it has been before Congress in different forms for over a decade  The election seems to have offered the perfect cover as Americans and activists were too busy arguing over Trump vs Hillary Scott Talbott senior vice president of government relations at the Electronic Transactions Association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties Talbott states The value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread he said Before CISA corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage CISA allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy Who exactly would be determining if someone is a threat is the meat of the sandwich though CISA is ripe for abuse just as the Patriot Act has beenThe Patriot Act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people without probable cause  to enter their homes or even to strip search them before theyve been to court had the opportunity to argue a case or given authorities a motive for this type of interrogationThe stated purpose of the Patriot Act was to deter terrorist acts in the United States but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country CISA simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional lawMore importantly who specifically is CISA targeting After multiple hackers have infiltrated computer systems at the White House  the State Department  the Pentagon  and the Office of Personnel Management along with the Democratic National Committee  and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal is the shadow government simply trying to create a stopgap before their most elusive yet damning information is made publicCISA certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the National Security Agency NSA before former NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed itI think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start said Justin Harvey CSO of Fidelis Cybersecurity adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will resultUnder the guise of sharing cyber threats CISA allows companies to wholesalecollect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is indeed a threat If this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill Its justifications for entering every possible orifice for datagathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacketThe government can already enter your personal property including your home your body  your cell and your computer  but now they will have a legal inroads to declare you a cyberthreat simply for sending an email  This begs the question  who is the real cyberbully CISA seems to be nothing more than a prevarication covering the acts of an elite few who dont want their secrets exposedNathaniel Mauka is a researcher of the dark side of government and exopolitics and a staff writer for Waking Times  This article  Distracted by Election 2016 Noone Resisted the Deep States Patriot Act 2  was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Nathaniel Mauka and WakingTimescom  It may be reposted freely with proper attribution and author bio Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  Click for details  Contributed by Waking Times of wwwwakingtimescom  Waking Times is an independently owned and operated online magazine that seizes on the transformational power of information to trigger personal revolution and influence humanitys evolution
