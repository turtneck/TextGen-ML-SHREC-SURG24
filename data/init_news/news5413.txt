Back in June I first saw Mr Trump announcing his candidacy for president What he said about unauthorizedimmigrants seemed ridiculous so I laughed I showed the video to friends and I laughed again His words were poorly chosenBut something worse happened People interpreted Trumps words in the most awful and offensive waysIn one of my courses at the University of Texas at Austin I asked my students What has Donald Trump said that you found most offensive One student raised her hand high He said that all Mexicans are rapists I asked a coworker the same question He replied He said that all Mexican immigrants are rapistsI explained that Trump said no such thing This is what Trump saidYou might well dislike Trumps words I did But lets not make it worse He did not say that all Mexicans are rapists Yet thats what many commentators did For examplePoliticomisquoted Trump by omitting his phrase about good people They said he was demonizing Mexicans as rapists They argued that Mexicans do not really commit more rapes in the US than whites But thats not what Trump claimedSimilarly other news sources misrepresented his words in offensive waysCompare such words with Trumps words Which is worse Writers excerpted the phrase theyre rapists as if it were about all Mexican unauthorized immigrants or worse about all Mexican immigrants or even worst about all Mexicans But thats not what he said Thats not what he meant It was just a remark about some of the criminals crossing the borderThe trick for misrepresenting Trumps words can be used against anyoneFor example on October 7 at a Democratic debate Hillary Clinton answered the question Which enemy are you most proud of She replied In addition to the NRA um the health insurance companies the drug companies um the IraniansIf you do to her what the media did to Trump then you should believe that Hillary Clinton is proud to be the enemy of 77 million citizens of Iran plus millions more living outside Iran including mothers children and disabled people But thats not what she meantOn November 6 at the MSNBC Democratic Candidates Forum Bernie Sanders said we have to pass a constitutional amendment that everyone in America who is 18 years old or older is registered to vote He saideveryone Someone might then write He proposed that everyone who is in the US should vote everyone who is 18 even illegal immigrants tourists and terrorists But thats not what he meantIt is no wonder that many people think the media is grossly dishonest No wonder Mr Trumps critiques of the media make his followers cheerTrump was discussing crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants Is it true that some people who illegally cross the border from Mexico are good Yes Is it true that some others commit crimes Yes Is that a problem People disagree Some conjecture that unauthorized immigrants dont commit more crimes than US citizens But crimes by unauthorized immigrants even murders would not have happened if those individuals had not entered the USTime for a disclosure I was born and raised in Puerto Rico Spanish is my first language I voted for Obama I live in liberal Austin Texas where I work as a tenured professor of history Ive never voted for a Republican My preferred candidate for US president would be Elizabeth Warren Since she is not running my preferred candidate is Bernie SandersAnyhow discussions about illegal immigration are ruined by lack of data I asked my friends university faculty How many people do you think are deported per year in the USThere are two kinds of deportations some are caught near the border and returned others are removed by a court order Consider the border patrol agents personnel the bureaucracy the lawyers the resources needed to find people and deport them How many were deported in 2014One of my friends guessed 3000 Another guessed 10000 Another guessed 50000which would really be a lot of people imagineActually in fiscal year 2014 the US deported a total of 893238 foreigners Thats a huge number It includes 577295 deported by the Department of Homeland Security plus 315943 deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Among the latter 2802 were classified as suspected or confirmed gang membersSince 1990 the average is 12 million deportations per year The highest in US history was 186 million foreigners deported in the year 2000 Thats astonishingHow many were criminalsWe dont know because most criminals are not caught Plus many who are accused are not convicted because of a lack of evidence Still in 2014 the US deported 177960 convicted criminals Surprisingly 91037 were already convicted criminalsbeforethey even entered theUSAt the University of Texas at Austin the football stadium can seat 100119 people I have seen it full Ive see more than 100000 people at onceits an incredible sight Its a staggering swarm of people I have seen them yelling all at onceIt is utterly astonishing to me that this stadium would fail to seat all the convicted criminals deported in a single year Back to Mr Trump Did he unfairly single out Mexicans when complaining about crimes by unauthorized immigrants By far most Mexicans are good people However since Mexico shares a large frontier with the US and many Mexicans face economic hardships most of the reported illegal immigration into the US is from Mexico Accordingly in recent years roughly 76 of criminal unauthorized immigrants are from Mexico What kinds of crime It is strangely difficult to find national statistics on homicides sexual assaults and thefts by unauthorized immigrants But there is relevant data for some states The Texas Department of Public Safety identified 207076 foreign aliens who were booked into Texas county jails from October 2008 through August 1 2014 Their term foreign aliens includes both foreigners who are in Texas legally and foreigners who entered illegally They were accused of 357884 crimes in those 70 months including these charges 4413 terroristic threats 60973 robberies and larcenies 6636 vehicle thefts 78682 assaults 12869 sexual assaults and offenses 1113 kidnapping and 3089 homicides That includes an average of 1383 charges of sexual assaults per year in Texas alone The real number of rapes and sexual assaults is larger since many victims do not report these crimes According to the National Crime and Victimization Survey 20082012 approximately 68 of sexual assault crimes are not reported So I estimate that foreigners commit roughly 4000 sexual assaults in Texas each year In Texas roughly 529 foreigners per year were accused of committing murder Plus the FBI reports that 36 of homicides nationwide remain unsolved These crime rates are staggering and offensive None of the women and men who were killed in by unauthorized immigrants in Texas would have died if the murderers had not entered the US illegally These are not just words Pause for a moment to think about a Texas woman whose husband was murdered one night Think about parents who never saw their son again because he was murdered Think of the thousands of families standing at the cemeteries Ive only summarized murders and sexual assaults Consider drugs and drug violence According to the Drug Enforcement Administration most illegal drugs come from Mexico including most cocaine and heroine Most methamphetamines also are smuggled from Mexico The 2015 National Drug Threat Survey finds that methamphetamines are the drugs that most contribute to property crimes and violent crimes You get the point There are tremendous problems of drugs murders and rapes caused at the porous border Without knowing the data it was easy to be offended by Mr Trumps crude words when he announced his candidacy However seeing the data above I understand his concerns Heres what Trump said right after his words quoted above And it only makes common sense it only makes common sense theyre sending us not the right people and its coming from more than Mexico its coming from all over South and Latin America and its coming probably probably from the Middle East But we dont know because we have no protection and we have no competence We dont know whats happening And its gotta stop And its gotta stop fast We can disagree about some points Is the Mexican government really sending criminals to the US On July 5 Trump said The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States They are in many cases criminals drug dealers rapists etc This claim might be false if Mexico does not intentionally send criminals to the US At its best this statement seems plausible if Trump meant that conditions generated in Mexico by its government lead some criminals to the US In any case Trump proposes to secure the southern border by implementing various security measures His most recurring proposal is to build a wall along areas of the border lacking natural barriers His proposal has been widely criticized Some people construed it as a sign of racism xenophobia etc However I can understand why many of Trumps followers actually cheer Build the Wall Build the Wall First there are the worries about murders drugs crimes and terrorism Presently countless many unauthorized immigrants walk into the country unchecked In fiscal year 2014 the Border Patrol made 468407 apprehensions along the southwest border By comparison the Border Patrol only made 18244 apprehensions in all other regions But one point sticks in my mind Namely this there already exist a long series of fences and walls between Mexico and the US These fences and walls span parts of California Arizona New Mexico and Texas As of early 2012 the Department of Homeland Security had completed 652 miles of fences and walls Trump did not build all that It was mandated by Congress Walls are common alongmany countries borders such as Spain China France Greece PakistanIsrael etc The border between the US and Mexico spans roughly 1950 miles Trump wants a wall that will be 1000 miles long including areas already covered Im not trying to convince you about a wall My point is just that its neither impossible nor ridiculous A main reason why many border areas have fences instead of walls is just that walls are more expensive Trump says that everyone who didnt enter the US legally should return to their countries They have to go We might well disagree But his view is closer to Immigration law If you prefer amnesty then lawmakers have to create a law to that effect Trump insists I want people to come in but they have to come in legally Regardless countless many people think that Trump is racist against Mexicans I suggest that anyone who thinks that should count how many times Trump has praised Mexicans Most unauthorized immigrants are good people But still the media wrongly blamed Mr Trump for their own misrepresentations
