The families of 17 service members who died fighting for the US demanded an apology from Donald Trump on Monday accusing him of cheapening the sacrifice made by those we lostThey said the Republican presidential nominees suggestion that the Muslim mother of a US soldier who died in Iraq had not been allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention was akin to attacking usA letter signed by the Gold Star families  the term for those who have lost loved ones during military service  also called Trumps comments repugnant and personally offensiveWhen you question a mothers pain by implying that her religion not her grief kept her from addressing an arena of people you are attacking us the letter added When you say your job building buildings is akin to our sacrifice you are attacking our sacrificeThe letter was organized by Gold Star Mother Karen Meredith from VoteVetsorg an advocacy group that calls itself nonpartisan but which has been described in the past as allied to Congressional Democrats The Center for Responsive Politics says VoteVetsorg is fueled largely by social welfare organizations aligned with Democrats and millions of dollars given by unionsOver the weekend Trump questioned why Ghazala Khan stood by quietly as her husband Khizr Khan talked about their son Humayun at the DNCIn the speech Khan criticized Trumps policies and statements about Muslims The real estate magnate sacrificed nothing and no one Khan said and questioned whether the Republican had even read the US ConstitutionThe Khans son a US Army captain was killed by a car bomb in 2004 while guarding the gates of his base in Iraq saving the lives of his fellow soldiers and civilians He was posthumously awarded a Bronze Star and Purple HeartRelated Father of Fallen Soldier to Trump You Have Sacrificed NothingTrump who has called for Muslims to be barred from entering the country responded to the speech by saying that maybe Ghazala Khan had not been allowed to have anything to sayTrumps comments go beyond politics according to the letter It is about a sense of decency That kind decency you mock as political correctnessIt added We feel we must speak out and demand you apologize to the Khans to all Gold Star families and to all Americans for your offensive and frankly antiAmerican commentsThe letters signatories were 10 families whose loved ones died in Iraq and one that lost a father in VietnamAnd one of the nations most prominent veterans groups  the Veterans of Foreign Wars  added its voice to the controversy Monday calling Trumps criticisms of the Kahn family out of boundsElection year or not the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression said organization chief Brian Duffy in a statement There are certain sacrosanct subjects that no amount of wordsmithing can repair once crossed Giving ones life to nation is the greatest sacrifice followed closely by all Gold Star families who have a right to make their voices heardTrump did not immediately respond to Mondays letter from the families He previously hit back at criticism from the Khan family saying he had made a lot of sacrifices  I work very very hard Ive created thousands and thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobsHowever he tweeted about Khizr Khan on Monday morningTrump also took to Twitter Sunday to defend past statements about Islam terrorism and his record on the war in IraqTrumps comments have sparked a firestorm on social media and forced some GOP grandees to criticize the Republican nomineeHis own running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence issued a statement Sunday saying he and Trump believe that Capt Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family like all Gold Star families should be cherished by every AmericanOther Republican leaders have also weighed inUnacceptable doesnt even begin to describe it said Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who unsuccessfully opposed Trump for the Republican nominationThis is going to a place where weve never gone before to push back against the families of the fallen he said in a statement There used to be some things that were sacred in American politics  that you dont do  like criticizing the parents of a fallen soldier even if they criticize you Ghazala Khan also addressed Trumps comments in an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Sunday writing Here is my answer to Donald Trump Because without saying a thing all the world all America felt my pain I am a Gold Star mother Whoever saw me felt me in their heartShe added Donald Trump said I had nothing to say I do My son Humayun Khan an Army captain died 12 years ago in Iraq He loved America where we moved when he was 2 years oldThe emotional piece recounts how she and her husband worried about their middle sons safety when he was called to fight in IraqWe asked if there was some way he could not go because he had already done his service He said it was his duty she wroteShe also addressed his comments about Muslims and sacrifice stating When Donald Trump is talking about Islam he is ignorantGhazala Khan added Donald Trump said he has made a lot of sacrifices He doesnt know what the word sacrifice meansOn Friday she explained to MSNBCs Lawrence ODonnell that she was anxious during her husbands speech knowing her sons photo would appear behind herIt was very nervous because I cannot see my sons picture and I cannot even come in the room where his pictures are and thats why when I saw the picture on my back I couldnt take it And I controlled myself at that time so it is very hard she saidKhizr Khan told ODonnell that he could not have appeared at the DNC without his wifes close supportSpeaking to NBCs TODAY on Monday Khan said he was also grateful for an outpouring of support he had received in the wake of his speech He had received many emails full of assurances that I am right  that we are rightOn Sunday Khan told Meet the Press that we have a candidate without a moral compass without empathy for its citizensWe dont take these values lightly he said We are testament to the goodness of this country We experience the goodness of this country every dayHe also responded to a Trump campaign statement saying the candidate he believes Capt Khan is a hero to our countryWhile he appreciated the clarification Khan added that it sounds so disingenuous because of his policies because of his rhetoric of hatred of derision of dividing us And that is why I implored him to read the Constitution
