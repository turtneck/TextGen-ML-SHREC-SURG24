CNN Sen John McCain is chastising GOP leaders for failing to embrace Donald Trump as the choice of millions of voters laying out his most extensive views to date about Trump at the top of the ticket Hes also repudiating some of the presumptive nominees comments  particularly about prisoners of warIn a wideranging State of the Union interview in his campaign office in Phoenix McCain criticized party leaders who are reluctant to back Trump saying they are out of step with voters who have chosen the controversial businessman as the GOP standardbearer He defended Trump for being a strong and capable leader particularly on foreign policy He called on Trump to choose a running mate who could unite the party possibly Iowa Sen Joni Ernst even as he strongly defended his 2008 choice of Sarah PalinBut he also urged Trump to retract his criticisms of prisoners of war while blasting Trumps personal attacks during the primary campaign as offputtingFrankly I have never seen the personalization of a campaign like this one where peoples integrity and character are questioned said McCain the veteran senator of nearly 30 years and his partys 2008 presidential nominee It bothers me a lot Because you can almost violently disagree with an issue but to attack their character and their integrity  then those wounds take a long time to healAsked if Trump should continue calling Hillary Clinton corrupt Hillary McCain said Well I wouldnt but Im not one to tell him how to campaign except on the part of uniting the partyMcCain 79 said hed back the nominee since GOP voters have had their sayYou have to draw the conclusion that there is some distance if not a disconnect between party leaders and members of Congress and the many voters who have selected Donald Trump to be the nominee of the party McCain said when asked about the comments by House Speaker Paul Ryan and his close friend Sen Lindsey Graham both of whom have so far refused to back TrumpYou have to listen to people that have chosen the nominee of our Republican Party McCain said I think it would be foolish to ignore themAt the same time McCain would not commit to appearing on the same campaign stage as Trump a tacit acknowledgment of the balancing act the Arizona senator needs to perform as he faces reelection this fall He needs to court Trump backers in a state that the candidate handily won during the primary season while also reaching out to independents Latinos and women voters  many of whom view the real estate mogul unfavorablyA lot of things would have to happen McCain said when asked if he would stump with his partys nominee He said thered have to be a condition first I think its important for Donald Trump to express his appreciation for veterans not John McCain but veterans who were incarcerated as prisoners of warMcCain was referring to Trumps jawdropping comment last year on POWs when he said I like people that werent capturedId like to see him retract that statement Not about me but about the others said McCain who was captured and tortured by the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam WarAsked if hed like Trump to retract his statements that many undocumented Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals McCain was more circumspectOh I dont know McCain said I think that its important that we understand the importance of the Hispanic vote in America Many states  in Arizona more than 50 of the kids in school are Hispanic After the 2012 election as you know we laid out a blueprint and part of it was outreach to the Hispanic community I think we ought to recognize that the Republican Party has to do thatDespite having a friendly relationship with Hillary Clinton when the two served together in the Senate McCain was sharply critical of the likely Democratic nominee saying she would run a feckless foreign policy in the mold of Barack Obama Trump he said would provide a much stronger dose of American leadership around the worldWell I think American leadership he emphasizes that and I think thats important McCain said when asked what specifically he likes about Trumps foreign policy platform This president doesnt want to lead Hillary Clinton was secretary of state for four years  tell me one accomplishment that she can point to besides she flew more miles than any other secretary of state in historyAs a leading defense hawk McCain the Senate Armed Services Chairman said he wanted to use his influence to steer Trump and the party toward Ronald Reagans view of national securityAsked if he had confidence that Trump could be like Reagan McCain said I think that he could be a capable leader I dont think anybody is  no one could compare to Ronald Reagan because he was the right man at the right timeStill McCain is worried that Trumps toxicity among Latinos could hurt him in his tough reelection race where hes expected to face Democratic Rep Ann Kirkpatrick in the fall campaignThere is a Hispanic vote which I have to continue my good relationship with because of the turmoil that exists in the whole national campaign McCain said adding that every incumbent has to recognize the great turmoil that exists partly because of Trumps rhetoric and hardline immigration positionsAsked if the Trump effect was good or bad for him in the fall McCain said I dont think he affects it I think that with 100 name ID people know me but having said that there is turmoil out there as we just discussedGiven his long service on Capitol Hill McCain knows full well that being an incumbent is a vulnerability with the approval rating of Congress at rockbottomAnybody in this environment that would take a reelection in stride or for granted does not have an appreciation for the tumult thats out there amongst the electorate and Im confident of victory but to take anything for granted would be foolish
