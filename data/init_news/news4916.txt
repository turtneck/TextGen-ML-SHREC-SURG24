posted by Eddie Mandatory vaccinations are about to open up a new frontier for government control Through the war on drugs bureaucrats arbitrarily dictate what people can and cant put into their bodies but that violation pales in comparison to forcibly medicating millions against their will Voluntary and informed consent are essential in securing individual rights and without it selfownership will never be respected The liberal stronghold of California is trailblazing the encroaching new practice and recently passed laws mandating that children and adults must have certain immunizations before being able to attend schools or work in certain professions The longstanding religious and philosophical exemptions that protect freedom of choice have been systematically crushed by the state Californias Senate Bill 277 went into effect on July 1st 2016 and marked the most rigid requirements ever instituted for vaccinations The law forces students to endure a total of 40 doses to complete the 10 federally recommended vaccines while allowing more to be added at any time Any family that doesnt go along will have their child barred from attending licensed day care facilities inhome daycares public or private schools and even after school programs Over the years California has developed a reputation for pushing vaccines on their youth Assembly Bill 499 was passed in 2011 and lowered the age of consent for STD prevention vaccines to just 12 years old Included in the assortment of shots being administered was the infamous Gardasil  which just a few years later was at the center of a lawsuit that yielded the victims a 6 million settlement from the US government which paid out funds from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  The Vaccinate All Children Act of 2015 is an attempt to implement this new standard nationwide and although it has stalled in the House it will likely be reintroduced the next time the country is gripped by the fear of a pandemic The debate surrounding vaccinations is commonly framed as a moral struggle between the benefits to the collective and the selfish preferences of the individual But since the outbreak scares of Zika  measles  and ebola  the rhetoric has taken a turn toward authoritarianism Its commonly stated by the CDC and most mainstream doctors that the unvaccinated are putting the health of everyone else at risk but the truth isnt so black and white  The herd immunity theory has been consistently used to validate the expansion of vaccine programs but it still doesnt justify the removal of choice from the individual The classic exchange of freedom for perceived safety is a no brainer for the millions of Americans who are willing to use government to strap their neighbors down and forcibly inject them for the greater good Anyone who expresses concern about possible side effects is immediately branded as conspiratorial or antiscience Yet controversial claims that certain vaccine variants cause neurological disorders like autism have led some people to swear off inoculations altogether This allornothing dynamic has completely polarized the issue and prevents any reasonable discussion from taking place Either you accept all of the CDCs recommended 69 doses of 16 vaccines between birth and age 18 or you want to bring back measles polio and probably the black plague On the other extreme side of the debate if you fail to acknowledge all vaccines as dangerous youre an ignorant sheep Through the internet disinformation has become widespread and created a movement of people that have written off all the benefits accomplished through immunizations These individuals are unable or unwilling to separate the science from the shady institutions that develop and distribute new vaccines Even if thimerosal and mercury based preservatives cause adverse reactions in some patients it doesnt detract from the advantages vaccine technology provides In this debate like most others in the US both sides are swept up in emotion and ignorance Regardless the publics trust in vaccinations has been eroded by the reputations of those companies producing them Pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Pfizer make billions from the distribution of these shots and the potential profits after a mandate are enough to corrupt the morals of almost anyone In one example former CDC director Dr Julie Gerberding left her post at the government agency in 2009 to work in Mercks vaccine division An investigative report published by the British Medical Journal last year found the CDC downplays its ties to the pharmaceutical industry Further by buying the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton  who received more donations from pharmaceutical companies and their employees than any other candidate this year  these huge companies are able to expand their influence in directing government policy  Maintaining control over what we put into our own bodies is a fundamental right but for now standing up to these government decrees only means ostracism from the education system and criticism from peers In the future however the punishments for disobedience will likely only grow stricter An Orange County doctor named Bob Sears is already in the crosshairs of Californias medical board after excusing a twoyearold from future vaccinations The mother expressed concern that her daughter had an adverse reaction to a previous shot describing the child as becoming limp like a ragdoll for 24 hours after the last dose Dr Sears alternative treatment recommendations break from the rules dictated by SB 277 and now his reputation as well as his career are in jeopardy This new authority to strip doctors of their medical licenses for simply going against the stateimposed standards opens the door for the persecution of medical professionals who resist any government regulation A vaccination is an invasive medical procedure that can have different effects on each and every individual The Nuremberg Codes first principle is voluntary consent but it seems the lessons of history have been completely forgotten by todays leaders The transition of these shots from recommended to required is well underway and those who think the ends justify the means are willing to forcibly make sure everyone else complies The new benchmark set by California symbolizes a precedent that could be mimicked across the nation Without having the discretion to choose which medications are injected into your body  or your childs  how can anyone convince themselves they are free This overreach and collusion can often be dismissed as a trivial issue but the fact that voluntary consent is under attack speaks volumes to the extent that state power has metastasized source
