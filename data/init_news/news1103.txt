Trump who has shaken off several highprofile controversies that would have ended other presidential campaigns faced an immediate backlash from advocacy groups and members of his own party distanced themselves from the GOP frontrunner The incident recalls Trumps 2011 quest to challenge Obama on where he was born which ended with Obama releasing his longform birth certificate It also follows a debate performance Wednesday that garnered mixed reviews for the billionaire businessmanWe have a problem in this country Its called Muslims an unidentified man who spoke at a questionandanswer town hall event in Rochester New Hampshire asked the mogul at a rally Thursday night You know our current president is one You know hes not even an AmericanA seemingly bewildered Trump interrupted the man chuckling We need this question This is the first questionAnyway we have training camps growing where they want to kill us the man wearing a Trump Tshirt continued Thats my question When can we get rid of themWere going to be looking at a lot of different things Trump replied You know a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening Were going to be looking at that and many other things The real estate mogul did not correct the questioner about his claims about Obama before moving on to another audience member White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest condemned the remarks Friday but added Is anybody really surprised that this happened at a Donald Trump rally The audience members comments and Trumps response were quickly denounced by Democrats Hillary Clinton the partys frontrunner for president personally tweeted late Thursday that Trumps remarks were just plain wrong and followed up on it Friday morning at a press conference I was appalled Clinton said bluntly to a question from CNNs Suzanne Malveaux Not only was it out of bounds it was untrue He should have from the beginning corrected that kind of rhetoric that level of hatefulness Rep Keith Ellison the first Muslim elected to Congress called the incident a sign of a lack of moral courage I dont know if Trump is using dogwhistle politics to win support in the polls or if he genuinely believes the racist things he says Either way he showed a complete lack of moral courage in that clip and he has shown once again that he completely unqualified to be President of the United States GOP frontrunner Donald Trumps racism knows no bounds This is certainly horrendous but unfortunately unsurprising given what we have seen already The vile rhetoric coming from the GOP candidates is appalling Schultz said Republicans should be ashamed and all Republican presidential candidates must denounce Trumps comments immediately or will be tacitly agreeing with him READ Chris Christie I would have said Obama is Christian After the event several reporters asked Trump why he didnt challenge the questioners assertions Trump did not answer But Corey Lewandowski Trumps campaign manager later told CNN that the candidate did not hear the question about Obama being a Muslim All he heard was a question about training camps which he said we have to look into Lewandowski said The media want to make this an issue about Obama but its about him waging a war on Christianity Trump announced Friday that he would cancel his trip to South Carolina citing a significant business transaction New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said Friday that he would not lecture Trump on how to respond to comments like that but said that leaders are responsible for correcting voters on certain issues Ill tell you what I would do and I wouldnt have permitted that if someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine I would have said No listen Before we answer lets clear some things up for the rest of the audience And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that Christie said on NBCs TODAY Friday RELATED Misperceptions persist about Obamas faith but arent so widespread Obama who has spoken openly about his Christian faith was born to an American mother and Kenyan father in Hawaii But Trump has been one of the leading skeptics of Obamas birthplace saying he did not know where Obama was born as recently as July A recent CNNORC poll found 29 of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim including 43 of Republicans Trump is not the first Republican candidate to raise eyebrows over comments involving Obama and his ethnic and religious background In February Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker became embroiled in a brief controversy when he told The Washington Post that he didnt know if Obama was a Christian Ive never asked him that Walker said A spokeswoman later clarified that he did believe Obama was Christian but disagreed with the medias obsession with gotcha questions And in 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain was booed after he famously told an audience member at a campaign event that Obama was a good family man Hes a decent family man  a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues McCain said then Thats what this campaign is all about
