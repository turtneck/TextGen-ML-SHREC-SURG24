When Henry Adams wrote in the early 20th century that politics as a practice whatever its professions had always been the systematic organization of hatreds there was ample reason to take him literallyThe world back then was on the verge of a cataclysmic war that would kill 17 million people and help incubate both communism and fascism Adams had come of age in London as the son of the American ambassador under President Abraham Lincoln a man who knew all too well how political disputes can turn bloody And Adams greatgrandfather the second president of the United States was accused by Thomas Jeffersons supporters during the famously acrimonious 1800 election of having among many other unpleasant things a hideous hermaphroditical characterSo maybe the one positive of the 2016 version of American political hatred is that it probably wont make people work double shifts down at the morgue But everything else about this repellant contest between the two most reviled majorparty nominees in modern history points to an alarming resurgence of that foul and dangerous defect of judgment known as collectivismWhen we hear the c word nowadays its usually in the context of Stalins agricultural fiveyear plans or the rahrah slogans on 1930s posters But theres another more personal meaning of the term that has dwindled in usage even while its application to majorparty politics seems to ratchet up each cycle And that is treating the disparate individuals within any given bloc as sharing a collective set of characteristics intentions and pathologies Its what Hillary Clinton meant with basket of deplorables its what Donald Trump has done with Mexican heritage and its variants and its all too often the nightstick that our friends and loved ones grab for when talking about politics in a presidential yearWhat makes the Democratic version of collective antipathy particularly noxious is the fact that it often comes disguised as a treacly appeal to unity Trump wants to divide us Clinton lamented at the Democratic National Convention We have to heal the divides in our countryAnd that starts with listening listening to each other Trying as best we can to walk in each others shoesUnless of course you have or work with large amounts of money Wall Street corporations and the superrich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes Clinton thundered later in the same speech If companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas well make them pay us backClintons vanquished Democratic opponent the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is even more tineared about his own hypocrisy This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions Sanders said in his convention speech Not just bombast not just fearmongering not just name calling and divisiveness But a few minutes later Sanders engaged in some bombastic fearmongering of his own bemoaning that the wealthiest people in America like the billionaire Koch brothersspend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and in the process undermine American democracy David Koch is a trustee of Reason Foundation which publishes this magazineClintons most controversial instance of Othering during this season came at a September fundraiser in New York where she said to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobicyou name itNow some of those folks they are irredeemable but thankfully they are not America While the irredeemable and unAmerican twists were new as was the memorable metaphor Clintons behindcloseddoors sentiment only mirrored what the Democratic nominee has said routinely throughout this dreary campaignAt an October 2015 Democratic presidential primary debate Clinton was asked by moderator Anderson Cooper Which enemy are you most proud of Her reply after some throatclearing Probably the Republicans Some people laughed but it wasnt really a joke When Vox Editor in Chief Ezra Klein asked Clinton nine months later whether she regretted the remark she said Not very much adding You know they say terrible things about me much worse than anything Ive ever said about them That just seems to be part of the political back and forth nowto appeal to your base to appeal to the ideologues who support you We have become so divided Do tellThe best that you can say about Hillary Clintons collectivismand the Democratic habit of mind that accepts and repeats such formulations unblinkinglyis that at least the deplorables chose their own status whether through true bigotry or mere party membership Donald Trumps Others by contrast are often born that wayIn June Trump told The Wall Street Journal that District Judge Gonzalo Curiel who was presiding over a case involving the failed Trump University should have been disqualified by his Mexican heritage Im building a wall the eventual GOP nominee explained Its an inherent conflict of interestIn a followup interview Face the Nations John Dickerson asked Trump to clarify what exactly the Mexican parents of an Indianaborn judge had to do with Curiels adverse rulings in the case Excuse me I want to build a wall Trump shot back I mean I dont think its very confusingHas nothing to do with anything except common sense You know we have to stop being so politically correct in this countryGross generalizations and shorthand stereotypes often make senseuntil they dont On the playgrounds and in the popular culture of my youth Mexicans were lazy Poles were stupid and queers were people who youd smear on a football field because they were so weak Now Mexicans are uniquely industrious Poles win Nobel prizes and the buffest guy at the gym is probably gay The same thing Donald Trump now says about the Chinese the entire political and journalistic class was saying about the Japanese in the 1980s Yes facts on the ground change but stereotypes often recede when the dominant culture recognizes them as reductionist shameful even ridiculousReverting to that kind of collectivism assigning negative value indiscriminately across an entire population feels retrograde in a country so steeped in individualistic ethos Once we start dismissing 20 percent of the population or 47 percent as with Mitt Romney particularly in a discussion involving politics we are playing with fire Determinism when wedded to state power has produced some of the worst moments in American historyAyn Rands writing on this is hard to top Like every form of determinism Rand wrote in The Virtue of Selfishness racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species his rational faculty Racism negates two aspects of mans life reason and choice or mind and morality replacing them with chemical predestinationThe problem isnt just racisms malign effects on the recipient It also has rotting effects on the intellect of the originator Like every other form of collectivism racism is a quest for the unearned Rand wrote It is a quest for automatic knowledgefor an automatic evaluation of mens characters that bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgmentAmerican political discourse in 2016 too is about bypassing the responsibility of judgment and trying to bludgeon people into line through insult comedy Heres hoping that more and more of our fellow citizens will refuse to take the politicians bait And that Hillary Clinton starts reading some Ayn Rand
