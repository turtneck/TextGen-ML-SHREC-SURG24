He had alsovividly shown his colorsat that point with his daily evocation on the stump of Bowe Bergdahl whom he called a dirty rotten traitor who would have been summarily executed back in the day when we were strong He promised to make our military so strong our heads would spin and he declared himself a big second amendment person He promised to renegotiate deals with every country in the world to get a better result for America although he was vague about exactly what that meant beyond complaining about all the foreign cars he allegedly sees coming off of ships in American portsFrom the beginning Trump has said that we dont have time to be politically correct anymore that our problems are so severe that we have to do whatever is necessary to make America great again He has not hidden his intentions But now that he has been a national frontrunner for more than six months perhaps its time to revisit this subject and look at his agenda as hes unveiled it since last summerFirst on the deportation issue When asked how he would go about it he has said that he would havea deportation forceto find detain and repatriate suspected undocumented immigrants and their children some of whom are Americans but hed fix that too When quizzed in the debateshe had this to sayto John Kasichs assertion that deporting all these millions of people is not a serious proposalAll I can say is youre lucky in Ohio that you struck oil Thats for one thing Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower good president great president People liked him I like Ike right the expression I like Ike Moved 15 million illegal immigrants out of this country Moved them just beyond the border They came back Moved them again beyond the border They came back Didnt like it Moved them way south They never came back Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower good president great president People liked him I like Ike right the expression I like Ike Moved 15 million illegal immigrants out of this country Moved them just beyond the border They came back Moved them again beyond the border They came back Didnt like it Moved them way south They never came backHe of course plans to eventually build a wall so high that nobody can climb over it apparently enlisting Jack and his magic beanstalk for engineering advice But that comment was no joke Hes talking about the infamous Operation Wetback And people never came back because theyd been left in the middle of the desert without water and diedAfter Paris and San Bernardino his authoritarianism took another dark turnHis famous statementthat the US should ban all Muslims from entering the country until we find out what the hell is going on was actually the culmination of a number of comments indicating that there could bea registry of Muslimsandsurveillance of mosquesand other places where one might find American Muslims In other words everywhere He reiterated thestandard fatuous right wing bromideabout arming everyone so that they could shoot down terrorists before they have a chance to explode their suicide vests Andhe enthusiastically endorsed torture and not just for interrogation purposes but as a punitive measureWould I approve waterboarding You bet your ass I would  in a heartbeat Trump said to loud cheers during a rally at a convention center here Monday night that attracted thousands And I would approve more than that Dont kid yourself folks It works okay It works Only a stupid person would say it doesnt work Trump said such techniques are needed to confront terrorists who chop off our young peoples heads and build these iron cages and theyll put 20 people in them and they drop them in the ocean for 15 minutes and pull them up 15 minutes later It works Trump said over and over again Believe me it works And you know what If it doesnt work they deserve it anyway for what theyre doing It worksWhen discussing what he would do withthe familiesof suspected terrorists he was a bit more vague but when you consider his other commentary the implication is clearHe has a fantasyabout the wives of the 911 hijackers having foreknowledge of the attacks and tuning in onTV with their children to watch daddy fly into the World Trade Center Except for the fact that the hijackers werent married and had no kids it would be an interesting taleHe has also blamed San Bernardino terrorist Sayed Farooks mother and sistersuggestingthe government need to get tough to deal with themWe better get a little tough and a little smart or were in trouble And hesopenly said he would commit war crimesand explicitly target the families of suspected ISIS terrorists Were fighting a very politically correct war And the other thing with the terrorists  you have to take out their families When you get these terrorists you have to take out their families They care about their lives dont kid yourselves They say they dont care about their lives But you have to take out their families On the domestic front Trump has made it very very clear that in addition to his deportation force he believes the country needs to allow the police agenciesmuch more latitude Were going to get you know the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes Theyre going to be out so fast One of the first thing Im going to do is get rid of those gang members Were going to be  you know you look at whats going on with Baltimore you look at whats going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St Louis the other night We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin You know we can be very tough I just met your cops outside Those police are tough cookies Those guys  we need law and order We need law and order I mean they allowed  in one night that first night in Baltimore  they allowed that city to be destroyed And they set it back 35 years One night Because the police were not allowed to protect people They werent allowed to protect people We have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be  the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know Originally from New York Hes a phenomenal guy He can stop things if theyre allowed to stop them He can stop it Believe me He has never explained exactly what he means when he says he plans to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin but evoking his relationship close to Chicagos police chief might be a clue He exhorts citizensto spy on each other and report activities to the authorities Andhe made a solemn pledge to police everywhere One of the first things Id do in terms of executive order if I win will be to sign a strong strong statement that would go out to the country out to the world anybody killing a police man a police woman a police officer anybody killing a police officer the death penalty is going to happen Considering the summary execution pantomime he does on the trail every day when he talks about Bowe Bergdahl its fair to assume he has some ideas about how that might be handled FinallyTrump has welcomed the approbation of Vladimir Putin Russias authoritarianstrongman leader even going so far as to defend him against charges that he has killed journalists who challenged him He has joked that he wouldnt kill any journalists himself well probably I hate some of these people I hate em Trump told the crowd I would never kill them I would never do that Then he decided to reconsider Uh lets see uh he said aloud his voice rising No I would never do that Trumps comments on journalists came after he spoke about Russian President Vladimir Putin who lavished Trump with praise last week Claims that Putin ordered the killings of Russian journalists are welldocumented but Trump has argued that those deaths are disputed and without evidence Trump did charge once again that some of the reporters in the back of the room are such lying disgusting people but as the crowd turned to angrily face those reporters Trump pulled them back This past weekTrump spoke admiringly of another despot North Koreas Kim Jong Un Youve got to give him credit How many young guys  he was like 26 or 25 when his father died  take over these tough generals and all of a sudden you know its pretty amazing when you think of it How does he do that Even though it is a culture and its a culture thing he goes in he takes over hes the boss Its incredible I mean its amazing that a young guy would go over and take over You know you would have thought that these tough generals would have said no way this is gonna happen when the father died So hes gotta have something going for him because he kept control which is amazing for a young person to do He did say Kim was a total nut job but its fairly obvious Trump doesnt see that as much of a problem Hes the boss and he kept control and that is what Trump sees as true leadership He figures that just as he would get along well with Putin he and Kim Jong Un could forge and understanding They all have a lot in common And millions of freedom loving Republicans think thats just terrific His poll numbers have never gone down since he threw his hat in the ring last June They arent backing him because hes promising to shrink the government or lower taxes or create jobs He very rarely even brings such issues up What he talks about on the stump is how popular he is how much money he has and how hard he will bring the hammer down on all the bad people who are making America not so great And he will have so many victories theyll be coming out of your ears He will do all this because all it takes is being tough and smart and having a proper disdain for political correctness  formerly known as democracy the constitution and the rule of law
