REPORT Megyn Trashes Trump Newt Then Murdoch Announces Replacements Are Available Amazing how many addresses you get from Google Going again until Saturday and all next week BAAHAA BAAHAA He then tagged someone else  its unclear if that was just to alert them to the post or to let them know that he voted for them After his posts where he laughed and boasted about committing voter fraud Dougherty apologized on Facebook I apologize for the insensitive post Lesson learned about my stupidity Its difficult to say whether Dougherty apologized because he didnt do it and had made a stupid joke or if he was simply trying to avoid being prosecuted Although we cant tell for sure right now whats true here Doughertys comments at the very least are a reminder of how important voter ID laws are If everyone were required to present identification to vote Dougherty wouldnt have made his joke about how easy it was to commit voter fraud  and if he actually tried to do what he boasted about on Facebook voter ID laws would stop such a thing For all we know Dougherty may not even be a Clinton supporter he could have been trying to make a point about voter fraud and the dirty tricks committed by Democrats Doubtful but who knows No matter what his party affiliation or whether or not he actually did what he boasted about he intentionally or not made the case for strong voter ID laws Share this post on Facebook and Twitter so people can see how this man showed the importance of voter ID laws What do you think about Doughertys Facebook posts Scroll down to comment below Advertisement Popular Right Now
