Our fight for LGBT equality is not nearly over Senator Kirsten Gillibrand DNY stated emphatically in an interview with me last week on SiriusXM Progress And Im hopeful very hopeful that the Supreme Court will say its unconstitutional to ban gay marriage But thats really just the beginning of fighting for our rights We have to actually make sure all LGBT couples can have full parenting rights have full social security and other federal benefit rights We want to make sure companies cant discriminate against members of the community because of who they love and who they are And its really important to take on discrimination wherever it existsToward that end Gillibrand last week reintroduced the Every Child Deserve a Family Act which she originally introduced in 2013 and which would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation Though Gillibrand says shes seeking bipartisan support in the Senate and will continue speaking with Republicans so far cosponsors include a handful of fellow Democrats such as openly lesbian Sen Tammy Baldwin DWis and Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass and independent Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders who is running for the Democratic nomination for the presidencyOnly seven states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in adoption and only five explicitly ban discrimination in foster care Gillibrand said in the interview So we have a long way to go We only have a few states protecting LGBT parents The reality is there are two million LGBT individuals and families that are willing and able to take on these parenting obligations to adopt these children or foster these children who desperately need it Unfortunately there are 400000 children in the US foster care system today and more than 20000 of them are going to ageout before finding a permanent home So we should be caring for these kids We should give them the loving families they deserveThe bill if it becomes law would only affect those agencies that take federal money and they are free to optout from receiving fundsIf youre getting the benefit of federal funds you cant discriminate Gillibrand said Its unconstitutional and you should not be able to use our taxpayer dollars to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation and who they love So I think its important we fight against it particularly when our taxpayer dollars are being usedThis legislation would prohibit adoption agencies and foster care agencies including religious adoption agencies and foster care agencies from providing services in many cases Lori Windham Senior Counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty told the Catholic news agency EWTN News Peter Sprigg senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council is quoted in the same article saying there are unique problems with allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children Claiming there is overwhelming evidence while not citing any studies Sprigg said I think its legitimate to disfavor them or to exclude them altogether
