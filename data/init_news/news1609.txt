Terrorism Threat Trump is Right  Profile Profile Profile Written by Selwyn Duke Email You do it I do it He does it She does it The guy down the block does it Everyone engages in profiling  continually For example if you see a bunch of roughhewn young men walking down the block and you move to the other side if you patronize the deli with the cleancut guy behind the counter and not the one with the tattooed bodypierced greasyhaired Greenwich Village retread or prefer a 50yearold school bus driver for your child to a 22yearold one youve engaged in profiling How about when a mother would choose a 17yearold girl to babysit her child but definitely not a 17yearold boy because most child molestation is committed by males Is that fair After all just as most Muslims dont engage in terrorism most young men dont molest children But lifes not fair And anyone who thinks a profile is invalidated simply because most members of the group in question dont conform to it doesnt understand profiling As Dr Walter Williams has put it profiling is a method by which we can make decisions based on scant information when the cost of obtaining more information would be too high For example since you cant spend a month living with a prospective babysitter getting to know him personally we have to use an observable or known physical attribute as a proxy or estimator of some other unobservable or unknown attribute as Williams has put it  Its the same with airport security where thousands of people must be screened within a short time And doctors profile too to use some examples Williams has cited black men have a prostate cancer rate twice that of white men physicians check women and not men for breast cancer even though men occasionally develop it and recommend prostate exams for men over 40 but not for 25yearolds When a doctor does this is he guilty of racism sexism and ageism What all this reflects is simply the reality of diversity And given that criminality isnt the one area of life where differences among groups suddenly cease to exist its not surprising that authorities instead of checking their brain at the door also use profiling In their realm the practice is used to determine the probability that a given individual has committed a crime or has criminal intent And a profile can include many factors For example Im a member of perhaps the most profiled group in the nation  men  who police view more suspiciously than women because men commit an inordinate portion of the crime Young people are also viewed more suspiciously for the same reason Aside from sex and age other factors in a criminal profile can pertain to dress behavior the car being driven whether a person is out of place in a given neighborhood and many other things  including race ethnicity and religion And this is where we have to be careful not to descend into prejudice and unjust discrimination Of course we have to know what that would be Heres a good example if you bat not an eye at profiling men or young people but then complain about profiling Muslims or blacks youre prejudiced If you insist that considering racial factors is racism but dont call the profiling of men and the young sexism and ageism youre prejudiced And if after having been made aware of this double standard you persist in it you are practically speaking a bad person This point cannot be made often enough There are only two kinds of profiling Good profiling and bad profiling Good profiling considers all relevant factors in accordance with legitimate criminological science bad profiling does not Yet propagandists and the genuinely misguided have convinced people that the truth is precisely the opposite of what it is that not cherrypicking  refusing to exclude certain relevant racial factors from a profile  is socalled racial profiling and is wrong They descend into further inanity in claiming that profiling Muslims is racial profiling even though Islam is not a race I wrote certain relevant racial factors because the antiprofiling crew has no problem profiling whites For example we often hear that mass shooters are inordinately white the kicker here is that this is untrue  As I demonstrated in 2014 by analyzing data provided by leftwing site Mother Jones  whites commit mass shootings in accordance with their overall percentage of the population interestingly the only group overrepresented in this category was Americans of Asian descent This brings us to another point leftists engage in profiling no less than anyone else They just do it all wrong Consider immediately following the 2015 San Bernardino shooting MSNBC suggested it might have been perpetrated by prolifers profile white Christians CNN opined that it could have been the handiwork of militia types profile white Christians Of course probability dictated the culprits were precisely who they turned out to be Muslims This brings us to the last point the Left engages in projection when it complains that comprehensive profiling reflects prejudice and unjust discrimination In reality the Lefts profiling is all about prejudice and unjust discrimination As Dictionarycom informs  a prejudice is an unfavorable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge thought or reason The assumption that the San Bernardino terrorists were Muslim wasnt a prejudice but simply a reflection of criminological knowledge Likewise that 87 percent of those targeted by the NYC polices stopandfrisk program were black or Hispanic didnt reflect prejudice but the reality that 96 percent of all crimes in NYC are committed by blacks and Hispanics In contrast the Lefts profiling is not about scientific correctness but political correctness not about what a group does but what it is  Can a group be profiled Christians yes Muslims no Whites yes blacks no Men yes women no Heterosexuals yes homosexuals no It is all prejudice all of the time Unfortunately none of the arguments above no matter how well or how often stated will do anything to purge this leftist prejudice To paraphrase satirist Jonathan Swift You cannot reason a man out of a position he has not reasoned himself into Leftists are divorced from Truth and operate based on feelings and a misbegotten emotional attachment cannot be remedied with an intellectual approach Instead political correctness must die Until exhibiting such means what speaking the Truth does now  scorn ostracism and career destruction  until it is rooted out from the cultureshaping media academia and entertainment well be left with the Lefts profiling and not the right profiling How could this be accomplished By counteracting the social code of political correctness and its attendant social pressure with social pressure designed to deny posturing leftists their illusory high ground turn a source of moral preening into a source of shame To oppose proper profiling is to harm our society To support unjust double standards in profiling is to be prejudiced And doing this even after hearing the truth is to be a bad person  follow him on Twitter or log on to SelwynDukecom Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment Thank you for
