Stanley Friedman was shot at The ship he was on was attacked by enemy bombers He saw a landmine blow apart a truck carrying two dozen of his fellow soldiers One of them died in his armsBut after he came home from World War II he found himself embroiled in another battle  this time with the Veterans Administration as he tried to get his benefitsIn the decades that followed the war Friedman suffered from anxiety depression and nightmares which lasted his entire life affecting his job and his familyYet as he sought treatment and benefits the Veterans Administration told him the military records documenting his service couldnt be found Despite the fact Friedman knew very specific details of the dates and places he experienced the most traumatic events there was no proof so he wasnt entitled to benefits the VA saidI have a huge box of letters that he sent to the VA over the years in his attempt to get benefits said Friedmans wife of 61 years Minna Rae He tried over and over and over again to get help but they just kept turning him downFriedman  who as he would later learn suffered from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  was not aloneVeterans of all wars from World War II to the present are fighting similar battles to this day against the VA  now called the Department of Veterans Affairs  to prove their service and obtain benefits they believe they deserve and finding out that the VAs records are woefully incompleteThe John Marshall Law Schools Veterans Legal Support Center and Clinic which works to assist vets with legal and other issues has lists of former soldiers wrangling with the VA systemIts an issue many many vets have been suffering through for a long time including recent veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan said attorney James GarrettGarrett had been a lawyer with the firm DLA Piper Global in San Diego which has a division that takes on pro bono work assisting veterans The veteran support clinic emailed him in 2009 appealing for help for Friedman Garrett said he was stunned to learn that six decades after the war ended a soldier was still locked in battleI couldnt believe that after all this time a WWII veteran was still having trouble getting benefits he exclaimedFriedman was 89 years old at that timeGarrett and his team began making calls sending letters searching the Internet digging through documents and wading through reams of microfilm just trying to find anything that would prove Friedmans claimsFrustrating does not even begin to tell you the truth of the matter Ive found it incredibly unbelievable as a taxpayer the amount of bureaucracy and ineptitude that was occurring not only in Stanley Friedmans case but in other cases Garrett saidBrian Clauss who is executive director of the clinic at John Marshall said missing records are especially a problem for veterans who served before 1973 when a fire destroyed millions of files at the National Personnel Records Center in suburban St Louis MoNo duplicate copies of these records were ever maintained nor were microfilm copies produced said Clauss Neither were any indexes created prior to the fireA person would need to be a very good detective to come up with proof of service or experiencesIt can be particularly cruel  an elderly veteran has to reconstruct their service record Theyre forced to prove their qualifications Clauss saidIn addition to the fire Clauss said records may not have been well kept during combat situations especially if a person was injured and then evacuated It is emergency treatment under extreme conditions he explained It is war people are rushing through the chaos They dont keep detailed recordsCritics also claim the VA is antiquated and behind the times technologically and theres still a great deal of material on paper  and not enough staff to deal with it allThe VA did not respond to requests from Fox News for comment for this reportSince Friedmans case came to light theres been more attention paid to the problem of lost veteran records but it continues to be a serious issue for manyGarrett said veterans told him Everyone thought we were lying about things we said we had seen and experiencedOne Vietnam veteran who didnt want his name used said the more publicity we get for this problem the better  Americans need to know about itIn 2012 Garrett was able to locate some of Friedmans lost records And after three more years of legal wrangling with the VA offices Friedman was finally able to obtain benefits at the age of 92This validated him It completely changed our lives said Minna RaeOnce he got benefits Friedman had greater access to care which included longawaited therapy for PTSDWere very fortunate he lived long enough to get verification for his service because many other World War II vets died before that happened Minna Rae saidIn the final years of his life Stanley Friedman was eventually able to move to a veterans residence not far from his suburban Chicago home called the Green House homes at the Captain James A Lovell Federal Health Care CenterHe found peace among the caring staff and his fellow veteransFriedman died in his sleep there at the age of 94Ruth Ravve joined the
