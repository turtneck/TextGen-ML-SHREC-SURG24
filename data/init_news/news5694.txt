Clinton accepts the Democratic Partys nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28 The former first lady US senator and secretary of state was the first woman to lead the presidential ticket of a major political partyHillary Clinton meanwhile broke with Obama by uttering the words radical Islamism  rhetoric that she has long resisted for fear that it would embolden terroristsTerrorist attacks often have the potential to radically shift the political conversation Trumps proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigrants in the aftermath of the San Bernardino California attacks for instance deeply resonated with GOP primary voters But the responses this week  in which Trump and Clinton made moves that would have been unexpected a week ago  reflect the unusual confluence of gay rights gun control and national security in the wake of Orlando and underscore the volatile nature of American politics this yearNo one is more unusual at the moment than TrumpHe started the week by tearing up the Terrorism 101 rule book used by most politicians who go out of their way to foster unity in the wake of such an outrage Trump did the exact oppositeHours after Sundays attack unfolded he issued a selfcongratulatory tweet that noted his long stance that radical Islam leads to terrorism On Monday he implied Obama was somehow complicit or sympathetic toward the USborn Muslim who went on the rampage and later snatched away the campaign credentials of The Washington Post when it reported on his commentsTrump has never been known for consistency and demonstrated his ability to hold several contradictory positions on issues that motivate the Republican base at the same timeAfter the Orlando carnage Trump suggested that if the people in the nightclub had guns themselves the story could have been different And he stirred his audiences with false claims that Clinton wanted to take away Americans gunsBut then perhaps scenting a change in the political wind Trump said he would meet with the National Rifle Association to discuss how to stop people on the terror watch list or FBI nofly lists from buying guns in contradiction with previous Republican positions But during a Thursday rally in Dallas he again seemed to take a hard line on guns repeating his claim about Clinton and saying Im going to save your Second Amendment rightsTrump repeatedly claimed that he was the best friend the LGBT community has in this election  rather than Clinton who has been deeply engaged in LGBT issues for years and counts the community as a deep well of support and donor dollarsClinton could not resist trolling her general election foe when CNN reporter Phil Mattingly quoted Trump on Twitter as saying You tell me who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than Donald TrumpThe former secretary of states campaign account tweeted back HiTrump expounded further on his gun views Friday evening At a Texas rally Trump argued as he often has in the wake of terrorist attacks and mass shootings that fewer gun restrictions would have lessened the death tollIf we had people where the bullets were going in the opposite direction right smack between the eyes of this maniac Trump said gesturing between his eyes And this son of a b comes out and starts shooting and one of the people in that room happened to have a gun and goes boom You know what that would have been a beautiful beautiful sight folksTrump also slammed President Barack Obama for arguing for action to change existing gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting in OrlandoPresident Obama is trying to make terrorism into guns and its not guns folks It is not guns folks It is not guns this is terrorism Trump saidBut Trump was not the only politician pulling off a role reversal toward the gay communityIowa Rep Steve King who once warned his state could become a gay marriage Mecca after its Supreme Court lifted a ban on samesex marriage offered a striking shift in tone this weekI think it was clear that gays were targeted in Orlando and it does matter and its tragic that they were targeted because of their sexual orientation King told CNNs Chris Cuomo on New DayThat was a rare moment of conciliation in what was a largely divisive political weekIn fact the manner in which the Orlando attack immediately became political fodder contrasted with the numbing wave of shock that settled over the United Kingdom where campaigning for next weeks Europe Union referendum was put on hold after the murder of lawmaker Jo CoxTrump and Clinton were hardly alone in the political fray this weekWith seven months left in his term Obama could have left it to the newly minted Democratic presumptive nominee to carry the fight to Trump But he felt a need to respond  especially to Trumps commentsThats not the America we want he said during an extraordinarily direct speech on Tuesday It doesnt reflect our democratic ideals It will make us less safeBy wading so deeply into the presidential race Obama was offering a preview of the kind of political assist he could provide Clinton as he hits the campaign trail soon as a surrogate But on Tuesday at least Obama completely overshadowed his preferred successorThe normal order is also disrupted on Capitol HillRepublican leaders are stuck in an uncomfortable marriage with their cantlivewithhim cantlivewithouthim presidential nominee who is showing no signs of cooling the polarizing rhetoric that many GOP elites decryLawmakers normally attracted to microphones like bees around a honey pot spent the week fleeing in the opposite direction House Speaker Paul Ryan endured the latest round of questions about whether he would withdraw his recent endorsement of TrumpRyan tried to explain his dilemma in an interview that will air on NBCs Meet the Press on SundayI get that this is a very strange situation Hes a very unique nominee Ryan said But I feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our partySanders is proving that piloting a soft landing to a political revolution is tough While he vowed on Thursday to help Clinton defeat Trump he still wants full reform of the Democratic Party and its policy platformStill there are signs that Sanders is losing his leverage not gaining it even one of his closest backers Rep Tulsi Gabbard signaled on Friday that the game was upI think there is a Democratic nominee at this point Gabbard told CNNs Wolf Blitzer though would not go as far as endorsing ClintonArizona Sen John McCain also felt the political heat when blasted Obama as directly responsible for the mass shooting in OrlandoThen like a character from a previous more courtly political age he had second thoughts and issued a statement that clarified that he meant that the Presidents policies were to blame  rather than the character of the man who beat him for the White House eight years agoA politician who admits he was wrong In the crazed world of the 2016 presidential election circus what could be weirder than that
