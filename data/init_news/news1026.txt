The simmering dispute over media access to Hillary Clintons presidential campaign erupted again Monday when a reporter for DailyMailcom was told by the campaign he couldnt attend her events in New HampshireDavid Martosko a reporter for DailyMailcom a website affiliated with the Daily Mail in London said the Clinton camp said his newspaper wasnt part of the official group  known as the print pool  that covers the White House on a rotating basis As a result he was blocked Monday from covering her events in person for the poolI got there when I was told to get there Martosko told Fox News Megyn Kelly Monday night Quarter to eight in the morning I showed up in the parking lot told them who I was and they said No you cant comeThis happened twice today Martosko told Kelly later in the interview I just came right over here from an evening event where Mrs Clinton was the keynote speaker  I showed up again and said Im the designated pool reporter and I was told you need to leave I find that unacceptable and offensive and I think most of my journalistic colleagues do as wellThe campaign said it is trying to resolve the issue However it denied any suggestion that Martosko was denied access because of his newspapers critical coverage of ClintonThe Daily Mail can sensationalize the incident as they see fit for their readers but thats what happened a Clinton aide told Fox NewsMajor media organizations in Clintons traveling press pool issued a statement Monday night defending Martosko and rejecting any attempt by the Clinton campaign to dictate who covers the candidateWe havent yet had a clear explanation about why the pool reporter for todays events was denied access said the statement signed by the Washington Post Wall Street Journal New York Times and Tribune Publishing as well as the Daily Mail and othersBut any attempt by the campaign to dictate who is in the pool is unacceptableThe pool in general is tightknit organization Martosko told The Kelly File Monday night And to a man and woman they all said No The Clinton campaign does not get to choose who covers themMost presidential campaigns essentially follow the procedures outlined by the White House Correspondents Association To accommodate the frequent media crush a newspaper reporter a photographer and a TV crew known as the pool covers an event Then the details are widely shared via email to reporters and othersHowever in covering Clinton a group of 14 news organizations including The New York Times and The Washington Post have formed to cover events and share the information on a limited basisGroup members argue that those who dont share the expenses of covering a campaign shouldnt have immediate access to the information or pool reportsStill this is not the first time a member affiliated with the foreign press has complained about being excluded from covering Clinton up closeMy feeling is that some people have established the rules and that we havent been part of the discussion a reporter for the French TV network Canal Plus recently told The Post I went to Iowa to cover Clintons first event I only saw her van  I am fighting for equality and access for allThe Clinton camp on Monday also said We have been working to create an equitable system and have had some concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being a part of the rotationA DailyMailcom spokesperson on Monday afternoon confirmed that Martosko was denied access to the Clinton event and kept from boarding a van that her campaign is using to transport pool reporters around New Hampshire However the campaign has yet to provide a full explanation considering Martosko was scheduled to be the designated print pool reporter the spokesperson also saidMartosko tweeted For those of you asking What Ive seen online re today is accurate and I intend to report here whether they want me to or not
