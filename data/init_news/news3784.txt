Will The Real Donald Trump Please Stand UpLately its been a political guessing game of which Donald Trump is going to show upIn the past 24 hours alone the whiplash between what rivalturnedunevensurrogate Ben Carson called the two different Donald Trumps was on bold displayFrom a serious foreign policy address in the morning he returned just hours later to his regular slapstick mockery of his rivals But as Trump moves even closer to securing his partys White House nomination the unpredictable dichotomy is one thats sure to worry GOP leaders anxious over which Trump will show up when it matters most in NovemberOn Wednesday evening it was pure unfiltered Trump who took the stage in Indiana Hoosier legend former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight whose own temper is controversial in itself introduced him endorsing the real estate mogul as the most prepared man in history to step in as president of the United StatesThere has never been a more honest politician than Donald Trump said Knight who was fired from IU in 2000 after uncivil defiant and unacceptable behavior that included allegedly choking a playerThey say he isnt presidential I dont know what the hell that means Knight thundered to loud applauseTrumps speech that followed was largely of the mold that many GOP leaders worry is decidedly unpresidential The mocking of Ohio Gov Kasichs eating habits was a staple He again berated Ted Cruz boasting that he has won evangelical voters this cycle while Cruz holds up the Bible puts it down and then he liesAnd even though he had some kind words about the Fourth Estate after his Tuesday night landslide Trump was back to calling the press corps following him the worlds most dishonest people on Wednesday evening in Indiana The crowd as usual ate it up and joined along in the jeersJust a week earlier there seemed to be a shift in Trump land Ever since the GOP presidential frontrunner hired political strategist Paul Manafort to helm his maligned delegate operation the longtime Republican hand has tried to telegraph the message that the controversial reality TV star would eventually evolve and tone down his temper and tenor on the campaign trailThat promise seemed to have been fulfilled after Trumps landslide win in New York last week In a more subdued victory speech at Trump Tower he was cordial to his bitter rival Cruz even referring to him as senator instead of the Lyin Ted moniker hes bestowed on himBut a week later that collegiality was gone after Trump himself pushed back on the idea that any change was forthcoming Campaigning in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania ahead of his sweep of five states Tuesday Trump was back to insults and his usual freewheeling unpredictable style Thats where he premiered his critique of his struggling rival Kasichs eating style on the campaign trailHe has the news conference all the time when hes eating Ive never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion Trump thunderedAfter his big wins on Tuesday  which possibly put him on an irreversible path toward winning the GOP nomination  Trump was back to a more unplugged styleTurning an eye toward the general election and likely rival Hillary Clinton he went hard after the Democrat for playing the womans card It was a new line of attacks that likely worry many party strategists as they seek to woo the important female voting bloc in November among whom Trump has high unfavorables in general election pollingIf Hillary Clinton were a man I dont think she would get 5 percent of the vote he jabbed at the end of his remarks Calling in to news shows the next morning he continued that line of criticismLater Wednesday afternoon however a more presidential sounding and looking Donald Trump showed up Giving a major foreign policy speech in Washington he was far more straightlaced reading prepared remarks from a teleprompterHeres how NPRs Domenico Montanaro described itJust hours later though he was back to his usual routine  for the most part There was one subtle instance of restraint during his Indiana rally Wednesday night He still took glee in mocking Cruzs decision to tap Carly Fiorina as his vice presidential pick even though the Texas senator is mathematically unable to get enough delegates on the first convention ballotBut he refrained from any overt attacks on Fiorina herself a departure from last fall when he derided her appearanceOverall Trump perhaps summed up his philosophy best during his Trump Tower victory speech Tuesday night If you have a football team and youre winning and then you get to the Super Bowl you dont change your quarterback rightTrump may take a knee more often on the campaign trail and give voters flashes of that more subdued version of himself But Wednesday alone demonstrated hes going to continue to blitz in his own way like it or not for the foreseeable future
