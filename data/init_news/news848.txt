California  Oregon Want To Secede From The US After Trump Election Nov 12 2016 2 0 In what is shaping up to be the beginning of a revolution within the United States residents from California and now Oregon are wanting to secede from the US after Donald Trump was elected Presidentand they want Alaska Hawaii Nevada and Washington state to join them to create an entirely new country altogether Two days after the Trump election in the US residents in California began a campaign called  Yes California Independence Campaign  which is to initiate the process to officially secede from the US California residents are pushing for secession Ruiz Evans said Yes California intends to launch an initiative that asks Californians whether they believe the state should remain part of the United States or break away on its own Similar to the Citizens United ballot measure voters approved Tuesday it would begin as an advisory proposal to kickstart an arduous process Marcus Ruiz Evans is the vice president of the group and s aid that Californians have a choice  The reason that were here today is we wanted to point out to everybody in California that the American system is broken Its failing Its sinking You as a Californian have a choice to make Do you go down with that ship out of tradition or sail on your own Their website states that Californians should follow Brexits lead In our view the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment and to the detriment of our children However this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country It is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association both of which are supported by constitutional and international law In 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their Brexit vote Our Calexit referendum is about California joining the international community You have a big decision to make To add to Calexits momentum an Oregon lawyer has joined the movement and filed the Oregon Secession Act  which has formally invited the states of California Alaska Washington Hawaii and Nevada to secede with them and form a new nation together The Act was filed by lawyer Jennifer Rollins and writer Christian Trejbal who said that Oregonian values are no longer the values held by the rest of the United States and that joining with these other states to create a new nation is a viable way to go forward However just 24 hours after the Act was filed they withdrew it due to the amount of violence they saw in the streets around the world Trejbal said that they were receiving death threats and that their movement is not about violent protesting so it was best to withdraw it at this time Though Oregon has suspended their secession campaign for now Californias campaign is growing stronger With Texas speaking of secession just months ago we now have the most populated state in the US speaking of secession as well Regardless of ones political stance it is clear to see that the people are growing restless and that something is going to have to give and give soon How do you see this playing out Will California be able to secede and will other states join them Will the US Congress allow something like this to happen Will revolution be the result
