With Slovenia behind them and Austria just ahead the asylum seekers shoved at the metal barriers blocking their path and chanted a plea into the smoky night air We want to goNearly 1000 people had been waiting all day for the border crossing to open penned into a nomans land by twitchy troops armed with pistols and assault rifles who met requests for food or water with stern commands and glares icy enough to match the fastfalling temperatureWeve already spent two nights outside said Galia Ali pointing to her severely disabled 8yearold son who lay shivering on a blanket near a dwindling fire If were still here in the morning hell be deadAs human flood continues Germany slaps controls on border with AustriaHours later the barriers were lifted and the migrants surged into Austria But up and down the route being traveled by a historic number of migrants this year as they seek new lives in Europe pressure is building to close the continents cherished open borders for goodHungary already has proved that it can largely insulate itself from the refugee crisis by deploying razor wire and threatening lengthy prison sentences for anyone who dares cross it The countrys moves have shifted the burden of the refugee crisis to its neighbors  and are now tempting leaders in those nations to build their own fencesThe UN refugee agency said Monday that a record 218394 people crossed the Mediterranean to reach European shores in October  about as many as the total from all of last year As the numbers rise officials in countries across central and southeastern Europe are eyeing one another nervously fearing that a sudden closure of any one border could unleash a domino effect across the region that would leave tens of thousands of people stranded and angry far from their intended destinations in the continents northThe result would be chaos and violence said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic who has coordinated his countrys response as more than 300000 people have crossed through the small coastal nation since midSeptember  including 8400 on Sunday aloneYou really think you can stop these people without shooting Ostojic said Youd have to build a wall around Europe if you really wanted to stop these kinds of flowsRather than try to impede the movement of migrants Croatia has sought to speed it up arranging trains to ferry people from the Serbian border in the east to the Slovenian border in the west But the countrys rightwing opposition which is a slight favorite to win national elections Sunday has proposed a different solution a fenceSlovenia has said it is considering a fence of its own Foreign Minister Karl Erjavec described that action as a last resort but added that he is very much concerned that other countries will erect barriers leaving his tiny Alpine nation shouldering an unsustainable burden Even now he said Slovenia is struggling to copeWe cannot go on like this for a long time Erjavec said in an emailed response to questions We have received more than 100000 migrants in just two weeks This number represents 5 of our population Our human financial and material resources are limitedFarther up the trail Austrian officials said last week that they are planning barriers to better regulate the movement of migrants coming across from Slovenia They quickly clarified that they have no intention of closing the border But they also have said they will not be able to leave it open if Germany  the next stop after Austria and for many asylum seekers the final destination  decides it can no longer handle an influx that brought more than a halfmillion asylum seekers to the country during the first nine months of the year As her poll numbers fall calls are growing for Chancellor Angela Merkel to do exactly thatEveryone is afraid of the moment when Germany decides it has had enough said Igor Tabak a Croatian security analyst for the Web site ObrisorgThe closure of borders Tabak said would not only undermine the principle of free movement at the heart of Europes postCold War identity but it also could be deeply destabilizing in the Balkans where countries that were in conflict with one another less than a generation ago are being forced to cooperate on the biggest challenge to confront the European Union in decadesSlovenia Croatia and Serbia have spent weeks trading accusations of mishandling the crisis Should a rightwing Croatian government opt to close the border with Serbia Tabak said the flow would probably shift to Bosnia an ethnically divided nation that has struggled to hang together since its bloodsoaked birthIf you have an influx of a large number of migrants into such a fragile system its easy to imagine the local institutions crumbling in Bosnia Tabak saidOstojic the Croatian interior minister said coordination among the regional rivals has improved after an emergency meeting of Balkan nations in Brussels late last month In recent days trains have begun to speed migrants through the region as part of a trial program that is expected to be fully rolled out this weekThe system replaces one that officials acknowledge was woefully unsuited to the scale of the crisis In the first two weeks after Hungary closed its border with Croatia forcing migrants to reroute through Slovenia thousands of people slept in the open each night as rain poured and temperatures plummetedSlovenia accused Croatia of sending migrants streaming across the border without warning Croatia charged that Slovenia had failed to ready itself  a point that some Slovenian officials now concedeNobody had foreseen what was going to happen The country was not prepared said Ivan Molan mayor of Brezice a handsome Slovenian town of redtiled roofs and quiet lanes that has borne the brunt of the crisisMolan said the new system of moving asylum seekers across borders by train could help to normalize life in a place where up to 10000 people had been trekking each day through farmers fields and driving away the tourists who normally flock to Brezice for a dip at its thermal spasBut he fears that the Austrians will close their border trapping frustrated migrants in Slovenia The country like others in the Balkans has no recent history of welcoming refugees from outside the region and has little to offer them If that happens this part of Slovenia will descend into a real crisis Molan saidAt the other end of the country  a mere 75 miles to the north  refugees who were awaiting the chance to walk into Austria said they were desperate to leave a place that had brought them only griefI didnt even know Slovenia existed before I came here said Sozdar elHassan a 24yearold from Damascus who stood pressed against an iron barricade while clutching her 22monthold daughter Its the smallest country but it gave us the most problemsOn a journey that has become a race to beat both winter weather and the prospect of closed borders Slovenia had badly stalled her familys progress They had crossed through five countries in four days but Slovenia alone took another fourOne night they slept outside in the mud with no blankets For two days they were housed in a crowded and filthy tent with heavily armed police barring the exits Hassan said they were forbidden to leave the tent to visit family members or even to use the toiletI asked one of the police Are we prisoners here And he responded For this moment youre prisoners said Hassan a cheery and brighteyed woman who said she learned English by watching Tom Hanks movies It was devastatingHassan said she dreams of studying accounting in Germany after her education was cut short by the war in Syria But as she stood in the cold and rain waiting for the border to be opened her exhausted daughter screaming in her arms she conceded that she would settle for falling a little bit shortAt least I want to get to Austria she said I just dont want to stay hereKarla Adam in London contributed to this
