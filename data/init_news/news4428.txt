Like a modern day Ben Franklin Sen Tim Scott makes his most critical decisions by listingthe pros and cons on a sheet of paperSo in recent weeks as the South Carolina Republican tried to decide who to endorse for the GOPpresidential nomination Scott pulled out his detailed notes onthe contenders along with his yellow legal pads and blue pens crafting the rationale for each of the potential nominees as well as their downsidesOn Tuesday he endorsed Sen Marco Rubio RFla  a fellow 40something when they were first elected in 2010 both minorities in the white confines of Republican caucuses What seemed like a natural decision from the outside came through one of the more detailed painstaking processes any senator uses for choosing which horse to back in presidential politicsIn an interview Scott explained that indeed he really only had one choice once he haddone his due diligenceWhen I put together a strong position on national defense and foreign policy coupled with a compassionate attachment for people to alleviate poverty using conservative principles exclusively Marco Rubio became the only candidate that I honestly believe can do both he saidThe endorsement served as another boost to Rubios campaign which shot out of the Iowa caucuses with a betterthanexpected finish in third narrowly edged out by Donald Trump for second and not far behind Sen Ted Cruzs RTexas winning slot Rubio who has tried to position himself as a nextgeneration leader has also focused on winning endorsements from less tenured lawmakers such as Sen Cory Gardner RColo and Rep Trey Gowdy RSC both of whom were also elected in the 2010 Republican tidal waveScott said that hes aware endorsements dont always add up to actual votes from real voters  that transference is one of the most difficult acts in politics He said that he will travel to New Hampshire in the coming days to be with Rubio in advance of Tuesdays primary where Cruzs staunch conservatism isnt expected to play as well and Rubio might have a chance for a strong secondplace finish or to even leap into first ahead of TrumpScottsreal focus however will be in South Carolina which is shaping up in its usually pivotal fashion Well find out in 18 days Scott said Tuesday counting down to the Feb 20 showdown in his home stateGetting to that point however took more than six months of detailed deliberation note taking and facetoface interaction between a dozen candidates and arguably the most soughtafter endorser in the US Senate Scott now 50 is the only AfricanAmerican Republican in the Senate and his personal biography of going from a childhood in poverty in North Charleston to making it into the Senate is the stuff of Republican storybook legendRead how the RyanScott poverty summit brought the issue to the 2016 forefrontMoreover his blessing carries more than just symbolic weight because South Carolina is third in line in the presidential nominating process after Iowa and New Hampshire Scott is surpassed in popularity only by Gov Nikki Haley R among Palmetto State leaders In the interview he acknowledged a fairly assertive courting process by the Republican contenders to get his backingScott couldve easily avoided the pressure of choosing because he is up for reelection this year Haley appointed Scott to his Senate seat in 2013 after Jim DeMint RSC decided to quit midterm to the Heritage Foundation He won the remainder of DeMints term outright in November 2014 but now must stand for election in November to wina full sixyear termRather than taking a pass on endorsing anyone Scott instead decided to maximize his leverage He put a premium on issues of fighting poverty and upward mobility that are not part of the normal Republican primary vocabulary Beginning in late August Scott hosted 12 different town halls with presidential candidates spread all across the state including everyone from onetime frontrunner Donald Trump to his South Carolina partner Sen Lindsey Graham whose own presidential bid came to an end in DecemberAt each event Scott said he took detailed notes of how the candidates handled questions from his constituents on the biggest issues of the day with a particular focus on national security and povertyYellow pads and blue ink a lot of it he said describing the processThat wasnt enough and so in early January Scott hosted what was billed as a poverty summit along with House Speaker Paul D Ryan RWis in Columbia SC Six GOP hopefuls showed up but Trump and Cruz were off campaigning in IowaAs Scott moderated the event thats when he began to settle on Rubio who like Scott uses his upfrombootstraps story to talk about his aspiration for AmericaI think it all culminated at my poverty summit he said explaining that he wants a candidate for the next American century rather than someone talking about the past I think its incredibly important for us to have a candidate who can win by using conservative principles  and that means you have to be able to sell those conservative principles so you need an aspirational candidateBut he still wasnt settled So in recent weeks that meant breaking out the legal pads and blue pens again crossing the line down the middle and drawing up the pluses and minuses for each candidateFinally Tuesday the decision arrived Rubios name got circled
