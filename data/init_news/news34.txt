Posted on October 27 2016 by Carl Herman It is no use trying to escape their Empires arrogance by submission or good behavior Robbers of the world having by universal plunder exhausted the land their drive is greed If the enemy be rich they are rapacious if poor they lust for domination Neither rule of the East nor West can satisfy them Alone among men they crave with equal eagerness poverty and riches To plunder slaughter seize with false pretenses they give the lying name empire And where nothing remains but a desert they call that peace   Tacitus The Agricola and the Germania analyses here  here  Tacitus wrote  100 AD a century into empire Emperors proclaimed to the public that their government still upheld the highest ideals of their Republic claiming expanding empire was only and always in selfdefense One Love Lets get together and feel all right Hear the children cryin Hear the children cryin One Heart   Bob Marley One Love language warning Socrates and I speak in the same direct language that caused his execution for corrupting the young Socrates Carl Carl Soc bro hug S How may I be of service genuine smile C I just want to talk with an honest person bro We last talked 6 months ago  I dont know if I have anything new to say but I want to talk with someone who can hear S Ill try What about C Were finishing a socalled election season thats jumped the shark and here  with the Leftwing candidate a proven criminal and Rightwing candidate a depraved Roman Emperor wannabe  These are Left and Right arms of one illegal rogue state US empire  of course S Of course C So I keep feeling that we have to be near an endgame Soc We have to be given the open floodgates of evidence about s much criminal activity by the 01 centered in war  looting  and lying  I mean really how much longer can this go on S smiling Are you asking me or just pausing for dramatic effect C Im asking if you have any answers S shrugs I went through a 27year civil war after almost 50 years of Athenian leaders concentrating an empire under their dominion As we discussed in some detail  Athens love of freedom and spin that foreign barbarians hate us for our freedoms was total inversion of the facts because freedom was only meant for us and not anyone else Everyone else had to pay tribute or face military invasion This hypocrisy in my time produced civil war Those of us voicing the facts were insufficient to prevent it or stop it once started Pauses to look intensely into my eyes So you tell me how much longer could your struggle go on C Fuck I really dont want a civil war S Fuck indeed If it comes maybe youll be lucky Maybe it wont last 27 years C Fuck S But I do have a brighter perspective I mean how many of the nonsheeple would care to talk with me if all I ever did is leave them discouraged chuckles Who would converse with Socrates if those who did were asked Hey how did your conversation with Socrates go and the responses were all disheartened Fuck laughs C Alright go Whats the higher light S You already know it You tell me C Ok youre right Maybe my being on Earth is all about growth truth and service and I have to exercise realworld Faith to the One Life Its my job as a guest on this planet to harmonize in service to the Goddess  plan for Earth Those of us who are relative beacons of light are isolated by design obviously by the facts of our relative leadership and lack of response from the public smile At least I havent been voted by my peers for execution as you were Soc for standing for truth S Not yet anyway If you had taken other pathways you would have been assassinated by your oligarchs such as Martin King  President Kennedy  and others  C sigh I guess I dont really have anything new to discuss I just want to win this game End the empire Have truth and love Its been a long war bro S Indeed it has Longer than you know C So much bullshit  S Only bullshit Any truth has been coopted controlled and used to mask the empire The only reason Im allowed onto your history pages is pretense that humanity lives on a planet operated from ideals of virtue Its the same with religious ideals of love C Im ready to win S So was I C sigh Alright So another day in the empire Ok Fine Realworld exercise of Faith The Goddess has more evolution to oversee with love and wisdom before we see a breakthrough I can embrace that Its really stupid to argue with reality Really stupid S smiling Apparently yes We have to work with what we have assuredly There is no other option C We discussed in our previous conversations linked for readers below that the US today compares to your empire in Athens and the case that perhaps just maybe the US is on the verge of breakthrough for Truth and Love S Perhaps my history can allow perspective on your world of the present and encourage Americans today to best use their voice and virtue for a brighter path than the civil war we endured Certainly for all interested this consideration is worthy of investing time and attention History is literally all we know and what drives our understanding of the present History is what informs our direction for building the future Americas history is at war between an awakening We the People and a deeply evil 01 committed to undisclosed vicious empire Your history could devolve into civil war chuckles As wouldbe Emperor Trump might say Sad C shaking my head slight smile Ok I gotta go to work Another day in the empire My vote still stands to planetary management for full fucking truth in a breakthrough I like a potential trend with revealing emails but want a breakthrough that causes arrests of our 01 leaders in elegant endgame S Yes and Id like to fly breath underwater swimming like a dolphin and have daily dinner parties with wine music and women C mock agreement Me too Ok our wants arent our best guides necessarily I do have to go to work Back to earning a living S Make the most of it Its your given area of selfexpression C I promise Ill lead by example of my best goodfaith expression and experience of virtue Another day S Perhaps just another day Perhaps you cant imagine whats coming C Human limitations Ill work with what I see S Thats all I concluded was possible Thats all I got for wisdom I didnt teach anything other than look for yourself whats right there in front of you to see Listen to your small voice within for your best call of virtue Stepbystep my brother In all empathy live your Faith that youre loved and guided more than youre able to imagine bro hug Well do our best Interview series
