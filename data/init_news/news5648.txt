Amman Jordan CNN ISIS militants have attacked Kirkuk in northern Iraq an effort that might be an earnest attempt to capture the key oilrich city or perhaps to divert Kurdish troops fighting to capture the Islamist extremist groups stronghold of MosulFor months ISIS has been facing off with the Peshmerga  armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan  to the west of Kirkuk It had gone into areas on Kirkuks outskirts but not the central cityHeavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central Kirkuk that local police had used as their headquartersPeshmerga and Kurdish antiterror units later raided the hotel wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them according to Peshmerga sources In addition two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the Kurdish forces outAlso Friday ISIS militants took over Maktab Khalid an area about 12 miles southwest of Kirkuk after heavy clashes with the PeshmergaAmong those killed was Brig Gen Shirko Fateh the highestranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in KirkukPhotos posted by ISIS purportedly show the groups militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk burning tents that had been used by Peshmerga troopsThe US military said Friday that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last weekAbu Malik worked in Saddam Husseins chemical weapons program before joining al Qaeda in 2005 US Central Command saidHe was killed January 24 near MosulHis death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ISIS ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people the military saidThere is no public evidence that ISIS has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction programBut US Central Command said His past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capabilityKirkuk is a strategically important city in the monthslong fight one that has pitted ISIS against the Peshmerga Iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist groupIt is one of the few notable cities  apart from the region of Kurdistan and its capital Irbil  in northern Iraq that havent fallen to ISIS Part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern IraqThe Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves with each side wanting to keep hold of them ISIS which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations has been coveting them tooPeshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS sinceIn December ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20 The attack according to ISIS was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fightersStill Kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting  which may be part of ISIS rationale for Fridays attack thereThe city of 15 million people on the Tigris River has been held by ISIS since June ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city Its leader Abu Bakr alBaghdadi pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in JulyKurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul it threatens Kurdistan Likewise neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraqs secondlargest cityPeshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two monthsThey have taken some 3000 square kilometers 1160 square miles of the Sinjar area as well as the area around the Mosul Dam choking off access routes and threatening ISIS main resupply routesTheres little doubt though that ISIS remains a very real force and threat in much of IraqThe group which calls itself the Islamic State still controls a vast swath of that Middle Eastern nation and neighboring Syria Its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law with its followers proving they will stop at nothing  having been blamed for the largescale killings of civilians mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves  during its questThat violent campaign continued Friday and not just in KirkukDozens of gunmen believed to be from ISIS faced off Friday morning about 175 miles 285 kilometers away in central Ramadi police and health officials in that city saidSeveral hours later that onslaught had been foiled and 20 gunmen were dead according to the officialsElsewhere in
