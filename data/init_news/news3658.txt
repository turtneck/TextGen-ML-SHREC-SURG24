One thing that is certain about Mondays ruling by a federal judge in Texas blocking implementation of President Obamas executive actions on immigration reform  it wont be the last wordNonetheless the opinion is worth noting for three reasons first what it says about the depressing politicization of the federal judiciary second and related what it suggests about the conservative face of judicial activism third what its implications may be for the coming showdown on funding for the Department of Homeland SecurityThe New York Times report on the ruling contained a jarring phrase describing its author US District Judge Andrew Hanen as an outspoken critic of the administration on immigration policy My instinct was that the reporter had gone too far in that characterization surely a federal judge  even a federal judge appointed by George W Bush  could not fairly be described that wayTurns out he can Hanen sits in Brownsville Tex on the border with Mexico and it can fairly be assumed it was no accident that the 26 states challenging the executive actions sued in that court where they had a 5050 chance of having the case heard by Hanen The other judge in Brownsville is a Bill Clinton appointeeHanen has a remarkable history of blasting the Department of Homeland Security for what he views as its lax approach to immigration enforcement In his court where you stand depends literally on where he sits  Hanens rulings bristle with frustration over the influx of illegal immigrants at the border and what he views as the feckless governmental policies in dealing with themIn a 2013 case involving the smuggling of a 10yearold girl from El Salvador Hanen went after DHS for reuniting the girl with her undocumented mother rather than prosecuting the mother for having hired the trafficker This court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security  of completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States Hanen wroteThe plaintiffs challenging Obamas plan got the judge they wanted and they got the ruling they wanted Frank Sharry executive director of Americas Voice an immigration reform group told meAs to that ruling its weakest link is its strained conclusion that Texas at least had legal standing to challenge Obamas actions Time was conservatives and conservative judges were most reluctant to grant standing an approach in keeping with their conception of the modest judicial roleSo how did Hanen deal with the federal governments argument that the states had failed to show the individual injury required to allow them to challenge the executive actionsIt came down  this is not a joke  to drivers licenses Texas argued that the expanded class of individuals eligible to remain in the country would be entitled to apply for licenses and that the 24 fee for obtaining a license did not cover the states actual cost Thus Hanen found the states have shown the the program will directly injure the proprietary interest of their drivers license programs and cost the states badly needed fundsHanens conclusion that he should prevent the immigration actions from going into effect rests on a similarly slender reed He concluded that an injunction was justified because the states could suffer irreparable harm in the form of having to issue drivers licenses and other benefitsSeriously the irreparable harm to Texas is that it spends some money on drivers licenses Please you conservatives who applaud this outcome  not another word about judicial activismFinally because the clock is ticking on funding for the Department of Homeland Security Hanens ruling raises the question of whether it offers a facesaving exit to Republicans seeking to avoid a shutdown or instead will further inflame conservativesMy answer is both Those who rail against presidential usurpation of authority will seize on Hanens opinion to assert that they cannot appropriate a dime for the Department of Homeland Security No matter that Hanens opinion only reached the notsosexy topic of whether the administrations actions complied with the yawn Administrative Procedure Act not whether they overstepped constitutional boundariesThe cannier move would be for Senate Republicans to seize on the case as an escape from their untenable corner The executive actions are under court review now we can move on with funding essential government services Smarter Yes More likely Not in the current poisonously partisan environmentRead more from Ruth Marcuss archive follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook
