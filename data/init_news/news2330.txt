The budget deal was crafted by outgoing Speaker John Boehner behind closed doors Hardline Republicans dont like that and neither does RyanRep Paul Ryan RWis right walks from a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington Monday Oct 26 2015 The bipartisan deal announced by House Speaker John Boehner seems to be great for many in Congress but Ryan has some beef with the proposed budgetThe bipartisan deal announced by House Speaker John Boehner appears to be a winwinwin  for the White House Republicans and DemocratsThe twoyear pact not only averts a federal debt default next week but also sidesteps a potential government shutdown in DecemberIt beefs up both defense and nondefense spending It heads off deep cuts in Social Security disability payments And it prevents a significant increase in certain Medicare payments Part B for seniorsSo then why is the presumed next speaker Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin expressing such anger about it Also why are political observers rather downcast as wellMuch of it has to do with the way the deal was put together  highly dependent on one man who is leaving the scene and highly reliant on a secretive negotiating process involving only a few key people and their staffs Such a closeddoor process is how Congress has gotten things done for decades But the hardline House Freedom Caucus has been demanding a different way  a bottomup approach which could actually complicate dealmaking for a future Speaker RyanPolitical observers have not trumpeted the deal because they see it as a oneoff solution created by Speaker Boehners pending exit That coming departure has freed him up to negotiate directly with Democrats in Congress and with President Obama unconcerned about another eruption on his right flank from the Freedom CaucusThis is not a good sign for the budget process The only way we got this done is for a speaker to resign Is that what its going to take to get a deal the next time asks Stan Collender a federal budget expert in WashingtonAs for Representative Ryan he took issue at least publicly with the process surrounding the deal Legislation for it was filed very late on Monday night and it will hit the House floor for approval on Wednesday Its expected to pass with heavy support from Democrats Then it will head to the Senate whose Republican and Democratic leaders were also in on the private negotiationsI think the process stinks Ryan said Tuesday morningThis is not the way to do the peoples business he said We are up against a deadline  thats unfortunate As a conference we shouldve been meeting months ago to discuss these things to have a unified strategy going forwardThat should be music to the Freedom Caucuss ears and Ryan would need that groups support as speakerThe nearly 40 Freedom Caucus members many of whom came to Congress on the tea party wave of 2010 or after want to devolve power from the speakers office Their preferred approach would empower committees and themselves to a much greater extentPutting together a very complex deal and giving members less than 48 hours to read it study it and vote on it with virtually no input  its about as bad as the process gets around here said Rep John Fleming R of Louisiana a member of the Freedom CaucusRyan was apparently not involved in the talks That absolves him from the deal  which has elements of one he negotiated with Democratic Sen Patty Murray of Washington to resolve a budget crisis just two years agoHe wasnt down there He wasnt even invited Hes been trying to figure out if hes going to be speaker this week not if hes cutting a debt ceiling deal said Freedom Caucus founder Rep Mick Mulvaney R of South Carolina sticking up for Ryan We believe him when he says hes frustrated by the processRepresentative Mulvaney acknowledges that deals like this in the end have to be negotiated by the key players on both sides Its not possible for all 247 Republican members to be negotiators The problem for him was that the chief negotiator was someone who is on his way out  someone whom the right wing had pushed out the doorMulvaney and other Freedom Caucus members have big problems with the deal itself not just how it was put together They dont like that it busts budget caps of the 2011 Budget Control Act by 80 billion even as it raises the current 18 trillion debt ceilingThats two strikes and there are plenty of other third strikes in there said Rep Tim Huelskamp R of Kansas another Freedom Caucus member One of them is a change that he says would destroy crop insurance of vital interest to his stateThe budget increases are being offset by cuts elsewhere including smallscale reforms to Social Security and Medicare  long sought by Republicans But Representative Huelskamp is skeptical about whether those reforms will ever pay off while Mulvaney says Boehner is merely moving the deck chairsSome observers say that even by cleaning out the barn for his successor Boehner hasnt really made it easier on Ryan The Freedom Caucus is even angrier at how this deal was handled and it will insist that Ryan not follow such secret lastminute negotiatingThe Freedom Caucus will not make it any easier for Paul Ryan to make similar concessions once he is in power writes Julian Zelizer a historian at Princeton University in an email to the Monitor Without the crisis atmosphere that results from budgetary differences there will in many ways be more room for the parties to fight over issuesPaul is going to be in better shape than he would have been because a lot of the overly contentious issues will be off the table says Rep Peter King R of New York a moderate in an interview Hell be able to actually start working toward governing as opposed to going from crisis to crisis
