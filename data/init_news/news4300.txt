To be fair Clinton has been on the ugly end of Republican attacks for decades  a little guardedness is pardonable But a playitsafe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like Trump The Republican nominees campaign depends upon free media In many ways what Trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant  the point is to be seen and heard He can lie and distort with impunity his supporters dont care and he dominates headlines all the sameWith that in mind I suggested Clintons plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea and that she ought to steal the spotlight from Trump whenever and wherever she can The same I reasoned was true for Democrats and downballot racesDemocrats still shouldnt take anything for granted but I no longer believe theres any reason to compete with Trump for airtime If weve learned anything in the last couple of weeks its that Trump will never morph into a sane pragmatic candidate He was never going to conform to political norms but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached November Instead hes quadruple downed on his racist comments about a MexicanAmerican judge and more recently accused President Obama of being a Muslim Manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in OrlandoNow that Trump is speaking to a general electorate hes paying a higher price for his racist drivel Indeed the latest NBC NewsSurveyMonkey poll finds Hillary Clinton now leading Donald Trump nationally by eight points 49 percent to 41 percent This gap will grow as Democrats unify and the Republican nominee continues unraveling in public Even the political press is challenging Trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentumAccording to a Politico report Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is now encouraging Democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch Trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him including GOP candidates whove endorsed him Its a timetested strategy When your enemy is imploding let him And thats what Democrats are doing Calling it a shock and blah campaign Politico reporter Burgess Everett writes The blah comes from the Democratic candidates themselvesTheyre intentionally playing it safe and boring figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on Trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states To the extent that Democrats are attacking at all theyre keeping it simple Every interview every question and every speech returns to a common theme Look whos at the top of the Republican ticket Is this what the GOP stands for Is this a candidate Republicans are willing to cosign If there was ever a national election said Dem Senator Chuck Schumer This is it Trumps campaign is a dumpster fire riding a wave of nativist angst Why not make every race on the ballot a referendum on him What works for Democratic senate candidates will also work for Hillary Clinton There are obvious differences between senate races and a presidential contest but the general strategy ought to work in both domains Clinton will have to face the cameras and engage much more than downballot candidates However if this is who Trump is going to be then merely looking and sounding like an adult will be enough for Clinton
