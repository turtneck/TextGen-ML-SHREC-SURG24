Since June 21 fires have been reported at six Southern churches that serve mostly AfricanAmerican congregations Investigators believe that two of these fires were intentionally set and the cause of three others is unknown and under investigationThese fires came to public attention a few days after the shooting that killed nine black members ofCharlestons Emanuel AME Church on June 17  which was itself a reminder of the long history of terrorism against black churches in America Although church fires are not uncommon  and there is a lot we still dont know about the recent fires some of which were accidental  many observers are fearful and anxiousSince June 21st there have been at least four mysterious fires at black churches in the South  three of which were likely deliberate In three cases law enforcement officers have said that theres evidence that the fire was deliberately set In one other case investigators have been unable to determine whether the fire was intentional or notMany media reports have referred to fires at seven churches But those include two churches that were struck by lightning one of which was a white church and another church where the cause of the fire was likely an electrical failureHeres what we know about the casesbased on reporting fromthe Los Angeles Timess Matt PearceCNNs Ben Brumfield and Sam Stringer theAssociated Presss Bruce Smith and Meg Kinnard and local mediaHow this compares to general arson rates for churches including black churches According to the National Fire Protection Association via theLos Angeles Timess Matt Pearce firefighters responded to an average of 1600 fires at churches a year from 2007 to 2011 That comes out to an average of 31 fires a weekSixteen percent of fires at churches and funeral homes the latter is much less common were intentionally set Thats an average of five intentional fires a week or 256 a year  causing an average of three civilian injuries annuallyBoth intentional and accidental fires have been declining since the 1980sWhat the motive of any intentionallyset fire was Deliberate fires are set for a variety of reasons Investigators have not come up with suspects or a motive in any of the recent firesWhether any of the fires were connected to each other Some past attacks on black churches like the 1995 Ku Klux Klan attack on the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church were deliberately coordinated But an attack can be racially motivated without being the work of a white supremacist organization In some cases racism combines with other factors  like alcohol and drugs  to inspire individuals to launch attacks on their own As the Washington Post reported about three Tennessee arsonists in 1996When well have answers Law enforcement officials are currently investigating four of the fires often with assistance from the FBI We dont know when these investigations will conclude or whether theyll have enough evidence to determine whether a crime was committedIn the past arson cases have often rested on forensic evidence that purported to show a fire was deliberately set But in recent years the reliability of those findings has been questioned or discreditedAttacks on black churches have been a frequent form of antiblack terrorism in America The black church has beena symbol and a gathering place for black America and thats made it an appealing target for white supremacist terrorists The Emanuel AME Church in Charleston where the June massacre happened was burned in the 19th century after one of its founders planned a slave revolt In 1964 four young girls were killed when the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham was bombed There was a wave of firebombings of black churches in the South in the 1990s and a black church in Massachusetts was burned the day President Barack Obama was inauguratedBurnings of black churches by whites are not uncommon The current data on church fires doesnt include data for black churches in particular But we do have some data from the 1990s when the rash of burnings of black churches prompted the creation of a federal task force The task force investigated 945 church fires including 310 black churches 213 of which were in the SouthLaw enforcement ultimately arrested 136 people for arson against black churches a little under two thirds of whom were white 102 of the suspects  twothirds white  were arrested for arson against black churches in the South Law enforcement agents arrested 431 suspected arsonists overall including white and black church firesMost of these cases were brought in state court But sometimes the federal government did end up bringing charges  especially in cases of hate crimes Fiftyeight percent of federal convictions for church arsons from 1995 to 2000 were for crimes motivated by bias
