Print In a story that predictably did not make the mainstream media and with video surveillance very difficult to find a massive mob of black teens viciously attacked white Temple University students police officers and even a police horse in Philadelphia on Friday night  In the limited local coverage this story did receive the race aspect was generally avoided It is way past time to take back the media and fill it with truthtellers not apologists More than 150 teens spread out in groups of 20 or 30 descended upon the campus at around 830 pm Friday  wreaking havoc for nearly two hours before eventually dispersing according to NBC 10  But there is a reason for all of this horror according to Solomon Jones of Phillycom  It evidently boils down to the progressive canard white privilege The black teens are feeling excluded because evil white others have come into their neighborhood and built rental properties for college students raising the property values of their neighborhoods in a way that evidently excludes the angry teens who were used to having their blighted turf unmolested
