Anderson Cooper was mostly the model of a good debate moderator focused on issues wellprepared quick to follow up only occasionally lapsing into stupidityas when he asked Bernie Sanders about his past as a conscientious objector a topic relevant to exactly nobodyand generally keeping things movingGranted Cooper had a vastly different situation to contend with than his predecessors who dealt with the Republicans There were only five candidates onstage and none of them were eager to go to war with each other All that was left to do was talk about actual policy In fact the moment that drew the biggest round of applause from the Las Vegas audience was when Sanders growled that he was bored with all the mishegoss around Hillary Clintons emails Refusing to attack Hillary The crowd ate it upAnd what about Hillary All eyes had been trained on herwould she crumble under the weight of the email scandal Would she tremble as Bernie barked his applause lines Of course not The debate provided her with perhaps the most sustained platform she has had so far to show off her policy chops remind everyone that she is a fearsomely polished debater and bask in the warmth of a crowd that was truly on her side There was nothing especially new about anything she saidtime and again she took a more cautious more hawkish approach to the issues thrown at herbut she made no major errors and even landed a few surprising and effective blows as when she took Sanders to task for his record on gun control Her biggest potential pitfallslike her disastrous foreign policy record her close ties to Wall Street and those nagging emailswere mopped up far more easily than they mighthave been In one of her smarter lines she defended her vote to invade Iraq by noting that President Obama had asked her to serve in his cabinetan answer that managed to both shamelessly evade the question about her judgment and win over the debate audience all at the same timeSanders has been one of Clintons top headaches but his resolute unwillingness to go after her too much meant that he didnt pose a real challenge for her during the debate Instead he stuck to his core themes belting his messages about inequality and bankers out like Ethel Merman trying to hit the back of the balcony Bernie Sanders knows how to work a crowd of liberals so this strategy worked Its tough to see how that will change the dynamic of the race though If Sanders is serious about winning the nomination theres only one way to do that and thats through Hillary Clinton As she showed she wont be shy about taking him down if she has to As for the other three people in the race well they were also present Martin OMalley made an intermittently energetic appeal to be the alternative Bernie Sanders It was an appeal that mostly fell flat Jim Webb spent the majority of his time either whining about how he wasnt being allowed to speak more or giving what sure sounded like sentences but didnt quite seem to end up as sentences And Lincoln Chafee gave what is likely to go down in history as one of the worst debate answers of all time when he explained his vote for the repeal of the GlassSteagall Act by saying that he had just gotten to the Senate didnt know what was going on and oh his father had just died Nice knowing ya Linc One last thing CNN desperately needs to rethink how it uses its journalists in these debates Dana Bash Don Lemon and Juan Carlos Lopez were quite literally tokenized pressed into service only when a topic relevant to their particular demographic came up Under the circumstances it would have been better not to have them there at all Or maybegaspCNN could have someone who is not a white man lead a debate for once
