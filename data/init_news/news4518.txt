A year after explosive accusations that patients had died waiting for appointments at the VA Medical Center in Phoenix Arizona the administrations path to making health care more accessible for Americas veterans remains on shaky groundCritics say a program rolled out to give certain veterans the option of governmentfunded private care is experiencing serious bumps according to reports only 27000 vets have taken advantage of the Choice Card program since it was launched in NovemberTechnically to be eligible to see a nonVA doctor a veteran must be at least 40 miles away from the nearest VA hospital or have waited at least 30 days for an appointmentBut veterans groups say confusion about eligibility remains the big problem  not everyone qualifies but some vets who thought they would reported they were turned away Some say the process isnt clear and bureaucratic red tape has led to conflicting messages to veterans about whether or not they can access the system Others have just gotten responses that werent very helpfulAir Force veteran Pat Baughman for example told Fox News he lives about 50 miles away from the nearest VA hospital in Bay Springs Miss  approximately a onehour drive But when Baughman called the Choice Card phone number last November he was told to drive more than three hours away to a hospital in Natchez MissIt didnt make sense at all I told them thats longer than what Im driving now So they said theyd get back with me Baughman said adding he received a call the next day and was told to drive to another location instead  two hours awayBaughman toldFoxNewscomhe finally gave up on the program and is using Medicare to pay his medical bills at a local doctorHes not alone in his frustration According to a survey conducted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars VFW in February 80 percent of the 1068 respondents who believed they were eligible to see a private doctor in lieu of VA care found out they were not Its unclear whether this is due mostly to misperceptions about the program by veterans or missteps by VA officialsHere we are in March and there is a lot of confusion said Garry Augustine executive director of the Disabled American Veterans DAV which is advocating with other major veterans organizations for some clarity in the legislation I think when you rush into a new program you are going to have growing painsPresident Obama made his first visit on Friday to the scandalscarred Phoenix center and referenced Choice Card  praising the program while acknowledging there was more to do in restoring trust in VA programs overall Congress passed that Choice Card legislation last July after an inspector general report on mismanagement and manipulation of waittime data fueled calls for VA reform The scandal also resulted in the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in MayCards went out to eligible vets first and then to all 9 million vets who currently receive VA care as of Aug 1  in case they too meet the eligibility standards It is up to the card holder to call the VA to see if they qualify and if so they are then sent to a thirdparty administrator for a list of participating doctorsOne area of confusion is that according to the rules a veteran must be 40 miles away from the nearest VA  as the crow flies But this can lead to unequal treatment since residents in areas with winding roads or simply crowded roads could face a longer drive than othersAugustine said about 500000 should be eligible under the distance requirements but the as the crow flies standard is throwing everything off He and others are behind legislation that would clarify the rule to accommodate a 40mile driving distanceThe VA is construing the eligibility criteria as it relates to the 40mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding too many who are far away from the care that they need wrote a group of senators to VA Secretary Robert McDonald on Feb 25 urging him to not only consider tweaking the distance requirement but to look at reports that veterans who need specialty care should be able to access that even if there is a VA clinic that does not provide specialists within the 40mile spectrumThis was a problem for Minnesota veteran Paul Walker who has cancer He told local KARE11 that he was turned down for private care for cancer treatment because there was a VA clinic within 20 miles of his home  but the closest VA hospital which offers the treatment he needs reportedly is more than 50 miles awayI tried using it and I got flatly turned down said Walker who told the network that at the clinic all they do is dental work there and eye work and some basic kinds of different minor things but I have cancer stage 4So he said I dont get a choice I get to die So to me thats not a choiceRep Tim Huelskamp RKan has 63 counties and no VA hospital in his district He also is joining members in moving legislation that could help people like Walker He told McDonald in a recent hearing that he has been fielding complaints from veterans on this issue tooI got an email by a veteran who drives 340 miles one way for cardiology he said If the VA choice program cant provide something closer for him then we have to relook how we are implementing the programThe Choice Card program was allocated 10 billion and is supposed to be temporary until the system gets up to speed with taking care of veterans in house which would mean getting through the backlogs plaguing the nations VA hospitals Aside from the Choice Card there are other separate options for veterans to access private care but veterans have to be referred by the VA directly said AugustineSen Jerry Moran RKan who was one of the senators on the recent letter to McDonald is sponsoring a bill to clarify the 40mile rule He says he doesnt feel the VAs heart is into providing private careHere is a link to the bill introduction if you want to put it in thereThe concern I have is that the VA has a mentality against outside care even in the circumstances of when veterans cant get care within 30 days or within 40 miles Moran said in a statementFor his part McDonald has said he too is not satisfied with the low number of veterans accessing the new program and has agreed the complaints are validWere talking about how we can do a better way of marketing it he said in the February hearing at the House Veterans Affairs Committee Further addressing the distance issue in relation to specialty care he said distance from the place where you cant get the service seems like a relatively weak measure As for the crow flies issue we can look at the 40 miles change the interpretation  so we can make the program more robust I am for whatever it takes to satisfy veteransA representative with the VA did not return a request for comment on FridayAugustine says that consistency and communication and anything they can do to end the confusion  whether it is on the VAs end or the veterans  would be helpful
