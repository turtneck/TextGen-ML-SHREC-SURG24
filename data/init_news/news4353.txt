Over the weekend a shootoutbetween three rival biker gangs at a bar in Waco Texas left at least nine gang members dead and 18 others hospitalized with gunshot and stab woundsIt was a huge devastating tragedy TheNew York Times reported that law enforcement sources called it the worst violence in the Waco area since the siege on the Branch Davidian compound in 1993 that left 86 people deadBut if you follow the social media conversations around the incident youll see something in addition to the predictable shock curiosity and mourning for the victims theres frustration and anger over how the Waco shootout whose perpetrators appear to be mostly white is being talked about  and specifically how that contrasts with the coverage and commentary of crimes when the people involved are blackThose who are using what happened in Waco to start conversations about stereotypes and media biases against black people arent complaining about the tenor of this weekends media coverage Theyre saying something a little different that by being pretty reasonable and sticking to the facts this coverage highlights the absurdity of the language and analysis that have been deployed in other instances when the accused criminals are blackIn particular youll see a lot of sarcasm about whiteonwhite crime and whiteonwhite violenceThats because handwringing over blackonblack violence is frustratingly common  especially as an attempt to derail the focus on high profile stories of policeinvolved deaths of black peopleIts finally catching on that focusing on blackonblack crime in response to criticism of law enforcement practicesdoesnt make sense but the absence of any similar refrain in cases in which the suspected criminals are white is a reminder of how the idea of intraracial crime is almost exclusively  and unfairly  brought up when black people are involvedAnother line of commentary thats predictable in media coverage and commentary surrounding violence involving black people has to do with black cultural pathologyPoliticians and pundits are notorious for grasping for problems in AfricanAmerican communities  especially fatherlessness  to explain the kind of violence that when it happens in a white community is treated as an isolated crime versus an indictment of an entire racial groups way of lifePoliticians and pundits are notorious for grasping for problems in AfricanAmerican communitiesThe total absence around the Waco incident of analysis of struggles and shortfalls within white families and communities is a painful reminder of thisThe Why are they shooting up their own neighborhood question in that last tweet is a sarcasticreference to a common sentiment expressed after the Baltimore riots that followed the death ofFreddie Gray and the destructive elements of the mostly peaceful protests in Ferguson Missouri surrounding the police shooting ofMichael Brown Its another line of thinking thats conspicuously absent in the television and social media commentary thats surrounded the Waco shootoutYoull also hear people lamenting that politicians reporters and commentators have largely refrained from calling the bike gang members thugs Theres been widespread sensitivity around the racialized use of that term ever since it was deployed against slain black teen Trayvon Martin who was killed by George Zimmerman in 2012This issue came up again more recently when Baltimore Mayor Stephanie RawlingsBlake used it to describe the young people who destroyed property when protesting Freddie Grays death The fact that the bike gang members accused in this case havent been slapped with this label is an infuriating reminder of its racial undertones and the way it is so easily and disproportionately deployed against black people either as an intentional code word of because of deepseated stereotypes about race and criminalityTo really understand the angst over the language and analysis surrounding what happened in Waco you have to remember that theres more going on here than just frustration with reports cable news commentators and Twitter reactionsAll of this is underscored and intensified by larger concerns about the way the same racial biases that fuel differences in coverage and conversation play out in real life in the same way observers speak and write differently when black people are involved police  perhaps unconsciously treat black people unfairly Many times these biases have deadly consequencesThats why some observers of the Waco tragedy have taken note of the fact that the gang members in the brawl werent brutalized or killed by the police officers who arrested them and actually appeared to be treated with a certain level of civilityA writer at the blogCrooks and Liars lamented Check out the cell phones and smokes while they wait for the cops to process them No rides in the paddy wagon for them Just sit on the curb and wait until nice Mr Policeman has a moment to process youThat of course stands in contrast to what has happened in a string of highprofile cases involving the policeinvolved deaths of black men who unlike the Waco bike gang members were entirely unarmedSome have interpreted the backlash as a criticism of media coverage of this particular event and are confused about what critics want to happen here Is the media supposed to use harsher language to describe the white bike gang members actions Call them thugs Ask about their fathersThat confusion is understandable After all its not as if the media has swept this tragedy under the rug or minimized its intensity The New York Times quoted a Waco law enforcement official who saidIn 34 years of law enforcement this is the worst crime scene  the most violent crime scene  that I have ever been involved in There are dead people still there There is blood everywhere Outlets arent holding back from using the term gang or talking about the death toll or explaining the dynamics that led to the battle Steve Cook executive director of the Midwest Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association told Voxs Libby Nelson that the gang members are domestic terroristsBut the key thing to understand is that the criticism here is not really of the coverage of what happened in Waco Its of the juxtaposition of what happened here with what happens when the people involved are of a different color The message is not that the conversation about Waco should be overblown hypercritical of an entire culture or full of racial subtextIts despair over the sense that if the gang members were black it almost certainly would be
