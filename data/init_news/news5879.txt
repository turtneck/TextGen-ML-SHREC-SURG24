Hillary Clinton launchedher harshest attacks yet on Bernie Sanders during their debate Thursday night in Milwaukee in a clear attempt to define their differences on major issues and win over black voters  but they had their most heated exchanges over campaign financing who was the stronger supporter of President Obama and who was a friend of Henry KissingerThe debate fell at a time when Sanders is trying to build his momentum after his big New Hampshire win while Clinton is trying to regain hersAs Sanders pointedly reminded her Youre not in the White House yetBut the candidates at times offered a similar message This was evident as they vociferously called for an overhaul of local police departments that they suggested are unfair to black peopleWe need fundamental police reform Sanders said adding hes sick and tired of seeing unarmed black people shot by police He likened heavily equipped police departments to occupying armiesClinton meanwhile echoed those themes joining Sanders in calling for sentencing reform while saying the countrys systemic racism goes deeper and must be addressed  in education housing and the job marketWe are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we need to root out she saidThe comments were part of each candidates revived appeal to minority voters a key voting bloc as the Democratic presidential primary heads to South CarolinaBut even as they stressed those issues differences were laid bare at the PBShosted debate in Milwaukee And Sanders came prepared to counter Clintons attacks showing a feistier side than he did at their last showdownWhen Clinton used her closing remarks to suggest Sanders was taking shots at President Obama Sanders called it a low blow and countered One of us ran against Barack Obama I was not that candidateHe even underscored his critique of Clintons foreign policy by pointing to a book where Clinton said she was mentored by former Secretary of State Henry KissingerI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend Sanders said calling him one of the most destructive American diplomatsClinton fired back that we have yet to know who Sanders listens to on foreign policyThe two also clashed sharply over Sanders highcost biggovernment plansWe are not England We are not France Clinton saidClinton accused Sanders of pushing programs that would grow the federal government by 40 percent She suggested his health care promises cannot be kept and will be far more costly than he admitsWe should level with the American people she saidShe also said Sanders plans would upend ObamaCare  though Sanders said he would not dismantle itThat is absolutely inaccurate he said when she claimed his plans would leave many people worse offIn my view health care is a right of all people  and I will fight for that Sanders said adding it would take courageClinton also criticized Sanders for voting against a 2007 immigration reform bill backed by the late Sen Ted KennedySanders explained that the bill had a guestworker program that progressive groups opposedI think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea of what needed to be done Clinton saidYet the candidates agreed in their joint criticism of the Obama administrations recent deportation raidsSanders meanwhile once again hammered Clinton for her Wall Street ties suggesting the financial sectors big donations are meant to buy influenceLets not insult the intelligence of the American people People arent dumb Sanders said Why in Gods name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions I guess just for the fun of itThey sparred on the issue as Sanders touted the fact hes the only candidate up here who has no super PAC supporting him A super PAC backing Clinton he said recently raised 15 million from Wall StreetClinton countered by noting that Obama took Wall Street donations too but when it mattered he stood up and took on Wall StreetLets not in any way imply here that either President Obama or myself would in any way not take on any vested interest she said calling for more regulation of the financial sectorThe showdown comes as Clinton tries to reset the race which heads next to Nevada and South Carolina Her narrow victory in Iowa and resounding defeat in New Hampshire have raised fresh questions about her candidacy which at one point was seen as a sure thing for the Democratic nominationPublicly the Clinton campaign is voicing confidence The campaign has been refocusing on the battle to lock down minority voter support asserting that with their help the former secretary of state can easily make gains against Sanders But Sanders is at the same time making a bid to expand his own support beyond rural white voters  who largely decide Iowa and New HampshireWhile the Clinton campaign is banking on minority voters as it heads into South Carolina and other delegaterich states down the primary calendar Tuesdays contest exposed serious problems for her She lost in New Hampshire across almost every demographic including womenOverall she lost to Sanders by more than 20 points
