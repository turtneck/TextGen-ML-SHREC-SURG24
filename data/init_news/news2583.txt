contests in Southern and Western statesAlthough former secretary of state Hillary Clinton enjoys a dramatic advantage over Sen Bernie Sanders Vt among minorities his resounding victory Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary gives him a shot of momentum that he hopes could turn that tideMaking clear how crucial minority support will be Sanderss first stop after leaving New Hampshire was in Harlem where he met Wednesday morning with the Rev Al Sharpton and Benjamin Jealous the former head of the NAACPIf the elections were held today in both those states we would lose Sanders said in an interview referring to Nevada and South Carolina But I think we have momentum I think we have a shot to win and if we dont win well do a lot better than people think we willSwamped by a wave of populist support for Sanders in New Hampshire Clintons campaign signaled Wednesday that the spectacular loss will not throw her off a careful course set months ago that relies in part on strong support among minoritiesWith a blast of announcements about endorsements travel plans and more the Clinton campaign sought to turn to subjects  gun control criminal justice the water crisis in Flint Mich  that speak to African American and bluecollar voters in the states that vote nextThere is no change to our core argument our plan and you saw that in what we are saying as we look to the states that vote in March Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said WednesdayThe Sanders campaign meanwhile predicted that once voters in the next round of nominating states tune in his message of economic fairness will resonate regardless of race Sanders has argued that many of his initiatives  including a higher minimum wage paid family leave and free college tuition  should be more appealing to African Americans and Latinos given the greater share of economically struggling families in those communitiesJeff Weaver Sanderss campaign manager said that internal polling is starting to show movement in Sanderss direction among younger voters of all backgrounds in upcoming statesYounger voters are clearly the strongest group for Senator Sanders and this is sort of reminiscent of the Obama campaign  where younger voters were the presidents strongest bloc as well  across racial lines Weaver saidClinton had no public appearances Wednesday She and Sanders meet for another Democratic debate on Thursday in Milwaukee Clinton is expected to strike a more aspirational optimistic tone that is a tacit acknowledgment that simply knocking down Sanderss ideas as unrealistic was not enoughA chief complaint among Clinton backers appalled by her 22point loss Tuesday in a state with long and fond ties to the Clinton political franchise is that she isnt getting through to voters Exit polling and other data show that Clinton did not connect in New Hampshire  not with men not with women not with the young and not with bluecollar votersThe next two Democratic contests will come in Nevada where 30 percent of the Democratic electorate in 2008 was black or Hispanic and in South Carolina where 55 percent of the 2008 Democratic electorate was black In March another slew of Southern states with

crucial to a Democratic victory in his stateIn the most recent competitive Democratic primary in 2008 61 percent of the electorate was female and 55 percent was African American Harrison said That combination means that the key voting bloc in South Carolina are black womenIf you want to know who is going to win you need to talk to African American women Harrison saidFor now they are predisposed to support Clinton If Sanders has any chance of making it close or of winning Harrison said he has to cut into her support among African American womenHillary Clintons poor showing with young voters and with women of nearly every age in both Iowa and New Hampshire gives many of her allies shivers and Sanderss inroads among African Americans have raised alarmSanders has won the support of Jealous
