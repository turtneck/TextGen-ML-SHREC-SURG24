Email In an exciting new development a startup company called Zero Mass Water has created solar panels that passively and efficiently pull water from the sky purify it and transport it to the tap for drinking and cooking purposes These solar panels are seriously changing the game for both tap water and clean energy Via TrueActivist SPONSORED LINKS Though the primary motivation for creating these panels was to help people living without access to clean drinking water it can also help a variety of people from all walks of life while conserving traditional energy that is bad for the environment  Scroll Down For Video Below The founder and CEO of the startup Cody Friesen said he was inspired when he was setting up another one of his technologies in Indonesia and thought about the abundance of rain but lack of clean water in the region He decided to focus his efforts on improving the global water supply Friesen told Fastco Exist Everybodys heard about the latest nanofilter thisor whatever the latest pump technology is None of those end up being sort of the leapfrog technology that addresses the fact that drinking water is a fundamental human right and yet we have one person dying every 10 seconds from waterborne illness on the planet Though these are the first solar panels of their kind the idea and technology behind the water conversion and supply is simple Zero Mass Water created a material that absorbs water from the air at an extremely accelerated rate then it draws the water back out to evaporate it and draw out pollutants After this purification process the distilled water is run through a mineral block to add calcium and magnesium and to improve the taste Since waterborne illnesses are so prevalent this water can save millions of lives and slowly eliminate diseases as it becomes more widelyused by countries suffering the most as a result of contaminated drinking water  Having an inhome water supply would also save girls and women worldwide approximately 200 million hours annually  as thats how much time they spend retrieving water They could use this time to go to school perform more tasks around the house or work The solar panels are currently being tested in Ecuador Jordan and Mexico to test their viability and effectiveness Though theyre starting out in areas rampant with poverty  the panels can also make a difference in the lives of the citizens whose water supplies are tainted with lead There are roughly 5300 such water systems and this could be a safe alternative to drinking that lethal tap water and buying bottled water A single panel can provide enough clean drinking and cooking water for a family of 4 and additional panels can be used on larger buildings such as hospitals Zero Mass Water hopes that this concept wont remain novel for too long despite the success theyre likely to have for being the only sellers of this panel their goal is to make the technology common throughout all solar panels installed in peoples homes When you think about solar today what do you think about Electricity Friesen said Everybody thinks that way I think that in a few years when people think about solar theyll also think about water abundance
