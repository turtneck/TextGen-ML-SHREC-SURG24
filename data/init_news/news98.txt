Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W Bushs legacy trading insults at a rapid clip  and the two CubanAmerican senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each others Spanishspeaking skillsAnd just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessmans prolife credentialsYou are the single biggest liar Youre probably worse than Jeb Bush Trump saidCruz stood his ground charging that Trump would appoint liberals to the Supreme Court if electedThe issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS Newshosted debate in Greenville SC in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalias death with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmationBut the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race as the candidates charge into next weeks critical South Carolina primary The clashes left Ohio Gov John Kasich  the affable secondplace finisher in the New Hampshire primary  making an appeal for peace in the GOP field albeit one unlikely to be heededI think were fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we dont stop this Kasich saidRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson too warned about the coming general election and said We cannot be tearing each other downThe appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration Its an argument theyve had before  Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort  but this time it became more heated And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldnt rescind President Obamas immigration executive orders on day one Rubio quippedI dont know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesnt speak Spanish Rubio saidCruz then immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish Rubio continued saying Cruz lies about all sorts of things and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrantsAs the RubioCruz battle heated up so did the longsimmering feud between Trump and BushThis is a man who insults his way to the nomination Bush said of TrumpWith Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourthplace finish in New Hampshire Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before  boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audienceThe audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush though Trump once again accused them of representing Bushs special interests and lobbyistsTheir most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the US mired more deeply in the Middle East  and blamed the former Florida governors brother for the problems thereTrump initially took issue with Jeb Bushs call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syrias Bashar Assad and sidelining RussiaJeb is so wrong Trump said You have to knock out ISIS  You decide what you have to do after You cant fight two wars at one timeBush though said Russia is not a US ally and Assads hold on power prevents a resolution in the war Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place calling it a big fat mistake that destabilized the Middle EastThey lied about WMDs he saidI am sick and tired of him going after my family Jeb Bush countered saying hes proud of his brothers efforts to keep the country safeTrump then invoked 911 The World Trade Center came down  Thats not keeping us safeRubio who has often been at odds with Bush leapt to his brothers defense saying the Bush administration kept us safeJeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trumps invitation to an upcoming rally with George W Bush on the campaign trailThe fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will haveSeveral candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy and wait for the next president to make that decision Trump though said he doesnt expect Obama to wait and called on Senate Republicans to hold up any nominationKasich urged Obama to put the country first and not move forward with a nomination a plea echoed by Rubio Obama though said minutes before the start of the debate that he indeed plans to nominate a successorThe GOP candidates meanwhile used opening remarks to honor Scalias legacyCruz called him a legal giant who changed the arc of American legal history He said Scalias death also underscores the stakes of this electionWe are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion by states threaten gun rights and undermine religious liberty Cruz said He said he would appoint a strict constitutionalist if electedScalias death thrusts the issue of judicial appointments into the 2016 race raising the possibility that the next president immediately will have to fill a high court vacancy While Obama vowed Saturday to nominate a successor its unclear whether he can get any appointee confirmed in the Republicanled SenateWhile the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy now looms over the race the South Carolina primary already was heating up on several fronts in recent days with the candidates trading accusations on immigration and other issuesThe debate Saturday reflects that tougher tone in a state notorious for bareknuckle primary battles Trump at one point accused Cruz of trying to spread rumors in the state that hes not running in South Carolina  likening that to his campaigns actions in Iowa where representatives spread false rumors that Carson was dropping outNasty guy now I know why he doesnt have one endorsement from any of his colleagues Trump saidEven Kasich struggled to avoid the fray as Bush criticized him for expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and said that would create more debtHe knows that Im not for ObamaCare Kasich said before vowing to stay positive The GOP field is now down to six candidates  after New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina dropped out following low finishes Tuesday in the New Hampshire primaryA big question Saturday night and going forward was whether Rubio could regain his momentum  following last weekends lackluster performance A withering attack by Christie on Rubio which had the Florida senator repeating himself appeared to hurt him in the New Hampshire primary Rubio himself blamed his debate performance in part for his fifthplace finish in the state He finished behind Trump Kasich Cruz and Bush Christie though is no longer on stage or in the raceMost polling in South Carolina still shows Rubio third with Trump and Cruz in the top two positions respectively
