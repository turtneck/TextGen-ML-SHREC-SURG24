Katie Walsh the Republican National Committees chief of staff was just a few hours from meeting with Donald Trumps new political director this week when the television outside her office blared the latest news breaking out of the Trump orbit Christie defends Trump Hes not a racist the CNN headline declaredThe scene illustrates the tricky task facing the party which is serving as the main engine behind Trumps presidential bid How do you a run a disciplined campaign for a candidate who is anything butHes the nominee and hes going to make sure his views are known Walsh said carefully during an interview Hes made that pretty clear We will leave it to Mr Trump to speak for Mr Trump  and we will keep hitting Hillary and raising money to be ready for NovemberTrumps failure to build a truly national campaign has left it to the GOP to run one on his behalf while also trying to extinguish the regular political brush fires set off by the unpredictable candidate The arrangement has intensified the burden on the Republican National Committee forcing it to absorb core campaign tasks and testing whether it has improved the field and data capabilities on which it fell short in 2012The real estate moguls operation has centered on his ability to gobble up news time with a stream of tweets rallies and television hits while largely outsourcing basic political functions such as fundraising and rapidresponse efforts He is leaning on the RNC even more as the race moves into the generalelection phase which requires intensive work to identify persuade and mobilize votersThe Trump campaign has yet to build out its headquarters or national staff ending the primaries with 70 employees compared with 732 on the payroll for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton His backstop is the party The RNC has deployed 461 field staffers to 16 states  more than it has ever had on the ground at this point in an election  while spending 100 million on its data and digital operations since the last presidential campaign The investments were pushed by Chairman Reince Priebus after the Democrats outgunned the GOP in 2012It creates an opportunity for the party to for lack of a better term show off what its been working on for the last three and a half years and provide the campaign with the infrastructure they dont have the time to build right now Walsh saidWe are kind of the infantry coming up behind the campaign saying Were here How can we be helpful And the Trump campaign has embraced that she addedFor the RNC to successfully take over many of the campaigns traditional tasks requires trust coordination and a unified strategy  all difficult to achieve under normal circumstances But this year is anything but normalPriebus ended up deeply immersed in a behindthescenes effort this week to persuade Trump to walk back his accusations that a Latino federal judge was biased against him because of the judges ethnicity even making editing suggestions for the statement that the candidate eventually released according to people familiar with his roleThe rant that could derail Trump  and the GOP rush to get him back on trackThe team they have in place is very good said GOP strategist Mike DuHaime who served as RNC political director during George W Bushs second term and helped guide the 2008 turnout effort I think what ultimately is missing is that it needs to mesh with the nominees  No matter what the RNC does its still up to the campaign to set the directionThat direction has been coming from Trump who serves as his own strategist He personally responds to nearly every critique including that his operation is too meager I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff Trump tweeted this week But small is good flexible save money and number oneSenior RNC officials are offering daily advice and resources to their lessexperienced campaign counterparts Communications strategist Sean Spicer is in constant contact with Trump press secretary Hope Hicks while chief digital officer Gerrit Lansing is coordinating with Trumps small digital staffIts a collaborative effort said campaign manager Corey Lewandowski They are working handinglove with us We are working with their team they are working with our team Everyone is happyParty officials have been making the case that the campaign needs to expand its footprint but persuading Trump has been a slow process The candidate scrutinizes proposed budgets sending them back with skeptical queries according to people familiar with the discussions His main argument I spent only 56 million in the primary and I beat 16opponents  why do I need all thisIts not so much We dont trust you its Help me understand why I need this Walsh said of the campaigns reaction Theres a dialogue that maybe wouldnt exist with a more traditional candidate that had used more traditional methods in his primary campaignLewandowski said the campaign will soon expand its political communications and fundraising teams We will keep growing theres no doubt about it he said Among the additions political director Jim Murphy a longtime GOP consultant who was tapped after predecessor Rick Wiley was abruptly dismissedMany Trump supporters dont believe his wildest promises  and they dont careBecause of his unrivaled ability to reach millions of voters through social media many party officials think that Trump will be able to forgo some of the expenses that have bloated presidential campaigns in the pastLook Donald Trump has thrown out the rule book and rewritten it and run the most nontraditional unorthodox campaign in my lifetime and its worked so far said Steve Duprey an RNC committeeman from New HampshireStill even roundtheclock media domination will not be enough to secure an Election Day victory GOP strategists warnedPeople can talk all they want to about how this race will be determined on the bigpicture message and Hillarys approval numbers and how horrible they are said Matt Borges chairman of the Ohio Republican Party It always comes down to good oldfashioned blocking and tackling We turn out our voters we win They do a better job they winAnd the underfunded state parties alone cannot carry the weight of a fall turnout operation which typically is buttressed by hundreds of presidential campaign staffersGetting the right voters to the polls to support Trump and the rest of the GOP ticket falls to Chris Carr a garrulous Louisiana native who serves as the RNCs political director From his thirdfloor office at RNC headquarters Carr has spent the past 16 months remaking the partys field program In doing so he has looked at the RNCs vaunted turnout apparatus in 2004 for lessons increasing the emphasis on volunteer training and metricsHe also has studied the methods used by President Obamas team which he saw up close as the Nevada state director for Republican nominee Mitt Romneys campaign in 2012 Romneys main field office in the state that year was in Summerlin down the street from a small Obama for America officeAny time of the day you could go and pull on that door it was locked Carr recalled We were like what is this guy doing  He was in his turf working He was organizingCarr has sought to bring that model to the RNC Rather than assign staff to battleground states based on population the terrain has been carved up into small turfs that each contain 8000 to 10000 lowpropensity or swing voters The party deployed an early wave of staffers last fall to key states to focus on voter registration Volunteers have been cultivated with oneonone coffee meetings and monthly house partiesBeginning last Friday each state team was required to begin a daily doorknocking regimen  an effort that will feed fresh voter data into the national database through Nov 8 Augmenting the partys voter file has been one of the top priorities of the RNC which hopes to weaponize personal information about voters this year the way Obamas team did in 2012Weve spent over 100 million between data and digital over the last four years investing in that voter file making sure we have that ability to know everything we can about every voter out there  not only from a knowledge perspective but how do you talk to them Walsh said Do they respond to email What time of day What issues do they respond toAfter briefing with Trumps chief strategist House Republicans see pivotIn June 2012 the RNC had 170field staffers on the ground now there are more than double that with the largest contingents in Florida 59 Wisconsin 49 Pennsylvania 54 and Ohio 53 That remains short of what the RNC had promised state parties if a nominee had been selected back in March worrying local officials who had hoped for a bigger ground force by now National Republican officials said they are on track to hit their staffing goals by July 31To do so the RNC needs the infusion of cash that usually comes with the selection of a presidential nominee But fundraising has been slow to ramp up in part because Trump largely selffinanced his primary bid and had no structure to solicit donorsIn the meantime the party is seeking to draw on a major resource the Trump campaign can provide enthusiasmThis week the campaign emailed supporters urging them to take part in a national day of action that the RNC is holding Saturday to register new voters Before the Trump appeal went out several hundred volunteers in Virginia had committed to attend By Thursday morning that number had soared to 1000
