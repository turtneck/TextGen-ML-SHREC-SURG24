15 Shares5 8 0 2While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites The Syrian Civil Defence or White HelmetsTheir name of course makes you think of the UNs Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harms way  and the colour of innocence However for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same nameThe SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebelheld territories in Syria and claims that it has in three years rescued about 70000 lives according to its Twitter account or 65 per dayContrary to what you might think it isnt a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO the International Civil Defence Organisation  since 1972The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US 100 million And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place ie in liberated areas where hundreds of groups and some 80 countries mainly NATO members Gulf states and SaudiArabia operateOn the White Helmets briefing page it is stated that funding for their humanitarian relief work is received from the aid budgets of Japan Denmark the Netherlands the United Kingdom and the United StatesHere is how the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen explains the roughly US 9 million to the White helmets from Denmark a country that bombs in both Iraq and SyriaOther civil society and humanitarian organisations inside Syria have not been so fortunate Youve probably not heard that much about the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and its work  How muchlittle support have they received from Western humanitarianconcerned governments And in general civil society organisations in Syria  women peace human rights culture etc  have received nothing like US 100 million in a few years and no one has such a flashy media appearance as the White HelmetsThe White Helmets was started in 2013 by James Le Mesurier who seems to have tried a little of everything everywhere including the grey zones of special forces and intelligence in virtually all NATO wars Yugoslavia in particular He later set up a foundation in Holland to gather the funds Here is a recent account by Scott Ritter  former US Marine Corps intelligence officer and weapons inspector in Iraq with tremendous knowledge of things Middle EastThe organizational underpinnings of the White Helmets can be sourced to a March 2013 meeting in Istanbul between a retired British military officer James Le Mesurierwho had experience in the murky world of private security companies and the shadowy confluence between national security and intelligence operations and international organizationsand representatives of the Syrian National Council SNC and the Qatari Red Crescent Society Earlier that month the SNC was given Syrias seat in the Arab League at a meeting of the league held in QatarAt that meeting the SNC assumed Syrias seat and the Arab League authorized member states to actively provide support including arms and ammunition to the Syrian rebels The Qataris working through the SNC helped assemble for Le Mesurier 300000 in seed money from Japan the United States and the United Kingdom for a sevenday course designed to train and equip a 25person rescue team recruited by the SNC for duty in socalled liberated areas of Syria The SNC made available a pair of Syrian activistsRaed Saleh and Farouq Habibto assist Le Mesurier in this workThe group is  as will be seen below  treated as uncontroversial in virtually all Western mainstream media However there is enough material with documentation to merit cautionIf you read media reports about the White Helmets and do not see the author mention that this groups real identity is disputed and functions controversial you can be sure that you are wasting your time with somebody who is politically incredibly naive or gullible someone who has not done his or her research or is knowingly part of a deceptive effort serving a onesided political agendaThe White Helmets definitely is an controversial NGO  at the same time as it is made difficult to understand clearly what it really isAnd until the whole picture has been developed anyone ought to be cautious with taking information about them at face value So much must be clear given the links belowDual purposeThat said this author has not been on the ground but has studied both the pro et contra links provided belowSome observers draw the conclusion that the White Helmets  Syrian Civil Defence  is purely good guys rescuing lots of people children in particular The opposite advocacy claims that all told they are part of the terrorist groups serve Western governments with intelligence and that their backers run political propaganda in their name and that they are simply executioners  murderers with a human faceBut does it have to be eitherorAn alternative hypothesis could be that the White Helmets is a dualpurposeorganisation They claim to be ordinary Syrian volunteers who came together around the idea of saving lives and are truly altruistic bakers tailors engineers pharmacists painters carpenters students and many more the White Helmets are volunteers from all walks of life It could well be that some of them actually are even a majorityThat doesnt preclude that other elements  not the least those operating outside Syria such as foundations PR and marketing firms change organisations NATO government and NGOs are in it with less noble warpromoting purposesLink collection pro et contraFind below a link collection  long but fascinating in its wealth of information We bring it as a help to those seriously interested in Syrias fate and in studying how opinions are being built by means of connected actors in a rather opaque networking structure in how NGOs have increasingly become Neargovernmental organisations and for those who do not want to sound foolish when they discuss these mattersFirst some links to how the the White Helmets presents themselves Second some mainstream media articles in their favour of and praising it  including some that argue that the White Helmets ought to receive the Nobel Peace Prize which happens to be nonsense since they dont even remotely qualify according to the criteria in Alfred Nobels very clear will and the prize is not a general dogoodprize In addition it must be doubted that the Nobel Committee will get more persuaded by the White Helmets  quite immodest  campaign in favour of their own candidacyThird some links to the comprehensive network of organisations including governments that the White Helmets seem to be part of  and it is quite a confusing lot with absolutely no transparency  but quite a few investigations have been carried outAnd fourth and final  the main links to investigative reports and other stuff that are sceptical in various degrees to

 of course  began his career with the strategy consultants McKinsey  Company He also happens to be a cofounder ofAvaazAvaaz means voice or song in several languages and the organisation is known by

Jeremy Heimans cofounder of Avaaz too speaks to Forbes about his background and what the two companies doAvaaz is very active in promoting a NoFly Zone in Syria which it explains in a petition text with these words Lets build a resounding global call to Obama and other leaders to stand up to Putin and Assads terror This might be our last best chance to help end this mass murder of defenceless children Add your nameThe sad thing is that it has learnt nothing from its own campaign for a NoFly Zone in Libya John Hanrahan is a former executive director of The Fund for Investigative Journalism and reporter for The Washington Post The Washington Star UPI and other news organisations has made this extremely interesting analysis about how odd it is that Avaaz maintains an interventionist waragenda in spite of earlier experiences and resistance even by highranking militariesHanrahan Quote s Avaazs campaign director former State Department official John Tye that Avaaz shows 54000 members in Syria in a population of 23 million  which means that even if every Avaaz member supported a nofly zone this would still mean that only one of every 426 Syrians had voted for oneAvaaz spearheads  at least in this matter  an extreme militarist policy while Avaaz is a global web movement to bring peoplepowered politics to decisionmaking everywhere Which people want a NoFly Zone in Syria Do they know its a violation of a sovereign states airspace of international law That it would embolden every terrorist on Syrian soil because they would get rid of the Syrian Airforce as their enemy That it continued into regime change in both Iraq and LibyaMany questions unanswered by this peculiar people power organisation more militarist than governmentsBut back to Purposecom and one of its important clientsThe Syria Campaign  homeThey maintain on their website that The Syria Campaign is fiercely independent and has accepted no money from governments corporations or anyone directly involved in the Syrian conflict This allows us full autonomy to advocate for whatever is needed to save lives But they also say that they have accepted funds from the Asfari Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation and other anonymous donorsThe Syria Campaign also states that it is only prohuman rights and profreedom and takes no side But they explain the conflict in these wordsThe regime of Bashar alAssad is responsible for crushing a peaceful uprising that has led to the deaths of over 450000 people the displacement of over 12 million  half the country  and the emergence of violent extremist groups like IsisToday the fighting in Syria has given way to a world war with more than eighty countries involved on all sidesThe majority of Syrians want neither Assad nor Isis They want an end to the violence and a democratic SyriaWhat is happening in Syria could be happening to any of us No one is free until were all freeI would characterise such a presentation as

Century WireCrossTalk White Helmets Really with Vanessa Beeley Eva Bartlett  Patrick Henningsen videoRussia TodayMultimillion funded  cant be independentGeneral reasons for concern about the real identity of the White HelmetsHere are some of the reasons  numbers not indicative of priority1 Huge funding by NATOEU countries which are militarily involved2 A degree of political lobbying  a very specific explanation of the conflict and how it started which points to a nofly zone weaponization of human rights issues and speaks strongly against the Syrian government and Russia and very critically of the UN  that is extremely unusual for a purely humanitarian organisation3 Incredibly advanced public relation in terms of very professional websites videos and PR strategy dropping the right stories and images at the right time  quite unique for a group of bakers tailors and students etcOmram rescued from a Russian airstrike  From the White Helmets homepage4 Too professional wordings and images too much playing to exploitation of emotions too catchy smart formulations again and again in short lacking every sense of genuine local quality Too many children  and cats  in the images speaking to an audience with little politically consciousness but surely a good heart In short populist marketing also in the sense of conveying the message Look how good we are and how evil everybody else are5 Guilt by association If the White Helmets is a 100 humanitarian first responder organisation it must be extremely naive in ignoring that its integrity credibility and noble purposes is put at risk with the specific network of organisations and governments that it has chosen to seek support from6 Substance versus public relation how does a humanitarian organisation justify that millions of dollars are spent on selfpromoting public relation rather than on saving more lives in such a horrific war And taking so many photos and shoot films of its own work in the midst of massacres and bombing raids7 Its very difficult to discern who actually manages the White Helmets in general and in terms of daytoday operations One looks in vain for something like an organisational chart secretarygeneral board executive director although one is mentioned Raed Saleh whom the US has on one occasion actually denied entry into the US8 How come that such an innovative organisation seems to have been started in circles that have to do with oil interests British intelligence mercenarymilitary operations and interventionistbombing countries9 How come it works only in rebelterroristliberated areas Could it do that without cooperation or coordination with some of these groups It has been stated  naively  by the Right Livelihood Award Foundation that their vision is to operate also on governmentcontrolled territory and later be a leader in rebuilding a new democratic postwar Syria However why should the sovereign state of Syrias legitimate government accept a foreignbased and financed civil defence territory there when it has had its own since 1953Perhaps we should not be that surprisedShould we be surprised that humanitarian workers are involved in something else and are not exclusively devoted to doing no harm and doing good for humanityNot really Ive met that sort of people and organisations during the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s among other places at the US Embassy in Zagreb where the humanitarian section people most likely CIA operatives after some talk with me about helping the people switched to talk about how good it would be if president Milosevic was killedAre humanitarian organisations  like most other NGOs today  highly or completely dependent on governments Yes most are And they should therefore always be checked for possible moral corruption and cooptation Many are no longer Non but Neargovernmental and behave at minimum politically correct or servepromote the interests of their governments one way or the otherWasnt Doctors Without Borders started by Bernard Kouchner who advocated military humanitarian intervention as an idea did the dirty job for NATO in Kosovo and morally advocated the bombing of Libya as a peace guarantee Here an interesting video debate with him at Oxford by Mehdi HasanShould it be so surprising that  even liberal democratic  governments propagandise construct concrete stories to appeal to the human heart in us all for a good cause and that they regularly lie do fearmongering use stereotyping and demonisation present blackandwhite narratives  all of which serve their elites interests and may not always be that noble in realityThink of the ugly shadow world of the global arms trade in which virtually all governments take part inOf course not No wars would be possible without one of more of these ingredientsThink of the  invented  story about the Iraqi soldiers who kicked out babies of incubators in Kuwait city  all invented as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by American Hill  Knowlton for the Kuwaiti governmentOr remember James Harf of the US public relations firm Ruder and Finn  who in 1991 was hired by the Croatian and Bosnian governments as well as by the KosovoAlbanians to create and promote an antiSerb attitude in the Western mediaSays Harf We were able to equate Serbs to Nazis in public opinion Some kind of balance or truth didnt interest him We are professionals We have got a job to do and we do itIf there is anything new in this field since the early 1990s it is the spectrum the depth the money and the intensity with which public opinion is being deceived about war and peace  that war today is peace and peace is preserved by violence And the de facto replacement of knowledge and texts by purposedriven mediatized and emotionalised narratives and images and films  right down on you phone and into your mindIn summary Illusions about our goodness that feed social narcissism and the MIMACI do not believe that I know exactly what the whole story and the truth is about the White Helmets But I know that quite a few things dont feel rightAs a sociologist and peace researcher with four decades of academic and practical experience of global affairs and work in conflict zones the word spoken by the guard Marcellus in Shakespeares Hamlet at Kronborg Castle in my native Denmark come to mind There is something rotten in the state not only in the bombing state of Denmark that supports the White Helmets but also in the state of the  free  media coverage of conflicts and warsIf thus you are generally sceptical of Western media coverage of wars fought by the West and specifically of the story of the White Helmets as a purely brave humanitarian organisation  are you then automatically proAssad proRussia or probombing If you are critical to A must you automatically endorse everything B or C doesGiven the Zeitgeist of these times my hunch is that the antiintellectuals the propagandists and the blamegamers answer is a roaring Yes Personally I couldnt care less but there is reason to worry about the fact that our media are not free to take up the issues dealt with herePulitzer prize winner Chris Hedges talks about the incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism The  unwinnable  wars the West fights with the illusory ideology of spreading goodness democracy freedom and peace as well as the alleged good role of the White Helmets in it is little else but an expression of such an incessant manufacturing of illusions that feed social narcissism of the many while filling the pockets of the few in the MilitaryIndustrialMediaAcademic Complex MIMACIts time to give reality show politics and media a reality check But who can and who will And who dares now everything will get worse after November 8
