Joe Biden doesnt sound like a man whos preparing for a grueling presidential campaignThe vice presidents latest remarks on a potential 2016 bid came Thursday night questioning whether he has the emotional energy to run so soon after his eldest son Beau died from brain cancer in MayFor all the chatter and predictions of the past month that Biden was eagerly readying a run the vice president has put forth a different face when he has spoken about a campaign And its one of a grieving father a notyethealed family and someone who certainly doesnt sound mentally prepared for the emotional rigors of the campaign trailI will be straightforward with you The most relevant factor in my decision is whether my family and I have the emotional energy to run Biden said in Atlanta where he was speaking on the Iran nuclear deal He was asked after his remarks about his intentions for a possible campaign Some might think that is not appropriate But unless I can go to my party and the American people and say that I am able to devote my whole heart and my whole soul to this endeavor it would not be appropriateBiden 72 said there were other concerns too  whether he can ramp up a competitive organization with such a late start wooing donors and staff and building infrastructure in early states But those werent driving his decisionThats not the factor a visibly drained Biden told the crowd in a Georgia synagogue The factor is Can I do it Can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment that wed be proud to undertake in ordinary circumstances The honesttoGod answer is I just dont knowBiden is no stranger to tragedy and he has soldiered on in the face of it before Shortly after his election to the Senate in 1972 his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident and his two sons  Beau and Hunter  were badly injured He had to be convinced to even take the oath of office and he did in the hospital beside his childrenThe vice president referenced that first deep loss on Thursday night but said he had learned theres no way to put a timetable on recovery from the scarsIf I can reach that conclusion that we can do it in a fashion that would still make it viable I would not hesitate to do it Biden continued But I have to be honest with you and everyone whos come to me I cant look you straight in the eye and say Now I know I can do that Thats as honest as I can beThis was an even more honest and raw assessment than Democratic insiders heard last week from Biden On a closed conference call with the Democratic National Committee to sell the Iran deal Biden again opened up about his presidential decisionmaking  and didnt sound any closer to pulling the triggerIf I were to announce to run Biden said I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul and right now both are pretty well banged up  Ive given this a lot of thought and dealing internally with the family on how we do thisMultiple reports have said that Beau encouraged him to run before he died and while the idea of a presidential campaign at that point may have seemed feasible its clear the elder Biden is still not ready  and theres no sign when he will beUnfortunately for the vice president the clock is ticking He initially said he would make an announcement by the end of the summer The unofficial end is this Monday on Labor Day but technically by that deadline he has until Sept 22But its actual deadlines that are important instead of symbolic ones The first Democratic debate on Oct 13 is on the horizon and filing deadlines are approaching It may be true that Hillary Clinton has stumbled but its insurgent Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders not Biden whos been the beneficiary of those foiblesOnly someone with the name identification and builtin political advantages like Bidens could even make such a late play and if he did pull the trigger he would be a formidable candidate Hes the last wild card on either side before the 2016 field is crystallized And a superPAC backing him Draft Biden has staffed up in recent weeks with notable hires and close Biden alliesBiden may give a more direct answer next week when he will appear on one of Stephen Colberts first Late Show episodes on CBS The more relaxed comedy setting may be one where Biden feels more comfortable and more free to be frankBut Biden has already been pretty transparent already  and all signs so far point to him not getting in
