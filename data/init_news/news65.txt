It was not supposed to end like this for Marco RubioEleven months ago he launched his presidential campaign in front of Miamis Freedom Tower the Ellis Island for his and other Cuban families In his rapid rise young Rubio had been a darling of both the tea party movement and the conservative intelligentsia  the Republicans best hope of attracting nonwhite votersBut then came vulgar Donald Trump Rubio was savaged on everything from immigration to his height On Tuesday night Rubio his campaign fading lost his home state of Florida to the bigoted demagogue who makes scapegoats of foreigners and minorities Bowing to the inevitable Rubio ended his candidacyBy the time Rubios campaign bus rolled to its final preprimary stop  an outdoor basketball court here where he played as a boy  only a couplehundred supporters were on hand nearly equaled by the number of journalists on death watchBefore Rubio arrived a prankster hijacked the microphone and was chased off by campaign aides When Rubio himself spoke the sound system failed so he delivered his valedictory with a bullhornThe GOP establishment has failed Its up to voters to deny TrumpRubios voice sounded tinny but his words were rich with nostalgia as he recalled knocking on doors when he ran for city commissioner here In between sips of sweet Cuban coffee I heard the stories of their youth of the dreams they lost he said That has carried me every single day throughout this campaign knowing that my worst days are better than some of the best days that many people in this community have hadThese are not the best days for Rubio or for anybody who cares about American democracy The 44yearold made mistakes during his campaign freezing in the New Hampshire debate failing to take on Trump earlier then finally attacking Trump by joking about genitaliaYet he finished honorably He spoke reflectively Monday about Trumps brutal transformation of politics This message should have been delivered much earlier but it deserves to be heard even nowLeadership is not about going to an angry and frustrated people and saying you should be even angrier and more frustrated and you should be angry and frustrated at each other Rubio told a gym full of Christian college students in West Palm Beach Thats called demagoguery And its dangerous It leads he said to where we are today a nation where people literally hate each other because theyre voting for different candidates  And it leaves us incapable of solving problemsTrump tore up the norms of decency that remained in American politics and Rubio expressed puzzlement that it worked My whole life Ive been told being humble is a virtue and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and selfabsorbed is somehow a virtue he said My whole life Ive been told no matter how you feel about someone you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God  and now being respectful to one another is considered political correctnessRubio voiced regret for his own role in the vulgarity saying he felt terrible for joking about Trumps penis size Such remorse separates Rubio from Trump who seems to have no shame as he blurts obscenities delivers insults and winks at violence There are people I know who like this stuff because he says what they want to be able to say but presidents cant say whatever they want to say Rubio told the students mentioning the harm to Americas reputation that Trump has already done Were not a Third World country Were the United States of AmericaDonald Trump just threatened more violence Only this time its directed at the GOPThats the welcoming country to which Rubios parents immigrated settling among the shoebox homes here in Cuban West Miami Everywhere I go I tell the story of this community of people many of whom lost their country in their youth Rubio said Monday night in his boyhood park his kids beside him in the bed of his Dodge pickupHe spoke in English then in Spanish with the requisite optimism telling supporters he looked forward to moving his caja china  Cuban barbecue  to the White HouseIf theres no car well go in a raft a supporter said in SpanishAnother said in English Dont give up manBut Rubios speech to his modest band had the ring of a farewell I will always be a son of this community I will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of generations that made possible the dreams of mine he said His candidacy he said was possible because you and I happen to live in the one place on Earth where even the son of a bartender and a maid from West Miami can be presidentOr at least he can lose to a trashtalking rich guy from QueensRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
