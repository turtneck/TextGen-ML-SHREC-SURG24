Leading Republicans say the party of Abraham Lincoln is facing disruption because in the past few decades it has lost its commitment to unifying ideals such as freedom and human dignityRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a Purple Heart given to him by a veteran during a campaign event at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn Va on Aug 2 2016 Mr Trumps denigration of a Muslim immigrant couples loss of their son Humayun Khan  who died fighting for the American military in Iraq  has triggered a backlash from some prominent RepublicansA report that the Republican National Committee is preparing for the possibility that Donald Trump might drop out of the presidential race has set the political world alightTheres no evidence that Mr Trump in fact is on the verge of dropping out But there are reports of deep discord within his campaign and signs of an unraveling of the partys fragile unity that had lasted through the GOP convention in Cleveland until now The moment is so fraught with discord that major Republicans increasingly are giving up on the party altogetherTrumps most controversial move was his repeated denigration of Khizr and Ghazala Khan the immigrant parents of a fallen MuslimAmerican soldier after Mr Khan spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention last week But its also an accumulation of brash moves  a daily unwillingness both to show the kind of restraint expected of a presidential candidate and to behave as a loyal RepublicanHow has the Grand Old Party founded in 1854 by antislavery activists come to this point It may not be all Trumps fault though he personifies the problem Leading Republicans say the party of Abraham Lincoln is facing disruption because in the past few decades it has lost its commitment to unifying ideals such as freedom and human dignityIn recent days a Republican member of Congress Richard Hanna of New York and a wellknown business executive and Republican fundraiser Meg Whitman announced their support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Congressman Hanna is the first sitting member to endorse Mrs ClintonOther stalwarts of the Republican establishment are beginning to write off their beloved partyI dont think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way Republican intellectual Avik Roy told Vox last week Theres going to be a disruptionMr Roy a healthcare expert and past presidential campaign adviser said he believed the GOP had lost its moral authority to govern because it was no longer committed to equality for all AmericansAnd that was before Trumps latest uproarTrumps decision to spend days verbally attacking the Khans may wind up being the biggest blow of all to his tenuous relationship with the GOPTrump exacerbated his schism with the party Tuesday when he refused to endorse Ryan and another senior Republican running for reelection Sen John McCain of Arizona In another unusual move Trumps running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence announced Wednesday that he is endorsing Speaker RyanI strongly support Paul Ryan strongly endorse his reelection Governor Pence said emphatically Wednesday on Fox NewsBoth Ryan and McCain had endorsed Trump despite their clear discomfort with his candidacy over both his bombastic style and positions that dont square with party orthodoxyBut the Republican Party is a club and the rules are the rules unwritten though they are When the party appears headed toward selecting a nominee the party closes ranks around that person for better or worseWith Trump theres been a whole lot more worse than better latelyIt has reached the point where allies of Trump  RNC chairman Reince Priebus former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani  are reportedly plotting an intervention with the candidate to get him to reset his campaignBut few have serious hope that Trump is really willing to change his ways Trump has said that he knows how to be presidential  but chooses not to His current shtick has taken him far he says so why change Hell be presidential after he defeats Clinton he addsIn other words this Trump  the unpredictable populist mesmerizing profane Trump  is the nominee and the one the party will ride all the way to November Or maybe notWord on Wednesday morning that RNC officials were contemplating the possibility that Trump might quit  leaving it up to the 168member RNC to find a replacement  seemed to send public discourse into the realm of political science fictionBut really the idea that Trump may not last three more months as the GOP nominee seemed to reflect more the confusion and frustration of party leaders over Trumps behavior than any real prospect that the hypercompetitive Trump might actually drop outThe GOP arrived at this point in part byhappenstanceWhen 17 candidates ran for the Republican nomination there was nothing the party leadership could do to winnow the field and anoint an establishment favorite who could take on the outsiders  not only Trump but also Texas Sen Ted Cruz The invisible primary  in which fundraising debates endorsements and poll numbers present an early picture of candidate strength  left the field large right up until the first caucusTrumps distinct style and populist message broke through the clutter of the large field and sent him to the top of the heapBut a large field in and of itself wouldnt necessarily lead to the potential demise of the Republican Party It is Trump himself who is taking the GOP to the point of no return some say In the view of Avik Roy it is the partys dark racial past that has been its own undoing  a past that Trump has played to in courting white workingclass votersRoy traces the problem back to 1964 when the party nominated Barry Goldwater for president  the original movement conservative He calls Senator Goldwaters nomination a historical disaster because for the ensuing decades it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rightsMichael Gerson former speechwriter for President George W Bush tells the same story in a different way He writes of visiting the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis on the same day that Trump was attacking the Khans Mr Gerson sees in that attack a repudiation of what Abraham Lincoln the first Republican president and the Rev Martin Luther King stood forThose who support Trump are setting the Republican Party at odds with the American story told by Lincoln and King a nationalism defined by striving toward unifying ideals of freedom and human dignity Mr Gerson writesAt this point thats unlikely to happen Most Republicans say theyd rather stick with the nominee they have no matter how flawed than blow up the party before Election Day by abandoning him But if Trump loses a period of time in the wilderness may be beneficial to the party they add
