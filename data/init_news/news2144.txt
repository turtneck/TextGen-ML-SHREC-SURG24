Home  World  Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy Britain No Longer a Sovereign Democracy By Anzu Legion 03112016 134113 LONDON  England  Britain is no longer a sovereign democratic nation when 175 million people who voted for Brexit can be swept aside with illegal injunctions When Britain is being ruled by those who wish harm upon these shores from foreign nations and pander to other nations to invade then there is no reason to believe that we are living in a democratic sovereign nation This is the case when 175 million people voted on June 23 to leave the European Union only to be overstepped by a few treasonous vipers who misled the High Court possibly due to corruption at the highest levels of the system The EU referendum was a legally bound vote with promises from the political establishment that the result would be respected To have the wrath of 175 million people on you will not be a nice thing it will not be pleasant because the people never forget and the coming election will result in some major changes We are currently embroiled within a constitutional crisis where the will of the people is being superseded by a few litigational scum bags who do not realise the enormity of their decision to thwart the will of the people Boycott You have condemned all members of parliament who supported Remain to unemployment You will never be voted in again including Theresa May who shoehorned herself into the role of prime minister Guyanese Gina Miller who was instrumental in this decision is not even British she is some investment banker cunt with no mandate to thwart the EU referendum As for the judges involved you have no right to undermine the will of the people It is most certainly a question of corruption at the highest levels where these supposed upholders of law are working against the law and undermining democracy and Britains sovereign rights 175 million people voted for Brexit and 175 million people will have their say in 2020 when the right people will be put in charge The people never forget
