It sounds corny to say it like that but I dont know how to say it and be believed I know that because having experienced this emotion from the inside for most of my life I sure as hell resisted believing it when I heard people saying itTheres no one more resistant to being empathized with or more prone to call attempts to do so patronizing than the bitter lonely guy especially when women try to do it but even when other nerdy guys try to reach out People like Captain Awkward and Dr Nerdlove and the founders of the Good Men Project spend huge chunks of their lives trying to help nerdy guys but still get regularly blasted with extreme vitriol as feminist SJWs by said nerdy guysIve tried to write sympathetically about this stuff in the past the guilt the shame the constant feelings of inadequacy Indeed part of the reason I am so determined to write and speak up and be an activist is a shamefaced admission of how lucky Ive been to get away from where I was a few short years ago how amazing a turning point 2014 was for me while being a terrible year for everyone elseThe viral meme that inaugurated 2015 as the New Year of the Bitter Male Nerd is MIT professor Scott Aaronson leaving an emotionally vulnerable comment on his blog during a heated argument about misogyny and sexual harassment in the STEM communityHe talks about how in the battle of the sexes awkward shy guys damn sure dont feel privileged How he in particular was plagued with guilt and fear over approaching women constantly selfcastigating over the possibility that he was a sexual harasser or a rapist to the point where he asked a therapist about the possibility of chemical castration He talks of reading Andrea Dworkin and other radical feminists who make him feel as a man like a monsterAnd he concludes as a result of this that feminism is a destructive force for men like him that the bias of the world is tilted in favor of women and womens issues because everyone is talking about how to help victims of harassment and sexual assault and no one is talking about how to help himAnd it sucks Im not trying to deny that it sucks Although I was never as bad off as Scott Aaronson Ive felt a lot of those feelings and more importantly Ive known my share of guys who were that bad off It seems in every group of nerdy guys Ive known theres one guy whos trapped in a feedback loop of anxiety and selfloathing when it comes to women that goes around and around in circlesFeminists on the Internet have tried to respond to Aaronsons piece some sympathetically some less soI dont want to rehash all the points Amanda Marcotte and Laurie Penny made Nor do I have some magic way of squaring the circle and making everything okay for guys like Scott  for both him and me high school was a long time ago and the only thing that really heals these wounds isnt any stirring speech or specific program of selfimprovement but just timeBut I will say something that as a guy whos Been There seems obvious to me and necessary to sayNone of the pain Scott talks about came from things that happened to him They came from things that happened inside his head He speaks in generalities about sexual assault prevention workshops or of feeling targeted by feminist literature  himself saying that he was perversely drawn to the most radical and aggressive rhetoric he could find eschewing more moderate writers for the firebreathing of Dworkin and MacKinnonHe doesnt talk about anyone targeting or harassing him personally  indeed how could he be targeted by books written by secondwave feminists when he was a toddler  but of feeling targeted of having an accusatory voice inside his mind tormenting him with a pervasive sense of inadequacy uncleanness wrongness It doesnt seem like anyone in his life was particularly giving him a hard time but that he was giving himself a hard time and picking up on any critical or negative messages directed at men in general as a way to amplify his negative thoughtsAs someone whos no stranger to those conditions we call depression and anxiety I can relate to Scott As someone whose circle of friends is also no stranger to those conditions and as someone whos read David Foster Wallaces seminal take on the topic I also cant blame anyone for being frustrated with ScottDepression at its core doesnt really make sense but its really great at hijacking the rest of your brain to make itself make sense and when the depressed person in question is highly intelligent you end up with an immaculately logical tower of reasoning for why their depression is wholly rational and inevitableThats how I feel when I look at Scotts impassioned argument that the dating scene is set up to grind shy awkward nerds into the dirt while letting jockish Neanderthals have all the women they want I could point out plenty of evidence statistical and anecdotal that this is not in fact the case as commenters in that thread in fact do  but what would be the point You cant argue with emotions that deeply ingrainedWhats striking to me is that this comes up because Scott very passionately wants to debate that nerds dont have male privilege and that nerdy guys are the victims not perpetrators of sexism He is arguing this to a commenter posting under the name Amy who argues that shy nerdy guys are in fact plenty dangerous on the grounds that she has been raped by a shy nerdy boyfriend and that in her life experience around shy nerdy guys shes seen plenty of shy nerdy guys commit harassment and assault and use their shy nerdiness as a shield against culpability for itTo be blunt Scotts story is about Scott himself spending a lot of time by himself hating himself When he eventually stops hating himself and as an older more mature nerd asks women out no women mace him slap him or ritually humiliate him  instead he ends up with a girlfriend who ends up becoming a wife So far so typical Amys story is about being harassed and groped by men in the tech world and eventually being raped by a shy nerdy guy she thought she trusted So far so also typical Whats the biggest difference between Scotts and Amys stories Scotts story is about things that happened inside his brain Amys story is about actual things that were done to her by other people against her will without her control And Scott and his commenters are treating the two as worthy of equivalent degrees of scrutiny This isnt a new or unique instance of this kind of blind spot going on We all know about the Gamergate firestorm where a bunch of anonymous guys on the Internet felt harassed and insulted by an article making general criticisms about gamer culture as a whole and deciding to react by harassing specific individual women including calling a SWAT team to someones house and treating it as though these two things are equivalent Its similar to an earlier instance when nerd persecution was cried when Rebecca Watson talked publicly about being made to feel uncomfortable in an elevator at a conference for atheist thinkers by a guy hitting on her at 400 am Watson didnt name the guy didnt share the guys social media handle didnt show a photo of the guy The guy remains anonymous to this day She wasnt even particularly mean to him  her Guys dont do that is exactly the kind of blunt wellintentioned advice guys like Scott say they want But people acted like Watson by speaking up about something a guy did to make her feel uncomfortable had viciously attacked the guy  and by extension viciously attacked all shy awkward guys  and therefore felt justified in viciously attacking her in return This turns out to be a pattern For most of us sex is a big part of our lives and our relationship to gender therefore a weighted and fraught thing We all have hangups and neuroses and theyre much more likely to manifest in the way we see sexual attraction and relationships than in the way we do our taxes No one actually said men have it easy But men are the ones who by and large get to deal with this as an internal matter Women are the ones who have to deal with internal hangups and as Laurie Penny points out in her piece external threats from other people Guys deal with Women in the abstract as a category women deal with specific men who physically threaten them Guys claim to be harassed more often online than women do but when guys are harassed it means being exposed to a generalized atmosphere of nasty comments and rude behavior By contrast women are the ones who get singled out stalked who become unwilling celebrities with a horde of people dedicated to taking her down This is what Laurie Penny means  or one of the things she means  when she says that the harm the patriarchy causes women is structural Not that all women have it worse than all men Not that anyone gets away without getting at least a little screwed up by the arbitrary unreasonable demands our culture makes of us But that its women who disproportionately bear the burden of actual harm of being directly victimized by other people I dont know what the best way is to help guys like Scott Aaronson who wrestle with internal demons Internal demons are slippery things I do know that what could help women like Amy is to find the guys who are doing bad things to her and stop those guys from doing that Thats why feminism is more focused on womens issues than mens because womens issues are the things happening out in the world where we can do something about them Similarly no one gets away without having hangups and neuroses about race but racism  the systematic denial of access to financial and social capital the being kept out of jobs the being harassed and shot by law enforcement  is something that happens to black people in this country and not to whites The questions of how to deal with the roles weve been handed down by our parents and our culture and how we parse how much of it is our own personality problems and our own psychology versus our cultural inheritance  thats a problem all of us have and maybe will continue to have for the rest of human history But the problem of people being assaulted harassed raped killed Thats an external physical problem Thats something we can do something about I dont know how women as a group can help men with the problems he describes I can testify from my own experience that getting laid does not in and of itself magically make anything better and that if Scott believes as he says that living in an era when he wouldve had an arranged marriage at a young age wouldve made his problems vanish hes probably wrong But meanwhile women are getting stalked and raped and killed Thats something that men are doing and that men can stop other men from doing And with apologies to my fellow emotionally tortured guys that really ought to be our priority
