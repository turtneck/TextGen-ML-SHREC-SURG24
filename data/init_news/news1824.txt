Why Time Magazines Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton Rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake November 4 2016 Joseph Klein Time Magazines Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled Why Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors the novel based on about Bill Clintons first presidential campaign in 1992 The other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the 30year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media Sorry but Hillarys wounds are selfinflicted Her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the payforplay Clinton Foundation There is one part of Trump that is indisputably real his ego the other Joe Klein wrote as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace Those who would put Clintons failings in the same league as Trumps depravities are delusional declared Klein I agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain He did not hand pick Hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly The government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe How can you keep a country safe asked Stevens former fianc in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi as Hillary did Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act as Hillary did In short anyone who thinks that Hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trumps depravities is delusional The other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the Hispanics the Muslims the women and yes even the veterans Yet much of Hillarys pitch is genderbased Elect her because she is a woman And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable The other Joe Klein charges that Trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right To paraphrase Bill Clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against AfricanAmericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined I dont think so Hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society At the Women in the World Summit last year for example Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans reminiscent of President Obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in 2008 Hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform There needs to be a Catholic Spring in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church wrote Sandy Newman president of Voices for Progress in an email to Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta In response Podesta picked up on the spring theme He wrote We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now Likewise Catholics United Like most Spring movements I think this one will have to be bottom up When Time Magazines Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society he should get out of his Washington DC bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their daytoday concerns Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda
