Washington CNN The future of health care in America is on the table  and in serious jeopardy  Wednesday morning in the Supreme CourtAfter more than an hour of arguments the Supreme Court seemed divided in a case concerning what Congress meant in one very specific fourword clause of the Affordable Care Act with respect to who is eligible for subsidies provided by the federal government to help people buy health insuranceIf the Court ultimately rules against the Obama administration more than 5 million individuals will no longer be eligible for the subsidies shaking up the insurance market and potentially dealing the law a fatal blow A decision likely will not be announced by the Supreme Court until May or JuneAll eyes were on Chief Justice John Roberts  who surprised many in 2012 when he voted to uphold the law  he said next to nothing in a clear strategy not to tip his hand either wayRoberts whos usually a very active participant in oral arguments said almost nothing for an hour and a half said CNNs Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin who attended the arguments Roberts was so much a focus of attention because of his vote in the first Obamacare case in 2012 that he somehow didnt want to give people a preview of how he was thinking in this case  He said barely a wordThe liberal justices came out of the gate with tough questions for Michael Carvin the lawyer challenging the Obama administrations interpretation of the law which is that in states that choose not to set up their own insurance exchanges the federal government can step in run the exchanges and distribute subsidiesCarvin argued it was clear from the text of the law that Congress authorized subsidies for middle and low income individuals living only in exchanges established by the states Just 16 states have established their own exchanges but millions of Americans living in the 34 states are receiving subsidies through federally facilitated exchangesBut Justice Elena Kagan suggested the law should be interpreted in its whole context and not in the one snippet of the law that is the focus of the challengersWe look at the whole text We dont look at four words she said Kagan also referred to the legal challenges to the law as the neverending sagaJustice Sonia Sotomayor was concerned that in the states where the individuals may not be able to receive subsidies Were going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoidAnd Sotomayor wondered why the four words that so bother the challengers did not appear more prominently in the law She said it was like hiding a huge thing in a mousetrapDo you really believe that states fully understood she asked Carvin that those with federally run exchanges were not going to get subsidiesJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the four words at issue were buried and not in the body of the legislation where you would expect to find themJustice Anthony Kennedy asked questions that could be interpreted for both sides but he was clearly concerned with the federalism aspects of the caseLet me say that from the standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism he said to Carvin It does seem to me that there is something very powerful to the point that if your argument is accepted the states are being told either create your own exchange or well send your insurance market into a death spiralHe grilled Carvin on the serious consequences for those states that had set up federallyfacilitated exchangesIt seems to me that under your argument perhaps you will prevail in the plain words of the statute theres a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument Kennedy saidThe IRS  which is charged with implementing the law  interprets the subsidies as being available for all eligible individuals in the health exchanges nationwide in both exchanges set up by the states and the federal government In Court  Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr defended that position He ridiculed the challengers argument saying it revokes the promise of affordable care for millions of Americans  that cannot be the statute that Congress intendedBut he was immediately challenged by Justice Antonin ScaliaIt may not mean the statute they intended the question is whether its the statute they wrote he saidAlthough as usual Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing Justice Samuel Alito was also critical of Verrillis argument He said if it were true that some of the states were caught off guard that the subsidies were only available to those in state run exchanges why didnt more of them sign amicus briefs And he refuted the notion that the sky might fall if the challengers were to prevail by saying the Court could stay any decision until the end of the tax seasonOn that point Scalia suggested Congress could actYou really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue he askedVerrilli paused and to laughter said Well this Congress Kennedy did ask Verrilli a question that could go to the heart of the case wondering if it was reasonable that the IRS would have been charged with interpreting a part of the law concerning billions of dollars in subsidiesOnly Ginsburg brought up the issue of standing  whether those bringing the lawsuit have the legal right to be in Court which suggested that the Court will almost certainly reach the mandates of the casePresident Barack Obama has expressed confidence in the legal underpinning of the law in recent daysThere is in our view not a plausible legal basis for striking it down he told Reuters this weekWednesdays hearing marks the third time that parts of the health care law have been challenged at the Supreme CourtIn this case  King v Burwell  the challengers say that Congress always meant to limit the subsidies to encourage states to set up their own exchanges But when only 16 states acted they argue the IRS tried to move in and interpret the law differentlyRepublican critics of the law such as Texas Sen Ted Cruz filed briefs warning that the executive was encroaching on Congress lawmaking function and that the IRS interpretation opens the door to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government spendingHatch said Republicans would work with the states and give them the freedom and flexibility to create better more competitive health insurance markets offering more options and different choicesIn Court Verrilli stressed that four words  established by the state  found in one section of the law were a term of art meant to include both state run and federally facilitated exchangesHe argued the justices need only read the entire statute to understand Congress meant to issue subsidies to all eligible individuals enrolled in all of the exchangesDemocratic congressmen involved in the crafting of the legislation filed briefs on behalf of the government arguing that Congress intent was to provide insurance to as many people as possible and that the challengers position is not consistent with the text and history of the statuteLast week Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell warned that if the government loses it has prepared no back up plan to undo the massive damage
