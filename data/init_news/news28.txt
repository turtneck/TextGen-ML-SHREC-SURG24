If you want a glimpse into a presidential candidates governing style take a look at his campaign How does he build an organization How does he manage personnel How does he delegate responsibility Does he value loyalty or honesty in advisers Its hardly conclusive but how a candidate deals with these challenges says a lot about what theyd prioritize as presidentThe presumptive Republican nominee has managed his campaign the way he manages his casinos or his realty TV program haphazardly and with an unearned arrogance Everythings about the brand and nonsycophants are cast aside Getting it right is far less important than being right Thus when prompted by advisers todial down the rhetoric and think more about his longterm viability Trump has resisted Hes yet to understand how different a primary and a general election are and hes too cocksure to listen to anyone who tries to explain itTrump isnt as stupid as he pretends to be but his confidence seems to scale with his ignorance and thats a dangerous trait in a president given how consequential each decision can beAs a candidate a confident idiot can make a lot of noise and fool a lot of voters But you cant lead that way As president Trump would need the sober advice of serious professionals Considering how little he understands about the job and the world this is especially true in his caseBased on the latest behindthescenes reports on Trumps campaign as well as his entire history in real estate and television its unlikely he would govern with the humility and selfawareness required The campaign has undergone several shakeups in recent months with key staffers like Corey Lewandowski being demoted to make way for veteran operatives like Paul Manafort Trumps approach has remained very much the same however Everyone he brings in bends to his will or is replaced by someone who doesThings have gotten more chaotic in the last week or so as Rick Wiley was fired as the campaigns national political director Wiley was known to assert himself in ways that alienated Trump and his loyalistsThe Washington Posts Sean Sullivan and Robert Costa summarized the broader situationover the weekend For the last two months Donald Trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars staff reshuffling and dueling power centers But tensions are more than typical campaign chaos They illustrate how Trump likes to run an organization whether its a real estate venture or his presidential bid Interviews with current and former Trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates wary of delegating major decisions scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him These are the management techniques of a brandhustling magnate not a president of the United States Trumps dictatorial approach works well on the campaign trail but itd be a disaster in office A president has to persuade and compromise The capacity to admit ignorance is equally important Trump by all accounts has no interest in any of these things Trump doesnt know what he needs to know in order to be president nor does he care that he doesnt know If his campaign is any indication hell hire people to ensure his veil of ignorance is never cracked That kind of megalomania is why Trump is who he is  its part of his outsized persona Its also the clearest indicator we have of the kind of president hed be
