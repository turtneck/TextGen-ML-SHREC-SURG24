Donald Trump is an unusual candidate who does a lot of unusual things For example after flubbing a debate performance in which he appeared volatile irritable and uninformed about key issues he did not attempt to refocus his campaign on proven message points or topics where he has a firm grasp of talking points Instead hes been lashing out at Alicia Machado while using apophasis to bring up Bill Clintons marital infidelity by saying hes not talking about Bill Clintons marital infidelityIt seems like a bad strategy because it almost certainly is in fact a bad strategyBut not everyone sees it that way In certain quarters theres a tendency to assume that Trump is crazy like a foxJon Favreau Barack Obamas chief speechwriter for much of his career in national politics sees the postdebate binge in that lightKen Baer a veteran Democratic Party operative even believes that Trumps feud with the Khan family was a successful effort to distract attention from a breadandbutter economic critique of TrumpThis view gives Trump far too much credit All available evidence suggests that Trump is a poor candidate waging a poor campaign and blowing a very winnable race against a Democratic Party nominee who is herself relatively weakThe presumption that Trump is performing well is based on a misreading of the underlying fundamentals of the election and in its own terms arguably does a little bit to boost his electoral fortunes by cloaking his campaign in an undeserved shroud of competenceThe overwhelmingly probable conclusion is that Trump does things that dont seem to make sense because he is a political neophyte who doesnt know what he is doingThe core fact about Donald Trumps general election campaign is that its been singularly ineffective Not only is he down in the polls right now but hes been consistently down in the polls for virtually the entire breadth of the campaignThat doesnt mean Trump cant win or that Clinton has nothing to worry about But it does mean that as best we can tell Trump started behind and has never really found a way to get ahead And hes been losing even though Clinton has been viewed more unfavorably than favorably since April a bad dynamic that set in for her before the Democratic primary wrapped upPeople tend to discount the Trump is losing factor on the grounds that he should be doing worse But this becomes circular  Trumps weakness as a candidate is the only reason to expect him to lose He is in fact losing because he is in fact running a bad campaignThe reality is that the underlying fundamentals of the race  a twoterm president leaving office amidst paltry economic growth  favor a Republican victory Thats what Voxs Trump Tax model says but dont take our word for it Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight thinks the same thing as does Lynn Vavreck at the Upshot and John Sides at the Monkey CageYet despite favorable fundamentals Trump has been consistently behind in the polls  leading in broad averages only for a couple of days between the two parties conventionsNot only has Trump been consistently losing despite favorable fundamentals but hes been consistently losing despite the luxury of running against an opponent with an underwater favorability ratingConversely the fundamentals in the 2012 election favored Obama Mitt Romney did slightly better than might be expected given the fundamentals and ran ahead of the GOP Senate nominee in basically every state Thats about what you would expect if you think of Romney as a handsome telegenic successful businessperson who governed as a moderate in a blue state before remaking himself as a conventional Republican Obamas attacks on Romney seem to have had replacementlevel effectiveness at best and still left Romney better regarded than a typical conservative RepublicanOne source of confusion is that overall economic conditions are clearly better today than they were four years ago History teaches us that what matters politically is shortterm rates of change not levels of prosperityEconomic conditions are better in 2016 than they were in 2012 But growth was faster four years ago than it is today when things seem to have leveled off after a nice 2015To make a long story short Donald Trump is the GOP nominee in a year when a generic Republican would be favored to beat a generic Democrat Rather than running against a generic Democrat he is running against an unusually unpopular Democrat And he is losingOf course the mere fact that Trumps overall campaign is ineffective doesnt mean that every particular choice he makes is bad But it does mean that theres no particular reason to give him the benefit of the doubt The big lesson of the 2016 campaign is that the fundamentals matter a lot The electorate is polarized and so even a really bad candidate has a high floorClinton has major weaknesses in terms of weak economic growth and voter fatigue with Democratic Party leadership manifesting in 2016 largely in millennial disaffection with Clinton even as young voters eschew Trump These factors keep Trump perennially within striking distance its a very winnable election for him But instead of winning he is losing And he has been consistently losing because he doesnt know what hes doing
