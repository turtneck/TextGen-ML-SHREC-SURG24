By Kalee BrownWhile I was at university many of my peers would take Adderall a drug commonly used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD to help them study or maintain focus while writing an exam It was somewhat of a social norm and no one seemed to care why because it was so popular however I believe it is a clear representation of the social and academic pressures imposed on children to be successfulIt also begs the question How are so many kids gaining access to Adderall Author and journalist Alan Schwarz explains that American children are not only severely overdiagnosed with ADHD but also frighteningly undereducated on the drugs theyre being prescribed so they end up selling the pills instead of taking them Wellknown for his investigative reporting on how Big Pharma manufactured the ADHD Nation through advertising and doctor bribery Schwarz recently published his book ADHD Nation using a term he coined to describe the widespread mishandling and misdiagnosis of the disorderHow ADHD Became An OverDiagnosed Disorder According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC approximately 11 of children between the ages of 4 and 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD as of 2011 However if you ask the American Psychiatric Association they maintain that even though only 5 of American children suffer from the disorder the diagnosis is actually given to around 15 of American children This number has been steadily rising  jumping from 78 in 2003 to 95 in 2007 Schwarz identifies two main themes involved with ADHD misdiagnosis the pharmaceutical industrys role in pushing ADHD drugs and doctors failing to identify the root cause of childrens behavioural issuesIn an interview with Scientific American  Schwarz explains Many kids have problems and need helpbut those problems in many cases will derive from trauma anxiety family discord poor sleep or diet bullying at school and more We must not abandon them We must help But we must also be more judicious in how we do that rather than reflexively giving them a diagnosis of what is generally described as a serious lifelong brain disorderBig Pharmas Role in Widespread ADHD Misdiagnosis Its no secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry As with many other diseases and disorders when it comes to ADHD pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to overstate the dangers of ADHD and the benefits of taking their drugs and understate the negative side effects Its easy for people to believe this misguided information when its affiliated with wellknown universities like Harvard and Johns Hopkins Many people dont even realize that these studies are funded by the very companies that profit from the drugs sale because that relationship is hidden in small print  source  Even though many of the advertisements Big Pharma has released state that ADHD medication is  safer than aspirin  these drugs can have significant side effects and are actually considered to be within the same class as morphine and oxycodone due to high risk of abuse and addiction You cant just blame all doctors either many of them genuinely believe theyre helping these children because of the information theyve been given in these studies and by Big PharmaBig Pharma creates advertisements for ADHD drugs that are specifically targeted at parents describing how these drugs can improve test scores and behaviour at home among other false claims One of the most controversial ones was a 2009 ad for Intuniv Shires ADHD treatment which included a child in a monster costume taking off his terrifying mask to reveal his calm smiling self with a text reading Theres a great kid in there The FDA has stepped in multiple times sending pharmaceutical companies warning letters or even forcing them to take down their ads because they are false misleading andor exaggerate the effects of their drugs  source The following New York Times video was created by Schwarz and Poh Si TengWhat Is ADHD and Is It Even Real If brain scans are performed on people with ADHD there are clear structural differences however the majority of ADHD diagnoses are confirmed by observation and often not even by a doctor Parents or school teachers are typically responsible for observing a childs actions and if they fit the criteria for ADHD doctors confirm the diagnosis and hand them a prescription Instead of getting to the root of these childrens attention deficit they are told they have a medical condition that can only be fixed with medication This is not only unethical but also clearly damaging to a childs self esteem Many of these kids could simply be uninterested in the subject matter suffering from some sort of emotional trauma or even have heightened creativity and energyMany doctors question the legitimacy of ADHD in general and whether or not it should be classified as a mental disorder This is largely because the definition of this and similar disorders is usually heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry American psychologist Lisa Cosgrove and others investigated financial ties between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM panel members and the pharmaceutical industry Their findings showed that of the 170 DSM panel members 95 56 had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry and 100 of the members of the panels on mood disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders had financial ties to drug companies read our article about it here Neurologist Richard Saul spent his career examining patients who struggle with short attention spans and difficulty focusing His extensive experience has led him to believe that ADHD isnt actually a disorder but rather an umbrella of symptoms that shouldnt be considered a disease Thus Saul believes it shouldnt be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic  Statistical Manual You can read more about his opinion in our article here No matter what your stance on ADHD is it is clear that too many children are being diagnosed with it and handed prescriptions without proper medical evaluations If you or a loved one has just been diagnosed with ADHD I suggest you do your own research on the subject instead of simply taking drugs for a mental disorder that may have been falsely diagnosedSource Collective Evolution
