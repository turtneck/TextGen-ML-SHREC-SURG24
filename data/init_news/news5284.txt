The swift action taken against a white police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed black man in South Carolina speaks to the compelling nature of the video but also to how much has changed since FergusonA man holds a sign during a protest for the shooting death of Walter Scott at City Hall in North Charleston SC Wednesday Mr Scott was killed by a North Charleston police office after a traffic stop on Saturday The officer Michael Slager has been charged with murderThe Rev Arthur Prioleau of Goose Creek SC carried a sign at a rally in North Charleston SC April 8 2015 Demonstrators rallied on Wednesday against what they described as a culture of police brutality in South Carolina in the case of white officer Michael Slager who was caught on video killing 50yearold Walter Scott a black man by shooting Scott in the back as he ran away after a traffic stop Slager was charged on Tuesday with murder in the death of ScottThis time the fatal shooting of an apparently unarmed black man by a white police officer resulted in something different a swift decisive and broadbased consensus that the officer should be charged with murderA bystander video that surfaced Tuesday appears to show Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager of North Charleston SC shooting Walter Scott in the back after a routine traffic stop on Saturday Mr Scott was attempting to fleeCertainly the compelling nature of the video evidence led to Mr Slager being arrested quickly charged by prosecutors and then fired from the forceBut the reaction by local authorities also hints at how much has changed in the seven months since a white police officer fatally shot a black teenager in the streets of Ferguson MoThere was no attempt to close ranks around the officer Instead the mayor and police chief visited the victims family on Wednesday morning and announced they would provide a police escort for Scotts funeral The mayor also issued an executive order that all the citys police officers must start wearing body camerasSlowly and perhaps inconsistently the wide latitude that society has long given police officers who say their lives are in danger is beginning to changeThe victims father said on NBCs Today show Wednesday that without the bystander video It would have never come to light They would have swept it right under the rug like they did with many othersBut the existence of the video along with the momentum for reform spawned by a halfdozen other recent incidents from Los Angeles to Madison Wis  some with videos of their own  is threatening the traditional deference given to policeThere is  and police departments are starting to know this  there is a crisis of legitimacy says Jeannine Bell a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who studies policing and hate crimes And this crisis does not help the difficult job that police officers already have of fighting crime and protecting citizens  it absolutely does notFor the most part the majority of white Americans have long given police the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the use of force Combining data from 2011 to 2014 for example a Gallup study last August found that nearly 60 percent of whites had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in police departments ranking them just below the military and small businesses as the nations most trusted institutions By contrast only 37 percent of blacks expressed such confidence  a fact well known even before the incidents in Ferguson and New YorkCharging a police officer with murder remains extremely rare During the past five years police in South Carolina have shot at 209 suspects killing 79 according to a report in The State Only three officers were accused of wrongdoing in these shootings however and none of them was convicted Indeed such numbers reflect the same picture from jurisdictions around the country in which police officers are rarely charged when accused of misconductThe police killings during the past year have shed light on a system including grand jury procedures that is run by police and prosecutors who work closely together on a daytoday basis  a fraternity one former prosecutor told the Monitor last year that creates a challenging environment for a prosecutor to seek an indictment let alone a conviction of a police officerIt is this situation that is coming under such intense scrutiny nowThere is no question that peoples attitudes will continue to change with respect to police agencies and the presumed honesty of police officers especially if laws dont change says Martin Lijtmaer a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles via email Existing laws foster a culture of secrecyHe notes that in California defense attorneys have to overcome substantial hurdles to get a court to order the disclosure of misconduct complaints against police officers Even then he says the information one gets is limited and subject to burdensome protective orders which prevent wider disclosureScathing reports this year by the Justice Department on the behavior and culture of several police departments and criminal justice systems have only added to the pressureThe bottom line is these incidents are a wakeup call not just for law enforcement but the community as well says Tod Burke professor of criminal justice at Radford University in VirginiaA former Maryland police officer Dr Burke emphasizes the need for officer support even in the face of public outcryBut if the officer is in the wrong the police agency needs to be the first to recognize it he says It shouldnt take the public going Hey your officers are messing up It should be Were messing up and we need to correct it
