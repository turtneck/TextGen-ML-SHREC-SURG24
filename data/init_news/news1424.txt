rocked the campaign to find his successor and to build a cleareyed bighearted and optimistic nationDelivering his annual report to the nation Obama did not name Republican 2016 candidates But he took clear implied shots at them nevertheless particularly frontrunner Donald Trump as well as Sens Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz Americas destiny the President said was imperiled by a political system festering in malice gridlock and in the grip of the rich and the powerfulObama also took on critics who accuse him of weakening American power abroad and Republicans who say he is underplaying the threat from radical Islamist groups such as ISIS He mocked the contention that fighters on on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages represented an existential

final State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill on Tuesday January 12President Barack Obama delivers his final State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill on Tuesday January 12The President acknowledged that a torrent of change technological advances and economic dislocation has left many Americans fearful of the future and anxious as social structures that have underpinned the life of the nation for decades fray But he urged them not to fall prey to the periodic temptation that has emerged throughout history to alienate minorities and resist social changeEach time there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control Obama said And each time we overcame those fearsWe made change work for us always extending Americas promise outward to the next frontier to more and more people And because we did  because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril  we emerged stronger and better than beforeEconomic opportunity security and a sustainable peaceful planet are possible he said if the country could return to rational constructive debatesIt will only happen if we fix our politics he saidIn a way Obamas seventh and last State of the Union address was a microcosm of his entire presidency He invoked a chorus of hope and optimism about Americas destiny and the transformative nature of change but was undercut by the poisoned political divides he has been unable to narrow  and that have even grown during his presidency Then he encountered fierce opposition from Republicans who believe he has transformed the nation by eroding its exceptional qualities and thwarting the ConstitutionMeanwhile a foreign policy crisis raging in the Middle East after Iran seized 10 US sailors exemplified the struggles in which Obama has had to impose US authority in an increasingly chaotic world that has challenged his core mission of ending costly American wars abroadSecretary of State John Kerry told CNN that the service members would be released very soon And Obama did not address the crisis in his speech but defended the legacybuilding deal reached to halt Irans nuclear weapons programWhile Obama in deference to his ebbing power as a lameduck president avoided the long list of legislative proposals that Congress has no intention of taking up he strongly defended his domestic record claiming credit for 14 million new jobs and a halving of the unemployment rate He said those who claimed the economy was in decline are peddling fictionHe rebuked politicians who draw congressional districts to protect safe seats and vowed to launch a national effort to secure voting rights an issue particularly important to minority communities And he named Vice President Joe Biden who lost his beloved son Beau to cancer last year to head Mission Control in a new moon shot to cure the disease He told conservatives who deny climate change to have at it because they were defying the worldObama also vowed  once again  to fight to close the war on terror camp at Guantanamo Bay Cuba renewing one of the first promises of his presidency that has been thwarted by Congress He called the facility a recruitment brochure for our enemies and was expensive and unnecessaryThe first AfricanAmerican president also offered a detailed rebuttal of the kind of politics that alienates people rather than unites them At times Obama was almost pleading with his audience to embrace the vision of hope and change that swept him to power and then was sullied by the bitter realities of polarized politics over a darker vision of Americas characterWhat I am asking for his hard Its easier to be cynical to accept that change isnt possible and politics is hopeless and to believe that our voices and actions dont matter Obama saidBut if we give up now then we forsake a better futureIt seemed clear that the President had Trump in his thoughtsAs frustration grows there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes to scapegoat fellow citizens who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background Obama said voicing a familiar critique of Democrats and some Republicans at the rhetoric of the billionaire real estate mogul whose populist campaign has taken American politics by stormWe cant afford to go down that path It wont deliver the economy we want or the security we want but most of all it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the worldIn the Republican response South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley also  after criticizing Obamas policies  offered a repudiation of Trump decrying the siren call of the angriest voicesObama appeared to relish the chance to take on Republican critics who have lambasted his performance as commander in chiefI told you earlier all the talk of Americas economic decline is political hot air Well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth Period Its not even close Obama saidThe man who burst on the political scene by rejecting the notion that there was a red America or a blue America also diagnosed a sick political systemIt doesnt work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice or that our political opponents are unpatriotic Obama warned and even accepted a share of the blame for not uniting warring political factionsIts one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better Theres no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and I guarantee Ill keep trying to be better so long as I hold this officeAnd he slammed Republicans who have responded to the spread of ISIS across much of the Middle East and the groups apparent widening of its target list to Europe and the United States by warning that its rise is a threat to America itselfAs we focus on destroying ISIL overthetop claims that this is World War III just play into their hands Obama saidThey do not threaten our national existence Thats the story ISIL wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit Obama said warning against pushing away vital Americans allies in the Middle East by echoing the lie that the group represents IslamWe just need to call them what they are  killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out hunted down and destroyed he said warning that tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians may work as a soundbite but dont pass muster on the world stage Obamas comments appeared aimed at Cruz who has warned he would carpet bomb ISIS and Rubio who says America is waging an existential fight against radical Islamic terrorismThe Iran incident complicated Obamas effort to counter claims by critics that the escalating chaos in the Middle East is the result of a deficit of US leadership and emboldened attacks by GOP presidential candidates who contend his weak performance as commander in chief has opened vacuums exploited by US enemiesRepublican candidates and lawmakers immediately seized on the incident to charge that Obama has emboldened Irans aggressive behavior in its neighborhood by offering sanctions relief in return for a halting of its nuclear weapons programThis is the latest manifestation of the weakness of Barack Obama that every bad actor  views Obama as a laughingstock Cruz said on WRKO radioRubio said Irans provocations were the result of having a weak president in the Oval Office Iran is testing the boundaries of this administrations resolve And they know the boundaries are pretty wide and this administration is willing to let them get away with many things said Rubio on Fox NewsAnd Colorado Republican Sen Cory Gardner told CNNs Jake Tapper on The Lead that Obama should delay the start of his speech to talk about what has happenedRepublicans agree with Obama that his presidency has been transformational  but in a bad way They believe he has presided over anemic growth rates wielded executive power on immigration gun control and climate change to thwart the Constitution is oblivious to the severity of Islamist terrorism and has engineered an era of declining American power in the worldHaley painted an unflattering picture of Obamas America and said the nation would soon have a chance to turn the page in remarks which also seemed to be a repudiation of TrumpThe Presidents record has often fallen far short of his soaring words Haley saidMany Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels Were feeling a crushing national debt a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available and chaotic unrest in many of our cities Even worse we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with itHaley took a shot at Obamas foreign policy record saying a Republican president would make international agreements that were celebrated in Israel and protested in Iran not the other way aroundThe governor also highlighted her personal story as a daughter of Indian immigrants and draw a contrast with some of the rhetoric currently on display in the primary campaignToday we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory she said During anxious times it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices We must resist that temptation No one who is willing to work hard abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this countryTuesdays address before a packed House chamber also marked the debut of House Speaker Paul Ryan  a longtime Obama rival  on the platform alongside BidenAnd as per tradition one Cabinet member did not attend the speech Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was named as the designated survivor
