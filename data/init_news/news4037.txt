criticized President Obamas efforts to fight the Islamic State His first question was what he would do differently if he were in the White House Cruz said the goal shouldnt be to weaken or degrade the terrorist group but to utterly and completely destory ISISAnd the current debate over boots on the ground in Iraq should be driven by military assessments on how to reach that goal he added Still Cruz recalled that he wasnt satisfied with the assessment he heard during a Senate briefing from Army Gen Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff about how that goal could be achievedI asked him in what time frame can we destroy ISIS Cruz said Dempsey responded that there is no military solution Cruz recalled only a change in the underlying conditions to prevent potential recruits from being radicalized through povertyThere is a word for thatI have to clean it up for Cspanand simply say its nonense Cruz said The way to defeat ISIS is not expanded Medicaid throughout IraqHere are
