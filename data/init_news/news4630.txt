President Obama earned a doublebarreled rebuke Monday from The Washington Posts factchecker for repeating a faulty claim that the Keystone XL pipeline bypasses the US  and for saying it would only carry Canadian oilThe president made the claims in an interview last week with WDAY of Fargo ND Obama continued to downplay the impact of the CanadatoTexas oil pipeline just days after vetoing a bipartisanbacked bill that would approve the construction project Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy has teed up a vote to override that veto later this weekIn the local interview Obama saidIve already said Im happy to look at how we can increase pipeline production for US oil but Keystone is for Canadian oil to send that down to the Gulf It bypasses the United States and is estimated to create a little over 250 maybe 300 permanent jobs We should be focusing more broadly on American infrastructure for American jobs and American producers and thats something that we very much supportThe president has been called out before for claiming the oil would bypass the USWashington Post factchecker Glenn Kessler explained Monday that while the crude oil would travel to the Gulf Coast it would then be refined into products like gasoline  and much of it certainly would be used in the USCurrent trends suggest that only about half of that refined product would be exported and it could easily be lower Kessler saidHe cited a February report by energy industry consultant IHS Energy which predicted most of the refined products would likely be consumed in the United StatesFurther even the State Department issued a report downplaying the notion that a large amount of that crude would be exported since foreign refiners would have to shoulder additional transportation chargesKessler said with his recent comments Obama appears to be purposely ignoring the findings of the lead Cabinet agency on the issueFurther he challenged Obamas claim that Keystone would just be for Canadian oil since producers in North Dakota and Montana want to move oil from the Bakken area through itKessler gave Obama four Pinocchios for his comments  the worst rating on his factcheck scaleIf he disagrees with the State Departments findings he should begin to make the case why it is wrong rather than assert the opposite without any factual basis Kessler wrote Moreover by telling North Dakota listeners that the pipeline has no benefit for Americans he is again being misleading given that producers in the region have signed contracts to transport some of their production through the pipelineMcConnell is aiming for a final vote on the Keystone veto override on Wednesday with a procedural vote set for Tuesday So far supporters of the pipeline have not demonstrated they have the necessary twothirds majority in Congress to overrideObama in opposing that bill has argued the State Department needs to be allowed to finish its official review of the pipeline
