Today September 8 I am holding a prayer vigil and rally for liberty in Grayson Kentucky I will call on Judge David Bunning to release Kim Davis on the grounds that her right to religious liberty has been grossly violated under the Constitution of these United States of AmericaWhen I warned that the Supreme Courts decision on marriage would lead to the criminalization of Christianity in America I was dismissed by many as an alarmist and my comments were mocked by the chattering class Now just two months after the courts lawless ruling an elected county clerk has been put in jail by an unelected judge for refusing to issue amarriage license to a samesex couple removing all doubts about criminalization of Christianity in this countryWhen the people of Kentucky electedDemocratKim Davis as county clerk the states constitution affirmed that marriage is between one man and one woman The amendment passed with 75 percent of the peoples voteTodayI ask on behalf of Kim Under what law is she authorized to issue homosexual couples a marriage license Can you site the specific right in the Constitution Is there a statute passed by Congress that actually says that the five unelected lawyers in the majority of the courts opinion were right to throw out the very definition of marriage and make up one on their ownIn theObergefelldecision the Supreme Court ruled samesex couples have the right to get married Whether you personally agree with that or not doesntmatter in Kims case What does matter is thatthe Supreme Court cannot and did not make a law It only made a ruling on a lawKims stand for religious liberty is a pivotal moment in our nations history Will we continue to pretend as though the Supreme Court is the Supreme Branch with the authorityand ability tomake laws It most certainly is not The Supreme Court is one of three coequal branches of government under our Constitution It is no more the Supreme Branch than it is the Supreme Being with the authority to redefine the laws of nature or of natures GodWhat we know for sure is thatThe Judicial Branchis constitutionally prohibited from writing laws there are religious liberty protections in the Kentucky constitution and Kentucky statute and the plaintiffs in the case did not seek KimsincarcerationDespite these facts KimDavis was thrown in jail for contempt which means she was given no possibility of bailThat seems even more ludicrous when you considermany of the Americas most evil and notorious serial killers murderers rapists mafia bosses and presidential assassinswere actuallylet out on bailAll of these dangerous criminals were given bail A Democrat county clerk in Kentucky who is a Christian was notNo one went to jail when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered city clerks to issue samesex marriage licenses in direct disobedience to California law More recentlyNo one went to jail when San Francisco was set up as a sanctuary city  sheltering dangerous illegal immigrant felons in defiance of federal law Not only did NewsomNOT go to jail hes now the lieutenant governor of the stateI am appalled at our governments willingness to accommodate the religious beliefs of all religions ChristianityWhen I traveled to Guantanamo Bay I was amazed byhow wellwe treated foreign Muslim terrorist detainees The US government provides prayer mats and special meals that conform to Islamic restrictions but we cant accommodate the religious beliefs of a popularly elected Christian county clerk in Kentucky We have lost our moral compass as a country when our government accommodatesmilitantMuslims but not conservative ChristiansAs a governor for ten and a half years I followed the Constitution of my state and of the United States The rule of law is a foundation of our democracyBut the reason why our laws are respected by the American people is because our Constitution guarantees reasonable safeguards to protect the rights of dissentersI refuse to sit silently as our Constitution is torched and the courts violate our fundamental rights We did not fight a revolution against the tyranny of one unelected monarch so we could surrender our freedoms and abandon our Constitutionto the tyranny of five unaccountable unelected lawyersThis shredding of the most fundamental civil rights of our citizens cannot stand I will fight for and protect the religious liberty of every American This will go down as a seminal moment in American history if we do not free Kim Davis now and make sure this never happens againFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee was a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States
