With House Republicans pushing for a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood Speaker John Boehners leadership is again under scrutiny  and under fireHouse Speaker John Boehner R of Ohio holds a news conference following a House Republican caucus meeting at the Capitol in Washington earlier this month REUTERSHouse Speaker John Boehner likes to say he learned all the skills he needs for his current job during his childhood years in Ohio  mopping floors in his dads bar and growing up with 11 brothers and sisters In a twobedroom house With one bathroomThats got to teach a person patience and the Republican speaker has an abundance of it Some say too much especially when it comes to the latitude he gives his rebellious rightwing faction  such as right nowWith just 10 days before the federal government runs out of money GOP hardliners are threatening the second widespread government shutdown in two years this time over federal funding for Planned ParenthoodTheyre also considering a rare maneuver to oust Mr Boehner from the speakers chair Its not the first time theyve plotted to get rid of himYet Boehner  the coolest cucumber I know as one of his colleagues puts it  has been calmly exploring the options as the GOP leadership holds more than a half dozen listening sessions with members of the divided caucus He still hasnt found a funding solution that will satisfy everyone He might not be able to But pushing and prodding in his own unperturbed way he wont stop tryingWhat Boehner does is hes very patient He lets things play out for a while He doesnt get mad Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesnt says John Feehery former spokesman for Denny Hastert the longest serving Republican speakerIts the tactics  not the ideology  that separate the speaker from his right flank In 2013 when tea partyers forced a 16day partial government shutdown over Obamacare Boehner was as opposed to the Affordable Care Act as they wereBut he repeatedly warned against a shutdown Failing to persuade he eventually joined in leading the way on several measures to delay or defund the presidents signature domestic program On Day 16 after having exhausted all his options he gave up the fight  and received a standing ovation from his caucus hardliners included for his effortsAs he explained to the former latenight television host Jay Leno last year You learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walkThis time Boehner is again in lockstep with the right flank on the substance of the issue Videos showing officials of Planned Parenthood a womens health provider discussing the sale of aborted fetus parts for scientific research are gruesome he has said and the federal government should stop funding the groupYet neither he nor Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell R of Kentucky want to shut down the government over it Trying to defund Planned Parenthood with a Democratic president in the White House is an exercise in futility as Senator McConnell put itAt a closeddoor GOP caucus meeting last week the House leadership shared internal polling that showed that twothirds of respondents in 18 GOP swing districts oppose shutting the government to try to stop funding Planned Parenthood according to Politico In 2013 the GOPs approval ratings plummeted in the wake of the shutdownThat doesnt mean much to Rep John Fleming R of Louisiana who belongs to the House Freedom Caucus a group of more than 40 hardliners formed this year to challenge the GOP leadership Congressman Fleming says hes one of 31 members who have pledged not to vote for legislation  be it a shortterm or longterm budget  that funds Planned Parenthood Thats my conscience voteAnd so the speaker has been patiently rolling out other options  investigations of Planned Parenthood in the House legislation to freeze funding for the organization and an abortionrelated bill Both bills passed the GOPcontrolled House on Friday but will be blocked by Senate DemocratsAnd thats where another leadership proposal comes in In order to actually get a defunding bill to the presidents desk theyve proposed using a legislative process known as budget reconciliation that only needs a majority vote to pass It would get to the president all right but he would veto itHardliners say they arent interested in this show vote Instead they seem determined to press for the shutdown and try to put the blame on the presidentAs the speaker cycles through his options and the calendar clicks closer to a shutdown some of his allies are getting frustrated with the repeated clashes There was another one earlier this year over immigration and funding for the Department of Homeland SecurityBoehner supporter Rep Devin Nunes R of California calls the hardliners rightwing Marxists who use extreme tactics to promote themselves  and then offer no realistic alternative plans The speaker he says with exasperation lets these guys get away with everythingTake the case of Rep Mark Meadows R of North Carolina who in July filed a rare motion to vacate the chair and call a new election for the speakership Such a move hasnt been tried in 105 years  and it didnt succeed thenThe speaker could have killed off the Meadows resolution in the Rules Committee which the speaker controls  but he didnt He could have brought it immediately to the floor for a vote he would have won and stamped out the spark before it caught fire  as some of his allies urged He didntHe chose not to press his advantage and divide his caucus said Rep Tom Cole R of OklahomaIn July Boehner called the Meadows move no big deal but rightwingers are talking about returning to it after the popes visit this week It is unlikely to succeed but nothing is certainIntraparty division is not new in Congress says former House historian Ray Smock He recalls the civil rights era when both parties had deeply divided caucuses But this is different he says because of the uncompromising wing of Boehners partyI think Boehner is seriously trying to run the House the way its supposed to be run but this has been a losing proposition for him since the advent of the tea party says Mr Smock Youve got an awful lot of members in that caucus that dont really care that government functions well Theyre elected as antigovernment peopleWhich raises the question Whats the point of patience with recalcitrantsMr Feehery says the free rein Boehner gave the tea partyers during the last shutdown could have been meant as a learning experience for them  but it simply emboldened them Now its time for the speaker to make an example of a few people and just kick them out of the conferenceBut then Feehery admits rightwing media would have a field day with that and so would the antiestablishment presidential candidatesAnd thats not the Boehner wayMembers get not just second and third chances they get repeated chances to operate as members of the team says Congressman Cole a Boehner allyOne things certain Democrats will not agree to defund Planned Parenthood Boehner knows that Eventually hell have to work with Democrats to pass a clean funding bill that leaves the womens health care provider aloneWhat happens between now and then though is anybodys guess
