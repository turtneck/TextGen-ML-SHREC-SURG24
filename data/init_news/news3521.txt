Williams wife Patricia turned the maisonette into a quarry of precious metals and shiny trinkets that for a certain kind of person might necessitate sunglasses or anticonvulsants Eclectic hectic and loaded in every sense the duplex was a motherlode of handpainted floor screens and motherofpearl tables its walls splashed with flashy modernist paintings and lit with leaded Tiffany lamps But despite the bonanza of gilded pier glasses and silver sconces and bronze flowerpots it was a harpsichord that held the home together The manofthehouses chief contribution to the glittering litter was a seventeenthcentury keyboard and he placed it in the marble foyer so that guests saw it firstas if to clear any suspicion that his wifes knack for chintz reflected on his personal taste in art Buckley who called the harpsichord the instrument I love beyond all others had matching models in his Connecticut mansion and Swiss chalet the conservative scion would entertain his visitors with a tune as often as an epigram Bach was his muse as much as Edmund BurkeThis love of his provides a rare moment of peace in Best of Enemies a turbulent whiplashinducing new film on the rivalry between Buckley and Gore Vidal In fact the music of Bach is a throughline in the documentary serving as Buckleys leitmotif After well over an hour of watching the men trade petty points and cheap insultsin archival footage not the grave though a psychic medium may easily prove otherwisewe see Buckley pull up his bench and play a Bach prelude in C the simplest most uncluttered of key signatures The effort contemplative and composed is the films only moment of civility Early on Vidal gives us an idyllic tour of his estate in Salerno but he leads us immediately to the bathroom where Buckleys portrait hangs next to the toilet An amateur musician but not a dabbler Buckley performed in the 80s and 90s with a roster of symphonies around the country honing his skill with almost spiritual devotion Art of any sort he once wrote is very very serious business that which is sublime cant be anything less His worship of Bach a lifelong attachment mirrored his intellectual manner Like Bachs themes his arguments in writing and speech were famously complex surprising winding and sonorous As with any player of polyphony Buckley showed considerable sleight of hand in teasing out parallels and resolving contradictions Baroque music which is contrapuntal makes no great fuss about harmony surely an appealing trait to a contrarian at odds with society Like Bach Buckley inevitably clung to the counterpointI harp on music becauseBest of Enemies harps on dissonance Directed by Morgan Neville and the Oscarwinning Robert Gordon this is a serious film by serious filmmakers and it seeks to understand the decay of American commentary into white noise Why the film wonders do Americans hope to divine the truth in 60second shouting matches rather than 6000word features Why do the opinion programs scuttle the wellread in favor of those who can barely decipher a teleprompter Why does Fox News boom with the authority of Mount Sinai Why when parsing a point do its hosts sound like a hernia is rending their groin Why do our congressmen echo the same guttural sound bites Why has the United States traded an intelligentsia for a punditocracyFor Gordon and Neville these rhetorical questions do not have a rhetorical answer and they point their plugged ears at the rhetoric of Buckley and Vidal whom they take to be the medias original screaming heads They circle the writers with yellow tape saying theyve found the epicenter of the shift They diagnose Buckley and Vidal as patients zero of our madness of our newsmens hysterics and our leaders strain of Tourettes At best this is half trueThe decline and fall of the chattering class began in 1968 the filmmakers say and in a certain sense they are right In that year ABC one of three television channels lagged far behind NBC and CBS in ratings and when its competitors bought up the rights to report from the Republican and Democratic national conventions the network hatched a plan It would hire two writers to comment on the presidential nominees They would perch on Americas left and right shoulders and vie for its conscience But both of them acted like devils and raised hell from the first debate to the tenth Despite the authors aristocratic airs and MidAtlantic inflections Buckley hissed through his drawl as Vidal thumbed his Aquiline nose at himThe clamor began well before the opening bell As the film recalls Vidal courted Buckleys rage years earlier lampooning him on The Tonight Show At the Republican convention in 1964 Vidal embarrassed him again in front of a national audience airing remarks from a campaign official about Buckleys relationship with Barry Goldwater then running for president Before the 1968 debates featured in the film Vidal hired a researcher to help him smear Buckley and wrote his putdowns in advance testing them on ABCs cameramen and gophers The liberal Vidal called his opponent a prophet of greed the Marie Antoinette of the right wing and the inspiration for Myra Breckinridge the transsexual rapist in Vidals novel by the same name When Vidal dismissed Californias conservative governor as an aging juvenile actor Buckley defended Ronald Reagan by playfully dismissing Vidals film efforts If ABC has the authority to invite the author of Myra Breckinridgeto comment on Republican politics I think that the people of California have the right when they speak overwhelmingly to project somebody into national politics even if he did commit the sin of having acted in movies that were not written by Mr Vidal Bickering became screaming in the melodramas final act when Vidal labeled Buckley a cryptoNazi a weightier offense in postwar America than today and Buckley called him a queer and threatened to sock him in the goddamn face Buckley a veteran of the Second World War took the insult especially hard having spent much of his career trying to purge conservatism of its antiSemitic elements and having succeeded in marginalizing the John Birch SocietyIf we believe the film then the tenepisode kerfuffle shocking to 60s viewers was a historic moment on TV that changed discourse forever We are reminded that at one point ABCs studio at the convention actually collapsed  a metaphor for the shockwaves of the debaters sonic boom While journalists panned the program as so much hot air ABC sucked in a massive new audience and a windfall of advertising dollars The hubbub was a boon and the network and its competitors would try to revive the debates flare in future political coverage They would prioritize noise over reason shouting over thinking and anoint pundits as Americas kingmakersBut including Buckley in this category is more than a violation of good manners As he might say about socialism  however wrongly I might add  such a sentiment commits the sin of overreaching Buckley for all of his objectionable politics was nonetheless the quintessential antipundit and his example could serve as a timely antidote to the poor state of contemporary opinionparticularly in his own partyThough Vidal said after the debates that he was glad to have given the audience their moneys worth Buckley considered the argument a disaster Vidal replayed the debates obsessively in his dotage but they embarrassed Buckley to the end of his days and he wished ABC had destroyed the tapes Buckley had wanted to talk about the Republican Convention he said but he found it difficult to do so when you have somebody like this who speaks in such burps and who likes to be naughty which has proven to be a professional highly merchandisable viceHis outburst brought him lasting guilt and Gordon and Neville show their sense of irony when Buckley plays Bachs WellTempered Clavier midway through the film If they give Vidal a theme it is Purcells Funeral March for Queen Mary a piece popularly associated with A Clockwork Orange an allusion to the social political and rhetorical upheavals that Vidal helped kick off Vidal claimed in the Paris Review that he was not musical which might explain the shrill tone of his essaysNoise is to music as confusion is to reason and Buckley was as practiced a logician as a pianist Indeed the historian Sam Tanenhaus interviewed at length in the film describes him as the great debater of his time Genuine debate neednt traffic in shame or tinnitus and Buckley eschewed the lowrung slur as much as he shied from the highpitched shout This is not to say that he wanted for wit which he had aplenty but that he used it only to ornament a fully developed theme If insults do not replace an argument they can do healthy illuminating work in revealing the hypocrisy or absurdity of a figure heaped in public praise To object is to deny that character as well as ideology shapes history its to deny that politics are personal Buckley would argue steadily and quietly holding forth with a hushed assurance that would seldom rush or halt his opponents assertions Like any trained musician he had that quality of selfmastery which the world used to call virtue His willingness and eagerness to listen the mark of an able and disciplined ear and his love for the long phrase and extended argument gave him doubts about TV Though Vidal said he would never miss a chance to have sex or appear on television Buckley believed there was an implicit conflict of interest between that which is highly viewable and that which is illuminating Yet the show he hosted Firing Line had an enduring impact on the marketplace of ideas It ran for 33 years longer than any other publicaffairs program and won an Emmy for its commitment to spirited inquiry He questioned guests who agreed with him Ronald Reagan Margaret Thatcher Milton Friedman Friedrich Hayek as eagerly as those who did not Jimmy Carter Noam Chomsky Saul Alinsky Christopher Hitchens Speaking to the shows long format a largesse for probing conversation the economist John Kenneth Galbraith said that Firing Line is one of the rare occasions when you have a chance to correct the errors of the man whos interrogating you Hitchens echoed the sentiment I did my first Firing Line in 1983 and swiftly learned that if I left the studio cursing at what I hadnt said it was my own fault Buckleys desire to persuade rather than overpower and his willingness to cope with the otherness of others views earned him fast friends among the leftleaning intelligentsia Galbraith Murray Kempton and Mario Cuomo all found in him a receptive and challenging companion In the pages of National Review the magazine he founded he helped launch the career of Joan Didion though her liberal awakening happened later His lifelong friendship with Norman Mailer is the subject of a new book by Kevin Schultz Buckley and Mailer that gives the lie to the films charge of divisiveness It is a meticulous portrait of two radicals who meet at the margins Buckley even has my own respect though I find many of his positions odious Im at least as leftist as the late Mr Vidal but I stick my fingers in my ears only half as much Buckleys brand of antistatism his hatred of the New Deal and the Great Society and federal intervention of any kind owed to a neurotic Cold War fear of collectivism His antiinterventionism even led him to oppose the Civil Rights Act a heinous lapse of judgment that he later recantedIn Vietnam he thought we were staring down the Four Horsemen All his life he kissed the ring of the war criminal Henry Kissinger His fear of big government excused the worst indignities of big money enshrining inequality as patriotism The socialized state is to justice order and freedom what the Marquis de Sade is to love he once wrote rather sadistically As with many conservatives his defense of liberty against the state was genuine but misguided He despised totalitarianism as fiercely as I do and he railed against the Soviet Union in an era of dtente But on a domestic level I part from him on the matter of social welfare in that I consider freedom null and void if swaths of the population are so disenfranchised they cant make full use of iteconomically politically biologically Unlike my opponents I refuse to forget the third item in Jeffersons list of inalienable rights life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Some found Buckley calculating and cold His rhetoric they said was all head and no heart It is a charge often brought against Bach this idea of enthroning reason and suppressing the passions It is also a common criticism of Plato Yet conservatism fills an important role in society In the body politic the right hand is as essential as the left Liberals ask what we can gain from change while conservatives ask what we can lose At every moment of crisis this is a valuable conversation to haveif it is in fact a conversation Otherwise it evokes a kind of madness like talking to oneself in the subway Nowadays blather rattles the land like thunder In cabs diners and doctors waiting rooms the din of stupid opinion yields only to the grinding of ones teeth But for our lightbulbs we would seem to be entering a dark age The noise today is relentless enough to inspire thoughts of taking a drill to ones eardrums It is inescapable this babbling rabble of 24hour TV Bill OReilly seems to be always on the verge of an aneurysm Greta Van Susteren a Scientologist with a questionable grasp of reality grunts and slurs like a bartender whos her own best customer Nested with parrots and mockingbirds the Capitol Building has become an echo chamber for Fox News Senator Ted Cruz a champion Princeton debater and a Harvard doctor of law now sounds like Sarah Palin with more testosterone A Bach fugue is as trying on the hands as on the head and if Buckley the writer and musician aspired to selfmastery it was in the pursuit of excellence Excellence of course is the antithesis of our leaders and pundits lack of seriousness discipline and integrity When asked to provide a mission statement for TheNational Review Buckley turned to the question of character The largest cultural menace in America is the conformity of the intellectual cliques which in education as well as the arts are out to impose upon the nation their modish fads and fallacies and have nearly succeeded in doing so In this cultural issue we are without reservations on the side of excellence  and of honest intellectual combat rather than conformity Though some suspect Buckley of elitism his demand for excellence simply set him against mediocrity This is as it should be His intellect eloquence and candor would be a tonic for the oafs now puffing themselves up as Republican messiahs In its most noxious strain their populism equates to craven demagoguery and outright philistinism Such thinking prevents the consideration of radical inventive unique voices and ensures that politicians on the right but also on the politically correct left remain toadies to their respective orthodoxies A master of counterpoint Buckley despised orthodoxy within his own movement He spurned dogma and hewed to original principles as the need arose The rigor of his views did not lend themselves to rigor mortis and he often veered radically from orthodoxy in favor of the practically radical or radically practical When entering the public sphere he was reluctant to accept the conservative label preferring to call himself an individualist He once wrote that intelligent deference to tradition and stability can evolve into intellectual sloth and moral fanaticism as when conservatives simply decline to look up from dogma because the effort to raise their heads and reconsider is too great So he opposed the War on Drugs its bitter financial and human costs and supported the legalization of illicit substances Though Libertarians cite him as a kind of hero he rejected their desire to demolish the state to privatize all public works as the most ridiculous kind of utopianism In a debate with Ron Paul on Firing Line he held that the libertarian position is discredited by a kind of reductionism that is simply incompatible with social life He might say the same of his ideological heirs on the airwaves and the National Mall who crank their bullhorns of drivel to one hundred decibels They spout so much sound and fury signifying nothing
