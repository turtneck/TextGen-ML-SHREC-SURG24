Ferguson to demonstrate gathered at a rap concert and a panel discussion groups of young men began breakinginto storefronts along West FlorissantAs a result police cut off traffic to the area and

detectives farther down West Florissant were monitoring a personthey believed to be armed who was with at least three or four other people they also believed to have weaponsEven as protesters and police were facing off nearby two groups that were apparently involved in some kind of feud began firing at each other Belmar said He said between40 and 50 shots were fired over about 45 secondsIt was a remarkable amount of gunfire Belmar saidThe person being tracked by the detectives crossed the street and left the area where the two groups were facing off and he may have been preparing to return

conditionThe four detectives who were placed on administrative leave have not been identifiedBelmar said that this confrontation between police and the lone man wasnt the culmination of all the
