Speaking at Tuskegee University in Alabama Obama told the audience that when her husband was running for office in 2008 she faced questions which she said were not typical for other candidates wivesAs potentially the first AfricanAmerican first lady I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others she told the class of 2015 Was I too loud or too emasculating Or was I too soft Too much of a mom and not enough of a career womanObama referenced the cover of the July 2008 issue of The New Yorker in which Obama was depicted with her husband as terrorist enemies of the United StatesThen there was the first time I was on a magazine cover It was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge afro and a machine gun Now yeah it was satire but if Im really being honest it knocked me back a bit It made me wonder just how are people seeing meIn her nearly 30minute speech the first lady recalled other particularly tough moments including being referred to on Fox News as her husbands crony of color and Obamas baby mama She also recalled a moment on the campaign trail when she gave her husband a fist bump to celebrate a primary win later to be referred to by an anchor on that network as a terrorist fist jab Back in those days I had a lot of sleepless nights worrying what people thought of me she recalled Obama added that she let the criticism get to the point where she would wonder if she was hurting her husbands chances of becoming President while also fearing what her daughters would think The first lady said eventually the only thing she could do to prevent others from defining her was to ignore all of the noise I had to be true to myself and the rest would work itself out she recounted to cheers from the audience Obama also said that once she became first lady and was working on platforms and issues that were important to her she was once again criticized for her choices not being bold enough So I immersed myself in the policy details I worked with Congress on legislation gave speeches to CEOs military generals and Hollywood executives Obama said But I also worked to ensure that my efforts would resonate with kids and families  and that meant doing things in a creative and unconventional way So yeah I planted a garden and hulahooped on the White House lawn with kids I did some mom dancing on TV  And at the end of the day by staying true to the me Ive always known I found that this journey has been incredibly freeing  In 2010 first lady Michelle Obama started Lets Move an

some of the racial controversies being played out in several American cities All of that is gonna be a heavy burden to carry It can feel isolating It can make you feel like your life somehow doesnt matter  And as weve seen over the past few years those feelings are real Theyre rooted in decades of structural challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and invisible and those feelings are playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country Obama said The first lady concluded by saying that while those feelings are real they are never an excuse for the graduates to give up or lose hope but instead provide a better example of how to succeed It teaches us that when we pull ourselves out of the emotional depths and we challenge our frustrations into studying and organizing and banding together then we can build ourselves and our communities up she said We can take on those deep rooted problems and together together we can
