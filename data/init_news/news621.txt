More than 500000 people have gotten health insurance in Kentucky through the states health care exchange Kynect and through expanded Medicaid Kentucky has seen the secondsteepest drop in uninsured of any stateSupporters of the health care law point to it as one of the success stories but the man who very well could become the states next governor is vowing to dismantle Kynect and cancel the Medicaid expansionWe will have a very spirited discussion as it relates to health care in our state Trust me on that vowed Republican Matt Bevin the surprising apparent winner of the contentious GOP gubernatorial primary The Tea Partybacked Bevin finished just 83 votes ahead of James Comer the states agriculture commissioner out of more than 200000 votesObamacares been very good to the state said Al Cross director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of KentuckyBut President Obama is very unpopular in the state and anything associated with him is too Kentuckians and Bevin are stressing the first three syllables instead of the last one in Obamacare Cross saidIt is the latest example of the problems Obamas signature legislation has faced at the state level where most governors and legislatures are in Republican hands The Affordable Care Act often called Obamacare can be viewed very differently based on the nameIn 2013 Hart Research and Public Opinion Strategies the bipartisan pollsters who conduct the NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll tested that in 2013 for CNBC The poll asked separately about feelings toward Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act There was almost a 10point difference in how much more negatively people felt toward Obamacare and almost three times as many did not know the Affordable Care ActIt was similar when the question was asked specifically in Kentucky about feelings toward Kynect and the new health care law An NBC NewsMarist poll in May 2014 found by a 29 percent to 22 percent margin that Kentuckians had a favorable opinion of their state health care exchange But 57 percent had an unfavorable view of Obamacare while just 1 in 3 had a positive oneIn Kentucky the governor has the power to unilaterally create or disband programs like Kynect Cross said Incumbent Democratic Gov Steve Beshear chose to both set up a state exchange and expand Medicare But he is termlimitedBevin a venture capitalist who lost badly in a Senate primary last year to Mitch McConnell would face off with Democrat Jack Conway Conway the state attorney general starts as a slight favorite but Kentucky is a conservative state and Conway struggled in his 2010 Senate bid against Republican Rand PaulBevin made getting rid of Kynect and the Medicaid expansion central to his campaign He is also vowing to implement righttowork laws and shrink government in part through attrition of public sector workersI think it too is destined to crumble under the weight of its own instability Bevin said of Kynect when he announced his longshot bid for governorBevin wound up breaking through in the primary in large measure by pitting the two frontrunners against each other He did it with this memorable ad depicting Comer and Hal Heiner a former Louisville city councilman as children at a backyard table throwing food at each otherHal Heiner and James Comer are acting like children throwing insults and attacking each other an announcer says as pasta splatters across the lens Kentucky can do much better The ad pivots labeling Bevin as grownup leadership for KentuckyBut now it will be Bevins policies that come under sharper scrutiny He argues the state cannot afford the Medicaid expansion which was the biggest reason for the drop in the uninsured Federal funds currently pay for it but that money will eventually go awayThe fact that we have 1 out of 4 people in this state on Medicaid is unsustainable its unaffordable Bevin said during the campaign and we need to create jobs in this state not more government programs to cover peopleBut Medicaid expansion is different than Kynect which has been held up as one of the bestfunctioning state exchanges in the countryHe wont get away with it Cross maintained of Bevins promise to get rid of Kynect Hell have to get serious about it at some point and stop conflating Kynect and the Medicaid expansion
