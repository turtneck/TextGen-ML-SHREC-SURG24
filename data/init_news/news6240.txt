 Defying the Politics of Fear By Chris HedgesChris Hedges gave this talk Saturday evening at a rally in Philadelphia for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu BarakaNovember 08 2016  Information Clearing House    Truth Dig   No social or revolutionary movement succeeds without a core of people who will not betray their vision and their principles They are the building blocks of social change They are our only hope for a viable socialism They are willing to spend their lives as political outcasts They are willing to endure repression They will not sell out the oppressed and the poor They know that you stand with all of the oppressedpeople of color in our prisons and marginal communities the poor unemployed workers our LGBT community undocumented workers the mentally ill and the Palestinians Iraqis and Afghans whom we terrorize and murderor you stand with none of the oppressed They know when you fight for the oppressed you get treated like the oppressed They know this is the cost of the moral life a life that is not abandoned even if means you are destined to spend generations wandering in the wilderness even if you are destined to failI was in East Germany Czechoslovakia and Romania in 1989 during the revolutions or in the case of Romania an interparty putsch These revolutions were spontaneous outbursts by an enraged population that had had enough of communist repression mismanagement and corruption No one from the dissidents themselves to the ruling communist parties anticipated these revolts They erupted as all revolutions do from tinder that had been waiting years for a sparkThese revolutions were led by a handful of dissidents who until the fall of 1989 were marginal and dismissed by the state as inconsequential until it was too late The state periodically sent state security to harass them It often ignored them I am not even sure you could call these dissidents an opposition They were profoundly isolated within their own societies The state media denied them a voice They had no legal status and were locked out of the political system They were blacklisted They struggled to make a living But when the breaking point in Eastern Europe came when the ruling communist ideology lost all credibility there was no question in the minds of the public about whom they could trust The demonstrators that poured into the streets of East Berlin and Prague were aware of who would sell them out and who would not They trusted those such as Vclav Havel  who had dedicated their lives to fighting for open society those who had been willing to be condemned as nonpersons and go to jail for their defianceOur only chance to overthrow corporate power comes from those who will not surrender to it who will hold fast to the causes of the oppressed no matter what the price who are willing to be dismissed and reviled by a bankrupt liberal establishment who have found within themselves the courage to say no to refuse to cooperate The most important issue in this election does not revolve around the personal traits of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump It revolves around the destructive dynamic of unfettered and unregulated global capitalism the crimes of imperialism and the security and surveillance apparatus These forces are where real power lies Trump and Clinton will do nothing to restrict themIt is up to us to resist We must refuse to be complicit even in the act of voting with the fossil fuel industrys savaging of our ecosystem endless wars oppression of the poor including the one in five children in this country who is hungry the evisceration of constitutional rights and civil liberties the cruel and inhumane system of mass incarceration and the statesponsored execution of unarmed poor people of color in our marginal communitiesJulien Benda reminds us that we can serve two sets of principles Privilege and power or justice and truth The more we make compromises with those who serve privilege and power the more we diminish the capacity for justice and truth Our strength comes from our steadfastness to justice and truth a steadfastness that accepts that the corporate forces arrayed against us may crush us but that the more we make compromises with those whose ends are privilege and power the more we diminish our capacity to effect changeKarl Popper in The Open Society and Its Enemies writes that the question is not how do you get good people to rule Popper says this is the wrong question Most people attracted to power he writes have rarely been above average either morally or intellectually and often have been below it The question is how do we build forces to restrict the despotism of the powerful There is a moment in Henry Kissingers memoirsdo not buy the bookwhen Nixon and Kissinger are looking out at tens of thousands of antiwar protesters who have surrounded the White House Nixon had placed empty city buses in front of the White House to keep the protesters back He worried out loud that the crowd would break through the barricades and get him and Kissinger And that is exactly where we want people in power to be This is why although he was not a liberal Nixon was our last liberal president He was scared of movements And if we cannot make the elites scared of us we will failThe rise of Donald Trump is the product of the disenchantment despair and anger caused by neoliberalism and the collapse of institutions that once offered a counterweight to the powerful Trump gives vent to the legitimate rage and betrayal of the white underclass and working poor His rightwing populism which will grow in virulence and sophistication under a Clinton presidency mirrors the rightwing populism rippling across much of Europe including Poland Hungary France and Great Britain If Clinton wins Trump becomes the dress rehearsal for fascismA bankrupt liberal class as was true in Yugoslavia when I covered the war and as was true in Weimar Germany is the great enabler of fascism Liberals in the name of the practical refuse to challenge parties that betray workingmen and women They surrender their values for political expediency Our failure to build a counterweight to the Democratic Party after it abandoned the working class with the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 was our gravest mistakeHillary Clinton embodies the detested neoliberal establishment She can barely fend off one of the most imbecilic and narcissistic candidates in American history Matched against a demagogue with brains and political skill she would lose If we do not defy the neoliberal order championed by Clinton and the Democratic Party elites we ensure the conditions for a terrifying rightwing backlash one that will use harsh and violent mechanisms to crush the little political space we have leftThe tactic of strategic voting begs the question Strategic for whom Our moneydrenched heavily managed elections are little more than totalitarian plebiscites to give a veneer of legitimacy to corporate power As long as we signal that we are not a threat to the established order as long as we participate in this charade the neoliberal assault will continue towards its frightening and inevitable conclusionAlexis de Tocqueville correctly saw that when citizens can no longer participate in a meaningful way in political life political populism is replaced by a cultural populism of sameness resentment and mindless patriotism and by a form of antipolitics he called democratic despotism The language and rituals of democracy are used to mask a political system based on the unchallenged supremacy of corporate power one the political philosopher Sheldon Wolin calls inverted totalitarianismWe must build structures of open defiance to the corporate state It may take as long as a decade for us to effectively confront corporate power But without a potent counterweight to the neoliberal order we will be steadily disempowered Every action we take every word we utter must make it clear that we refuse to participate in our own enslavement and destruction The rapid disintegration of the ecosystem means resistance cannot be delayedOur success will be determined not by the number of votes we get in this or any other election but by our ability to stand unequivocally with the oppressed The enemies of freedom throughout history have always charged its defenders with subversion The enemies of freedom have often convinced large parts of a captive population to parrot back mindnumbing clichs to justify their rule Resistance to corporate power will require fortitude an ability to march to the beat of our own drumNo revolutionary abandons no matter what the cost those he or she defends We cannot betray those murdered by police in our marginal communities We cannot betray the courageous dissidentsJulian Assange Chelsea Manning Edward Snowden and the great revolutionary Mumia AbuJamal  They have not betrayed us We cannot betray the dissidents in North Dakota who are defying a fossil fuel industry that is orchestrating the sixth great mass extinction  melting the polar ice caps and raising carbon emissions to over 400 parts per million We cannot betray the 23 million men and women locked in cages across this nation for years and decades We cannot betray the Palestinians We cannot betray the Iraqis and Afghans whose lives we have destroyed by state terror If we betray them we betray ourselvesWe cannot betray the ideal of a popular democracy by pretending this contrived political theater is free or fair or democratic We cannot play their game We cannot play by their rules Our job is not to accommodate the corporate state Our job is to destroy it We think we are the doctors Alexander Herzen told anarchists of another era We are the diseaseThe state seeks to control us through fear propaganda wholesale surveillance and violence This is the only form of social control it has left The lie of neoliberalism has been exposed Its credibility has imploded The moment we cease being afraid the moment we use our collective strength as I saw in Eastern Europe in 1989 to make the rulers afraid of us is the moment of the systems downfallGo into the voting booth on Tuesday Do not be afraid Vote with your conscience Vote Green If we win 5 percent we win Five percent becomes the building block for the years ahead A decade ago Syriza the ruling party in Greece was polling 4 percent And after you vote join some movement some protest some disruption Black Lives Matter the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel an antifracking demonstration Courage is contagious Revolutions begin as I saw in East Germany with a few Lutheran clergy holding candles as they marched through the streets of Leipzig in East Germany It ends with half a million people protesting in East Berlin the defection of the police and the army to the side of the protesters and the collapse of the Stasi state But revolutions only happen when a few dissidents decide they will no longer cooperate when they affirm what we must all affirm when as Havel said they choose to live in truthWe may not succeed So be it At least those who come after us and I speak as a father will say we tried The corporate forces that have us in their death grip will destroy our lives They will destroy the lives of my children They will destroy the lives of your children They will destroy the ecosystem that makes life possible We owe it to those who come after us not to be complicit in this evil We owe it to them to refuse to be good Germans I do not in the end fight fascists because I will win I fight fascists because they are fascistsChris Hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America the Middle East Africa and the Balkans He has reported from more than 50 countries and has worked for The Christian Science Monitor National Public Radio The Dallas Morning News and The New York Times for which he was a foreign correspondent for 15 yearsChris Hedges The End of the Election Will Not Mean the End of Public Anger Posted on Nov 8 2016In a 30minute interview with Sophie Shevardnadze at RT Truthdig columnist Chris Hedges discusses who will be the real loser in the 2016 US presidential raceSophie Shevardnadze Chris Hedges Pulitzerprize winning journalist author welcome to the show once again great to have you back Hillary was seemingly cruising to victory just after the debates  some polls gave her a 10 point lead  and now theres virtually nothing separating the candidates Today if you had a million bucks whod you bet it on  Clinton or TrumpChris Hedges Its impossible to tell you because it really will depend on the mood on the emotions of the voters on election day Thats all these campaigns are about because they both essentially are neoliberal candidates who will do nothing to impede imperial expansion and corporate power The whole campaign has descended to you know not surprisingly to the level of a reality TV show with presidential debates featuring women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault being brought in by Donald Trump videos  Ill go back to the primaries  of the size of peoples genitals I mean its just appalling but all of that is emblematic of a political system in deep decay and one that no longer revolves around fundamental issues We know from the Wikileaks emails the John Podesta emails that were leaked from Hillary Clinton that there was a calculated effort on a part of a Clinton campaign to promote these fringe candidates  like Trump and they particularly wanted Trump because the difference between Hillary Clinton and a more mainstream Republican candidate like Jeb Bush is so marginal So if you had to ask me I dont think Trump will win but I dont rule out the possibility that he will win  we have to look at the Brexit polls in BritainSS RightCH And same kind of anger is underway hereSS The FBI is extending its investigation into the Clinton email case  after obtaining a warrant to search the laptop of Clintons closest aide Huma Abedin The Clinton campaign says the move is political  is the FBI guilty of swaying the vote like Hillary suggestsCH To be fair to FBI they were put in a very difficult position  there are tens of thousands they say 660000 emails we dont really know how many of those but if the FBI made this discovery and did not make it public they would be accused of course of aiding Clinton campaign I dont know the motives but I think we do have to recognise that the FBI I think felt correctly that given the volatility of the campaign and the fact that they had after the investigation of the Clinton email  she had used a private server  while they certainly felt that it was inappropriate to exonerate her of criminal activity that they felt kind of a responsibility to be transparentSS Another FBI investigation showed that the bureau didnt find any evidence that Trump is tied to the Kremlin like the Clinton campaign implied  has Hillarys attempt to play the Russian card failedCH I dont know that its failed because the media has been quite obsequious in terms of parroting back this narrative and one of the frustrations of the Wikileaks email dumps the John Podesta emails he is her campaign manager runs her campaign  is that the contents were often overlooked to essentially ask the question Is Russia trying to influence the elections and as a former investigative reporter for the New York times this is just not a legitimate question I spent manymany years 15 years with the Times I was elated all sorts of information by all sorts of governments from the French Intelligence agency to the Israeli Secret Service the Mossad to the US government  and these people were not leaking it because they cared about democracy or an open society they were leaking this information because it was in their interest to do so and my job as a reporter was to determine whether this leaked information was true or untrue  and thats really the only thing the reporter should do with the leaked information on the Podesta emails But one of the things that as a reporter as a former investigative reporter that has disturbed me is that they have  Im talking about the press especially about the electronic commercial corporate press  they have effectively ignored much of what is in the emails to carry up this speculation Meanwhile of course nobody has offered us any evidence that the Trump campaign is linked in any way to Russia or that Russia is responsible for the email dumpSS Were used to the fact that ordinary Americans dont really care about foreign policy but this campaign has focused a lot on foreign issues and Russia in particular Are candidates trying to unite the nation by creating the image of a foreign threatCH Yeah Its very disturbing on many levels the kind of neoconservative foreign policy cabal led by Robert Kagan and others that is around Clinton The very people who gave the disastrous Iraq war are now proposing policies to bait Russia You know it makes absolutely no sense to those of us who spend as many as I did two decades abroad as a foreign correspondent except that it plays well politically into this very stunted peculiar neocon vision of the world and that is that everybody out there only understands one language and thats force Thats how you see these 15 years now of war the longest war in US history Its been an utter disaster utter failure both in Iraq and Afghanistan and of course Syria and Libya  and yet whats the response More bombs more bombs more bombs which created the problems in the first placeSS Yeah and do Americans like being scared by a foreign adversaryCH No I dont think they like it but its a very effective form of control Fear works and Americans are hardly the only people to use it Terrorism the specter of Russiawhatever it is Fear is a form of social control and when you have essentially two political parties that are doing corporate bidding that serves the interests of corporate global elites at the expense of the citizens  they need fear they need to manufacture fear and I think thats what were seeingSS Trump has said things along the lines of this election is rigged and hes hinted that he may contend the results which is kind of like admitting hell be defeated Is this talk backfiring and scaring away voters Why would people head to the ballots if they think their voice doesnt count anywayCH The Trumps base primarily white lowerworking class which has been dispossessed through deindustrialisation is going to head to the polls They are attempting to work within the system If the race is close and Trump loses I think everything we have seen given the volatility of Trump suggests that he will charge that the elections were rigged We certainly have seen evidence now from in particular the leaked emails of the rigging of the primaries on the part of the Democratic National Committee on behalf of the Clintons Its pretty clear that Nevada Caucus was stolen they blocked independents from voting in many of the primaries in many of the states and independents were Bernie Sanders primary base We just saw a few days ago a day or two ago that Clinton was actually leaked questions that would be given to her at a staged I mean they call them Townhalls theyre totally Potemkinlike reality shows totally scripted  so its enough to look into the inner workings to suggest that these people the Clinton machine the Democratic party do not play fair So yeah I think that that is the danger and the danger becomes then when enraged Trump supporters believe that the system is rigged the system is broken it doesnt function fairly  and that becomes dangerous because these people will resort to kind of anarchic levels of violenceSS Filmmaker Michael Moore who you cant call a Republicanfriendly figure exactly called Trump a human Molotov cocktail which desperate poor voters can throw at the system that stole their lives from them How come a Republican candidate is the candidate of the dispossessed shouldnt Hillary be the one taking care of themCH Yeah That is the whole idea that a billionaire developer is somehow the voice of the dispossessed but he has tapped into this rightwing populism This is coupled with a kind of xenophobia kind of exalted nationalism and a statement  which is true of course  that the elites have betrayed the ordinary citizenry So when Donald Trump goes to Michigan and stands before the executives from car manufacturers who are moving their plants over the border courtesy of NAFTA to Mexico and says that if you try to make cars in Mexico Ill put a 35 tariff on it  this is something that no candidate in either party has been saying and there are manymany really struggling I mean half of this country now lives in poverty people who have been waiting a long time for somebody to stand up and defy these corporate executives and CEOs who have destroyed their lives the lives of their communities destroyed the lives of their families So in that sense Trump is not a traditional Republican which is why the Republican establishment itself has united with the Democratic establishment to try and destroy the Trump presidency  much as in 1972 the leftwing insurgent candidate George McGovern saw the establishment of the Democratic party unite with the establishment of the Republican party to elect Richard NixonSS The election is estimated to have cost 66 billion dollars so far thats including the House and Senate campaign spending and is likely to end up being even more pricey than that Thats the whole budget of Bahrain Elections in India have four times as many voters and cost one billion less Is this price tag cutting off any truly independent candidate like Bernie SandersCH You cant compete unless you can raise that kind of money unless you can get into debates Bernie Sanders actually raised significant sums he didnt do it through corporations his average campaign contribution was 27  but yeah you cant play in this game of political theater unless youre bankrolled to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars That is the part of the way they lock out thirdparty candidates like the Green party candidate Jill SteinSS The Democratic party managed to fend off an antisystem challenger  Sanders  how come the Republicans couldnt find anyone who could defeat TrumpCH Because the establishment itself is so deeply hated so when the Republican establishment finally did  they didnt take him seriously in the beginning and when they did turn on him they trotted out the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney to attack him and people just laughed Its the Romneys the Bushes the Clintons the Obamas its that establishment that people are turning against  which is why Hillary Clinton is having such a difficult time competing against such an imbecilic undisciplined and impulsive and frankly ignorant candidateSS Im just wondering  why is the media even the rightleaning media which created Trumps phenomenon  turning on him in this campaignCH Two reasons One  he is attacking the trade agreements which is how the elites make their money and secondly hes a public relations disaster for the US I think those are the two reasons Maybe the third reason is that they dont know what theyre getting with Trump  nobody knows what theyre getting with Trump Trump doesnt know what hes getting with Trump and they know that Clinton will maintain both the imperial overreach and the design of the corporate state So Clintons a sure bet and Trump is just too volatile a candidate and thats why the establishment has turned on himSS PresidentObama has hit the campaign trail to endorse Hillary Clinton  hes warning that all the progress will go out the window if we dont make the right choice Do you think everything Obama achieved will really go out the window if Trump gets electedCH I dont think Obama has achieved very much His healthcare program which is essentially forcing citizens to buy defective corporate products and were watching now massive increases on an average of 22 and people that have the bronze plan different levels of plans cannot even afford the kinds of premiums and copayments  I mean the whole system is a disaster His assault on civil liberties has been worse than under Bush he has expanded imperial wars in places like Libya create more failed states I dont think Obama has much of a legacy Hell walk out and get rich and will start his own Foundation like the Clintons  theres almost a complete continuity between Bush and ObamaSS A recent CNN ORC poll says Obamas approval rating is higher than at any time during his presidency  why is he doing so great now that hes leaving Is that his Hillary campaigning paying offCH You know these people run very skilled public relations operations which revolve not around policy but around creating manufactured personalities and that has been very difficult for Clinton  and thats why Clinton has the secondhighest disapproval rating of any Presidential candidate as far as we know in American history with the exception of course of the person shes competing against  Donald Trump We have to look at what American politics is  its really about creating feelings emotions getting voters to confuse how they are made to feel with knowledge It is not about actual policies and both Michelle Obama who has a very high kind of favourability rating and Barack Obama have been skilled in doing that Its much more difficult thats part of the problem for the Clinton campaignSS Looking back at the beginning of Obamas presidency the Nobel committee handed Obama the peace prize in 2009  not for his accomplishments but for his intentions But the promised peace didnt come to Afghanistan didnt come to Iraq were seeing the unravelling of other Middle Eastern states  did Obamas peace vision not only fail but make things worseCH Oh yeah of course look at Libya look at Syria look at Somalia look at Iraq look at Afghanistan look at Pakistan No its a complete catastrophe Ive spent seven years in the Middle East I was the Middle East bureau chief for the New York Times and what weve done is I would argue the greatest strategic blunder in American history and its one that Obama aided and abetted The whole idea of him as a peace candidate is I mean I kind of gave up on the Nobel Prize Committee I have no idea why this was done As you correctly pointed out he hadnt even done anythingSS Was it a genuine inability to make things better were his hands tiedCH No He was an establishment candidate he was selected anointed and promoted by the Democratic Chicago political machine which is one of the dirtiest in the country he got more money in 2008 from Wall St than the Republican candidate who was against him  McCain No hes very cynicalbright talented unlike George Bush but deeply cynical candidate He brought in the old establishment including the old Defence Secretary Robert Gates who had been the Secretary of Defence under Bush he brought in old these figures like Larry Summers and Geithner who are Wall St marionettes No Obama knew very well what he was doing from the very beginning and effectively Look he won Advertising Ages top annual award which was Marketer of the Year His campaign did because the professionals knew just what he done  he functioned as a brand for the corporate state a very powerful and a very effective oneSS On the other hand America has restored relations with Cuba and reached a nuclear deal with Iran  both seemed unachievable just a couple of years ago Do you count those as a Obamas foreign policy successesCH Yeah they are foreign policy successes but we have to understand that the Pentagon had long fought the neocons call for war with Iran even under the Bush administration they put a stop to it So there was no appetite within the American military establishment for war with Iran anyway So that wasnt really an option despite Israeli pressure In terms of Cuba it just got to the point of absurdity  the boycott of Cuba and we must also remember that the second generation of Cuban Americans did not have that kind of hatred towards Fidel Castro and towards the Cuban regime and so it was politically safer for the Democratic party because the new generation just like the new second and third generation of Jewish Americans dont have that loyalty to Israel  it wasnt as politically volatile a decisionSS Obama made global zero a strategic objective  however he failed to get America to ban nuclear tests by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty while the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock to three minutes to midnight  that is to a nuclear war Why did Obamas promise to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American foreign policy backfireCH Because the militaryindustrial establishment is so powerful in the United States that politicians serve its interests They dont dictate what the interests of that industry is  officialy it swallows about 53 of our discretionary budget but that of course masks huge other expenditures including for our nuclear weapon systems which isnt counted for Veterans affairs which is huge for if you want to count the security and surveillance state which is officially hidden but probably at least a hundred billion dollars Were starving the rest of society to do that and you cant fight these wars Indeed if you were watching the Bernie Sanders campaign Sanders did not take on imperial adventurism or the military establishment  because you cant within the American political system  and Obama I think is an example of thatSS Police shootings of unarmed black men have sparked massive protests and the Black lives matter movement  does Obama being the first black president actually mean little for race troubles in the USCH It means nothing because you have deindustrialised urban centres ie places that once had factories and jobs which are now in ruins  you walk through them and its boarded up factories and pothole streets and crumbling infrastructure dysfunctional schools and there are no jobs So you have created mini police states in these marginal communities where police can serve as we see as Judge Jury and Executioner  three in one Americans almost all poor people of colour are shot by police in this country every day and its a form of social control along of course with mass incarceration We have 25 of the worlds prison population and 4 of the worlds population  most of those imprisoned are poor people of colour So when youve taken away the possibility for jobs and with it the possibilities for hope for advancement for inclusion within both the economic and political system  then you need these very harsh forms of controls in order to keep people essentially fenced in Thats why these killings dont stop it doesnt matter how many protests are carried out and Obama has quite sadly betrayed if we go back especially to 2008 and even to 2012 his primary base  AfricanAmericans voted in staggering numbers for Obama I think 90 or something Almost that high and yet life for AfricanAmericans I would argue after 8 years of Obama is worse than when he took powerSS Weve been talking to Chris Hedges author Pulitzerprize winning journalist talking about the ups and downs of 2016 US Presidential Campaign and the end of the Obama era as the Americans are gearing up to choose their next President tomorrow Well of course be watching the vote closely Thats it for this edition of SophieCo I will see you next time
