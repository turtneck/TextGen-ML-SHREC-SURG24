 To join the few and the proud who police Britains streets with a gun first you have to walk the beat unarmed for yearsThen there is the rigorous selection process  an unforgiving complement of fitness tests psychological appraisals and marksmanship exams Finally there is the training which involves endless drilling on even the most routine scenariosThey rehearse those situations like a SEAL team trying to get into Osama bin Ladens compound Cambridge University criminologist Lawrence Sherman saidYet in a country where the vast majority of police officers patrol with batons and pepper spray the elite cadre of British cops who are entrusted with guns almost never use them Police in Britain have fatally shot two people in the past three yearsThats less than the average number of people shot and killed by police every day in the United States over the first five months of 2015 according to a Washington Post analysisAs the United States reckons with that toll  and with the constant drip of videos showing the questionable use of force by officers  lightly armed Britain might seem an unorthodox place to look for solutions But experts say the way British bobbies are trained commanded and vigorously scrutinized may offer US police forces a useful blueprint for bringing down the rate of deadly violence and defusing some of the burning tension felt in cities from coast to coastOf course British and US police are patrolling different societies The United States has some of the worlds loosest gun laws and some of the highest rates of gun ownershipBritain is the opposite with handguns and assault rifles effectively bannedThat inherently changes the way police officers do their jobsPhil Palmer was a British police officer for 15 years and was stabbed twice in the line of dutyBut in all my time I never expected to have to deal with anyone with a firearm he saidDuring a year in the United States teaching and working with New York City police officers he quickly realized that they had a very different expectationThey were very professional But every time they got out of their car to talk to someone their hand would hover over the gun said Palmer now the codirector of the Institute of Criminal Justice Research at Britains University of Southampton Police in America are more aggressive and I think thats because they have to beBut there are also enough similarities that the British model carries special relevance Like the United States Britain is large urbanized democratic and diverse Police have to reckon with gang violence organized crime and Islamist extremists all amid persistent allegations that they unfairly target minority communitiesThat puts Britain in a different class than the handful of other nations that largely forgo firearms when policing including New Zealand Iceland Ireland and NorwayFew here would argue that the United States should adopt Britains nearly firearmsfree approach But as increasingly horrified British officers and commanders have watched videos of American police officers firing on civilians they say they hope that some of their strategies and practices can be translated across the AtlanticSir Peter Fahy chief of the Greater Manchester Police commands 6700 officers  just 209 of whom are armed Those authorized to carry guns he said face extremely tight protocols governing when they can be deployed and under what circumstances they can fire Shooting at moving vehicles at people brandishing knives and at suspects fleeing a scene are all strictly forbidden except under extreme circumstancesIts very controlled he said Theres a huge emphasis on human rights a huge emphasis on proportionality a huge emphasis on considering every other optionAll officers he said are taught to back away from any situation that might otherwise escalate and to not feel that they have to win every confrontationI constantly remind our officers that their best weapon is their mouth he said Your first consideration is Can you talk this through Can you buy yourself timeThat mantra helps explain why across England and Wales over the past decade there has been an average of only five incidents a year in which police have opened fireSo too does the stringent screening process Officers must serve for years before they can apply to carry a gun and the selection of those deemed worthy is intensely competitiveWhen Mark Williams applied to be a firearms officer in 1995 he was among a group of 16 who started the grueling regimen of physical and psychological trials Three made itWilliams was among them but that wasnt the end of the testing He and his fellow firearms officers faced regular drills challenging them to find creative ways out of confrontations and spent long nights at the shooting range to upgrade their marksmanshipIf you fired the kind of rounds we did youd be bankrupt said Williams who is now chief executive of the Police Firearms Officers Association We can put a lot of effort into the ones who are armed because there arent that manySome aspects of British policing are more easily transferrable Sherman the Cambridge criminologist recently told a White House task force that the United States should create a national college of policing that states should set up police inspectors general to provide oversight and that local police forces should merge to achieve a minimum standard of 100 officers per department All are steps he said that have worked in BritainOf course police shootings here can still arouse intense debate One of the most prominent came in 2005 when a Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was mistakenly identified as a wouldbe suicide bomber and shot nine times in the head by elite officers in a Tube station in LondonProsecutors chose not to charge anyone with his killing a decision his family is challenging this week at the European Court of Human RightsIn 2011 police shot dead a 29yearold black man Mark Duggan prompting several nights of riots across London An inquest later ruled the killing had been lawful because police had ample reason to believe that Duggan was armed But rights groups say the killing and others like it raise questions about police practices that echo concerns in the United StatesThey may well be fewer here but they raise similar issues said Deborah Coles codirector of Inquest an advocacy groupStill there is little doubt that Britain has a more uniform and transparent process for reviewing such casesEvery police killing here is subject to an independent inquiry and even nonfatal shootings are meticulously tracked and evaluatedSir Denis OConnor a former police chief who later served as a royally appointed independent overseer of British police work said cops here take seriously the idea of policing by consent They see themselves as working for the public he said rather than for the state itselfThey also know that someone is always looking over their shoulderThe cops here tend to fear getting it wrong and being criticized by a judge he said Cops in the US fear getting shot Those are two very different worldsAfter 800 years Britain finally asks Do we need a written constitutionWorld crises may be multiplying but campaign turns Britain further inward
