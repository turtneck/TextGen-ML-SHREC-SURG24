President Obama named federal appeals judge Merrick Garland on Wednesday as his pick to succeed Antonin Scalia on the US Supreme Court  setting up a showdown with Republicans who have vowed to block the choiceObama who said he went through a rigorous and comprehensive screening process said Garland would bring integrity modesty and an evenhandedness to the Supreme CourtI said I would take this process seriously and I did Obama said at the Rose Garden ceremonyYet within minutes Republicans doubled down on their opposition to confirming any nominee in an election year insisting that the vacant seat not be filled until a new president is sworn inIt is a presidents constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice and it is the Senates constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floorObama anticipating the swift resistance urged Republicans to reconsider adding it would be unprecedented for Garland not to at least get a hearingI hope theyre fair Thats all Obama said To give him a fair hearing and up or down voteObama said earlier Wednesday that it was both his constitutional duty to nominate a justice and one of the most important decisions that I  or any president  will makeHe added Im doing my job I hope that our senators will do their jobs and move quickly to consider my nomineeA Senate confirmation is required for any nominee to join the benchBefore the announcement Sen Mike Lee RUtah also told Fox News that neither he nor his GOP colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee would back down and declared once more he would stop the nomination from going forwardWeve been clear Lee said of his plan to reject Garlands nominationGarland has served under both Republicans and Democrats He clerked for the courts liberal icon Justice William J Brennan Jr In 1997 32 Republicans voted in favor of his nomination including seven who are still members of the SenateGarland was mentioned as a possible nominee when Justice Paul Stevens retired in 2010The vacancy ultimately went to Justice Elena KaganSen Chuck Schumer of New York the No 3 Democratic leader called Garlands section a bipartisan choice adding If the Republicans cant support him who can they supportSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid who spoke to Obama Wednesday morning said in brief remarks on the Senate floor that Republicans must act on the presidents choice Hes doing his job this morning they should do theirs said the Nevada DemocratIf confirmed Garland would be expected to align with the more liberal members but he is not viewed as downtheline liberal Particularly on criminal defense and national security cases hes earned a reputation as centrist and one of the few Democraticappointed judges Republicans might have fasttracked to confirmation  under other circumstancesBut in the current climate Garland remains a tough sell Republicans control the Senate which must confirm any nominee and GOP leaders want to leave the choice to the next president denying Obama a chance to alter the ideological balance of the court before he leaves office next January Republicans contend that a confirmation fight in an election year would be too politicizedAhead of Obamas announcement the Republican Party set up a task force that will orchestrate attack ads petitions and media outreach The aim is to bolster Senate Republicans strategy of denying consideration of Obamas nominee The partys chairman Reince Priebus described it as the GOPs most comprehensive judicial response effort everOn the other side Obama allies have been drafted to run a Democratic effort that will involve liberal groups that hope an Obama nominee could pull the high courts ideological balance to the left The effort would target states where activists believe Republicans will feel political heat for opposing hearings once Obama announced his nomineeFor Obama Garland represents a significant departure from his past two Supreme Court choices In nominating Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan the president eagerly seized the chance to broaden the courts diversity and rebalance the overwhelming male institution Sotomayor was the first Hispanic confirmed to the court Kagan only the fourth womanGarland  a white male jurist with an Ivy League pedigree and career spent largely in the upper echelon of the Washingtons legal elite  breaks no barriers At 63 years old he would be the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis Powell who was 64 when he was confirmed in late 1971Presidents tend to appoint young judges with the hope they will shape the courts direction for as long as possibleThose factors had until now made Garland something of a perpetual bridesmaid repeatedly on Obamas Supreme Court lists but never chosenBut Garland found his moment at time when Democrats are seeking to apply maximum pressure on Republicans A key part of their strategy is casting Republicans as kneejerk obstructionists ready to shoot down a nominee that many in their own ranks once considered a consensus candidate In 2010 Utah Sen Orrin Hatch called Garland terrific and said he could be confirmed virtually unanimouslyThe White House planned to highlight Hatchs past support as well as other glowing comments about Garland from conservativesA native of Chicago and graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School Garland clerked for two appointees of Republican President Dwight D Eisenhower  the liberal US Supreme Court Justice William Brennan Jr and Judge Henry J Friendly for whom Chief Justice John Roberts also clerkedIn 1988 he gave up a plush partners office in a powerhouse law firms to cut his teeth in criminal cases As an assistant US attorney he joined the team prosecuting a Reagan White House aide charged with illegal lobbying and did early work on the drug case against thenDC Mayor Marion Barry He held a topranking post in the Justice Department when he was dispatched to Oklahoma City the day after bombing at the federal courthouse to supervise the investigation The case made his career and his reputation He oversaw the convictions of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and went on to supervise the investigation into Unabomber Ted KaczynskiPresident Bill Clinton first nominated him to the DC Circuit in 1995His prolonged confirmation process may prove to have prepared him for the one ahead Garland waited 2 12 years to win confirmation to the appeals court Then as now one of the man blocking path was Iowa Sen Charles Grassley argued he had no quarrel with Garlands credentials but a beef with the notion of a Democratic president trying to fill a court he argued had too many seatsGrassley ultimately relented although he was not one of the 32 Republicans who voted in favor of Garlands confirmation Nor was Sen Mitch McConnell the other major hurdle for Garland now The Republicans who voted in favor of confirmation are Sen Dan Coats Sen Thad Cochran Sen Susan Collins Sen Orrin Hatch Sen Jim Inhofe Sen John McCain and Sen Pat RobertsThe Associated Press contributed to this report
