weekendThe masons who built the church placed windows only in the basilicas uppermost story to protect worshipers from the antiCatholic sentiment of the time Francis invoked the basilicas history of high walls and windows as he urged church leaders in the United States to devote more energy to reaching out to young people and those on the periphery of societyIn a nod to Pennsylvanias homegrown saint St Katharine Drexel Francis recounted Pope Leos words to her when she complained of the needs of the missions Leo whom the pontiff called a very wise pope asked Drexel pointedly What about you What are you going to doThose words changed Katharines life because they reminded her that in the end every Christian man and woman by virtue of baptism has received a mission Francis said Each one of us has to respond as best we can to the lords call to build up his body the churchOutside the basilicaSusan Suzi from Hershey Pa and Carmen and Ann Marie Zullo of New Jersey spent three hours on their

champions gay parents and their children Francis has pleaded for compassion in the case of samesex marriage and other family issues but for many the church has not moved far enoughStill his themes of compassion forgiveness and hope have resonated across a wide range of Catholics lapsed Catholics many who practice other faiths and those with no religious convictions at allFather James Bretzky a theology professor at Boston College said that bishops who Francis calls the voice of the church are getting the message particularly after a speech Wednesday where the pope stressed that harsh and divisive language does not befit the tongue of a pastorIts a hard course change though for many of them Bretzky said If the bishops hadnt gotten the message before the meeting in DC they certainly can no longer deny that theyve not heard the pope asking them to take a different tack
