posted by Eddie Got VHS tapes collecting dust on a shelf somewhere Maybe you already reclaimed the space and theyre sitting in an attic longforgotten Hopefully you didnt throw them out though as it turns out there might be quite the market for some old tapes Modern directorial practice for movie releases and rereleases tends to include adding or editing the film from the theatrical version While some people dont mind or even enjoy these changes for others the original cut is worth a hefty price tag This translates to listings on eBay for certain tapes at astronomical prices like one particular Beauty and the Beast tape going for 9999 The original Beauty and the Beast did not include the song Human Again it was cut for space reasons then readded to the 2002 special edition However Disney tapes in particular might be valuable to collectors for other reasons Reddit user RedditExecutive speculates that because of the specific branding on original releases these movies could go for quite a bit On the spines of some VHS and BetaMax tapes is a black diamond with Walts signature on it This was Disneys first attempt to market their videos to homes Because of this certain Disney collectors are convinced that these VHS tapes are worth something While its possible some tapes are indeed worth quite a bit many of the movies listed are actually selling for much less Still if your plan for your old VHS tapes begins and ends with trash them theres no harm in doing your research on what they might be worth Source
