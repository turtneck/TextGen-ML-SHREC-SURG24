Americas constitutional democracy is going to collapseSome day  not tomorrow not next year but probably sometime before runaway climate change forces us to seek a new life in outerspace colonies  there is going to be a collapse of the legal and political order and its replacement by something else If were lucky it wont be violent If were very lucky it will lead us to tackle the underlying problems and result in a better more robust political system If were less lucky well then something worse will happenVery few people agree with me about this of course When I say it people generally think that Im kidding America is the richest most successful country on earth The basic structure of its government has survived contested elections and Great Depressions and civil rights movements and world wars and terrorist attacks and global pandemics People figure that whatever political problems it might have will prove transient  just as happened beforeBut voiced in another register my outlandish thesis is actually the conventional wisdom in the United States Back when George W Bush was president and I was working at a liberal magazine there was a very serious discussion in an editorial meeting about the fact that the United States was now exhibiting 11 of the 13 telltale signs of a fascist dictatorship The idea that Bush was shredding the Constitution and trampling on congressional prerogatives was commonplace When Obama took office the partisan valence of the complaints shifted but their basic tenor didnt Conservative pundits  not the craziest zaniest ones on talk radio but the most serious and wellregarded  compare Obamas immigration moves to the actions of a LatinAmerican military dictatorIn the center of course its an article of faith that when right and left talk like this theyre simply both wrong These are nothing but the overheated squeals of partisans and ideologuesAt the same time when the center isnt complaining about the excessively vociferous complaints of the outparty of the day it tends to be in fullblown panic about the state of American politics And yet despite the popularity of alarmist rhetoric few people act like theyre actually alarmed Accusations that Barack Obama or John Boehner or any other individual politician is failing as a leader are flung and then abandoned when the next issue arises In practice the feeling seems to be that salvation is just one election away Hillary Clinton even told Kara Swisherthat her agenda as a presidential candidate would be to end partisan gridlockIts not going to workThe breakdown of American constitutional democracy is a contrarian view But its nothing more than the view that rather than everyone being wrong about the state of American politics maybe everyone is right Maybe Bush and Obama are dangerously exceeding norms of executive authority Maybe legislative compromise really has broken down in an alarming way And maybe the reason these complaints persist across different administrations and congresses led by members of different parties is that American politics is breaking downTo understand the looming crisis in American politics its useful to think about Germany Japan Italy and Austria These are countries that were defeated by American military forces during the Second World War and given constitutions written by local leaders operating in close collaboration with occupation authorities Its striking that even though the US Constitution is treated as a sacred text in Americas political culture we did not push any of these countries to adopt our basic framework of governmentIn a 1990 essay the late Yale political scientist Juan Linz observed that aside from the United States only Chile has managed a century and a half of relatively undisturbed constitutional continuity under presidential government  but Chilean democracy broke down in the 1970sThe exact reasons for why are disputed among scholars  in part because you cant just randomly assign different governments to people One issue here is that Americanstyle systems are much more common in the Western Hemisphere and parliamentary ones are more common elsewhere LatinAmerican countries have experienced many episodes of democratic breakdown so distinguishing LatinAmerican cultural attributes from institutional characteristics is difficultStill Linz offered several reasons why presidential systems are so prone to crisis One particularly important one is the nature of the checks and balances system Since both the president and the Congress are directly elected by the people they can both claim to speak for the people When they have a serious disagreement according to Linz there is no democratic principle on the basis of which it can be resolved The constitution offers no help in these cases he wrote the mechanisms the constitution might provide are likely to prove too complicated and aridly legalistic to be of much force in the eyes of the electorateIn a parliamentary system deadlocks get resolved A prime minister who lacks the backing of a parliamentary majority is replaced by a new one who has it If no such majority can be found a new election is held and the new parliament picks a leader It can get a little messy for a period of weeks but theres simply no possibility of a yearslong spell in which the legislative and executive branches glare at each other unproductivelyBut within a presidential system gridlock leads to a constitutional trainwreck with no resolution The United Statess recent government shutdowns andexecutive action on immigration are small examples of the kind of dynamic thats led to coups and putsches abroadThere was of course the American exception to the problems of the checksandbalances system Linz observed on this score The uniquely diffuse character of American political parties  which ironically exasperates many American political scientists and leads them to call for responsible ideologically disciplined parties  has something to do with itFor much of American history in other words US political parties have been relatively unideological and undisciplined They are named after vague ideas rather than specific ideologies and neither presidents nor legislative leaders can compel backbench members to vote with them This has often been bemoaned famously a 1950 report by the American Political Science Association called for a more rigorous party system as the source of problems Its also according to Linz helped avert the kind of zerosum conflicts that have torn other structurally similar democracies apart But that diffuse party structure is also a thing of the pastAmerican politics is much more polarized today than it was 25 or 50 years ago But not everyone buys the theory that todays era of party polarization spells big trouble Political scientist Jonathan Bernstein argues that its not some sort of freakish unAmerican phenomenon The real exception Bernstein says the middle of the twentieth century when the parties werent polarized Polarization is the norm he says and hes rightA long line of research starting with Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal political scientists at the University of Georgia and New York University respectively records all congressional votes and then analyzes the types of political coalitions that emerge This system known as DWNOMINATE lets you measure the degree of party polarization precisely When Democrats all vote one way and Republicans all vote the other way politics is highly polarized When votes frequently scramble the parties it is less polarizedWhat this research shows is that the steady march toward polarization over the past generation is a return to a situation that existed during an earlier periodThe story here like so much in American politics is race Southern Democrats had a range of views on nonracial issues but monolithically supported white supremacy and held together in the Democratic Party to maximize their leverage in Congress The result was that the Democratic Party included Northern liberals who supported civil rights and Southern conservatives who supported segregation So polarization temporarily went away in Congress But as segregation receded as an issue in American politics the parties slowly but surely sorted themselves by ideology and so today there is no Republican in Congress more liberal than the most conservative Democrat or viceversa American politics has repolarized According to Bernstein this change may be discomfiting but its nothing to worry about American politics has been polarized before and it was fineWhat this story of reversion misses is the crucial role of ideology Polarization and ideology are clearly related concepts but simply counting congressional votes doesnt really tell us what those votes were about Georgetown University Professor Hans Noel greatly improved our understanding of the relationship between the two by extending the DWNOMINATE methodology to people who arent elected officialsFor his book Political Parties and Political Ideologies in America Noel constructs ideological space scores for writers and political pundits  people who address the same issues as elected officials but who are not serving on Capitol HillWhat he found is that while Gilded Age members of Congress voted in a highly partisan way their voting didnt reflect any polarization of ideas evident in broader American society As Charles Calhoun a leading scholar of Gilded Age politics has written the main concern of actual members of Congress was not policy but patronage power the privilege of placing ones political friends and supporters in in subordinate offices In other words a member of Congress would get to distribute federal jobs and contracts to his supporters and in exchange the beneficiaries of his patronage would support his partys ticket at all levels For this reason the obscuresounding job of customs collector of the Port of New York was important enough in the 1870s that Chester A Arthur leapt from it to the Vice Presidency The first real filibuster was held over Whig efforts to assign a printing contract to friendly companiesEven though party discipline was strict in these days it was not really about much beyond who held the spoilsOver the course of the 1920s 1930s and 1940s the rise of progressive and liberal ideology and the formation of a conservative ideology to counter it upended this system So much so that by the 1970s it had become common to observe that American political parties were in decline University of California Irvine political scientist Martin Wattenberg achieved the apogee of this literature with his 1985 classic The Decline of Political Parties in America since updated in five subsequent editions citing the waning influence of party professionals the rise of singleissue pressure groups and an attendant fall in voter turnout But as historian Sam Rosenfeld writes underthehood changes in the process for selecting presidential nominees and Congressional leaders ultimately helped to create a newly receptive institutional setting for issuebased activism within the parties leading to the parties reconstitution around modern ideological linesTodays partisan polarization in other words is not the same as its Gilded Age predecessor The old polarization was about control over jobs and money  the kind of thing where splitthedifference compromises are easiest That polarization was eventually undermined by a new politics built around principles For decades politicians found themselves crosspressured between their commitments to a national party network and to various ideological causes Today however politicians are no longer crosspressured We have strong Gilded Agestyle parties but organized around questions of principle rather than questions of patronageYou can take this theory too far of course There have been moments in American life where questions of principle sharply split American politics We had ideological parties or at least one in the 1850s when the antislavery Republican Party rose to the fore But the example is not enormously encouraging  the constitutional process collapsed and we had four years of civil war hundreds of thousands of deaths and then even after a Union victory white supremacy was reestablished in the South through a twodecade campaign of terrorismNot all breakdowns of constitutional processes are as violent as the American Civil WarFor a less catastrophic more realistic view of the kind of thing that could happen here its useful to look to some lessfamiliar but morerecent events in Honduras Back in late 2008 leftwing President Manuel Zelaya was locked in persistent conflict with an oppositioncontrolled congress With neither side able to prevail within the context of the existing system Zelaya decided he wanted to add a fourth question to the upcoming November 2009 election In addition to voting for president congress and municipal offices Zelaya would ask the voters whether they wanted to hold a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution  presumably to allow him to run for reelectionUnfortunately for Zelaya Honduras existing constitution made no provision for rewriting the constitution by plebiscite Consequently in March 2009 Zelaya determined that the solution was to hold another plebiscite On June 28 Hondurans would go to the polls to vote in a nonbinding referendum on whether the constitutional question should be added to the November ballot This he hoped would give him the democratic legitimacy needed to go forward with the constitutional revisionZelayas opponents in congress evidently concerned that the president would win sued They won a court case enjoining the president against holding the referendum Zelaya pressed ahead regardlessIn Honduras the military typically assists with election logistics so Zelaya ordered the army to begin distributing ballots General Romeo Vsquez Velsquez the chief the Honduran military refused to comply On May 24 Zelaya fired the general Several other commanders quit in solidarity The Supreme Court ruled that the dismissal was unconstitutional Throughout June the constitutional process essentially broke down with protests and counterprotests dominating the capital On June 28 the military deposed Zelaya in a coup retroactively justified by a backdated Supreme Court ruling Roberto Micheletti the president of the National Congress was installed in his steadThe military quickly handed power over to a new group of civilians The coup was legitimated by the National Congress and the Supreme Court And its perpetrators argued with some justification that there was no constitutional alternative Zelaya was trying to circumvent the rules so they had no choice but to circumvent them too in responseThe deadlock was ultimately resolved by force rather than legal procedure Zelaya did not have enough support to amend the constitution through the existing process and Honduras constitutional system created no legal mechanism for impeachment of a president The Supreme Court arbitrarily ruled that Zelayas effort to circumvent the amendment process via referendum was illegal while Congress effort to circumvent the impeachment process was fine There were quite a few injuries as protesters clashed with security forces but no massive bloodshedHonduras coup is worth paying attention to not because the exact same scenario is likely to play out in the United States but because it reveals how genuinely difficult it is to maintain constitutional politics in a presidential systemPresidents feel themselves to be accountable for steering the nation And all the evidence indicates that the public and the media do in fact hold presidents broadly accountable for national outcomes Throughout the United States 2012 presidential campaign for example it was universally assumed that good news for the American economy or for America more broadly would redound to Barack Obamas benefit even though control of policymaking was split between the White House and a GOPdominated CongressAs Obamaput it in a November 2014 press conference people are going to ask for greater accountability and more responsibility from me than from anybody else in this town The problem is the president is not only held accountable for things that are in part outside his ability to control gas prices Ebola or shark attacks but for things that are actually under the control of his political adversaries Im the guy whos elected by everybody concluded Obama and they want me to push hard to close some of these divisions break through some of the gridlock and get stuff done If youre going to be held accountable for outcomes in other words then youd better actIn a parliamentary system this is simply democratic accountability in action A head of government who strongly believes the nation needs actions the legislature wont approve can dissolve parliament and hold a new election to decide the issue In Honduras presidential system the very act of trying to schedule a vote to resolve the deadlock was itself unconstitutionalThe United States of course is a long way from a coup What we are witnessing instead is a rise in what Georgetown University Professor Mark Tushnet labeled constitutional hardball in a 2004 articleConstitutional hardball describes legal and political moves that are without much question within the bounds of existing constitutional doctrine and practice but that are nonetheless in some tension with existing preconstitutional understanding In other words moves that do not violate the letter of the law but do trample on our conventional understanding of how it is supposed to workTushnets article is vital reading today in part because the different partisan context in which it was written can help shock people out of their entrenched positions His lead example is from the George W Bush administration when liberals were concerned about the president taking power away from Congress Tushnet describes the strained argument offered by Republican senators in 2005 that Democratic Party filibusters of Bushs judicial nominees violated the constitution At the time of course Democrats found the view that Republicans might simply ban the use of filibusters for this purpose outrageous The filibuster serves as a check on power said Harry Reid that preserves our limited government Joe Biden called the Republicans attempt to end the fillibuster an example of the arrogance of powerBut ultimately the hardball tactic for ending filibusters was used by Democrats in 2013 to halt Republican obstruction of Obamas nominees Republicans Reid said have done everything they can to deny the fact that Obama had been elected and then reelected He argued he had no choice but to abandon a principle that just a few years ago he said was crucial to preserving American liberty Meanwhile Republicans who had supported the 2005 effort to weaken the filibuster executed a perfect flipflop in the other directionTushnets other example from the mid2000s  Texas decision to redraw congressional district boundaries to advantage Republicans between censuses  seems almost adorably quaint by the standards of the Obama eraFrom its very first months Obamas presidency has been marked by essentially nothing but constitutional hardball During the Bush years Democratic senators sporadically employed a variety of unusual delaying tactics to stymie his agenda In 2009 Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans retaliated by using tons of them constantly Suddenly filibustering went from something a Senate minority could do to something it did on pretty much all motions George Washington University congressional scholar Sarah Binderobserves that leaders in the 1970s rarely felt compelled to file for cloture to break filibusters averaging fewer than one per month in some years while in recent years Reid has filed over once per weekAs Jim Manley a former aide to the Democratic Senate leadership explained to The Atlantic the obstruction not only prevented many of Obamas more controversial measures from becoming law it also drastically altered the process of even routine governanceAs a political strategy McConnells tactics were vindicated by the 2010 midterms which showed that making the president look partisan clumsy and inept was a winning strategyRepublicans in Congress subsequently moved beyond unusual acts of obstruction to an unprecedented use of the statutory debt ceiling into a vehicle for policymaking Traditionally a bit of oddball American political theater immortalized in a funny West Wing scene in 2011 the GOP threatened to provoke an unfathomable financial and constitutional crisis unless the Obama administration agreed to sweeping spending cuts Again there was nothing illegal about what Republicans in Congress did here  it was just in its intent and its scope unprecedentedAnd its fairly clear that these actions while consistent with Republican Party electoral success have not exactly produced a wellrespected legislature Congressional approval ratings are so low  and have been for so long  that its become a subject of pollster humor In 2013 Public Policy Polling found that congress was less popular than Genghis Khan traffic jams cockroaches or Nickelback In a less joking spirit Gallup finds that the voters have less confidence in Congress than any other American institution including big business organized labor banks or television newsAs relations with Congress have worsened the Obama administration has set about expanding executive authority over domestic policy to match Bushera unilateralism in the national security domain This came to the fore most publicly with Obamas decision to protect millions of unauthorized migrants from deportation without congressional agreementAs Voxs Andrew Prokop has argued the pattern is actually much broader Obamas handling of K12 education policy is in some ways an even more paradigmatic example of constitutional hardball The George W Bushera education law No Child Left Behind laid out penalties for state education systems that didnt meet certain rather unrealistic targets The laws authors assumed that when the law came up for reauthorization the targets would be changed In case Congress didnt act in time the Secretary of Education also had the authority to issue waivers of the penalties Since Congress no longer really functions there has been no reauthorization of the law So the Obama administration has issued waivers  but only to states that implement policy changes ordered by the Department of EducationUniversity of Chicago political scientist William Howell told Prokop this was a new frontier for executive policymaking Yale Law Schools Bruce Ackerman says Obama used a waiver provision for modest experiments and transformed it into a platform for the redesign of the statute Obamas actions are clearly legal  but they are just as clearly a decision to creatively exploit the letter of the law to vastly expand the scope of executive power over the lawThose who like these actions on their merits comfort themselves with the thought that these uses of executive power are pretty clearly allowed by the terms of the existing laws This is true as far as it goes But its also the case that Obama or some future president could have his political opponents murdered on the streets of Washington and then issue pardons to the perpetrators This would be considerably more legal than a Zelayastyle effort to use a plebiscite to circumvent congressional obstruction  just a lot more morally outrageous In either case however the practical issue would be not so much what is legal but what people including the people with guns would actually tolerateAmericas escalating game of constitutional hardball isnt caused by personal idiosyncratic failings of individual people Obama has made his share of mistakes but the fundamental causes of hardball politics are structural not personal Personalityminded journalists often argue that a warmer executive would do a better job of building bridges to congress But as Dartmouths Brendan Nyhan points out Bill Clintons more successful outreach to his opponents didnt keep him from getting impeached Likewise George W Bush was more gregarious than Obama but it didnt make him any more popular among Democrats once the post911 glow had worn offTheres a reason for this and it gets to the core of who really runs American politicsIn a democratic society elected officials are most directly accountable to the people who support them And the people who support them are different than the people who dont care enough about politics to pay much attention or the people who support the other side They are more ideological more partisan and they want to see the policies they support passed into law A leader who abandons his core supporters because what they want him to do wont be popular with most voters is likely in modern American politics to be destroyed in the next primary electionThe amateur ideological activists who eroded the power of the party professionals in the 1970s are now running the show While Gilded Age activists traded support for patronage jobs modernday activists demand policy results in exchange for support Presidents need to do everything within their legal ability to deliver the results that their supporters expect and their opponents in Congress need to do everything possible to stop them At one point Republican congressional leaders were highly amenable to passing an immigration reform bill and the Obama administration insisted it had no means of circumventing the legislative process But under pressure from their respective bases Republicans found it impossible to compromise and Obama decided he had better find a way to go around CongressIt is true that the mass public is not nearly as ideological as members of Congress But the mass public is not necessarily active in democratic politics either Emorys Alan Abramowitz finds that the American public has become more consistent and polarized in its policy preferences over the past several decades He also writes that this increase in consistency and polarization has been concentrated among the most politically engaged citizensThis rise in ideological activism has a number of genuinely positive impacts It makes politics less corrupt The leastpolarized state legislatures in America are in places like Rhode Island and Louisiana bastions ofcorruption rather than good government Its not a coincidence that the Tea Party surge led to the end of earmarked appropriations But it heightened executivelegislative conflict and leads to what Linz termed the zerosum character of presidential electionsLooking back at Bushs election in 2000 one of the most remarkable things is how little social disorder there was The American public wanted Al Gore to be president but a combination of the Electoral College rules poor ballot design in Palm Beach County and an adverse Supreme Court ruling put Bush in office The general presumption among elites at the time was that Democrats should accept this with good manners and Bush would respond to the weak mandate with moderate consensusoriented governance This was not in the cards Not because of Bushs personal qualities if anything the Bush family and its circle are standardbearers for the cause of relative moderation in the GOP but because the era of the partisan presidency demands that the president try to implement the partys agenda regardless of circumstances Thats how we got drastic tax cuts in 2001If the Bush years shattered the illusion that theres no difference between the parties the Obama years underscore how much control of the White House matters in an era of gridlock The broadly worded Clean Air Act whose relevant provisions passed in 1970 has allowed Obama to be one of the most consequential environmental regulators of all time  even though he hasnt been able to pass a major new environmental bill Hes deployed executive discretion over immigration enforcement on an unprecedented scale And hes left a legacy that could be rapidly reversed A future Republican administration could not only turn back these executive actions but substantially erode the Affordable Care ActThe lessons of the 2000 and 2008 elections make it unnerving to imagine a BushGore style recount occurring in 2015s political atmosphere The stakes of presidential elections are skyhigh And the constitutional system provides no means for a compromise solution There can be only one president And once hes in office he has little reason to show restraint in the ambitions of the legislative  or nonlegislative  agenda he pursues In the event of another disputed election it would be natural for both sides to push for victory with every legal or extralegal means at their disposalIndeed we ought to consider possibilities more disastrous than a repeat of the 2000 vote What if a disputed presidential election coincided with a Supreme Court vacancy What if the simultaneous deaths of the president and vice president brought to power a House Speaker from the opposite party What if neither party secured a majority of electoral votes and a presidential election wound up being decided by a vote of the lame duck House of Representatives What if highly partisan state legislatures start using their constitutional authority to rig the presidential contest A system of undisciplined or nonideological political parties has many flaws but it is at least robust to a variety of shocks Our current party alignment makes for a much more brittle situation in which one of any number of crises where democratic norms and constitutional procedures diverge could bring us to a state of emergencyThe idea that Americas constitutional system might be fundamentally flawed cuts deeply against the grain of our political culture But the reality is that despite its durability it has rarely functioned well by the standards of a modern democracy The party system of the Gilded Age operated through systematic corruption The less polarized era that followed was built on the systematic disenfranchisement of AfricanAmericans The newer system of more ideological politics has solved those problems and seems in many ways more attractive But over the past 25 years its set America on a course of paralysis and crisis  government shutdowns impeachment debt ceiling crises and constitutional hardball Voters understandably are increasingly dissatisfied with the results and confidence in American institutions has been generally low and falling But rather than leading to change the dissatisfaction has tended to yield wild electoral swings that exacerbate the sense of permanent crisisAs dysfunctional as American government may seem today weve actually been lucky No other presidential system has gone as long as ours without a major breakdown of the constitutional order But the factors underlying that stability  first nonideological parties and then nondisciplined ones  are gone And its worth considering the possibility that with them so too has gone the American exception to the rule of presidential breakdown If we seem to be unsustainably lurching from crisis to crisis its because we are unsustainably lurching from crisis to crisis The breakdown may not be next year or even in the next five years but over the next 20 or 30 years will we really be able to resolve every one of these highstakes showdowns without making any major mistakes Do you really trust Congress that muchThe best we can hope for is that when the crisis does come Americans will have the wisdom to do for ourselves what we did in the past for Germany and Japan and put a better system in place
