Lessig says that his sole mission as president would be to persuade Congress to pass the Citizen Equality Act which would implement three reforms to the political system First it would guarantee the equal right to vote by enhancing the power of the federal government to control how states conduct elections requiring states to provide for online or automated voter registration and shifting Election Day to a national holidaySecond it would guarantee equal representation by banning gerrymandering of districts Lessig also endorses an idea called rankedchoice voting where voters rank the candidates rather than vote for just one The candidate who receives the highest aggregate ranking wins You can find the somewhat complicated details here Third it would provide for citizenfunded elections All voters would be given vouchers that they could use to contribute to political campaigns and small contributions would be matched from public funds Rules blocking government officials from becoming lobbyists would be strengthenedWould these reforms give us citizen equality Unfortunately if money goes to the root of the problem as Lessig says these reforms would have little impact In the best case they would enhance the popular vote in elections by a little bit They might enhance by a small amount cash contributions from lowincome people And Republicandominated state legislatures would lose some of their power to create safe seatsBut in the economy of political influence that Lessig describes in his book none of these things can make much difference Most Americans are terribly uninformed about the political process and rely on very crude proxies such as endorsements or partisan identification to determine how to voteMany people fail to vote not because of barriers to voting but because theyd rather spend their time doing something else Candidates who suited voters a bit better because of rankedchoice voting assuming it works as advertised and who received more small donations from lowincome people would still need to rely on wellinformed lobbyists with whom they had relationships and would still benefit from massive infusions of cash from big business Lessigs cure just doesnt follow from his diagnosisThe current disaffection with the government probably reflects the ideological polarization of the electorate which is an input not an output of the political process People disagree with one another more than in the past sowhatever compromises the government reaches over policythey are more likely to be unhappy with it If people feel that they have no influence on political outcomes thats in part because we live in a huge and diverse country and so even in an ideal system where your vote counts as much as anyone elses its just one of more than a hundred million So there is a mismatch between Lessigs meansa dramatic run for office as an unprecedented referendum president who resigns as soon as his mandate is legislatedand his goal which is at best incremental reform In the past he has argued with a great deal more persuasiveness that the only way to reform the political system is through a constitutional convention and it is easier to see the logic of this position than to understand his campaign goals Constitutional amendments really could go to the root of the problemby limiting campaign contributions and thus overturning Citizens United which held that the First Amendment banned certain limits on political expenditures restructuring the Senate which is a highly unrepresentative body that favors rural interests limiting the power of the Supreme Court and perhaps creating a parliamentary system or something like it which would avoid the twin problems of gridlock and presidential abuse of power that have long been troubling features of our system of separation of powersBut most calls for constitutional conventions come these days from conservatives who want to impose a balanced budget on the federal government and who have no interest in adopting Lessigs electoral reformsnearly all of which would benefit the Democratic party in the short term And the results of a constitutional conventionwhere moneyed interests as well as all kinds of interest groups would play a big roleare unpredictable Well not entirely unpredictable Under the amendment process of the Constitution state legislatures can play an important role in selecting delegates and ratifying amendments And while there is a means to circumvent their formal participation they would probably influence the outcome This matters Republicans have vastly more control over state legislatures than Democrats doin part because of the gerrymandering Lessig wants to endso we can be pretty certain about the ideological tilt of any amendments that might ultimately be ratified if not their content This is probably why Lessig has not adopted his earlier proposal of a constitutional convention to his presidential run The rot goes too deep But it also should raise doubts about whether the Citizen Equality Act can do any good Even if Lessig cant win or cant do much more than hand over the reins to his vice president if he does win his candidacy would bring a rare level of intelligence and political sophistication to the election and muchneeded attention to the problem of electoral reform For that reason you might donate a little money to his campaign I did
