campaign of taking advantage of our country The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement of competence and common sense and low taxes and secure borders and it would be so foolish to give it awayTrump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nominationThe conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmenI know all these people Trump told Hannity These are people that are taking advantage of our countryThey dont want to have strong borders They want stuff flowing across the borders They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from thatPoliticians will do whats right for the people that gave them the money Trump added later not whats right for the countryFormer
