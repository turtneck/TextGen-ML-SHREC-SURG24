RALEIGH NCAyana McAllister went to Hillary Clintons rally two weekends ago at St Augustines University the historicallyblack school where shes a freshman She watched the Democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland But on the eve of the election the 18yearold is still not 100 percent soldI dont know said McAllister a native of Largo Md I feel like Ive got to settle for Hillary I feel like Im going to vote because I know I need to not because I want to I feel like neither of them should be president but I feel like Hillary will be better Really its like two children arguing back and forthThis was a common refrain during interviews at yesterdays football game here between St Augustine and crosstown rival Shaw University another historicallyblack institution Early voting numbers and polling suggest that African American turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008 Though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the Clinton high command Many students at the schools here in Raleigh regret that they never got to vote for Barack Obama They are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between Clinton and Donald Trump but they plan to vote nonetheless In fact teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on TuesdayI am not a fan of either one but of the two I will probably be voting for Hillary said Anoviua Rush a freshman from Durham Shes just a liar And Hillary is not even good at backing up her lies Everyone makes mistakes but when you try to cover them up its a problemAs a marching band performed behind her under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day Rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her but Clintons support for equal pay legislation does Shes more understanding of minorities and what we go through said Rush Im not going to say hes racist but hes said some messed up stuff about minorities  Donalds main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and Ill say it possibly Caucasians A lot of people are very discouraged Very very discouraged said Felishia McPherson 47 who was wearing a Black Lives Matter tshirt Really its like youre choosing between a liar and a clown But who doesnt lie We all lie  Im a mental health counselor I know that psychologically in order to want to be president youve got to be a little narcissistic to start with  Trump was never an option for me I dont love Hillary but I dont have to Shes not coming to my house Shes going to the White HouseMcPherson already voted early for Clinton She brought her sevenyearold niece Malia named after the presidents daughter to Obamas rally in Fayetteville on Friday I dont know if I actually believe in the political system as far as does my one vote count But Im not going to take a chance of it not counting she explained afterward If the system really does work then Im going to participate If it doesnt then I still did the best I could by my ancestors  I do believe with Obamas encouragement even though we may not believe in the system we know we need to do it Several elderly African Americans expressed deep concern that millennials including their grandchildren do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting Irene HillThomas 79 is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in Sampson County If youve been around long enough your eyes are open she said You appreciate it because you fought for it The younger generation hasnt been there They dont know The younger generation doesnt understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so  I remember the white and the colored fountains They dont North Carolina was the closest state Obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012 African Americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times and Obama won almost all of themReflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in North Carolina and the strategic significance of the Research Triangle specifically both candidates will return to Raleigh on Monday Trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds and Clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here  at midnight Another very important explanation for why African American turnout is down in North Carolina Republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours The executive director of the state Republican Party persuaded GOP county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests He pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open especially evenings and Sundays when many African Americans typically cast ballots after church servicesIn the Democraticleaning county that includes Greensboro  the states third largest  there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open This year there was just one So while 61000 people voted during the first week four years ago only 8000 did this year After that first week 25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken I shadowed a field staffer from the AFLCIO affiliate group Working America as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of Raleigh yesterday afternoon Walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off Martin Luther King Jr Blvd Andrea Vogler urged folks to go voteDuring a period of just one hour though half a dozen African Americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long So they came home They all said they hope to still go on Tuesday but what if the lines are long then too Will they stick aroundA woman in a nurses uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week but the lines were too long each timeA younger man named Victor came to his door in redcheckered pajamas He had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around He works a night shift so he said hes going to try voting on his drive home from work at 630 am Tuesday  which he hopes will be before a crowd formsIve heard that on a couple of different days now Vogler 32 lamented as she walked to the next house On the one hand it is good people are trying to vote On the other I hope it doesnt deter anyone from actually votingA woman named Barbara pulling out of her driveway in a Chevy Trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat is one of the people who gave up when she saw the linesDamien her husband was who Vogler had come to talk with Barbara warned her that he was sleeping But every vote counts so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway He was nonplussed I worked all damn night 12 hours he said his eyes bloodshot I just want to go back to my bed She tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for Clinton He grimaced and refused to take itWorking America has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states They have had 573400 conversations with voters since launching this summer including 45500 in North Carolina In the Raleigh area alone the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on Saturday The group largely targets African American and Latino voters though some swing whiteRepublicans are in their universeAn older man sitting in his green Chevy Lumina picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of groundlevel studio apartments told Vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon She informed him that early voting had ended for the day and that Saturday was the final opportunity until Tuesday Damn he repliedNorth Carolina is the most important state Vogler stressed over and over again Youve got to get out to vote In an interview late last night I asked Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross  who is in a neckandneck race with Sen Richard Burr that may decide which party controls the majority  about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines Its by design she complained But she argued that this will also galvanize many African Americans on Tuesday I dont think anything is going to keep people from voting this year she saidRoss a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for sameday voter registration which was pivotal to Obama carrying the state a year later noted that for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites many more waited around There were people who stood for hours in line she saidThe weather forecast for Tuesday looks good and she believes this might make the difference in her razor thin race I think were going to see long lines on Election Day Ross predicted with a southern twang Were going to turn people outA Clinton campaign official speaking anonymously said they were worried during the first week of early voting but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout But allies say Clinton may need to perform especially well on Election Day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeksSurrogates have also streamed into the state to drive African Americans to the polls Civil rights icon John Lewis headlined a march in Charlotte on Thursday Cory Booker came Friday night Other efforts are underway too The national president of the Sierra Club was outside the St Augustines football game handing out biscuits from Bojangles and urging young people to support Clinton in order to advance environmental issues The president himself has now spoken at five rallies for Clinton in North Carolina Addressing a crowd of 2500 that was probably 95 percent black in Fayetteville on Friday he made a very explicit pitch Right now Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor certain areas on Election Day Obama said I dont know what certain areas hes talking about but you doHe finished his speech with the story of a 100yearold woman who was purged from the North Carolina voter rolls after a Republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds Grace Bell Hardison was mentioned in an NAACP lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on Friday North Carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters  most black and Democratic  who had been cut from the rolls under a socalled individual challenge lawSo young people I want you to understand this Obama said It wasnt that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soapIt wasnt that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi  If youve been marching for criminal justice reform thats great But you still need to vote  If you vote well win North Carolina And if we win North Carolina Hillary Clinton will be presidentWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING Trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in Reno last night after a man reportedly yelled gun but the GOP nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speechSecret Service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weaponThe man who identified himself as Austyn Crites 33 was reportedly released after the event telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a Republicans against Trump sign When I pulled out the sign people around me were trying to grab the sign Crites

Florida North Carolina Ohio and Pennsylvania Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012 Until recently it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clintons electoralmap advantage But as the race has tightened Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column and other states outside those four have potentially come into play The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan and New Hampshire  to make up a potential deficit should he not win Florida North Carolina and Pennsylvania  In Trumps case it is an effort to grab what he considers

down Clintons margins in a region that excluding theexurbs leans heavily Democratic Bigger picture Trumps schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now Its not clear where and how he would win Of all of Trumps mustwin states the only one where Mr Trump has really been close in the polls is Nevadawrites TheUpshots Nate CohnBut Nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting and it hasnt brought good news for Mr Trump  Perhaps Mr Trump will mount a huge comeback in Nevada on Election Day Or maybe Democrats are much weaker among registered Democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe But if Mrs Clinton does indeed have a big advantage in Nevada then his chances start looking very bleak Hes at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top Whats more its not really clear where he has his best chance  something reflected in Mr Trumps unfocused preelection push A deep

instead he took the stage and started talking about how terrible Hillary isShe is so trapped in the world of the elite the sophomore in political science said She has completely lost grip of what its

called the FBI a leaky sieve and accused Jim Comey of breaking protocol by announcing his email investigation so close to an election He also dismissed Trump ally Rudy Giulianis decision to back off claims that he Giuliani had been given advance notice of the FBIs plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation I dont think Giulianis walkback is credible the Virginia senator said referring to Giulianis preemptive announcement that the FBI had a big announcement to come I think the FBI sadly has become like a leaky sieve he added New York Times If Clinton Moves to Oval Office Aides Baggage May Be Heavy by Matt Flegenheimer and Mark Landler In the final sprint of her campaign troubled by an FBI inquiry and narrowing polls Clinton has held tightly to a handful of advisers who have spent their careers protecting her interests defending her reputation and at times sullying it  and their own And if she wins on Tuesday the most telling test of Mrs Clintons transition back to power will arrive quickly After a campaign season often defined by voters weariness with and distrust of her which old hands will  or should  follow her into the Oval Office Almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of Mrs Clintons candidacy the inquiry into her use of a private email server  and the WikiLeaks hack of campaign chairman John Podesta The unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother Mrs Clinton much friends say The political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter Boston Globe A1 9 moments that molded the campaign by Matt Viser and Annie Linskey When planning the Democratic convention in Philadelphia Clinton campaign officials didnt initially include Michelle Obama as a featured speaker according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans  For Clintons campaign it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day  when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were both to speak We thought it would be hard for Sanders people to boo Michelle Obama said the person who isnt authorized to talk about the first ladys deliberations Another revelation The

has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope People in small and distant countries who count on the US to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components  trammeled Longstanding allies have been left to wonder  whether the US can be relied on when it counts And even though the campaign still has

rancor is a nave fantasy writesFrank BruniTheres no end here just a punctuation mark a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come And theres no way to unsee what all of us have seen over these last 18 months to bottle up what has been unbottled Election Day will redeem and settle nothing not this time around Whether balloons fall on Clinton or Trump there will be bolder divisions in America than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the countrys most important institutions  Even putting Trumps angry troops aside it feels as if were coming out of this election with four parties the Paul Ryan Republicans the Freedom Caucus the establishment Democrats and the Elizabeth WarrenBernie Sanders brigade  Meet the new paralysis same as the old paralysis Potentially worse From elections past I dont recognize this terrain How can I assume that its navigable If Trump loses the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge says conservative columnist Peter Wehner who served in the Bush and Reagan administrations Policies that promote economic growth social mobility and greater opportunity are important But in some respects the partys stance here is a secondary priority Republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first Will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions or not who conceive of America as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed  who abhor ignorance or embrace it In a postTrump world Republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments Can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite America Does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions Does it believe in a just social order or not The next few months will tell us a lot about whether Mr Trump and Trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that Lincoln helped create When historians write about this bizarre ugly and dispiriting campaign  the epic dark saga will unfold this way A man filled with fear and insecurity created a hatemongering character and followed it out the window And a woman filled with fear and insecurity hunkered down and repeated bad patterns rather than reimagining herself in an open bold way Maureen Dowd writes Before he jumped into the presidential race Trump was seen as bombastic vulgar a bit of a buffoon and a cave man but also a cheeky brio He was not regarded as a bigot or demagogue He was seen as a playboy not a predator  But he created another character for the Republican primaries playing to the feral instincts of angry voters encouraging violence at his rallies hatred toward journalists and disrespect for democracy itself Hes so used to playing a role in different areas of his life said TV personality Donny Deutsch  He saw the crowds adulation and it drove him He started to get the biggest cheers for saying the most offensive things The New Yorkers Jeffrey Toobin dubbed this election Clinton investigation mania part two Bill Clintons Presidency was defined for the most part by criminal and congressional investigations he writes The subjects of those probes sound like entries in a nineteennineties time capsule Whitewater Filegate Travelgate  It may be that Republicans spent so much time in pursuit of Bill Clintons scalp because things were mostly going well otherwise The economy boomed and the nation was at peace So Congress took a vacation from its responsibilities to investigate a decadeold Arkansas land deal in which the Clintons lost money But real dangers abound in the unstable world of today The economy is only tenuously prosperous And a warming planet notwithstanding the lack of interest among debate moderators threatens apocalyptic change A politics based on pursuit and accusation rather than on reason and compromise will address none of these problems And the prospect of four years of governance that resemble the last days of this campaign is one that would drive anyone to drink Averting the worst starts with electing Hillary Clinton says the New York Times Editorial Board For many voters that will mean defying Republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies legal obstructions and the threat of violence We hope the voters hold out however intimidating the process and long the lines For Americans who may feel unmoved or unwilling to vote for Mrs Clinton here is a question from the future In
