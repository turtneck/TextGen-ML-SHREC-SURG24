Facebook must have thought the online news game was pretty easy Two years ago it plucked a small team of about a dozen bright hungry twentysomethings fresh out of journalism school or entrylevel reporting jobs It stuck them in a basement paid them contractor wages and put them to work selecting and briefly summarizing the days top news stories and linking to the news sites that covered them It called them curators not reporters Their work appeared in the Trending section of the Facebook home page and mobile app where it helped to define the days news for millions of Facebook usersOn Tuesday Facebook became the subject of a Senate inquiry over claims of anticonservative bias in its Trending section Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune a South Dakota Republican sent Mark Zuckerberg a letter asking a series of pointed questions about how Facebook chooses stories for the section how it trains its curators whos responsible for their decisions and what steps its taking to investigate the bias claims He also asks for detailed records of stories that the company decided not to include in the Trending section despite their popularity among Facebook usersThe inquiry followed a report by Gizmodos Michael Nunez on Monday in which anonymous former Facebook curators described the subjective process by which they assembled the Trending section Facebook had publicly portrayed the sectionwhich you can find near the top right of Facebookcom or under the search tab on the Facebook appas an algorithmically driven reflection of the most popular stories its users are reading at any given time But the excurators said they often filtered out stories that were deemed questionable and added others they deemed worthy One a selfidentified conservative complained that this led to subtle yet pervasive liberal bias since most of the curators were politically liberal themselves Popular stories from conservative sites such as Breitbart for instance were allegedly omitted unless more mainstream publications such as the New York Times also picked them upNone of this should come as a surprise to any thoughtful person who has worked as a journalist Humans are biased Objectivity is a myth or at best an ideal that can be loosely approached through the very careful practice of trained professionals The news simply is not neutral Neither is curation for that matter in either the journalistic or artistic application of the termThere are ways to grapple with this problem honestlyto attempt to identify and correct for ones biases to scrupulously disclose them to employ an ideologically diverse staff perhaps even to reject objectivity as an ideal and embrace subjectivity But you cant begin to address the subjective nature of news without first acknowledging it And Facebook has gone out of its way to avoid doing that for reasons that are central to its identity as a technology companyFor that matter you dont get that big by admitting that youre a media company As the New York Times John Herrman and Mike Isaac point out 65 percent of Americans surveyed by Pew view the news media as a negative influence on the country For technology companies that number is just 17 percent Its very much in Facebooks interest to remain a social network in the publics eyes even in the face of mounting evidence that its something much bigger than that And its in Facebooks interest to shift responsibility for controversial decisions from humans whom we know to be biased to algorithms which we tend to lionizeHuman values shape the Trending section too The algorithm that surfaces the stories might skirt questions of bias by simply ranking them in order of popularity thus delegating responsibility for story selection from Facebooks employees to its users Even thatthe notion that whats popular is worth highlightingrepresents a human value judgment albeit one thats not particularly vulnerable to accusations of political bias Thats why Twitter isnt in the same hot water over its own simpler trending topics moduleThe problem with an algorithm that simply harnesses the wisdom of the crowd is that the crowd isnt always wise The most popular stories at any given time might well be misleading or sensationalist or even full of lies Thats why Facebook felt the need to hire humans to oversee it This is in keeping with the companys broader push for what it calls quality content another term that entails value judgments without copping to themBut Facebook instead opted to hire cheap contractors and went on to claim that their role is simply to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not for example similarsounding topics or misnomers Thats a dubious claim even if you think the allegations of liberal bias are trumped up If the curators job was really just about cleaning up the data Facebook seems to have forgotten to tell that to the curators themselves who described their mandate very differently to Gizmodo They said they were encouraged to prioritize stories from certain outlets deemed reputable to avoid news about among other topics Facebook itself and to replace the word Twitter in headlines with something more vague like social media That may not be political bias but its bias all the same They also described choosing stories for the Trending section that may not have been surfaced by the algorithm but that seemed to them to be important or worthwhile like stories about conflict in Syria or the Black Lives Matter movementThe problem will not be solved by firing bad apples or instituting tougher guidelines The only way for Facebook to extricate itself from this mess is to admit that journalism isnt as simple as it thought Its to stop treating curators like drones and stop treating news like a data set to be optimized Its to build a real human curation team with a real editor in charge and an ethos and a mission and an understanding of the responsibilities involved in shaping how the news is framed to 16 billion people Surely a company that pays its interns 11000 a month in salary and benefits can afford it
