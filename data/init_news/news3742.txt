What are so few trainers going to do in an Iraq besieged by the Islamic State They send a messagePresident Obamas decision to send an additional 450 troops to Iraq to train mostly Sunni fighters for the battle to oust the Islamic State is a modest gesture aimed at a very big problem  Iraqs wide and deepening sectarian divide between Shiite and Sunni MuslimsThe new trainers expected to arrive in Iraq within a few days will go to a different location from the 3050 United States soldiers already in Iraq and assisting in the training and equipping of Iraqi security forcesThe difference is that the objective of the new site will be to train and arm Sunnis who have largely been excluded from other efforts at building up Iraqs security forces This is a priority that Obama administration officials describe as crucial to the effort to reverse the territorial gains of the Islamic State and ultimately push it out of IraqIts critically important to get the Sunnis in the main security forces said Elissa Slotkin assistant secretary of Defense for international security affairs in a teleconference with reporters Wednesday Thats another reason we want  US forces on the ground she adds to help facilitate that conversation about ensuring that Iraq will have the military represent the people who are resident in IraqThe new training site at Taqaddum air base is significant  and not just because it was the launch pad for the thousands of US Marines who fought for months in 2007 to take back the nearby city of Fallujah from Sunni insurgents It was those same extremists who rose from defeat to regroup in warravaged Syria and form the Islamic StateTaqaddum the Marines simply called it TQ is located outside Ramadi the capital of the Sunnidominated Anbar province that Islamic State militants have largely controlled since sweeping into Iraq from Syria a year agoNow it will be the goal of the US trainers at TQ to build a fighting force drawn largely from local Sunni tribes to spearhead the fight to take back Ramadi which fell to the Islamic State last month and begin pushing the extremists out of AnbarIt is a very tall order  and one that stands virtually no chance of succeeding in the absence of broad political reforms by the Shiiteled government in Baghdad that address the deep marginalization and political exclusion of Iraqs Sunnis That alienation has left many Sunnis either indifferent to Islamic State gains or in some cases even sympathetic to themMr Obamas order reflects a request from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider alAbadi for more help for the fight to retake lost territory from the Islamic State But it is also an attempt to emphasize the presidents conviction that no amount of US assistance can succeed without an inclusive government in Baghdad and Sunni buyin to the new IraqJust days ago at the Group of Seven meeting of leading industrialized nations in Germany Obama essentially said that the US had too many trainers in Iraq already speaking of more training capacity than weve got recruits But Obama has made it clear he believes whats lacking is a military that includes all of Iraqs communities  and in particular the disenfranchised SunnisYouve had in the past some of the Sunni tribes who have not joined the regular Iraqi security forces  because of some of the political tensions and divisions in Iraqi politics over the last several years said Ben Rhodes deputy national security adviser for strategic communications on the same teleconference Part of what were aiming to do  is to provide different pipelines for Iraqis to get into the fight under the umbrella of the Iraqi security forcesAddressing the Iraqi shortcomings after meeting Monday with Mr Abadi on the margins of the G7 summit Obama zeroed in on the sectarian factorIraqs Sunnis are willing and prepared to fight he said but bringing them into the security forces and training programs has not been happening as fast as it needs toObamas decision is also intended to bolster Abadi a Shiite politician facing opposition within the Iraqi government to any gestures toward the Sunnis The administration views Abadi as open to political reforms but hesitant before the stiff headwinds hes encountering from morehardline ShiitesIn addition the plan to empower Iraqs Sunnis is intended as something of a counterbalance to Irans growing influence in Iraq Iran is advising and equipping the Shiite militias that have filled the void left by a collapsed Iraqi Army and police forceBut those militias have also deepened the wedge between Shiites and Sunnis with many Shiites welcoming their and Irans growing influence while Sunnis accuse them of abuses and serving Shiite purposesObama has consistently said the fight to oust the Islamic State is one the Iraqis have to win themselves and Wednesdays announcement only underscores that perspective By sending 450 additional trainers to Iraq Obama can hardly hope to heal Iraqs sectarian divide But the step may at least test whether the Iraqi will and intent are there to do it
