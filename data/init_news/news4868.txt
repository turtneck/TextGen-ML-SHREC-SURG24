Politics Bombs Ready The American Blob Is Already Oozing Into Syria The US foreign policy establishment is laying the groundwork for Hillary to send the US military against the Syrian state Originally appeared at The Week Syria is in absolute ruins The ongoing civil war a disorganized melee involving the Assad regime various rebel groups Russia Iran ISIS and other Islamists Turkey Kurdish forces and the US has been stuck in stalemate for month after month Much of the country is in a state of utter collapse hundreds of thousands have died and refugees continue to pour into neighboring states and Europe With the election of a militaristinclined Hillary Clinton looking all but certain the Blob  White House aide Ben Rhodes apt name for the permanent DC foreign policy establishment  is quickly coalescing around a new consensus that existing US intervention should be dramatically scaled up as Eric Levitz writes  The central policy for this effort is a nofly zone to be enforced by American air power  This is a seriously risky policy that stands little chance of meaningfully ameliorating the humanitarian disaster in Syria But theres virtually nothing at this point that can be done to stop it This long background article in Spiegel Online provides a great overview of the dizzying complexity of this conflict and good context for the debate over escalation At the risk of stating the obvious the central factor in the endlessness of the war is that nobody has been able to win This in turn is the result of a rough parity of support from outside powers particularly Russia and the US Along with Iran the former regards Assad as a crucial regional ally and source of an important Russian naval base without their support the Assad regime would have collapsed years ago Americas main concern meanwhile is fighting ISIS done directly with US forces and through Kurdish proxies who have carved out a semiautonomous Kurdish zone in northern Syria connected to Iraqi Kurdistan This infuriates Turkeys  increasingly unhinged  President Erdogan due to the longstanding feud between the Turkish government and Kurdish organizations in the south of that country The Turkish military recently hit Kurdish forces outside Aleppo with airstrikes  killing dozens  right as the Iraqi military and Kurdish troops were in the middle of a longplanned effort to oust ISIS forces from Mosul  This almost cant be a coincidence and no doubt infuriated US commanders Awkwardly Assads forces are also fighting ISIS and responded to the Turkish bombardment with a threat to shoot down any more Turkish planes that violated Syrian airspace In sum this is a tremendously complicated conflict with multiple shifting factions The US goals  defeat ISIS and remove Assad without helping radical Islamists  are directly at odds with each other Lets grant for the sake of argument that the Blob is actually motivated by a desire to stop the bloodshed in Syria If they were it would pressure the Saudi government to stop their disastrous war in Yemen instead of refueling their bombers but thats a different story Here their argument that hesitation on the part of President Obama has prolonged the conflict does have a grain of truth to it If one great power or another had jumped in with overwhelming military force and steamrolled the opposition or simply withdrawn from the conflict the civil war could have ended years ago The problem of course is what comes after that Sufficient force to end the war would have meant either an invasion or occupation which was a disastrous bloody failure in Iraq or a heavy air power intervention only which was a disastrous bloody failure in Libya If theres anything the last 15 years of foreign policy history has shown it is that the American military is extremely good at smashing organized military forces and it is extremely bad at establishing any sort of lasting political order in the aftermath And more fundamentally if hesitation is really the problem then a nofly zone has the exact same problem as Obamas current policy Its an escalation that is far short of the overwhelming force that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria Why Probably because the American public shows no sign of supporting the kind of force read a massive ground invasion that would be necessary to impose peace on Syria What a nofly zone would do however is risk immediate conflict with Russia which has been assisting Assad with lots of air power Its disturbingly easy to imagine getting into a shooting war with the worlds only other nuclear superpower over this The general public apathy towards lowkey military interventions gives the American president huge latitude to bomb and deploy special forces basically anywhere in the world  which is often devastating to the targeted communities  But the moment that creates large numbers of US casualties a political backlash is certain Hillary Clinton whose 2008 presidential campaign was lost because she supported the invasion of Iraq probably realizes this however grudgingly Ultimately the Blob does not really care about carnage in Syria Its overwhelming priority is the use of military force which it views as good by definition The civil war there is just a convenient pretext Nonmilitary means to stop violence will be downplayed or ignored  just like the last several consecutive failures of military intervention were and the probable upcoming failure of the Syrian intervention will be   SYRIA Kurds Repel Erdogans Rebels Lavrov Warns Ankara Washington Shrugs Adam
