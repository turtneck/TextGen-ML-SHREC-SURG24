The death threats were starting to get to Constantin Querard They had been streaming in from Donald Trump supporters who wanted to know why Sen Ted Cruz RTex had won delegates at Arizonas convention even though Trump had won the state After the deluge finally a niceseeming message appeared on his Facebook pageQuerard the Arizona political consultant who had managed Cruzs delegate campaign clicked to read the restIm praying for you to get prostate cancerCruzs delegates were girded for two more months of this then a contested convention where they could force a second ballot and defeat Trump making all the hate mail worth itInstead hundreds of Republican activists have been elected as delegates to a convention expected to be a coronation of Trump Delegates such as Querard who outfoxed Trump supporters at state conventions were now trapped on a speeding Trump Train They were legally bound to stand up and nominate him That might be the last time they vote for himIm a lifelong Republican and I love the party said Querard But dont ask me how Ill vote in November Ive been on the receiving end of enough death wishes where its pretty soon for me to strap on the jersey with any authenticityThere are unhappy delegates at every party convention but the captive audience of Trump skeptics bound for Cleveland is unique For months supporters of Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich worked to get their supporters elected as unbound delegates or even as Trojan horse delegates bound to Trump on the first ballot but free to bolt if the contest continuedTrump turns to general election  and away from past positionsFor a few weeks it seemed to be working Kasich and Cruz both crowed about their ability to outorganize Trumps forces who in Cruzs world were not capable to run a lemonade stand As both men lost highprofile contests  Trump won all but two of them in Utah and Wisconsin after March 15  Cruz took to counting up his state convention victories as proof that voters were rejecting TrumpYet Trump turned the wins against them telling his megarallies that a crooked deal was stealing his delegates Roger Stone a Trump ally who had promised to publish the names and hotel rooms of Trojan horse delegates was happy to see them failMany will not attend leaving their seats to the alternates who in most cases are Trump supporters Stone said I am not too concerned about their feelingsThe people who had outorganized Trump were dazed by the backlash North Dakota did it how it was supposed to be done said Bette Grande a hardcharging Cruz delegate who helped him dominate that states weekend convention The media didnt like that because it was something they didnt understand so they bought into the lie of Trump that something unfair was going onGrande like almost all of the Cruz and Kasich delegates intended to head to Cleveland anyway In the days since the Indiana primary delegates have occasionally sought instructions or solace from the Cruz and Kasich campaigns There has been no instruction to stand down and no hint that the results can be overturnedIt is time for those who supported others in the Republican Party to come together and help Mr Trump be the best candidate he can be said Jim Brainard the mayor of Carmel Ind whose election as a proKasich delegate turned out to be one of that campaigns last coups Its a big tent and those of us who disagree with Trump will hopefully have an opportunity to sway his viewsSome of the Trojan horses had only reluctantly backed Cruz or Kasich Subba Kolla a Realtor from Northern Virginia had backed Sen Marco Rubio Fla in the states close primary but allied with Cruz during the state convention Cruzs forces won a smashing victory but Kolla was resigned to backing TrumpIm not sad he said I am a party loyalist I am representing my community the Indian American community and I dont want to disappoint them Most of our community supported Rubio Now theres only Trump I dont have any bad feelings about himSeveral other delegates said that they would attend to keep Trump and the GOP honest Virginia state Sen Richard H Black Loudoun a Cruz delegate said he had actually preferred Trumps America first policy to Cruzs but intended to go to Cleveland and defend the social conservative planks of the Republican platformKay Godwin a Georgia conservative who had become a Cruz delegate felt the same way It wasnt the Lords plan for Ted to win but maybe thatll be his plan next time she said The reason I became a Republican is because the platform is wonderful It stands for everything that I stand for in my heartStill there were holdouts Querard knew of one alternate who no longer wanted to spend the money to go to Cleveland Russell Donley a former speaker of the Wyoming House who had won one of Cruzs slots said the Trump victory made him inclined to stay home with his wifeIf Trumps short one vote and theres an opening for Cruz okay then I go Donley said But Im an old Wyoming boy and going to Cleveland in the summer doesnt really enthuse meThen there was Eric Brakey a young state senator from Maine who had been part of a Cruz slate that triumphed so resoundingly that Gov Paul LePage R denounced it Four years earlier Brakey had fought just as hard to become a delegate for former Texas congressman Ron Paul only to watch the Republican National Committee overturn the state convention and replace some Paul delegates with Romney delegates This year Brakey was finally given a vote at the convention  and received yet another disappointmentDonald Trump isnt who my conscience tells me to support Brakey said Then again neither was Ted Cruz I voted for Sen Rand Paul Ky at the caucuses and when I ran for delegate I said I would reflect the will of the voters Now Im sort of jokingly telling people that Ill cast my vote for Ron Paul  four years late
