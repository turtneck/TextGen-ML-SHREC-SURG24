While Bernie Sanders has been mathematically eliminated the ability to appeal to Millennial attitudes is only going to grow more crucial in future elections political scientists sayDemocratic presidential candidate Sen Bernie Sanders is hugged by a supporter after addressing the crowd following the closing of the polls in the California presidential primary in Santa Monica Calif June 7Garner Jarrett never used to care much about politicsThe massage therapist and actor who is in his late 20s had been an indifferent voter at best and never before voted in a presidential primaryBut the promise of change that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders brought to the national stage  and the access to information about him that the Internet made possible  moved Mr Jarrett enough to not only cast his vote at his neighborhood polling station in Koreatown on Tuesday It also propelled him to reevaluate his view of the American political process he saysThis election changed the way I participate on a deeper scale he says I started seeing stuff about a candidate I cared about It inspired the hope that things could get betterJarretts remarks articulate in part the attitudes that are coming to define Millennial voter concerns and behavior Those attitudes first emerged in the 2008 presidential election a tendency to lean toward liberal values a drive to champion social justice issues and call for change in established processes and a reliance on the Internet and social media for information communication and political mobilizationAs the generation comes into its own  already Millennials match baby boomers in their share of the US electorate  those perspectives will more heavily inform the issues and processes that determine future elections political analysts and generational experts sayWhat has grown more pronounced since 2008 and 2012  and which Senator Sanderss campaign underscored  is a push away from even the perception of being part of the establishment whether its Washington or Wall Street Such a drive if sustained could have lasting influence on the way Millennial voters engage in elections and the kinds of issues toward which they steer conversation says Jan Leighley a professor who specializes in political behavior at American University in WashingtonThe likely consequences of Millennial support of a Bernie candidacy is that a you may have mobilized a generation more than they would have otherwise and b you may just have pulled Hillary to the left she saysTuesday Hillary Clinton made history as the first woman to top a major party ticket by securing the number of delegates she needed to clinch the Democratic nomination  even before the last six states went to the polls according to the Associated Press Three of the states  New Jersey New Mexico South Dakota  have been called for her while she holds a commanding lead in the nights biggest delegate prize CaliforniaTonight caps an amazing journey  a long long journey Mrs Clinton said in her victory speech Thanks to you weve reached a milestone The first time in our nations history that a woman will be a major partys nomineeSanders who won in Montana and North Dakota refused to bow out vowing to fight on until Washington DC goes to the polls June 14 While he has been mathematically eliminated his success in galvanizing young people like Jarrett speaks to the value of a politicians ability to verbalize Millennial concerns in a passionate waySanders struck a chord that this generation is receptive to says Michael Hais a veteran market researcher and coauthor of three books on Millennials More and more he notes leaders will have to speak in a language and communicate using methods that this generation understands  as the senator has doneTheyve had these basic attitudes  and thats going to persist Mr Hais adds They are going to shape the policy of the futureDespite their numbers only 46 percent of Millennials 18to34 year olds are likely to vote They make up just 17 percent of likely voters in CaliforniaThats not unusual as voters tend to participate more in elections as they grow older Baby boomers today have higher rates of voter turnout than Millennials but boomers came out to vote at about the same rate as Millennials when they were the same age according to data from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement a nonpartisan research institute at Tufts University in BostonThe reality is youth are very small percentage of the vote says Professor Leighley Thats true even in presidential election years  and even under the most generous assumptionsStill Millennials did show up at polling stations across Los Angeles on primary day  making it more likely that they will vote againThe biggest predictor of participating in a future election is if you participate in a previous one says Jeff Gulati a political science professor at Bentley University in Waltham MassAnd those Millennials who spoke with the Monitor echoed Jarrett the Koreatown resident when it came to their hopes for and expectations of a leader  and the reasons they came out to voteThis election makes me want to be more aware says Serenity Self 26 as she walks out of Bellevue Recreation Center which served as a polling station in LAs Silver Lake neighborhood Bernie bringing up delegates and superdelegates made me question thewhole electoral process I think finally people are seeing the lightThis is the most active Ive ever been in a campaign says David Hemphill 33 a childrens book publisher who spent primary day canvassing for Sanders in Boyle Heights in East Los Angeles He gave a voice to things that I have felt for a long time and havent really heard someone speak toIm looking at our power structure in this country through a different lens than I was a year ago he addsElementary school teacher Angelo Gonzales 28 says he wavered between Mrs Clinton and Sanders but ultimately chose the latter because of his bold visionI guess I wanted to make a statement he says Ten years ago I wouldve scoffed at Bernie Sanders I would have said he wanted too much change But change is good Its a powerful thing We want someone to step upSome political analysts are wary of making definitive statements about the longterm impact of this election  and of Sanderss campaign  on Millennial attitudes and vice versa Though the senator did manage to energize a large swath of the demographic Professor Gulati says not all Millennials are Sanders supporters or Democrats for that matterTheyre also young and therefore still developing their views and political stances says Professor Leighley at American UniversityYoure talking about individuals who dont have firmlyheld attitudes and dont have much experience she says The issues that theyre raising are issues that every other age group are raising  economic security jobs some aspect of maybe the role of government in allowing or helping individuals to get ahead Thats not much different from what elections usually are aboutAnother enduring effect of this election analysts say is the role of the Internet and social media  not just in terms of how candidates are reaching potential voters as they did for Obama during his campaigns but also how voters are informing themselves about the candidates and their issuesThey are says Hais the generation expert the best way of appealing to Millennials more than anythingTheres so much information out there video editor Andrea Otto 27 says You can look into the money of campaigns you can be better informed You dont have to take what mainstream media outlets are telling youI think this election is unique in that social media is coming to be huge adds Jarrett from Koreatown You can take a person nobody knows about and through social media hes able to become an important candidateMr Hemphill the childrens book publisher goes a step furtherWere the most educated connected generation in the history of the world he says We have the Internet at our fingertips We can look at things that any leader said five years ago 10 years ago We can track someone that easilyPeople really discount what the Internet voice is I think its very short sighted he adds I think that people are now awake and alive and I can only hope that it continues We cant go back
