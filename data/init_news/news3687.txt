People no longer switch allegiances between parties from election to election adding to the rise of moreextreme candidates and changing the nature of campaignsHeres a prediction about the 2016 presidential election thats almost certain to come true Generally speaking swing voters wont Swing that is Float Change their preference Vote for the Republican if they voted for President Obama in 2012 Vote for the Democrat if they pulled the lever for Mitt Romney last time outThats because the United States is becoming a country where no one changes his or her mind about presidential politics Voters are increasingly divided into reliably partisan camps Those swing voters pundits love to talk about Theyre mythical creatures unicorns nothing but a flash of white in the forest at dusk New research shows theyre now about 5 percent of the US electorate  the lowest percentage ever recordedWhy such a static situation Its not because most Americans are in love with their choices Fear and anger are likely causes of much of this sorting Many voters arent so much trying to elect their candidates as block the ones from the other party whom they see as a danger to the republic Negative partisanship has become one of the strongest forces in this particle physics theory of US politicsAnd that may be just fine with the two big parties that govern the nation Theres evidence that they devote more attention to rallying committed supporters than reaching out to the uncommitted in presidential campaigns Theyve been moving in that direction since 2000 when the virtual dead heat between George W Bush and Al Gore showed them  and the rest of the nation  how closely balanced Republicans and Democrats areCampaigns are changing their strategies to focus on the people who are at the ideological extremes rather than centrist voters says Costas Panagopoulos a political scientist at Fordham University in New York whos researching the subject My sense is thats operating in primaries as well as general electionsIndeed the decline of swing voting may help explain the partisan dynamics of this unusual presidential primary season in which the ideological separation between the parties seems particularly wideConsider the GOP Since the days of Richard Nixon the maxim of the partys establishment has been that candidates need to run right in the primary then pivot back toward the center in the general election But on immigration many of the Republican hopefuls have moved so far to the right  No amnesty Ship immigrants here illegally home  that they might have a difficult time reversing course if they win the nominationTheres been similar rightward movement by some GOP candidates on abortion and other provocative issuesMeanwhile Democrats are doing much the same thing only pointing in the opposite direction Theyre talking about everything from free college tuition to paid family leave and higher taxes on the rich Its hard to imagine frontrunner Hillary Clinton repeating her husband Bills 1996 pronouncement that the era of big government is overThere are a number of reasons for the development of this partisan chasm They include the angry mood of the electorate and the rise of particular outsider candidates yes we mean Donald TrumpBut a major cause may be that a candidate who tacks to the center will find it a much less populated place Compared with election cycles past there arent as many unaffiliated voters sitting around wondering whom to vote for The polarization of US politics so evident in Washington has filtered down to the grassroots level This means parties are freer to adopt the policy choices of their most committed members because swing voters have become less importantParty elites can ignore the moderating specter of floating voters because polarization has changed many of them into loyal supporters writes Corwin D Smidt a Michigan State University assistant professor of political science in his recently published journal article  Polarization and the Decline of the American Floating VoterLets stop a moment to make an important point Swing or floating voters are not the same thing as people who declare themselves political independentsSelfdescribed independents are the largest category of voters in the US A record 43 percent of Americans now say they are neither Republicans nor Democrats but members of the unaffiliated group of I according to Gallup figuresHowever if pressed about half of these independents will say they lean toward one party or another Another large chunk consists of lowinformation voters who dont usually bother to go to the pollsAnd many of those who remain have voted like partisans in recent years whatever their personal beliefs and political motivationThats the upshot of Professor Smidts groundbreaking study published in October in the American Journal of Political Science Drawing on data from the American National Election Studies ANES  a series of academic voter surveys dating back to 1948  he shows that recent presidential elections exhibit the lowest levels of floating voting ever recordedSwing voting  defined as casting a presidential ballot for a different party than one voted for the previous election  used to be relatively common Between 1956 and 1980 the average rate of vote switching among the entire US electorate was 12 percent  easily a big enough bloc of voters to determine the outcome of an electionSince then that figure has dropped precipitously In 2008 only 81 percent of voters reported voting for a different party than in 2004 In 2012 it hit an alltime low with only 52 percent of Americans voting for a different majorparty nominee according to SmidtMeanwhile the percentage of standpatters  people who vote for the same party over a series of consecutive elections  has risen correspondingly and is now approaching 60 percent of Americans of voting age Nonvoters and periodic voters account for the restThe result There may be less and less reason for presidential campaigns to trim their rough edges and appeal to swing voters in the middle Over time this could lead to morepartisan candidates  and presidents  who in turn push voters more to the ideological edgesMore Americans today may not identify with a party but their behavior indicates we have never observed as many loyal supporters writes SmidtTo see how this looks in real life consider the opinions of Tyrone Quinn an investment businessman from Chicago interviewed while on a flight to Boston Mr Quinn says he prefers to identify himself as an independent because voters should strive to choose whichever candidate they think is the best personThe hard left and the hard right both of em kind of make me sick he says Career politicians make me sick too Give me a good smart wise and decent personQuinn says that on the local level hes voted for candidates of both parties For instance hes backed Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White a Democrat because he feels Mr White is a good guyBut Quinn has exclusively voted for Republicans in national elections He believes that on the Washington level the Democratic Party is in favor of uncontrolled regulation Democrats have a total lack of regard for spending other peoples hardearned money he saysWhy have floating voters stopped floating around Quinns answers hint at one major possible reason In todays polarized political world almost everybody has a clear idea of what he or she thinks US political parties believeSometimes these views tilt the electorate in favor of one party Sometimes they tilt it in favor of the other But there is little confusion or indecision about the Democrats or Republicans identitiesAs recently as the early 1980s the parties were still somewhat mixed up ideologically speaking The Democrats had a significant conservative Southern wing The Republicans had liberals primarily in the NortheastBut thats winnowed out now Liberals and conservatives have separated into completely different camps The differences between the parties have become so marked and clear that even Americans who seldom follow politics can tell them apart So they pick a side and stick with itPeople are more confident in their opinions when they see polarized parties says Smidt in an interview They think Well if the choices are so stark its just not a gray area at all And stark in this context might mean worrisome Because theres also evidence that voters are sticking with one party not because theyre excited about it but because they dislike even fear the other sideThats what research by Emory University political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster indicates in any case They set out to directly study why partisan voting is going up at a time when fewer voters than ever label themselves Democrats or RepublicansTheir conclusion The trend is driven by what they call negative partisanship In other words fear and antipathy Voters arent so much trying to elect someone as block somebody else from winningTheir data showed that the more US voters disliked the other party the greater the probability they would stick with their own partys choiceAlong with increasing awareness of party differences increasing negativism toward the opposing party has contributed significantly to the rise of party loyalty and straight ticket voting in recent years they writeA simple thermometer scale of attitudes toward the big US parties shows the nature of this trend Since 1980 according to ANES data Americans feelings toward their own party have cooled slightly dipping from an average of 72 degrees to 70 degrees in 2012 Their feelings about the other party Theyve frozen dropping from 45 degrees in 1980 to 30 degrees in 2012Whats behind this disparity Mr Abramowitz and Mr Webster theorize are increasing racial and religious differences between Democrats and Republicans that make it easier for voters to see their opponents as threatening as othersNonwhites now account for 45 percent of Democratic voters on the national level but only 11 percent of Republicans Meanwhile the percentage of white voters who are religiously observant attend services at least once a week and lean GOP has increased significantly from 48 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in 2012The religious divide in particular has helped create a wide gap in party attitudes on volatile cultural issues such as abortion and gay marriageThe growing cultural divide among white voters and the growing racial divide among all voters have both contributed to a widening ideological divide between Democratic and Republican voters write Abramowitz and WebsterThis divide echoes in the words of Tara Schiraldi a young liberal Democrat in her last year of law school at Georgetown University interviewed in Philadelphia on a jobhunting tripShes interested in working with a nonprofit that advocates for juveniles Shes worked for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center Shes concerned about what she sees as a schooltoprison pipeline in America for disadvantaged youthBut the issue she keeps coming back to is women She says she draws a line on womens issues such as access to birth control sex education  and most notably abortionThe way in which the Republican Party deals with women  makes it difficult for me to feel respected by the Republican Party she saysThe republican and democratic hierarchies are well aware of the increasing scarcity of swing voting For them trying to win over voters who arent already committed supporters is becoming an increasingly difficult and inefficient activity like fishing the Gulf of Maine for dwindling stocks of Atlantic codSo presidential campaigns more and more may be throwing their nets where theyre likely to catch larger numbers of votes Theres some evidence theyve shifted in recent years to devoting more effort to the mobilization of their party base as opposed to the pursuit of undecided independent or swing votersMr Panagopoulos who is currently a fellow at Yale Universitys Center for the Study of American Politics has examined the rates at which presidential campaigns contact various voter categories Hes found that in recent elections that rate has risen much more sharply for committed partisans than it has for independents or adherents of the other partyIn other words the parties are devoting increased resources to emailing calling and ringing the doorbells of their own strong supporters instead of reaching out and trying to sway swing voters or loosely committed opponentsThe evidence seems to suggest that the attention strong partisans receive is greater than the attention swing voters get says PanagopoulosThe election of 2000 was the breaking point Thats when the line of this trend really started to nose upward This timing is no surprise given that Bush vs Gore was a virtual dead heat highlighting the need for campaigns to scramble for any possible edge Plus thats when microtargeting technology and ecampaign techniques began to mature and spread through US politics making it easier for campaigns to carry out finely tuned outreach programsCampaigns still try and woo new voters of course Its just that they now appear convinced that theres more bang for the donor buck in rousting old friends and making sure they voteCampaigns have limited resources They have to figure out how to allocate them as efficiently as possible Panagopoulos saysIts possible that this mobilization trend has produced a selfreinforcing cycle If strong partisans are pushed harder by the parties they may vote at higher rates electing morepartisan candidates who push the parties further to the left or right creating more strong partisan supporters Rinse repeatThe potential is that the increased focus on strong partisans has transformed the voting electorate in a more polarized way and can be linked to growing polarization in government says the Fordham professorThis imbalance in voter outreach efforts may not be a good thing for America But political campaigns are in the business of winning not building up the pillars of democracy Counteracting the cycle of polarization may require efforts by the US government or nonpartisan organizations to increase voter turnout for everyone not just those at the ideological polesThats really where the impetus is going to come from says PanagopoulosHe adds There are all kinds of reforms that have been proposed These include everything from Sunday voting to easier methods of voter registrationIn the end its important to remember that this state of affairs is not foreordained American politics is not locked in a neverending cycle in which both parties inevitably drift away from the uncommitted center The behavior of swing voting has dwindled The potential for swing voting has notThe problem now is that both parties think the existing state of polarization benefits them At some point one or the other will likely wake up and realize thats not true In the past systematic losses have had this effectConsider the Democratic Party of the early 1990s After three consecutive White House defeats many Democrats decided a swivel back to morecentrist policies might be in order That led to President Clinton a former southern state governor backed by the middleoftheroad Democratic Leadership CouncilParties are the problem and parties are the way out People want to win says Smidt of Michigan StateAnd possible swing voters do still exist even as an endangered species Take Dave Bradford a Connecticut salesman tapping away on his laptop at the 30th Street train station in Philadelphia Mr Bradford voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 because he thought the president had done well in his first term Since then hes voted for Democratic presidential candidatesI probably lean more towards the Democrats but as I get older Im more in tune with some of the Republican philosophies and stands Bradford saysHe thinks some of Rand Pauls ideas are worth listening to and exploring particularly those that deal with taxation and taking government off our back Hed like to see former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg run not so much because of Mr Bloombergs political philosophy but because of the competence Bloomberg showed as mayor and because he like Bradford himself is a businessmanI try to vote for the person Bradford saysContributor Mary Beth McCauley in Philadelphia and staff writer Noelle Swan in Minneapolis contributed to this report
