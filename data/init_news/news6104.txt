WASHINGTON When it comes to getting around Congress President Obama may not be able to move mountains but he can rename themTheObama administrations decision to rename North Americas tallest peak to its original native name of Denali is drawing protests from Republicanlawmakers in OhioThats because themountains previous namesake President William McKinley was also a Republican from OhioThis decision by the administration is yet another example of the President going around Congress SenRob Portman ROhio said noting that Congress had been debating the name for yearsRep Bob Gibbs ROhio went even further callingit another example of Obamas constitutional overreachPresident Obama has decided to ignore an act of Congress in unilaterally renaming Mount McKinley in order to promote his jobkilling war on energy Gibbs said in a tweetedstatementSunday This political stunt is insulting to all OhioansObama timed the announcement to coincide with a threeday trip to Alaska to highlight the problem of climate change in the Arctic But the dispute over the name goes back decadesThe 20237foot mountain was originally known as Denali which means the great one in the Athabascanlanguage of the original Alaskans But that began to change when EuropeanAmerican prospectors and explorers arrived A Seattle manWilliam Dickeyrediscovered the mountain in 1896 while prospecting for goldWe named our great peak Mount McKinley after William McKinley of Ohio who had been nominated for the presidencyand that fact was the first news we received on our way out of that wonderful wilderness he wrote in a dispatch to the New York SunMcKinley was not yet president then and the naming may have been a political stunt in itself McKinley in running against the populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan favored the gold standard to back US dollarsThat name was formalized in 1917 when President Woodrow Wilson signed theMount McKinley National Park Act whichrequired the park to be dedicated and set apart as a public park for the benefit and enjoyment of the people under the name of the Mount McKinley National ParkBut another law passed in 1947 gives the Secretary of the Interior and the Board on Geographic Names the power to provide for uniformity in geographic nomenclature and orthography throughout the federal governmentThe Alaska government first petitioned the Interior Department to change the name to Denali in 1975 But because the Board on Geographic Namesdeferredto Congress if a name was under consideration by lawmakers the Ohio delegation was able to prevent a name change for four decades simply by introducing bills to keep the McKinley name even if those bills never passedFriday Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said that impasse had gone on long enoughInher order issued Fridayshe noted that McKinley never stepped foot in AlaskaStill House Speaker John Boehner who hails from the opposite corner of Ohio said he was disappointed in the decisionThere is a reason President McKinleys name has served atop the highest peak in North America for more than 100 years and that is because it is a testament to his great legacy Boehner said in a statementHe recitedMcKinleys record which included service in the Union Army in the Civil War elections to theHouse of Representatives and to the Ohio governorship And he led this nation to prosperity and victory in the SpanishAmerican War as the 25th President of the United States Boehner saidIts unclear what the Ohioans can do about the decision Gibbs said he would would work to overturn the decision legislatively Portman said he would ask the National Park Service to find a way to preserve McKinleys legacy somewhere else in the national park that once bore his nameThe issue is not strictly a partisan one Ohio Democrats too have introduced bills over the years to retain the McKinley nameAnd Sen Lisa Murkowski RAlaska while critical of Obama on energy policypraised the decision to rename the mountainFor centuries Alaskans have known this majestic mountain as the great one she said in a statement SundayId like to thank the President for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor respect and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska
