Super Tuesday Brings Harsh Light And Heartaches On The Morning AfterThe results of the biggest voting day in the presidential contest thus far may not have been everything that frontrunners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton had hoped but they were enough to set the course for the remainder of the nominating seasonAnd they were surely enough to intensify the pressure on their respective rivalsFor believers in Bernie Sanders promise of a political revolution Super Tuesday may have seemed like the end of a dreamAnd for Republican officeholders and party officials anxious about having Donald Trump as their presidential nominee Super Tuesday must have been a nightmareSanders went down in seven of the 11 states holding Democratic events winning in only four where the Democratic vote was relatively small These included his home state of Vermont where he won with 86 percent amid turnout lower than it had been in 2008Worse yet for Sanders crusade Clinton dominated in the competition for pledged delegates to the nominating convention Because her victory margins were so large in several populous Southern states including 21 in Texas her share of the delegates far exceeded her rivals She also won in Georgia Tennessee Virginia Alabama Arkansas and MassachusettsHaving begun the night with a modest lead in pledged delegates Clinton wound up with 544 to Sanders 349 And when you include the socalled superdelegates who go to the convention by virtue of their elected or party office Clintons lead expands to 1001371 As bigstate contests loom in Michigan Ohio and Florida over the next two weeks Clinton needs only to break even in delegate allocations to maintain her formidable advantageSmall wonder then that Clinton once again spoke generously of Sanders in her victory speech turning her guns instead on a likely upcoming foeI congratulate Sen Sanders on his strong showing and campaigning she said before offering this implicit salute to Sanders populism Because this country belongs to all of us not just those at the topSoon enough she was pivoting to her preferred targets across the aisleThe stakes in this election have never been higher said Clinton and the rhetoric were hearing on the other side has never been lower Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong and were not going to let it workSanders had spoken early in the evening right after Vermont was called in his columnThis campaign is not just about electing a president he said its about transforming America We are not going to allow billionaires and the superPACs to destroy American democracyBy the time the evening was over Sanders had added wins in Oklahoma Colorado and Minnesota But the contests in Colorado and Minnesota were caucuses with relatively few participants Taken together his vote total in the four states he won was about 430000 Clinton won 530000 in Georgia alone and larger totals still in Massachusetts and TexasLosing in Massachusetts had to be the hardest blow for the Sanders forces to bear The state borders Vermont but Sanders was not able to replicate his smashing win in neighboring New Hampshire from Feb 9 He did win the counties nearest his own state and most of the counties outside the Boston metropolitan area But it wasnt enough Clinton edged him by fewer than 2 percentage points taking 45 delegates to Sanders 43But if there was disappointment in the Sanders camp last night there was panic in the ranks of establishment Republicans at the thought of Trump as their party championAfter his string of victories on Super Tuesday his chances of capturing winnertakeall states down the road are all the greater making his nomination in July no worse than an even betIn fact given his growing lead in delegates Trumps main obstacle now may be not another candidate but the prospect of an open convention where neither he nor anyone else has the votes for a firstballot victoryAfter Trump scored big February wins in New Hampshire South Carolina and Nevada party officers and congressional leaders began taking him on in public and in private House Speaker Paul Ryan called him out for his apparent reluctance to denounce former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke There was talk in the media of Republican candidates detaching themselves from the partys nominee in the fallYet on Super Tuesday there seemed little sign of this same unease within the Republican primary electorate Trump won seven of the states holding primaries including Georgia Tennessee Virginia Alabama and Arkansas in the South At the same time unlike other Republicans who in the past have run the table in Dixie Trump wrapped up two more states in New England Massachusetts and VermontNoting that Republican turnout had been up again across the board while Democratic turnout fell shy of 2008 Trump added thisI think were going to be more inclusive  more unified and I think were going to be a much bigger party The GOP has become more dynamic Its become more diverse Were taking from the DemocratsTrump did yield the biggest prize of the day to rival Sen Ted Cruz who won his home state of Texas along with the adjoining state of OklahomaThank God for the Lone Star State crooned Cruz as he thanked his supporters in Stafford Texas Cruz made much of having beaten Trump in three states claiming this made him the best alternative to the New York business mogul Hours later Cruz increased his total to four states after the Alaska caucuses went his way Cruz also said the other candidates  who would be Florida Sen Marco Rubio Ohio Gov John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson  should prayerfully consider abandoning their own campaigns to unite behind himIt was immediately apparent that none intended to do so Rubio who had hoped to establish himself as the last bright hope of the antiTrump forces settled for a firstplace finish in Minnesotas caucuses his first win of the year and two secondplace showings in Georgia and VirginiaRubio had high hopes for both of those states The former borders his home state of Florida and the latter had high concentrations of suburban Republicans to whom he had directly appealed Rubio did come within a few percentage points of Trump in Virginia but still fell short He had a strong finish in Minnesota but the caucus was lightly attended and his vote total was barely over 41000But with his flair for seeing the bright side Rubio noted that Trumps vote totals on Super Tuesday had not matched Trumps poll numbers in state after state Rubio saw that as a sign of his own success in challenging the frontrunner Rubio had begun bearding Trump in the Feb 25 debate and traded insults with him throughout the weekend repeatedly calling him a con artist among other thingsKasich for his part came within a whisker of eclipsing Trump in Vermont and added another more distant secondplace finish in Massachusetts He made it clear he would be in the race at least through Michigan March 8 and Ohio his home state a week later Kasich has been widely regarded as campaigning for a vicepresidential offer at this point although he continues to suggest he could be the unity candidate against TrumpCarson once again indicated he was not going anywhere blaming his singledigit shares of the vote to the system he was fighting calling it a complex webIn the end of course all this persistence on the part of his rivals may make it easier for Trump to divide and conquer The more rivals remain the more the antiTrump vote is diluted making it easier for him to prevail with a plurality of the vote state by state all the way to the convention
