recognition campaign infrastructure or media spotlight Sen Bernie Sanders has already posed a significant challenge to Hillary Clintons campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination Just imagine what Tuesdays nationally televised debate hosted by CNN could doThe underdog Sanders leads Clinton in the early primary state of New Hampshire and is within striking distance in Iowa although he continues to trail the former secretary of state by double digits among Democrats nationallyArguably Sanders popularity among Democratic voters is fueled as much by who Sanders isnt as who he is His populist positions and regularguy disposition stand out in contrast with the chronically calculating and centrist ClintonAnd this debate is his to lose Just by showing up on the same stage as the presumptive frontrunner and showing a wider audience that he can substantively and stylistically challenge Clinton Sanders gainsBut what about Clinton She wants to avoid a protracted fight for the Democratic nomination not to mention the sort of upset she suffered at the hands of Barack Obama in 2008 So its in her best interest to brush aside Sanders as soon as possible The first Democratic primary debate is her earliest and best opportunity to do so HowLook for Clinton to employ three strategiesFirst shell likely try to lump her positions in with those of Sanders and the other Democratic contenders and say that all of the Democratic candidates mainly share the same vision and the partys best interest is served by picking the one with the best shot at being electedElectability is Clintons strongest argument especially as more and more Democrats become legitimately freaked out by the cast of characters vying for the Republican nomination Its in Clintons interest to deemphasize the ideological differences on the Democratic side and imply more agreement than not  which is for the most part trueSanders will try to poke holes in that script especially with respect to Clintons economic agenda which has been rhetorically populist but conventionally centrist in policy termsSanders and many populist Democrats have opposed the agreement as a giveaway to big business that will hurt American workers While Clinton tacitly backed the deal while secretary of state shes now free to express her own opinion separate from the stance of the Obama administrationWill she ally herself with populist opposition to the trade deal And even if she does will people believe her stance is anything more than crass opportunism to win voters fleeing her for SandersClintons second strategy will likely be try to highlight ways in which she is more progressive than her Democratic opponents especially Sanders The recent mass shooting in Oregon just days before the debate yet again brings to the surface the concerns of Democratic voters  and voters in general  who are fed up with Congress failure to pass commonsense gun laws despite overwhelming need and widespread public supportHere Clinton can draw a clear contrast with Sanders who has opposed some gun control measures and is out of step with the majority of Democratic primary voters on this issue While she may have difficulty demonstrating her sincerity on economic populism here the contrast with the senator from Vermont is strong  his weak record on guns is a hard position to defend especially nowSimilarly Clinton can try to distinguish herself as more progressive in addressing racial bias and structural racism Despite Sanders selfprofessed position as the most progressive candidate in speaking about racial justice police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement he has been woefully inadequate at bestClinton hasnt been much better with her discussions on race often tainted by an unsettling defensiveness But shes still clearly more comfortable talking about race than Sanders and has given more thought to how racial injustice poisons Americas institutions and culture Talking about this more in the debate will be good for America  and good for her candidacyThird look for Clinton to try to connect authentically with viewers at home and show her human side Many voters may get lost in the substantive back and forth over what Clinton supports versus what Sanders supports and their various policybased accusations against each other But elections are also about gut instincts over which candidate shares your values and vision And those gut instincts are especially triggered when voters see the candidates side by sideFor her part Clinton can say all the right things but if she spouts populist rhetoric while sounding like an outoftouch patrician it wont work Thats not to say Clinton should emphasize showing more of her heart and humor as campaign aides have promised in a retooling Rather she should just be her damn self and show that to the voters We dont want a particular personality so much as we want a real person Hopefully if nothing else Trump has taught candidates thatThe first Democratic debate will be pivotal since voters will form first and perhaps lasting impressions of how the candidates match up It is Sanders debate to lose But if she plays it right it could also be Clintons debate to win
