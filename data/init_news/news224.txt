The Bentley administration the Alabama legislature and the governors Alabama Health Insurance Exchange Study Commission weighed many of the same issues their counterparts in other states did How would they finance the exchanges operations Should a state agency or some other entity manage a new marketplace How heavily should insurance companies be regulated Would it better for Alabama to exert at least a little control over Obamacare or to just let the US Department of Health and Human Services do the workIf that was the case four years ago no one told Alabama state Sen Jim McClendon R a native English speaker who cochaired Bentleys commission while a member of the state House of Representatives which unanimously passed a bill in April 2012 to establish an Alabama health insurance exchange  No No No That was never never brought up McClendon said in an interview with The Huffington Post last month I was unaware of that stipulation in the Affordable Care Act and I would almost have to guess that anybody involved in this process was not aware of it I was a little surprised when it came up eventually Nope I was the chairman of the commission and I was totally unaware of thatNever It was never discussed said Carey who also worked with Delaware and Tennessee on their exchanges at the time when he was a subcontractor working for LMI a Tysons Virginiabased government contractor It was never a consideration that they werent going to get subsidies if they deferred to the feds I mean I was there at every commission meeting and I was presenting Here are your options heres what I think it might cost you and we did those type of calculationsI dont remember that coming up I really dont I really dont ever remember that ever being brought up as an issue I dont ever remember anybody saying Well if we do this and let the feds do it this is the tradeoff down the road Im almost positive somebody wouldve brought it up During the time we didnt know that After the commission thats when all that stuff started coming out We were like Oh wait a minute That couldve really changed obviously the advice to the governor because I dont think he wouldve even said were not going to do it if it was clear at that point in time all the way back four five years ago that if you dont do this heres the side effect Because thats a huge tradeoffWren was the author of the health insurance exchange bill the state House passed in April 2012 and he championed a staterun marketplace until Bentleys final decision in December of that year to forgo a state exchange Wren told HuffPost he still believes Alabama should have its own exchange  Wren claimed in an interview that he was aware early on of a provision in the law that would restrict subsidies to those who purchased coverage on state exchanges But in a subsequent email his account shifted Wren first said that issue came to his attention in 2009 before Obamacare had even passed In a subsequent email he wrote that he had misspoken during the interview and said hed actually learned of this phrase in 2011  I believed at the time that for many reasons including the possible favorable premium treatment to individuals purchasing from a state exchange that Alabama should consider this over a federal he wrote Greg Wren then a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in 2011  There is little evidence to back Wrens claim that he was aware of the nowcontroversial provision in Obamacare during his states debate over whether to establish an exchange The former legislator could not offer an explanation for why his version of events differs from those of McClendon and the others interviewed for this article or why it isnt reflected in official documents or media accounts from the time  At this point I can only say is sic I remembered back as best I could he wrote in an emailWren also acknowledged that he has no documentation from 2010 through 2012 to support his assertions that he understood the phrase established by the state could mean that subsidies wouldnt be available in federal exchanges The Alabama legislature does not transcribe floor or committee proceedings so no official record exists of the debate on Wrens bill  Wren was often quoted in the local and national press speaking about the advantages of staterun health insurance exchanges in 2011 and 2012 but HuffPost couldnt find any articles that cited him saying the subsidies wouldnt be available in federal exchanges
