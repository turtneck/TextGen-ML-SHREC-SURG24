 FBI Wants you to Believe It Examined 650000 Emails in 691000 Seconds In no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention the FBIs clearing Hillary Clinton of wrong Print Email httphumansarefreecom201611fbiwantsyoutobelieveitexaminedhtml In no surprise to anyone paying even marginal attention the FBIs clearing Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing in its briefly reopened investigation  however the time the agency took to reach this conclusion is not only bereft of logic and reason it constitutes the most hubristic of insults to the publics intelligence In just 691000 seconds from announcement to conclusion FBI Director James Comey wants you to believe agents thoroughly examined over 650000 emails newly discovered on Anthony Weiners computer  including any threads resulting as well as all attachments  before deciding Clinton innocent of wrongdoingWe the people of this planet are just not that stupid  nor are we even mildly amused by this farcical bullshit passed off as a credible investigationSeriouslyIndeed the lightning pace of this putative second investigation not only boggles the mind it forces uneasy questions concerning the true motivation and apparent exceeding necessity to ensure Hillary Clinton walks away scotfree amid rapidly mushrooming evidence of flagrant corruption and mendacious collusionJust a cursory comparison of two investigations shows such marked differences it would be impossible not to question legitimacy of the FBIs findingsIn the summer of 2015 the FBI commenced its first probe into the former secretary of states use of a private email server during her tenure in office after John Giacalone  then Director of the National Security Branch  met with Comey to voice concerns emanating from the Intelligence community about classified information possibly handled carelesslyFor nearly a full year  365 days or 31536000 seconds  a sizable task force of FBI agents pored over an enormous cache  first comprised of 30000 emails but later totaling 44900 after additional documents not originally handed over by the Clinton camp to the State Department were discovered This means  rounding off the rough estimate of one year  the bureau combed an average of just over 123 documents every day While that might seem to be manageable with a slew of investigators on the job a basic comparison of the two probes proves the literal inanity of the reopened investigationLater in the day on October 28 Comey announced the commencement of the secondary probe  albeit to the consternation of current and former officials who felt his telling Congress broke a number of investigatory guidelines including possibly influencing the outcome of the presidential raceAccording to Comey an additional 650000 documents located on the computer of Clinton aide Huma Abedins nowdisgraced and estranged husband Anthony Weiner deserved careful scrutiny for pertinence and relevance to the original investigation of the Democratic nomineePublic and official speculation predicted a months or yearslong investigation even with substantial manpower dedicated to the taskBut on Sunday November 6 in yet another shocker of an announcement from the FBI director Comey inexplicably declared nothing of relevance to the Clinton investigation  no new conclusions  had been revealed in its secondary probe This means  again rounding for brevity to eight days the total length of the investigation  FBI agents inspected some 81250 documents each day Granted both estimates have been averaged and roughened but only for comparisons sake  and that contrast doesnt survive the scantiest litmus test of believabilityNot at allBefore the naysayers jump in with a theres no comparison deflection consider the following pointsAlthough an algorithm or program combing those documents might indeed retrieve subjects of interest to investigators  keywords germane subjects accordant peoples names and the like  in no way would such technological gatekeepers reveal subtle nuance as has been displayed in emails published by Wikileaks from Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta  and the Democratic National CommitteeSuch fine gradations of meaning naturally found in the English language but also purposefully employed to throw off investigators and interlopers could not possibly be revealed by artificial means  at least not that quickly and particularly not with currentlyavailable technologiesStill not convincedConsider that if such technology did indeed exist to that discerning level of scrutiny in our heightened and overarching surveillance and police states no criminal would ever roam freeLaw enforcement departments and the National Security Agency together have amassed astonishingly voluminous data sets on every person in this country including through emails and online activities A technology advanced enough to comb for subtleties in language would hone in on criminal behavior and activity with incredible frequencyAnd while NSA programs have been revealed to hunt for keywords there are limits to its effectiveness  no terrorist plot has yet been halted in progress because the intelligence to discover it hasnt yet solidified to that pointTechnology experts immediately weighed in claiming such technology does indeed exist is frequently employed and can do the job perfectly in a mere eight days  no worriesBut as Wikileaks rebutted in a number of tweets it isnt quite so simpleEmails between Clinton her campaign staff the DNC and other insiders have proven to be a literal trove of revealing details  including Hillarys use of the name of aide Huma Abedin as a deflection and President Obamas use of a pseudonym to communicate on the private server in an attempt to thwart future investigatorsPrograms and algorithms would have to be fed such information but not all of those pseudonyms were known  and that represents only one such complication Even working around the clock as Comey alleged the FBI did in its second probe 82000 documents daily isnt even worth comparing to the 123 averaged each day in the initial investigation So what are we to believe about the clearing of Hillary Clinton for a second timeThats up to you  to each of us  to draw a conclusionBut to characterize that second investigation as anything other than a charade to placate an irate public would be criminal willful denial of conspicuous evidence  criminal willful denial that the utter bullshit the FBI just brazenly served the American people doesnt somehow stink By Claire
