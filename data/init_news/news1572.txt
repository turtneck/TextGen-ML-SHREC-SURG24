On Super Tuesday Donald Trump continued his surprise series of wins gaining seven out of the 11 states in play that day In response many are asking Why have establishment candidates had such a hard time in this years Republican nomination contestSome suggest that Republicans who bother to vote in the primaries are farther to the right than the Republicans as a whole  and are unimpressed with the somewhat more moderate establishment candidates Others suggest that lesseducated citizens who dont usually vote are turning out just to vote for TrumpThese may be part of the answer But we offer a different suggestion to explain Trumps meteoric rise The GOP establishment is out of touch with its base Trump actually represents Republicans better if you examine beliefs issue by issueHow political science helps explain the rise of Trump Most voters arent ideologuesTo investigate we have teamed up with Pollfish a startup survey platform to track American public opinion on 11 key campaign issues weekly during the election season Pollfishs survey platform delivers online surveys to almost 200 million potential respondents We specifically target smartphone owners in the United States Our sampling technique is best described as randomly targeting people of a sample of adults in the US with smartphones Using highly technical statistical techniques to adjust for nonresponse a legitimate concern in all surveys coupled with demographic breakdowns of the voting population derived from Big Data on all registered voters in the US we monitor public opinion on these issues broken down by the general population and by party and compare it to leading political figures in the 2016 primary seasonLets look here at opinion on three highly divisive and partisan issuesOn all three issues most Democratic politicians including both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agree very strongly or strongly The establishment Republican candidates including both Sens Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio disagree very strongly or stronglyBut where do Republican voters stand Lets compare them to the general population to seeHow political science helps explain the rise of Trump the role of white identity and grievancesIf you look at the figure below you can see that only 20 percent of the general population supports a complete abortion ban even in cases of rape and incest  and only 25 percent of Republican voters do Cruz and Rubio advocate this position Trump breaks with the GOP establishment  and agrees with the nearly 60 percent of Republicans who support the right to abortion in these circumstancesDonald Trump may be showing us the future of US rightwing politicsLess than 35 percent of the general population would oppose any additional gun regulation or control More than 50 percent support at least some increased gun regulationOn both abortion and guns less than 15 percent of the general population holds the neutral position 75 percent hold strong or very strong views On guns the Republican voters agree with their elites all Democratic candidates favor increased gun control while all of Republican candidates favor no additional gun controlOkay so what would a Trump presidency be likeWe find that 35 percent of the general population strongly support government action to reduce differences in income inequality 20 percent strongly oppose and 45 percent hold positions that are either neutral or soft However there is a partisan divide Most Democratic voters do strongly support such measures Sanders strongly advocates this position we have defined Clinton as neutral on the issue both in her rhetoric and her policy proposals although this may change in coming monthsRepublican voters are less clearly aligned  and are certainly not as cleanly aligned with the Republican elite Trump Cruz and Rubios tax plans would massively redistribute aftertax income to the highest earners although thats not what their rhetoric says Despite proposing the largest tax cuts Trump calls CEO pay a joke and disgracefulbut offers no policy solutions and has specifically advocated for the end of the hedge fund carried interest loopholeWe asked a total of eight questions all framed to measure whether people hold strong or moderate positions on hotbutton issues We consistently found that people were more likely to hold strong opinions on one side or the other than they were to be neutral or mildly opinionated In other words public opinion was very polarized This indicatesthat elite polarization ie the distance between the policy positions of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has certainly rubbed off on the general population at least to a small extentBut heres something interesting Across these three representative issues 60 percent of the Democratic electorate supports Democratic candidates policies strongly or more so But only 35 percent of the Republican electorate supports their candidates positionsDoes this misrepresentation matter to the voters Its hard to know In 2012 92 percent of selfidentified Democrats voted for Barack Obama while 93 percent of selfidentified Republicans voted for Mitt Romney Only 6 and 7 percent respectively crossed over to vote for the other partys candidateIf Trump secures the Republican nomination a greater proportion of Republican votersmay cross over or the Republican Party may splinter on policy losing proimmigration business leadersBut the Democratic candidates are further from the Republican base than Trump is And Trumps breaks with Republican orthodoxy may actually be closer to the beliefs of the Republican base He breaks left to match Republican voters beliefs on abortion  and he breaks even further right to match those voters in his extreme positions on on opposing immigration and any pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrantsIn other words Trumps apparent hodgepodge of moderate and conservative positions may actually make him a more representative Republican presidential candidate than the establishment candidates weve seen in the past eight yearsIts certainly possible that Trumps candidacy will pull the Republican Party back towards the views of Republican votersNotes on methodology We sampled about 1000 American smartphone users once a week for five weeks between Jan 11 and Feb 12 2016 The total respondents is 4209 We then model each question using a Bayesian hierarchical regression with age race gender education race and party identification We then weight the obtained probability estimates based on total counts of likely voters derived from the
