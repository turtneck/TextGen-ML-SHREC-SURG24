On Wednesday night stories started pouring in from women accusing Donald Trump of sexual assault  groping them or kissing them against their will much like Trump bragged about doing in a leaked audio recordingBut almost immediately Trump surrogates and others started calling their stories into question because of the timingThese allegations are decades old senior Trump adviser AJ Delgado told Chris Hayes on MSNBC If somebody actually did that Chris any reasonable woman would have come forward and said something at the time Delgado added that she didnt find the women who talked to the New York Times credible because they reportedly support Hillary ClintonMSNBCs Joe Scarborough said he was skeptical about the timing of the allegations even though he also insisted that he had no reason to doubt the storiesTalk about an October surprise Scarborough said There have been a thousand triggering events that wouldve made sense If I had been sexually harassed by this man the Megyn Kelly story wouldve given me an opportunityBut the timing of these reports really isnt suspicious at all In fact its totally expected and even reasonable to use Delgados words when you understand how victims of sexual abuse respond to trauma and social stigmaThe three women who spoke to journalists at the New York Times or the Palm Beach Post all said they were inspired to come forward after hearing Trump deny on national television that he had done the things he described on the leaked tapesNatasha Stoynoff of People magazine also led off her story with the exchange from the second presidential debate when Anderson Cooper asked Trump Just for the record are you saying  that you did not actually kiss women without consentThis wasnt just a triggering event as Scarborough put it although the harassment of Megyn Kelly was indeed triggering for survivors of abuse This was Trump explicitly denying that he had done exactly the kinds of things these women say he did to themThe New York Times reported that it was after the debate that one of the accusers Rachel Crooks emailed a reporter at the Times about her experienceThe other accuser who talked to the Times Jessica Leeds said that she started telling her story to people she knew about a year and a half ago when it became apparent that Trump was actually running for presidentBut as Leeds explained to CNNs Anderson Cooper watching the debate inspired her to write a letter to the editor to the New York Times to tell her story That led staffers to contact her and reporters to interview her which led to her story being vetted and publishedAnd Crooks had reportedly been talking to Times staffers about her experience before the debate  but it wasnt until afterward that she actually agreed to go on the recordTheres a tendency in our culture to automatically disbelieve victims of sexual abuse when they come forward Thats especially true in highprofile cases against famous or powerful men as weve seen just this year with Bill Cosby and Roger AilesWhen an accusers story is called into question the typical narrative is that shes just seeking attention or a big payout or that she has some other ulterior motiveBut if youve ever talked to actual victims of assault or been one yourself you know that coming forward is terrifying and intimidating on all kinds of levels and that the costs often drastically outweigh the benefitsAs a purely practical matter pressing charges can mean putting your life on hold for an investigation or a trial and losing a lot of time and money as a resultIts almost impossible for most women to respond effectively to sexual harassment said Patricia Barnes an attorney and an expert on workplace discrimination in an earlier interview with Vox Because to do so means they have to hire an attorney they have to go through a complex legal proceeding that takes years and it has an uncertain outcome at best and often failsThe potential payout is rarely worth it If you go the civil route the median settlement for a sexual harassment suit is 30000 If youre pursuing a criminal case most accused rapists never see jail timeAccusing a powerful man also means risking your career if hes your boss or even if he works in your industry We heard stories along these lines from Roger Ailess alleged victims one of whom said there was a conspiracy of silence around Ailess behavior because nobody wanted to be personally and professionally destroyed by AilesThen there are the personal and emotional costs Victims risk being shunned by their community if they accuse someone who is wellliked They risk having their personal life and especially their sex life ruthlessly scrutinized by people who want to find reasons not to believe themFinally sexual abuse causes trauma that may be too painful to relive in court much less in public It may take victims a long time to even admit to themselves that they were abused or victimized Victims may simply want to suppress the experience as Trump accuser Leeds put it and move on with their lives And victims often feel shame after their attack even if theyve done nothing wrongSo its no surprise that many victims never report the crimes against them in the first place And it shouldnt be a surprise that they may only decide to come forward years later  because it takes that long to process the trauma or to muster up the courage to put yourself through the reporting process or to find the time to put the rest of your life on hold to pursue justiceLeeds who is 74 years old and says Trump assaulted her in the early 1980s on an airplane explained that societys attitudes at the time heavily discouraged victims from speaking outThe culture had instilled in us that somehow it was our fault the attention that we received from men Leeds said That we were responsible for their behavior You didnt complain to the authorities you didnt complain to your boss If something happened to you you just bucked up and you went onBut despite the feminist advances of the intervening decades this is still often true todayCrooks who said Trump forcibly kissed her outside an elevator in 2005 told the Times that the incident made her so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do thatBut as Crookss thenboyfriend also told the Times I think that what was more upsetting than him kissing her was that she felt like she couldnt do anything to him because of his position  I remember her saying I cant do anything to this guy because hes Donald TrumpPower imbalances shame and trauma the fear of social stigma  all of these are reasons why it often takes something big to encourage women to come forward It might take hearing someone else break her silence publicly first which can make it feel safer and less lonely for you to do the sameIt might take hearing that your attacker had other victims which could make you feel morally obligated to help make sure he cant do it againOr it might take seeing the question of whether your attacker committed sexual assault suddenly become a presidential campaign issue
