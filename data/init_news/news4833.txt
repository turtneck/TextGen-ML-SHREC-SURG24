DISPATCHES FROM DANIEL ESPINOSA working to defeat the Big Lie in all its forms J ulian Assange has taken from the political elites their de facto right to conceal their actions from the public they claim to serve But if we can learn anything from WikiLeaks is that a veil of secrecy many times concealS selfinterest taken to a criminal degree Many journalists and researchers have shown us in the past that political and business elites prefer not to discuss policy with the rabble  Even as elections are many times represented as a rather weak or limited form of democracy political elites demand to control them nonetheless Quoting Hillary Clinton addressing the Israeli press in 2006 I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories I think that was a big mistake And if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win 1 Nothing out of the ordinary for the already notorious Democrat behind the infamous we came we saw he died referring to Gaddafis murder or cant we just drone this guy referring to Assange American propaganda is not only pervasive but utterly false and hypocritical mostly based on manufactured fears For some politicians democracy or a fair trial is not for everyone This disdain for democratic values is deeply rooted in Western societies as Noam Chomsky and Michael Parenti to mention just two noted scholars have extensively covered throughout their work even figures as central to modern liberal journalism as Walter Lippmann regarded the masses as ignorant and meddlesome outsiders meaning regular citizens should be spectators not participants whose only duty is to show up every couple of years to ratify decisions made elsewhere If information empowers WikiLeaks should be recognized as a democratic tool redistributing power in times when it is obscenely concentrated This is extremely disturbing for the subservient corporate media as we can easily observe in the reaction of many of its putative journalists Bravo Ecuador This isnt about silencing Assange and suppressing his operation Its about preventing the Ecuadorean embassy from doubling as headquarters for a PutinAssange campaign to discredit Clinton  A Chicago Tribune editorial celebrating Ecuadors President Correa cutting off Assanges internet 101916 T he negative association of Putin with Trump has been helpful in condemning Assange who by himself is often considered a positive influence in Western politics especially when attacking the Republican Party The fabrication of a plan between Russia and WikiLeaks to influence American elections is of course not only patently ludicrous given the advanced state of putrefaction of American democracy itself hardly a damsel whose virtue is in peril never as exemplary as propagandists would have us believe but simply an excuse for pseudo journalists and the punditocracy to ignore the contents of the leaks and drive the publics attention toward Putin and Russia as in those golden days when many things could be associated with the Red Scare Thus as they speculate about how deep Putins nose is inserted in US politics and all the similarities between him and past mythological demons threatening America these characters look away from the reality of the decomposing political system they still cling to Their task has been made simpler by the obnoxious nature of Clintons adversary With his racist and misogynistic rhetoric Trump stands as the easytohate billionairevillain and yet he isnt pushing for a nofly zone over Syria an innocent sounding notion that could easily escalate into something truly catastrophic B ut corporate media being a tool of the corporate ruling class which also controls the military and all major banking and commercial entities in the nation and around the globe rarely speak against military intervention especially when framed as humanitarian the latest pr label concocted by the spin doctors to disguise naked imperial aggressionGoing to war expanding imperial domains and influence promoting Wall Street interests all that while selling the narrative of the enemies of freedom is exactly what the American establishment demands of its presidents As an extension of those interests corporate mediaas previously notedalso demands to be the sole apparatus in charge of shaping public opinion in the direction of which candidates to choose from and what qualities such people should exhibit  Unsurprisingly transmitting a truthful portrait of Hillary Clinton is offlimits as it would seriously question her political legitimacy This explains ridiculous claims as that from CNN host Chris Cuomo in regard to Wikileaks stating that remember its illegal to possess these stolen documents Its different for the media So everything you learn about this youre learning from us WikiLeaks has in fact managed to redirect some attention to HRCs longstanding dirty ways to do politics with its known costs to third world regimes and overall peace as well as her predilection for Wall Street sponsors Trump does not necessarily represent anything substantively different but the illusion of choice is fundamental in our capitalist democracies As former UK Ambassador turned human rights activist Craig Murray puts it You will not get a clear analysis of these issues from the mainstream media That is because they are of course part of the moneypower nexus in which Clinton is intimately connected and they expect Clinton to win I think their fear of Trump is exaggerated He and Clinton are two plutocrat candidates in a system laughingly labelled democracy They move in the same social and financial circles 2 That may explain the haste by some media to celebrate Rafael Correa for unplugging Assanges internet connection recently a mere gesture that does not prevent the WikiLeaks organization from carrying out its journalistic activities as the Ecuadorian government emphasized This attitude towards Assange and WikiLeaks is shared by international media with Ecuadors press also expressing frustration and suggesting the inconvenience of standing against the American political establishment Examples of this subservient spirit abound in the media unless the Ecuadorian government is voluntarily inserting itself in this global chessboard that has inflamed the conflict between US and Russia and threatens to seriously distort US elections letting Assange continue with his plan is going to sink Ecuadorian foreign policy its literally a diplomatic suicide  3 Standing against the de facto powers of the Western world is sure to provoke this kind of reaction but the real distortion of US elections came before way before WikiLeaks thats exactly one of the many functions of corporate media to misrepresent its profoundly worthless and highly compromised leaders for easier public consumption What Ecuador is doing is protecting a very important source of information that is reminding the world about the importance of political transparency as it would presumably do with any journalist living inside its territory Notes Kurson Ken
