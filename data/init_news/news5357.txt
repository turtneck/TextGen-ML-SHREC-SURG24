Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump criticized US immigration and trade policies on Saturday in speeches that veered from accusing Mexico of deliberately sending criminals across the border to professing respect for the Mexican government and love for its peopleSpeaking to a gathering of Libertarians in Las Vegas before headlining an event in Phoenix Trump repeated his charge that Mexico was sending violent offenders to the US to harm Americans and that US officials were being dumb in dealing with immigrants in the country illegallyThese people wreak havoc on our population he told a few thousand people attending the Libertarian gathering FreedomFest inside a Planet Hollywood ballroom on the Las Vegas Strip  Saturdays two appearances seemed to leave many of his Republican rivals and critics scattered in disarray On Sundays morning talk shows the reaction ranged from criticism to applause  At the end of the day for us to win a national election we have to do better with Hispanics presidential candidate and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told CNNs State of the Union programAnd for us to have the moral authority as a party to govern a great nation we have to reject this demagoguery If we dont we will lose and we will deserve to loseWith the Hispanic population rising Hispanic voters are becoming increasingly important in US politics Their support helped Democratic President Barack Obama win reelection in 2012 Most illegal immigrants in the United States are HispanicGraham said Trump had hijacked the debate over immigration policy adding I think hes a wrecking ball for the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic communityGraham has long advocated a comprehensive change in US immigration laws including providing a pathway to citizenship for some of the more than 11 million illegal immigrants  South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley a daughter of two immigrants and considered a potential 2016 Republican vice presidential candidate said on

praise for the countrys seemingly clever tactics   I love the Mexican people I love em Many many people from Mexico are legal They came in the oldfashioned way Legally An estimated 15000 people tried to get into the event according to a Trump spokesmanHe quickly returned to the sharp tone that has brought him scorn as well as praise I respect Mexico greatly as a country But the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours and theyre killing us at the border and theyre killing us on tradeHis speeches in both venues were long on insults aimed at critics and short on solutions to the problems he cited When he called for a wall along the USMexico border the audience in Las Vegas groanedIn a break from the immigration rhetoric that has garnered him condemnation and praise Trump
