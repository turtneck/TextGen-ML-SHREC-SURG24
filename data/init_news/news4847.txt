Share on Facebook Republicans in Congress and perhaps across the nation are suffering today from a case of buyers remorse after Trump begins back peddling on several of his campaign promises before he even takes office Over the last few days he backed off on his claim that hell repeal Obamacare by saying hed just tweak it Hes seemed to have changed his mind on prosecuting Hillary Clinton and hes no longer talking about banning Muslims While drain the swamp which referred to Washingtons culture of corruption was one of his later campaign slogans hes filling his cabinet posts with Washington insiders and corporate lobbyists Hes even appearing to change his mind about his signature issue the wall between the United States and Mexico  One piece of Trumps campaign rhetoric was actually something that would make peoples lives better and its something that Republicans are going to hate His proposal for student loans is radical in that its not a gift to Wall Street and its even more liberal than anything President Obama has proposed In a rally just a month ago Trump said about student loans We would cap repayment for an affordable portion of the borrowers income 125 percent wed cap it That gives you a lot to play with and a lot to do Trump said at a rally in Columbus Ohio on Thursday And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years well let them get on with their lives They just go ahead and they get on with their lives Students should not be asked to pay more on the debt than they can afford Trump said And the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives Source Washington Post Trumps proposed debt forgiveness program is actually pretty similar to Obamas  Instead of a 125 percent cap Obama introduced a cap of 10 percent of a graduates income Trumps program though would leave graduates with five fewer years of debt Trumps would forgive debt after 15 years while Obamas would forgive after 10 In that one significant way Trumps program is even more liberal than Obamas and if he carries it out Congressional Republicans may have no choice but to turn on their partys President The American Enterprise Institute is a Washington think tank who issues a lot of the marching orders of Republicans They were the driving force behind the Iraq war and of failed trickle down economics This is what they have to say about student loan debt forgiveness They are way off on their numbers said Jason Delisle a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute a conservative think tank If you were going to give loan forgiveness in 15 years youre going to forgive a lot more debt than youre going to make up for in the form of the higher payments theyre proposing by a lot I dont even need to run the numbers Its so obvious Really its not obvious Forgiving student debt would be a big boost to the economy because it would 1 incentivize people to become more educated and 2 put more money back into the economy because graduates would be free to buy more Not that Republicans care about that though They prefer that graduates owe their lives to Wall Street banks and in turning his back on that Trump is violating literally everything his party stands for
