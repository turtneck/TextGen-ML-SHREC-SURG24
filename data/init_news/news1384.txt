The recent murders at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood center and the political arguments that have followed remind us once again of the connection between political polarization and terrorismWe are used to the idea that Democrats support legal abortion while Republicans oppose it but this has not always been the case This came up here a couple of years agobut I think its worth returning to the topic now that it is in the news againTo start with heres the trend in public opinion from the National Election Study For each election year we show the average opinion on abortion on 14 scale where 1  abortion should never be legal and 4  abortion should always be legal among selfdeclared Democrats Independents and RepublicansI made the graph a few years ago but I dont think the polarization has gone away Sample sizes are small in some years so I wouldnt recommend trying to interpret every jump in those lines but the basic pattern is clear no partisan polarization on abortion before 1992 lots sinceYair Ghitza and I then broke these data down by ethnicity to see where the polarization was happening And heres what we foundThese lines show estimated regression coefficients predicting abortion attitude from partisanship that is predicting that response on the 1to4 scale from a partyidentification variable that takes on the values 1 0 1 for Republicans Independents and Democrats using a hierarchical model to get stable estimates for each year and for each of four ethnic groupsAs you can see almost all the polarization is occurring among whites Also some among the other category but they represent only a small fraction of the electorateWe then continued and broke down the whites by income and educationPolarization is concentrated among upperincome and welleducated whitesAnd now we can return to the news story about the killerThis is N1 and of course noncollegeeducated people can perpetrate political violence as well But I find the statistics helpful in understanding partisan polarization more generally
