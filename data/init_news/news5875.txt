The salespeople at Ideal Health were thrilled when they heard Donald Trump would become the new face of their company The New York real estate mogul whose reality show The Apprentice made him famous licensed his name to the firm which was then rebranded as the Trump Network in 2009Oh my god people cried when they heard it was him says Jenna Knudsen who worked as a highranking saleswoman for Ideal Health at the time They cried and looked at each other and said Were going to be millionaires Knudsen and her colleagues sold customized vitamins and other health products as part of a controversial business model known as multilevel marketing in which companies pay salespeople commissions for selling products and recruiting more representativesTrump whose presidential campaign is based in part on his reputation as a businessman is well known for licensing his name to golf courses hotels clothing wine and many other products But in this case he became involved in an industry that consumer advocates had long criticized as promising financial independence to sales recruits but rarely delivering it Ideal Health had already faced complaints about its practicesTrump says he was not involved in the companys operations But statements by him and other company representatives  as well as a plethora of marketing materials circulating online  often gave the impression of a partnership that was certain to lift thousands of people into prosperity In fact within a few years the company fell on hard times leaving some salespeople in tough financial straits It ultimately was acquired by another firmBut when Trump joined forces with Ideal Health he was enthusiastic about its futureWhen I did The Apprentice it was a long shot This is not a long shot Trump told a Trump Network convention of at least 5000 people in Miami in 2009 his face projected onto a giant screen This is going to be something thats really amazingIts going to be our company as a group he addedSales peopleaffiliated with the newly branded company also highlighted the relationship Were working on projects behind the scenes every single day with Mr Trump Kim Stone who was one of the highestlevel sales representativesin the company says in a videothat was posted onlinein early 2010 Literally you will be able to set yourself up for the rest of your life financially speaking if you take advantage of the timing right now with this companyIn an interviewStone said many salespeople believed Trump would be more involved Initially when the owners said were all becoming Trump Network they kind of led the field to believe he was financially a part of it she said And technically it was just this branding dealTrump attorneyAlan Garten said in a statement that Trump has always been transparent about his relationship with the network Some materials such as the companys website did contain fineprint disclosuresHis role in the Trump Network was limited to licensing the Trump brand and providing motivational speeches to its members Mr Trump was never an owner of the Trump Network He also was not involved in the manufacturing or sale of any of the Trump Networks products Gartensaid To be clear Mr Trumps role in the Trump Network was clearly disclosed to everyone involved in the company and its members whether it be in the members independent contractor agreements the marketing materials or on the products themselvesInterviews with nine former salespeopleandindustry and academic experts  as well as court filings Federal Trade Commission complaints and Trump Network documents and videos that remain online today  tell the story of Trump leveraging his name and reputation only to leave some disappointed when imagined benefits did not materializeTrump Network is not the first Trumpaffiliated company to receive scrutiny Another of Trumps branding arrangements has become a topic in the campaign Trump University which has been sued along with Trump for promising to teach people unique ways to make money in real estate  a program that would costthousands of dollars  without actually delivering any effective lessonsStudents also say they were misled about the extent of Trumps involvement Trump has rejected the allegationsSome of Trump Networks salesrepresentativeswho suffered after the company ran into trouble say the lack of commitment by Trump and the Trump Networks owners let them down Knudsen  who had reached one of the companys top sales ranks had thousands of people working under her and at one point was earning thousands of dollars a month  ended up losing her house Her car purchased as part of the companys rewards program was repossessed in the middle of the night She said she was a single mother with no alimony and no child support and her kids were traumatizedThey changed us to the Trump Network so we thought we were his company he was invested in us But we were just an endorsement We were just paying to rent his name Knudsen said Was Trump to blame We dont know but he certainly did not do what he said He did not support us he did not make this company his baby company And somewhere between the owners and Donald Trump they devastated thousands of people And no one ever apologizedThe road to the Trump NetworkWhen he set his sights on Ideal Health in the late 2000s Trump did not hint at any qualms about the industry Im a big fan of network marketing Trump said at the Miami convention in 2009 which featured circus performers on stilts and a massive dance partyIdeal Health was started in 1997 by Scott Stanwood his brother Todd and Lou DeCaprio who had worked together in the multilevel marketing business Ideal Healths flagship product  later the Trump Networks  was a multivitamin tailored for customers based on a urine test It cost 13995 plus 6995 a month for the vitamins plus 9995 for additional testingevery six months Former salespeoplepraised the product saying it helped customers live healthier lives But some experts say it was of questionable valueTheres very little evidence to suggest that this test is going to provide you with clinically meaningful information or that the supplements they provide are going to make you healthy said Timothy Caulfield a public health professor at the University of Alberta and longtime analyst of alternative medicineBut most of the controversy surrounding Ideal Health and later the Trump Network stems from how these companies rewarded and recruited sales representatives Althoughmany multilevel marketing companies are legal the FTC has called some thinly disguised pyramid schemesScott Stanwood said he couldnt comment because ofconfidentiality agreements with the Trump Organization He said he was speaking on behalf of Ideal Health and the Trump Networks other ownersAs is common with the model Trump Network sales representativesmade money when they sold products and when salespeopleworking under them made purchases They werent employees so they werent guaranteed a salary And because salespeoplepaid upfront for products each month they bore a lot of the riskA Trump Network compensation plan shows that those in sales were promised big rewards for recruitment A hypothetical example presented by the company showed that salespeoplecould build levels of salespeopleunder them and would earn commissions of 100 25 or 20 each time a new recruit bought a business starter kit for 497 Extraordinary growth on Level 7 the plan says 2187 people x 20  A Lot of MoneyIn one complaint to the FTC obtained through aFreedom of Information Act request by The Washington Post one former salesrepresentativerecounted spending 188775 on starter kits and other materials They kept tricking me into believing that I will make money just by selling more products and inviting more people but the rate of return is so low the consumer who is not identified wrote In other words they are scamming and deceiving people making them believe that if they just hang in there they will make moneyGarten saidthe Trump Network did not receive any complaints from the FTCKatie Baker an attorney with the FTC said that the FTC does not reach out to companies to resolve individual complaints but merely analyzes andcompiles themWell before Trump got involved Ideal Health had faced similar questions about its business practices according to documents made public by a 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by the Minneapolis law firm Mansfield Tanick  CohenSalesrepresentativessaid they paid thousands of dollars for leadership programs infomercials starter kits and other materials that they never recovered in sales One consumer said theyjoined the company expecting to make a fivefigure monthly income butinstead ended up spending 895620 on promotional materials Another claimed they were encouraged to mortgage their home for 70000 to buy shares in TV advertisingThey try to use peoples hopes and dreams to empty their wallets reads one complaintTrump was not new to multilevel marketing He already had been involved for several years with ACN Inc a company that sells phone and other services According to documents released earlier this year by his campaign in2014 and 2015 Trumpreceived135 million in fees for three speaking engagements with ACN ACN said that Trump was a paid keynote speaker at several company events as were many other industry and business experts and that he was not involved in any other facet of the businessTrump was introduced to Ideal Health in early 2008 through Dean Blechman a former chief executiveof Ideal Health and another associate according to acourt documentfrom a subsequent separation lawsuit between Blechman and Ideal HealthIdeal Health was undercapitalized Blechman said and the companywas seeking a partnership to expand its recognition So he and two other business contacts arranged a meeting with Trump at his office in Manhattan Blechman says Trump liked the idea of promoting health as well as creating jobs and income for people through direct marketingI brought the company a hundredsofmillionsofdollarrevenue opportunity Blechman said There was nobody in the world nobody not a single person in the world that was more perfect than Donald TrumpAt first Trump considered taking a stake in the company according to the court document Trumps attorneyGarten said the billionaire became involved with the Trump Network because he believed in the strength of the management team but said only a licensing agreement was ever envisioned Ultimately in March 2009 the parties settled on an agreement in which Ideal Health would license Trumps likeness and trademarks and Trump would promote its productsTrumps endorsement persuadedsome salespeople to quit their day jobs and recruit friends family and neighbors to join according to interviews and contemporary news stories The network grew to more than 20000 people from 5000 before his involvement the Boston Globe reported in 2010As many Americans were confronting the aftermath of the financial crisis and the Great Recession Trump touted the network as a salvationThe economic meltdown greed and ineptitude in the financial industry havesabotaged the dreams of millions of people Americans need a new plan he said in an introductory video They need a new dream The Trump Network wants to give millions of people renewed hope and with an exciting plan to opt out of the recessionSara Harper a former Trump Network saleswoman in San Diego said the overall message she and her colleagues received made it easy to think that Trump was a substantial part of the business A picture was painted that he was involved at a level of business decisionmaking that I dont think he really was she saidSeveral salespeople said that following in Trumps footsteps was a major attractionPeople saw the Trump Network as an opportunity to be associated with the biggest business brand in the world says Lenny Izzo a chiropractor who was one of the Trump Networks top salespeopleWith Trump coming in they hyped it up to make us believe oh its not going to take us long now were going to make money so much faster said Yvonne Zook who was a midlevel sales representativeBut over the next few years according to several of the salespeople far fewer people started showing up at the annual conferences And by late 2011 some suddenly stopped receiving their payments and beganto leave the companyGarten said many people enjoyed financial success with the network But like with any business venture you get what you put into it he saidHeadded that any problems at the Trump Network that came up were solely the result of the financial crisisOthers though suggest alternativereasons for why the company struggled including mismanagement and profligacy by the owners such as spending on anew office and flashy promotional events and an awkward fit between the Trump brandand ahealth and wellness productSome sales representativesdont criticize Trump for the businesss struggles saying he did his best in a limited relationship He did exactly what he was asked to do And I think thats why people were excited because they thought that this could be the turnaround for the company because they felt that he had the business sense said Carolyn Connolly a top saleswomanAccording to public records the Trump Networks owners Todd and Scott Stanwood and Lou DeCaprio filed for bankruptcy The trio lost the 8000squarefoot home with an infinity pool where they lived together north of BostonAroundthe end of 2011 Trumps licensing contract ended and in early 2012 the business was sold to another company Bioceutica for an undisclosed sum Trumps attorneysays those in sales who signed on withBioceutica received outstanding payments Bioceutica declined to commentIzzo says that Trump could have saved the company if he had stepped in  but he didnt have good reason to do that Izzo who also went bankrupt addedCould he have approached this differently Absolutely Could he have taken less fees could he have stepped in and guided the company differently He could have but that wasnt the choiceThe myth and the reality of Donald Trumps business empireDonald Trumps first Cabinet pick is just as controversial as he is and a lot richer
