Home  Headlines  World News  Oathkeeper Chapter 8 A peaceful valley in the mountains of Colorado becomes a battleground pitting the federal government against a rural sheriffs department Sheriff Bear Ellison finds himself increasingly isolated as he is forced to decide between risking his life protecting a local hero or reneging on his oath and handing him over to federal prosecutors Chapter 8 Cold winds poured down off the mountains and swirled in the valley heralding the end of Indian summer Billowing cumulonimbus clouds boiled upwards into the stratosphere dwarfing the fourteenthousandfoot peaks to the west The aspen on the northern slopes had lost the last of their leaves and the cottonwoods and willows that clustered in the arroyos and flood plains had turned yellow The elk had made their way down off the high meadows and the mule deer were more common grazing along the shoulders of the highway sizing up their prospects of safe crossing Sheriff Ellison drove his patrols with a heavy heart Nguyet had made her decision She was leaving for Atlanta and he would soon be alone He wished his term was over so that he could jettison his responsibilities and join her and his new granddaughter The visit with Acevedo had cured him of any lingering political aspirations Despite the DEAs wishes he never did give a press conference on the accidental shooting What would be the point he thought Acevedo was right in one sense The sheriff would have been held responsible for the shooting regardless of how he framed it for the public Ellison conceded that he would not be able to reign in the feds He knew that the populace had most likely also realized this by now and this painted him in a pastel hue of weakness He noticed that people in general had become less social and cordial towards him since the botched raid Good morning Sheriff How are things was replaced with a cursory Howdy or a perfunctory nod followed by averted eyes This along with his wifes looming departure filled him with a feeling of isolation The DEA raids would continue despite his protest Nguyet had begged him to resign but he just couldnt Not at such a chaotic time in his career Ellisons hope was that the county might turn against the DEA occupation Monte Turcot was a hero after all and the shooting of him and his wife was a lightning rod He hoped that the citizens were beginning to question the value of the DEAs mission but without effective leadership and organization they would be helpless to foment any real resistance Ellison knew Acevedo was disappointed that he did not do the requested damage control on the DEAs behalf He learned of this through a phone call with the governors office whom the DEA had contacted to voice their displeasure They had called him demanding an explanation Theres nothing for my department to communicate Ellison had explained over the phone We were not involved in that operation We have asked DA Chalmers to launch a grand jury investigation We expect their decision any day Ive ordered Special Agent Acevedo to suspend operations No he has not complied I respectfully disagree with your assessment I will take the governors position under advisement The DEA continued according to their plan It didnt matter to them what the sheriff or a constituency of rancheros and hippy flameouts thought of their operation Their mission was ordained by the president Provincial resistance was futile Those who stood athwart them would be ignored or swept aside Acevedo and his agents conducted three more raids after the Turcot shooting adding to their tally of minor victories in the War on Drugs at a taxpayer cost of over 100000 per arrest Thankfully no one else was shot One afternoon while on patrol Ellison received a text on his cell phone He glanced at it quickly then turned off the road to change direction An email from DA Chalmers came moments later Re Turcot Shooting it read GJ has decided not to pursue Ellison stepped on the gas He turned west onto County Road 306 and north just after the golf course taking Gun Club Road for two miles and over Michigan Ditch where it ended at the intersection of a dirt road running east and west Ellison turned west his cruisers tires throwing up rocks and a plume of dust as he accelerated up the road that led into the hills and evergreen forest Ten minutes from when he had received the email he was pulling into Monte Turcots driveway He shut off his cruiser looked at his watch took a deep breath then got out and walked up to the door As he raised his hand to knock the recognizable pop of gunfire echoed through the trees Instinctively Ellison reached down towards his holster Another shot rang out then another and another in deliberate succession The sounds were coming from behind Turcots trailer where it abutted the woods Cautiously the sheriff made his way around the trailer ready to draw if necessary As he stepped out from behind it the source of the shooting finally came into view It was Monte Turcot himself now bearded and thin firing rounds into a tree trunk with a small pistol His back was turned to the sheriff and a half empty bottle of Jim Beam sat clasped in his other hand Dont shoot me Monte Im right behind you Ellison called Monte staggered a few steps back and lowered his gun Listen I came out here to talk to you Without even acknowledging the sheriffs presence Monte took a swig from the bottle his pistol now dangling in his hand like a toy gun at his side Ellison kept his hand close to his holster and made a quick glance about looking for cover in the event that Monte had in fact lost his marbles and was mulling over the idea of suicide by cop Can we talk asked Ellison Monte stared into the woods wobbling his back still turned to the sheriff After another swig he lowered his bottle holding it so loosely that Ellison wondered if it might slip out and crash on the rocks at his feet Monte Monte didnt move Okay Monte Ellison explained slowly Im going to go back to my car and check my messages and call in Thatll take me about five minutes or so Then Ill be on my way If you want you can come over and talk Or call me later Does that sound okay with you Monte didnt respond swaying in the autumn air A gust of wind blew pine cones off the trees which landed with a thunk on his trailers metal roof Ellison backed away behind the trailer and walked back to his cruiser Inside he radioed a quick status report to dispatch and then checked his messages Nguyet was wondering when he would be home for dinner His son had emailed pictures of his granddaughter A reporter from the Gazette wanted to talk about his reelection campaign Someone had sent a note about a roadkill carcass on the highway north of town Something moved in the corner of his eye Ellison glanced up and was startled to find the ragged Monte Turcot framed in his windshield He looked pale his hair was matted and his filthy sweatshirt was stained with blood Ellison looked at his hands Monte was no longer wielding the pistol but he still clung to the bottle From the looks of it hed had a few more drinks since the sheriff had arrived Relieved but still cautious Ellison rolled down the passenger window Get in Monte Monte stared back his blank expression evoking that of a zombies Ellison clipped his cell phone into its mount on the dash then reached over and opened the passenger door Monte slowly shuffled towards it and got in How are you holding up Monte Ellison asked Still here he answered in a raspy tone This is a terrible thing youre going through I wish there was something I could do to help Thanks murmured Monte Whats that blood from on your shirt there Tore my hands up chopping wood Did you cut yourself No Monte set his bottle down on the floorboard and presented the palms of his hands to the sheriff They were covered in blisters some of which had burst The tender layer of skin beneath had torn open You should take care of that Ellison warned him It could get infected Yeahyoure probably right Looks like you did a lot of chopping Four cords Monte stated quietly How long did that take you I split it all yesterday That ought to be plenty to get you through winter in that trailer of yours Monte stared out the passenger window The mountains appeared through a break in the ponderosa that lined his drive their peaks sheathed in the purest of white It certainly is beautiful out here this time of year the sheriff observed I think I might just walk myself up into those mountains and never come back down Monte answered in a quiet resigned sigh You ever think about doing something like that Sheriff I think about that a lot Monte Maybe not exactly like you describe it but there are a lot of days  too many days  when I think about dropping everything and going away going away for a while I aint talking about for a while  Im talking about for good You wouldnt be planning on bringing that gun along with you would you asked Ellison You know I dont really plan anything anymore Monte looked down at his ravaged hands The future changes day by day Sometimes I think about going back to active duty again volunteering for all the action I thought for sure that was going to be my future yesterday But then today I dont think thats such a good idea Today I think Ive seen enough killing for one lifetime I dont want any part of that no more Right now I wish Id never joined in the first place He shrugged But then again who knows Tomorrow Ill probably wish I never came home Its got to be tough dealing with everything youve been through Ellison answered Its too much for one man Yeah Monte nodded slowly Im ashamed of the things that I thought about doing yesterday What sort of things Im worried about you Monte What do you know about anything Sheriff Youre right I dont know much about what youre going through I just worry Dont Monte Ellison said wary of the direction he was about to take the conversation I came out here to check up on you It doesnt look like youre doing well I dont think youre out of line or anything all things considered I just think youre out here all alone and that its not good for you Is there any way I could talk you into staying with some family for a while Youve got a sister dont you Maybe she could come out and stay with you or you could go visit her She lives in Connecticut Shes got four kids What about your parents Theyre old worn down worn out Id be a burden on them I dont want to deal with them right now anyway MonteI wouldnt feel right about just leaving you out here without knowing youre going to get some help Everyone needs help sometimes There isnt any shame in that Monte turned from the window and looked at Ellison So what happened with the grand jury Thats really why you came out here isnt it To tell me about that Ellison felt relieved that Monte had broached the subject first He hadnt been able to figure out a way to get there gracefully by himself They concluded that under applicable law no criminal charges will be filed against the DEA agent that shot you and your wife Im sorry He watched as Montes eyes dimmed in helpless frustration For the record thats the DAs language not mine I think its wrong I cant say that Im surprised Monte replied He picked his bottle off the floorboards and opened the door I think Im going to go back inside and lay down for a while Okay Monte Ill stay out here for a few minutes if you dont mind Dont worry Sheriff Ill be all right answered Monte I just need to get some rest These hands are hurting real bad and Im pretty drunk He stumbled out of the cruiser and staggered slowly back into his trailer letting the door slam shut behind him Sheriff Ellison waited outside with his window down listening for a gunshot for over an hour
