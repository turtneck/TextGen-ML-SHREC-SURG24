DES MOINES  Its Iowasnightmare scenario revisited An extraordinarily close count in the Iowa caucuses and reports of chaos in precincts and computer glitches areraising questions about accuracy of the count and winnerThis time its the Democrats not the RepublicansEven as HillaryClinton trumpeted her Iowa win in New Hampshire on Tuesday aides for Bernie Sanders saidthe eyelashthin marginraised questions and called for a reviewThe chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party rejected that notion sayingthe results are finalThe situation echoes the events on the Republican side in the 2012 caucuses when one winner Mitt Romney by eight votes was named on caucus night but a closer examination of the paperwork that reflected the head counts showed someone else pulled in more votes Rick Santorum by 34 votes Butsome precincts were still missing entirelyLike Republican party officialsin 2012Democratic partyofficials worked into the early morning on caucus night trying to account for results from a handful of tardyprecinctsBut at 230 am TuesdayIowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Andy McGuireannounced thatClinton had eked out a slim victory based onresults from 1682 of 1683 precinctsAfter voters from the final missing Democraticprecinct tracked down party officials Tuesday morning to report their resultsSanders won by two delegate equivalentsover Clinton in the final missing precinct Des Moines precinct No 42The Iowa Democratic Party said the updated final tally of delegate equivalents for all the precincts statewide wasThats a 377count margin betweenClinton the powerful establishment favorite who early on in the Democratic race was expected to win in a virtual coronation and Sanders a democratic socialist who few in Iowa knew much abouta year agoSanders campaign aides told the Register theyve foundsomediscrepancies between talliesat the precinct level and numbers that werereported to the state party The Iowa Democratic Partydetermines its winner not based on a head count like in the Republicans straw poll butbased on delegate equivalentstied to a math formulaAnd there was enough confusion and untrained volunteers on Monday night that errors may have been madeWe feel like that theres a very very good chance that there is said Rania Batrice a Sanders spokeswoman Its not that we think anybody did anything intentionally but human error happensTeam Sandershad its own app that allowed supporters and volunteers to send precinctlevel results directly to the campaign At the same time caucus chairs sent their official results to the state party either over a specially built Microsoft app or via phone Sanders aides hopeto sit down with the state parties and review the paperwork from the precinct chairs Batrice saidWe just want to work with the party and get the questions that are unanswered answered she saidMcGuire in an interview with the Register said noThe answer is that we had all threecamps in the tabulation room last night to address any grievances brought forward and we went over any discrepancies These are the final results she saidMcGuire in her 230 am statement said Hillary Clinton has been awarded 69957 state delegate equivalentsBernie Sanders has been awarded 69549 state delegate equivalents Martin OMalley has been awarded 768 state delegate equivalents and uncommitted has been awarded 46 state delegate equivalents We still have outstanding results in one precinct Des Moines 42 which is worth 228 state delegate equivalents We will report that final precinct when we have confirmed those results with the chairTeam Clinton quickly embraced that news and flatly stated that nothing could change itClintons Iowa campaign director Matt Paul said in a statement at 235 am Hillary Clinton has won the Iowa caucusAfter thorough reporting  and analysis  of results there is no uncertainty and Secretary Clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegatesStatistically there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that Senator Sanders can overcome Secretary Clintons advantageMcGuire repeated that Tuesday afternoon saying the reporting app had a builtin failsafe to prevent volunteers from reporting more delegates than were assigned to each precinctClinton who saw her expected Iowa win slip away in 2008grasped theprize TuesdayI can tell you Ive won and Ive lost there and its a lot better to win shesaidat a rally in New Hampshire the state that votes next on the presidential nominating calendarBut that didnt quell doubts back in IowaPolitics is a contact sport with few referees so torturing your opponents with questions about the transparency of an election can be very harmful and damaging said Steffen Schmidt a longtime political observer and professor at Iowa State University in AmesDiscrepancies can occur in official elections and caucuses are not even official election events run by the secretary of states office notedDennis Goldford a Drake University professor who closely studies the Iowa caucusesThe caucus system isntbuilt to bear the weight placed on it he said There arent even paper ballots in the Democratic caucusesto use for a recountin case something doesnt add upDemocrats have never released actual head counts and McGuire said they would not be releasedthis time either Determining a winner based on state delegate equivalents rather than head count is a key distinction between how the Democrats conduct their caucuses versus conducting a primary she saidNew Hampshire and Iowa are generally careful to maintain such distinctions as part of their effortto preserve their status as the first caucus state and first primary stateThere were reports of disorganization and lack of volunteers Monday eveningParty officials reported a turnout of 171109 far less than the record of 240000 seen in 2008 Democratic voters reportedlong lines too few volunteers a lack of leadership and confusing signage In some cases people waited for an hour in one line only to learn their precinct was in a different area of the same building The proceedings were to begin at 7 pm but started late in many casesThe scene atprecinct No 42  the one with the final missing votes was chaos Monday night saidJill Joseph a rankandfile Democratic voter who backed Sanders in the caucusesNone of the 400plus Democratswantedto be in charge of the caucus so a man who had shown up just to vote reluctantly stepped forward As Joseph was leaving with theuntrained caucus chairman who is one of her neighborsI looked at him and said Who called in the results of our caucus And we didnt knowThe impromptu chairman handdelivered the results to Polk County Democratic Party Chairman Tom Henderson TuesdaySanders won seven state delegates Clinton won fiveAmes precinct 13 started caucusing two hours late at 9 pm because the crowd was so big and the checkin line so slow saidPeter D Myers a finance major and member of the student government at Iowa State University who caucused for the first timeCapacity at the caucus site Heartland Senior Center was 115 but 300 people turned out Myers said At one point they considered moving to the parking lot of the HyVee grocery storeIt was so chaotic that we ended up making the building work even though capacity was doubled he saidMyers said he registered to vote in August but was alarmed to find out I wasnt on the list so I had to go to the back of the line The gentleman in front of me has caucuses the past three cycles and he wasnt on the list eitherNo one was there to lead the caucus so a pregnant lady took charge and counted the Bernie supporters and a Hillary captain took the small group to a corner and counted the supporters he saidSanders ended up with four delegates and Clinton one he saidAn Indianola precinct that gathered in Hubbell Hall at Simpson College had a discrepancy between the number who checked in and people counted in the first voteThe chair and secretary knew the count was off but proceeded anyway said Paige Godden a reporter for The Record Herald and Indianola Tribune We did the final count at least three times People were very frustrated by the endNew voters made up nearly 40 of the caucusgoers  207 of 521  at Democratic precinct No 59 on at Des Moines Central Campus organizers said The precinct ran out of voter registration forms and had to print moreWhen the caucus began the onebyone head count discovered 58 more people voting than had checked in Organizers asked anyone who had not signed in to do so and then recounted Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller a Clinton supporter who lives in the precinct stepped in to help with the recountThe precincts caucus chair Mark Challis wasnt sure if the counts were accurate but changes wouldnt have affected the final vote tally which had Sanders substantially aheadDemocrat Mary Ann Dorsett of Des Moines told the Registerthat492 voters turned out in her precinct but there were only a handful of people assigned to check people inIt was a very large room so clearly they expected a large turnout Dorsett said The lines snaked through the corridor and out the door It took over an hour to check inRepublicans in the same precinct were seated long before this and already listening to speechesDorsett thinks the onebyone headcounting system is a real headscratcher in terms of the possibility of inaccuracy as well as time wastedIf all the smartphones were eliminated it could have been 1820 and we were reenacting the roles of a bunch of farmers sitting in a church hall counting heads Is this the 21st century she said This may well be my last caucus unless the Democratic Party cleans up its actMeanwhile Republican Party of Iowa officials are doing a review  theyre comparing the app results for each candidate with what the precinct chairs jotted down on their eforms on caucus nightWhen youre counting thousands of votes youve always got to be careful Iowa GOP spokesman Charlie Szold saidMicrosoft one of the premier tech companies in the world had developed websites to deliver results in real time But both the Democratic websiteidpcaucusescom and GOP websiteiagopcaucusescom struggled intermittently throughout the night crashing for periods of time and locking out the public from access to the resultsMcGuire said theapp system the volunteers in the precincts used to file their numberswas never down They Microsoft had plenty of capacity for our results she saidMicrosoft spokeswomanAngela SwansonHenry said National interest in the Iowa Caucuses was high and some who attempted to access websites may have experienced delays which were quickly addressedContributing Tony Leys and Kevin Hardy The Des Moines Register Follow Jennifer Jacobs on TwitterJenniferJJacobs
