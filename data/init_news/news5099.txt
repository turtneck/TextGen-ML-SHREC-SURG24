Turns out theres no free lunch even if youre among those lucky few dining at the Harvard Faculty ClubThe New York Times is feasting on the delicious uproar created by Harvard professors who are now outraged to be hit with higher health care costs as a result of ObamaCare I hardly know where to start on this one Perhaps with the fact that the article appears in the New York Times I will let that one go for the momentHeres whats clear Health care costs at Harvard are going up Immediately And they are rising directly as a result of ObamaCareThe explanation written right at the top of Harvards health care enrollment guide for 2015 states that the university must respond to the national trend of rising health care costs including some driven by health care reform The guide even highlights in a special little box in the margin the exact Impact of Health Care Reform explaining that The Affordable Care Act has brought new benefits and opportunities to many people but with added costs to sponsorsSay what Who could have predicted that Anyone who can do mathStill the special little box goes on to point to such benefits as keeping offspring on your plan until they are 26 and the Cadillac tax as added costs And as a result they say premiums and deductibles are risingOne French history professor gasps without a hint of irony that rising premiums are tantamount to a pay cut Welcome to our worldStill the rising costs arent necessarily news to everyone Several years back Harvards own provost Dr Alan M Garber sent an open letter to President Obama praising the Cadillac tax as a way to rein in health care costs and premiums In subsequent interviews hes defended his stance and the higher costs he and coworkers are now facingIm betting hes having a hard time finding a tablemate at the Harvard Faculty Club this weekProvost Garber should not be confused with another economist with a similar sounding name working about a mile down the Charles River at MIT Jonathan GruberGruber infamously counted on the stupidity of the American voter to overlook the obvious math thats now confronting Harvards staff Harvard faculty may be a lot of things but stupid aint one of themIn fact Meredith Rosenthal a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health told the Times she was puzzled by the outcry The changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes all Americans are seeing Indeed they have come to our front door much later than othersNo I dont think these folks are surprised by the math I am a graduate of the Harvard Economics Department and I have sat in these classrooms I would bet the faculty just didnt believe they would have to foot the bill Costs may rise but they would somehow be absorbed in the system Donors someone  someone else that is  would payAnd that is in fact one of the main problems in American politics We all want life to be better for everyone Who wouldnt want all of their fellow Americans or all of humanity for that matter to have good health care But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocatingThats the hard question the president and proponents of ObamaCare did not want you to grapple with because they were afraid your reaction would be akin to the screams now echoing through Harvard YardMelissa Francis is the host of MONEY with Melissa Francis 2 PMET a program that breaks down the days top stories and how they impact the American taxpayer Like her on Facebook at MelissaFrancisFOX and follow her on TwitterMelissaAFrancis Click here for more information about Melissa
