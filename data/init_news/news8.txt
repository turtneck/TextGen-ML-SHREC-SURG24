Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC commanderinchief forum on military and veterans issues Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started while Trump was wrong once again in saying he was against the war before it startedTrump said that President Obama set a certain date for withdrawing troops from Iraq when that date was set before Obama was sworn inTrump said that Obamas visits to China Saudi Arabia and Cuba were the first time in the history the storied history of Air Force One when high officials of a host country did not appear to greet the president Not trueClinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration Thats false Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitalsTrump said Clinton made a terrible mistake on Libya when she was secretary of State But at the time Trump also supported US action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from powerTrump cherrypicked Clintons words when he claimed Clinton said vets are being treated essentially just fine Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as widespread as some Republicans claimed but she went on to acknowledge problems including the issue of wait times for doctorsThe forum sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America was held Sept 7 at the Intrepid Sea Air  Space Museum in New York City Todayshow host Matt Lauer and members of the military and veterans in the audience questioned the candidates separatelyTrump said he was totally against the war in Iraq while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started The facts dont support either candidates strong assertionsOur review of Trumps statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started In fact he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept 11 2002  about six months before the war startedStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq and Trump responded Yeah I guess soIn the NBC commander in chief forum Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war But that article appeared 17 months after the war startedAs for Clinton who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump supported it before it happened he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happenedBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war after it happenedThe Clinton campaign cited Trumps interview on March 21 2003 with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war startedCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market Trump said the war looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint and he predicted the market will go up like a rocket after the war But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the US should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war and Trump doesnt offer an opinionAs early as July 2003 Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthewsabout money being spent in Iraq rather than in the US Two months later Trump told MSNBCs Joe Scarborough I guess maybe if I had to do it I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily IraqClinton invited her audience to read Trumps comments on the Iraq War They can read our timeline Donald Trump and the Iraq WarTrump said President Obama set a certain date for withdrawing troops from Iraq but that date was actually set by President George W BushNBCs Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond when pushed for details on his military proposals that hes not going to give details because he wants to be unpredictable Trump responded Absolutely and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal dateAs we said then Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec 14 2008 It said All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31 2011In the NBC forum Trump also called the withdrawal of troops a terrible decision As weve explained before Condoleezza Rice Bushs secretary of State later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki objectedOnce Obama took office in January 2009 he had three years to renegotiate the deal which his administration tried to do to leave a residual American troop force But Maliki still didnt agree Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether US troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion His then defense secretary Leon Panetta later wrote that the president didnt press hard enough for a deal But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasnt a deal to be made with MalikiSo both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a certain date for withdrawal and let US enemies know about it when that date was set before Obama was sworn inIts worth noting that Trump said in a March 16 2007 interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from IraqTrump said that Obamas visits to China Saudi Arabia and Cuba were the first time in the history the storied history of Air Force One when high officials of a host country did not appear to greet the presidentThats not true Other presidents have encountered similar lowkey greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraftTrump referred to the fact that Cubas president Raul Castro did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March that Saudi Arabias King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obamas trip to Riyadh in April and he referred to Chinas handling of the presidents arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meetingWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a US president as Trump claims is a matter of debate But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before It hasIn 1984 for example Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by Chinas foreign minister rather than the president whom he met only later Similarly on a 1985 trip to West Germany Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut KohlThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler the Washington Posts Fact Checker who researched a Trump claim in April that Cubas and Saudi Arabias handling of Obamas visits were without precedent Kessler said of Trump once again hes wrong wrong wrongKessler also noted that during Richard Nixons historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the countrys number two man Premier Zhou Enlai His boss Chairman Mao didnt even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest houseClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization which she said Trump supportsBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans I would not do that Trump said referring to Clintons claim that he supports privatizationTrumps campaign published The Goals Of Donald J Trumps Veterans Plan on its website last October It doesnt call for the VA to be completely privatizedOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any nonVA medical center that accepts MedicareUnder a Trump Administration all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veterans ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately the plan statesThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans healthcare dollars the plan saysTrumps proposal would seemingly go further than the NonVA Medical Care Program which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services The program requires preapproval for veterans to receive care at a nonVA facility in nonemergency situationsTrumps proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law creating a temporary program separate from the NonVA Medical Care Program that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a nonVA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospitalTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA in JulyPoint 10 of the plan says Mr Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice Under a Trump Administration no veteran will die waiting for serviceTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as wellTo be clear Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones Thats not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veteransTrump criticized Clinton for making a terrible mistake on Libya when she was secretary of State But at the time Trump also supported US action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from powerTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be prepared on Day One if elected president to tackle complex national security issuesThis isnt the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the US intervention in LibyaDuring the 10th GOP debate Trump said he had never discussed that subject when Sen Ted Cruz called him out on supporting US action in the country But as we wrote Trump said in 2011 that the US should go into Libya on a humanitarian basis and knock Gadhafi out very quickly very surgically very effectively and save the livesTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011Even though Trump now says Clintons support for intervention in Libya was a terrible mistake it doesnt change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafis removalTrump twisted Clintons words when he claimed Clinton said vets are being treated essentially just fine Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as widespread as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system  including the issue of wait times for doctors  and what she would do to address themTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as one of the big problems in the VA and then suggested Clinton doesnt think the VA has problemsLauer interrupted noting that Clinton went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VATrump insisted his version was accurate adding Im telling you  she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans AdministrationThats not accurate The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBCs Rachel Maddow on Oct 23 2015 Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable Maddow saidMaddow asked if Clinton had any new ideas for trying to fix the VA Here was Clintons response with the part Trump is referring to in boldClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they want it to fail so they can privatize itClinton added But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern so that we can try to stymie the Republican assaultIndeed the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to fundamentally reform veterans health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care The campaign says Clinton was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA and as president she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership The site specifically mentions Clintons dissatisfaction that many veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals and promises she will build a 21stcentury Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver worldclass careTrump cherrypicked the part of Clintons response that said problems in the VA have not been as widespread as it has been made out to be to make the blanket claim that Clinton is satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration and that vets are being treated essentially just fine But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clintons answer that acknowledged problems in the VA  including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns
