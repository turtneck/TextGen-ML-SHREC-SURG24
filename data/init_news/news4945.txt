Donald Trump on Tuesday channeled more than a years worth of fiery and freewheeling protectionist rhetoric into an uncharacteristically disciplined address putting him out of step with decades of conservative economic orthodoxy and even some of his own prior positionsSpeaking in a warehouse filled with piles of compressed aluminum cans and scraps of metal Trump ticked through a sevenstep plan to boost domestic job growth that included renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement labeling China a currency manipulator and withdrawing from the TransPacific Partnership trade deal and preventing its implementationAt a rally in Ohio hours later Trump said the trade pact was being pushed by special interests who want to rape our country repeating rape several timesThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee mentioned Britains recent decision to leave the European Union saying that our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy and that now its time for the American people to take back their future Quoting Founding Fathers and former presidents Trump said international trade agreements have left American workers behindOn trade on immigration on foreign policy we are going to put America first again Trump said We are going to make America wealthy againHe also took sharp aim at presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by invoking the populist attacks she has faced from her rival in the primaries Sen Bernie Sanders of VermontPeople who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothings going to change Trump saidThe speech highlighted one of the key areas of disagreement pitting Trump against business leaders and establishment Republicans who for decades have advocated freetrade policies and have generally opposed tariffs and other measuresIt also came amid a period of upheaval in Trumps campaign that many backers hope will lead to a more policyfocused operation He
