The GOP presidential campaign has now shifted away from the heartland evangelical wonderland of Iowa to live free or die state New Hampshire where the elbows are notoriously sharp and a whole bunch of Republican establishment candidates are hunkering down to stage their last stand It remains unlikely that any of them will be able to dislodge Trump in the number one slot  its much more his kind of electorate than the pious social conservatives of Iowa There are lots of angry white rightwingers and independents there who arent as concerned about their religion as they are about their guns and the threat of Mexicans and Muslims pouring over the border to make them eatmoleand follow Sharia lawBut after Iowa there a feeling of excitement in the air that the Trump balloon may have finally burst and theres a possibility that the air could go completely out of it over the next couple of weeks Nate Silver mused yesterday that Trump may just end up being like Pat Buchanan or Ron Paul One suspects that all the other candidates are having fever dreams about making a big lastminute move as Rubio did in Iowa to either usurp The Donald or come in a close second and be touted as this cycles Comeback Kid Cruz and Rubio are of course the two best positionedto do this with Rubio probably a little bit better positioned than Cruz simply becausehe isnt quite as dependent on evangelical voters even though he turned himself into the second coming of Oral Roberts in the last couple of weeks to get himself a slice of that Iowa evangelical pieYesterday morningthe campaigns wasted no time with niceties as Chris Christie Jeb Bush and John Kasich were practically waiting on the tarmac for the Iowa Three to alight from their private planes to begin the battlemano a manoSo far they seem to besticking with the Trump will implode eventually strategy and are setting their sights on one another As is his wontChris Christiewas the first to deliver a roundhouse punch to the man who came in third in Iowa but was declared the winner Marco RubioLets get him up here  lets get the boy in the bubble up here Lets see if hell handle your questions and take that I dont think he will Now its time for him to man up and step up and stop letting his handlers write all of his speeches Im fascinated to hear his answers and Im sure you are too Maybe hell answer more than two or three questions at a town hall and do more than 40 minutes and deliver something that isnt the same canned speech he gives every time This isnt the studentcouncil election everybody This is the election for the president of the United States Lets get the boy in his bubble out of his bubble and lets see him play for the next week in New Hampshire Lets see if hes ready to play because Im ready to playIts pretty clear what Christies saying there Rubios a punk Rubios campaign manager responded by calling Christie a liberal Obama lover whos full of hot air which undoubtedly made him feel very sadJeb Bush meanwhile is facing a different problem too much campaign spending on his behalf It sounds weird but according tothis Washington Post story Bushs Super PAC is inundating people with expensive campaign swag to the point where its making them recoil from the candidateThis has happened before In California eBay magnate and GOP gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman saturated the state with advertisements for many months and it madepeople hate herThere is such a thing as too much exposure Its worth noting thatWhitman had an unusual business arrangement with strategist Mike Murphythe same Mike Murphy who runs Bushs Right to Rise Super PACMeanwhileafter his Super PAC ran a very unpopular negative ad against Marco Rubioand he asked them to take it downGovernor John Kasich who is seen as a possible New Hampshire latecomer seems to have decided that hes going to run as the positive optimistic guy It makes sense since there might be a few people in New Hampshire who arent convinced that their country is the dark and hopeless dystopian hellscape the other candidates insist America has becomeAnd then theres Rubio who is telling everyone who will listen that hes the only one who can unite both the Republican Party and the conservative movement after what has been a divisive campaign He seems to think if he says it enough it will be true And a lot of Republicans in DC are probably hoping hes rightUnfortunately he and Cruz might share the same problem in the general electionThis Kasich votergets right to the point Rubio and Cruz really are too conservative and I dont really see them as compromisers said Judy Kohn a 76yearold retired librarian from Georges New Hampshire Nobody is surprised that someone might think Ted Cruz is too conservative But that nice young man Rubio Well yes as it happenshes just as right wing as Cruz Sure he joined the Gang of 8 to try to forge some compromise on immigration but thats theonlycompromise hes ever endorsed Its too bad for him that happens to be a litmus test issue on the right and one which Im not sure they can forgive Lindsay Graham put it right out there on Morning Joe I like Marco but he has now turned hard right Marco has no exception for rape and incest I think its going to be very hard to grow the party among women if youre gonna tell young women If you get raped youre gotta carry the child of the rapist According to recent pollingthat extreme position is only held by 17 percent of the public This quote is from a speech Rubio gave a while backat the Reagan Library talking about Medicare and Social Security These programs actually weakened us as a people You see almost forever it was institutions in society that assumed the role of taking care of one anotherAll of a sudden for an increasing number of people in our nation it was no longer necessary to worry about saving for security because that was the governments job Its rare to hear even a far right wing zealot or hardcore libertarian suggest that Social Security and Medicare have weakened us as a people The farthest they will usually go is to suggest that the program should be privatized Thats a scathing indictment of our national character Heres a quotefrom the most recent presidential debate talking about the threat of ISIS When I am president of the United States if there is some place in this country where radical jihadists are planning to attack the United States we will go after them wherever they are and if we capture them alive they are going to Guantanamo Essentially hes saying that terrorist suspects caught within the United States will not have trials they will be sent to Guantanamo But thats not how we do things in this country Any terrorist suspects weve caught here up until now have been subject to the American legal system Weve had numerous court cases on the subject Hes openly admitting he plans to flout the rule of law That was just the tip of the iceberg of Rubios frightening foreign policy and national security declarations during the debates He is by far the most bellicose of the lot and thats saying something He states that President Obama has not kept the country safe and therefore he is prepared to let the intelligence services do whatever it takes and promising to make terrorist suspects talk and I think we know what that means Even Dick Cheney is more restrained The Republicans seem to have talked themselves into believing their own hype that the country is in dire straits the terrorists are coming in droves to kill us and everyone in the nation is angry and frightened to death about well everything Theres a certain political utility in making this case in a presidential primary but at some point reality is going to intrude No everything isnt perfect America is still emerging from a very difficult economic crisis and there is a terrorist threat abroad People are frustrated by student debt and police violence and any number of other problems But the Mad Max version of the United States these Republicans are talking about doesnt really ring true for more than a limited faction whothink the world they knew is disappearing and they will not be able to adjust to the new one If all the cards fall the right way and Cruz is unable to win anywhere where there isnt a large evangelical population and Trump decides he wants to go back to playing golf and none of the rest of the establishment pack can climb out of the pile maybe Rubio will be able to bridge the gap between the conservative movement and the establishment as hes now promising on a loop And thats making the huge assumption that the antiimmigration fetishists will hold their noses and vote for him despite his one apostasy But that still doesnt solve their problem Rubio is so far to the right and the party is so hostile to racial and ethnic minorities that they cannot win a national election Hes got a Hispanic last name and a beautiful young family but his record shows hes just another right wing extremist
