Chris Christie depicts Marco Rubio as a truant schoolboy Jeb Bushs top ally portrays him as a weather vane Ted Cruz and his supporters characterize him as a nervous sellout who bowed to Democratic demands for amnestyIn commercials interviews and facetoface meetings with voters Rubios 2016 rivals and their backers are waging increasingly personal attacks using different words to say much the same thing that the freshman senator from Florida is weak and unreliableWith their pointed attacks Rubios rivals have essentially taken a page out of Donald Trumps playbook After months of trying and failing to dislodge the brash GOP frontrunner the field is now focused heavily on Rubio who is seen as a vulnerable and necessary target straddling the line between the conservative and establishment wings of the Republican PartyThursday nights Fox Business News debate in North Charleston SC will put the new dynamic on display before a national audience with less than three weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses Rubio advisers and allies are tightlipped about his debate strategy but in general they say that he will not endure attacks quietly Rubio tends to respond to criticism with specific wellrehearsed policy critiques rather than personal jabsHowever in a campaign where Trump Christie and Cruz have ascended on the strength of their belligerent dispositions and quippy broadsides Rubios softer approach carries risksHes not as inflammatory as others and those personal attacks tend to get headlines said Rep Jason Chaffetz RUtah a Rubio supporter But Marco Rubio is that steady responsible conservative with a message thats inspirational for a lot of usOne of the most searing attacks on Rubio yet came this week in the form of a Web video from Keep the Promise I a super PAC supporting Cruz The 1 minute spot splices together footage of President Obama praising the immigration reform bill Rubio once pushed and clips from interviews edited to give Rubio a deerintheheadlights lookTo many Republicans Rubios youth is one of his best attributes The 44yearold candidate regularly talks about hiphop electronic dance music Uber and Airbnb He looks sounds and sometimes dresses younger than most Republican officialsBut where some see an appealing freshness others see inexperience and weakness  critiques similar to those leveled at Barack Obama by Republicans in 2008Marco Rubio has never run anything Im not sure he could run a bath said Roger Stone a longtime Trump confidant who departed Trumps political team last yearRight to Rise USA a super PAC supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush put out a video this week that kicked off a multipronged attack against Rubio including seemingly questioning his masculinity and accusing him of changing his position on capandtrade regulations immigration and other issuesThese boots are made for flippin and thats just what theyll do One of these days young Marcos gonna flip flop flip on you sings a woman in the video which makes fun of Rubios welldocumented fashion choice during a recent swing through New Hampshire a pair of stylish black highheeled boots Right to Rise also released a TV ad showing a Rubio cutout spinning around on a weather vaneIn a Wednesday interview with MSNBC Bush  who at 63 is at least five inches taller than Rubio  was asked whether he owned any platform boots I dont have a height issue he saidStrategic or overconfident Rubio plays hard to get with votersTrump who also has a height advantage said last week on a Boston radio station that it helps to be tallI dont know what to think of those boots he said adding Theyre big heels I mean those heels are really up thereRubio has called the fascination with his boots craziness at a time when consequential events are unfolding across the worldFor most of Rubios competitors finishing ahead of him rather than Trump is a more realistic goal in the early states Its particularly critical for those stuck in the middle tier to receive a boost with donors and voters in the first wave of contestsChristie New Jerseys governor is a good example Since the last debate in December the RubioChristie rift has deepenedChristie has said in recent interviews with The Washington Post and other news outlets that Rubio turns tail and runs a reference to him walking away from comprehensive immigration reform that the truant officer is out looking for him a reference to his many Senate absences and perhaps his relative youth and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would cut his heart outRubio and his campaign have hit back but on policy rather than characterIm sure he doesnt really want to have a conversation about the issues Rubio said of Christie in Nashua NH last week Rubio dinged the New Jersey governor as a backer of Common Core education standards said he ran for office as a supporter of gun control and noted that Christie once made a contribution to Planned Parenthood Days earlier a proRubio super PAC unveiled a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire with similar lines of attackHes Cuban Im Mexican Can Rubio and Cruz connect with Latino votersOn Monday Rubio delivered a speech on taxes in which he took policy swipes at Christie and Cruz In a clear shot at the senator from Texas Rubio said not to be fooled by advocates of a business flat tax which he said acts like a valueadded tax widespread in foreign countries but not the United StatesMuch of Cruzs antiRubio rhetoric has been associated with his membership in the bipartisan Gang of Eight that pushed a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 The bill included a path to citizenship that conservative opponents call amnestyRubio has fought back against Cruz by pointing to an amendment Cruz pushed offering legal status to undocumented immigrants Cruz says it was a poison pill meant to foil Democrats Rubio has also sought to run to Cruzs right on national security hitting him hard over his vote to stop the governments bulk collection of Americans telephone metadataRecent polling shows Rubio edging up to second or third place in each of the first two nominating states Theres a growing sentiment that party elites will eventually coalesce around an alternative to Trump and Cruz who some leading Republicans fear are too combative for the general election Rubio is trying fend off Christie Bush and Ohio Gov John Kasich in that subcontestEven as he stresses his youth and nextgeneration appeal Rubio has tried to appear presidential as his rivals raise doubts about him He is pitching himself as the strongest possible commander in chief His events even the small ones have a formal feel to them with a stage always erected at the front His TV ads include several spots with dark themes and dire warnings about threats overseasRubio will have to adjust a bit to Thursdays debate because Rand Paul a natural opponent on foreign policy did not poll well enough to appear on the main stage In the last debate Rubio took am at the Kentucky senators libertarianleaning foreign policy to tout his more hawkish viewsRubio has tended to do well in the debates winning positive reviews in each of the previous five meetingsAfter the debate Rubio will hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire and then Iowa where some like Evan Sinclair 20 are nervously watching whether he can blunt his rivals attacks Observing Rubio shake hands in the Des Moines suburbs recently Sinclair said he hopes the senator can catch fireRubio had better shine a light so the Republican Party can exist he said People need to
