the hands of the embattled Ferguson police department whose chief resigned in the wake of scathing criticism of the force by the Justice Department for racially biased policingSt Louis County police chief Jon Belmar had called for a measured response to the shooting of the two officers around midnight Wednesday but reserved the right to beef up security as warrantedThe two officers took a very hard hit and were seriously injured but will not sustain longterm injuries he said They were released from the hospital Thursday morningWe were lucky by Gods grace that we didnt lose two officers last night Belmar told reporters We could have buried two police officers over this  Its a miracle we havent had any instances similar to this in the summer and fallPolice recovered shell casings at the

reportedNeighbors said three people were taken from the home in handcuffs Police said they were taken in for questioning but there were no immediate arrestsThe shootings occurred as demonstrators were winding up a protest following the resignation of the citys police chief in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report alleging bias in the police department and courtThis is really an ambush he said You cant see it coming You dont understand that its going to happen and youre basically defenseless from the fact that it is happening to you at the time Belmar said one of the officers a 32yearold sevenyear veteran from nearby Webster Groves was shot below his right eye The bullet lodged near his right ear he saidThe second officer a 41yearold with 14 years on the St Louis County

the scene had dropped to about 40He said the two wounded officers were standing in a line of 20 to 25 other officers when three or four shots were fired from about 125 feet awayI feel very confident that whoever did this was there for the wrong reason not the right reason and came there for whatever nefarious reason it was Belmar said in a news conference But I do feel like there was an unfortunate association with that gatheringJeff Roorda who heads the St Louis Police Officers Association said the shooting sent a chill through the law enforcement communityHe called on state and county officials to restrict protests to daytime hoursThis is a very volatile situation Roorda said You have outside agitators racing to be here This isnt safe for police community or peaceful protestersRoorda said hes spoken to the police officer who was shot in the shoulder and that he was doing remarkably well considering the circumstancesPolice officers at the scene last night said were jolted by the timing of the incident The protests were breaking up and only a few dozen demonstrators were left when the shots were firedTheres been a recurring phenomenon throughout the protests where you see the flashpoints the bad things coming  he said But last night as it was described to me by many of the cops that were here here it wasnt that way The crowd was just mulling around A lot of the protesters were starting to disperse No one saw it comingThe shootings came hours after Ferguson officials announced that Police Chief Thomas Jackson who will step down March 19Jackson 57 became the third top city official to leave following the release of the Justice Department report Judge Ronald Brockmeyer and City Manager John Shaw resigned earlier this weekLt Col Al Eickhoff is

insurance for one yearBelmar said he has called for a measured response to the shootings but reserved the right to call upon the highway patrol for additional help if necessaryHe said police are planning to assess their security plans outside the Ferguson Police Department and talk to protesters and community leaders about how to move forwardWhen asked about security in the area moving forward Belmar said it is very difficult to sustain this kind of situation without injuries to the public or police officersI think we need to reevaluate that and thats one of the things Ive been doing since my phone rang at midnight tonight said Belmar Were going to be looking for different ways to approach this Obviously my first priority is to the community but thats followed very very closely to my police officers and making sure that theyre able to do what theyre supposed to do out there in a safe mannerEarlier in the day Obama condemned the shootings saying in a tweet that violence against police is unacceptable Our prayers are with the officers in MO he wrote Path to justice is one all of us must travel togetherSt Louis County Executive Steve Stenger said doesnt believe the shooting will set back any gains made in the cityI dont consider this incident a setback toward healing he said I dont believe its going to affect any healing process that is going on in the community I think the community at large is fully supportive of these police officers and probably wishes the very best for themKnowles and the Ferguson City Council released a statement thanking law enforcement agencies that have helped the city in the past seven months and reaching out the communityWhile we respect the right to peacefully protest we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction to our community the statement said We ask our residents and clergy in this area to partner with us as we make our way through this processThe shootings came as a shock to the crowds gathered outside the police department DeRay McKesson 29 one of the most visible protesters in Ferguson was sitting in his car and about to tweet that the crowd was thinning out when he heard about four gunshots to his rightIt was like pow pow pow pow  like four consistent shots he said I was looking straight up at the police department and I see an officer fall and I see officers surround himMcKesson said protesters who had been gathered at the police department since 8 pm Wednesday hit the ground as soon as the shots rang out and scattered trying to get to safety amid the chaosEvery single gun any officer had was drawn and they were all behind something he said adding that officers ran and ducked behind cars and the department buildingSt Louis County Alderman posted a Vine showing people crawling on the ground after police reacted to the gunshotsHeather De Mian 44 of St Charles Mo was live streaming the scene outside of the police department when the shots rang outThose gunshots went right past my head said De Mian who is in a wheelchair and tried to duck down I tried to go down low so my head wasnt sticking outShe said soon after the shots a swarm of St Louis County Police crime scene cars showed up and later a group of officers marched up the hill on a side street in the direction of where the sound of gunshots had come fromMeanwhile De Mian is adamant that the shooters were not with demonstratorsThe shots came from a block away from the protests she said Its incredibly dangerous to try to link the protesters to this without evidence It could be someone trying to frame the protesters or someone who was aiming at the protesters and was a bad shot Whoever shot put everyones life in dangerAn Aug 9 shooting of unarmed AfricanAmerican teen Michael Brown by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson set off weeks of unrest and violence in the St Louis suburbBrowns family issued a statement Thursday condemning the police shootings
