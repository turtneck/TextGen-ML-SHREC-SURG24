Proof God is on Dutertes Side Azzmador October 29 2016 God gave this man three missions Kill drug dealers  stop cussing  gas kikes These days its not very often a nation can say their leader has the approval of the Almighty God himself but now the Philippines can claim this distinction The Washington Post  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a solemn promise no more swearing Duterte who famously cursed the pope and used a slang term that translates as  son of a whore  while denouncing President Obama said he was flying back from Japan late Thursday looking at a vast expanse of sky listening to his colleagues snore when he heard a voice say If you dont stop epithets I will bring this plane down now I know many of you may be skeptical of his claim but not me Ive heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life and until now there was always some personal agenda involved When I was a kid I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didnt send him ten million dollars by a specified date God would kill him personally Then you had guys like Ted Haggard Im pretty sure God told him it wasnt a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W Bush but if so Gods words went unheeded Not so with the infamous Flip shitlord And I said Who is this So of course its God he told Filipino journalists late Thursday So I promise God he continued Not to express slang cuss words and everything So you guys hear me right always because a promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people Gods servant on Earth Rodrigo Duterte contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords Now theres a man with his priorities straight He identifies the speaker and makes his promise publicly to God and his people that he will obey Of course all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy so his obedience just makes sense An important thing to note is when God speaks what he doesnt say is just as important as what he said He told Duterte stop cussing Nothing more Thank goodness he did not say stop killing criminals I was pretty sure he wouldnt but you never know What a relief Of course not everyone is theologically adept ie the author of the WaPo article She took to Twitter to make some heretical and thoroughly unfair remarks Err to quote astroehlein  Did God mention the death squads httpstcoQezjfCweEH  Emily Rauhala emilyrauhala October 28 2016 No Emily God did not mention the death squads and any true believer knows this means he approves of them Where in the Holy Bible does it say youre supposed to allow savage drug kingpins to wage war in your streets killing innocents by the thousands just so they can decide who gets to sell poison to your people and in what location Ive never read that part I cannot confirm whether or not Emily Rauhala is a Jew but shes WaPos China Correspondent and her Twitter timeline reads like someone with a personal vendetta against the fantastic leader of The Philippines Whatever her problem is shed better get a handle on it because in ten days were electing a Great Christian here as well
