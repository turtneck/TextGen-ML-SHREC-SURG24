When it takes up the question of whether President Obamas 2014 immigration executive actions were constitutional the Supreme Court will throw out its typical playbookUnited States v Texas is one of the most  if not the most  important cases before the highest court this term Its certainly the most important immigration case the Supreme Court has taken up in a generation or arguably a century And the Court is treating it accordinglyOn Monday instead of splitting up 60 minutes of oral arguments between the two sides of the case as usually happens the Court will convene for 90 minutes  and bring in more parties to argue their caseTexas and the 25 other states suing will get 30 minutes The federal government will get 35 But the Supreme Court has also given 10 minutes to a lawyer representing a group of immigrant women whod benefit from Obamas executive actions And thats not all  15 minutes will go to the US House of Representatives thanks to the Republican House majority which has jumped in to support the statesThe unusually complicated oral argument process reflects just how messy this case is Its a case covering surprisingly narrowsounding legal questions but its outcome carries broad implications for the relationship between Congress and the president and the relationship between the federal government and the states Oh yeah  and its a presidential election year and both immigration and the Court itself have become election issuesAll this makes it something of a nightmare scenario for Chief Justice John Roberts who tends to be more anxious than the typical Supreme Court justice to present the Courts opinions as drawn purely from law rather than politicsAs the justices hear oral arguments and consider the case before issuing an opinion which theyre expected to do in late June at the end of the term Roberts and the other justices will have to work through legal questions that are both less contentious and more abstract than the broader immigration debate makes them seemThen theyll have to figure out if theres any way they can cobble together a fivevote majority for a lasting opinion  or if the eightperson Court will deadlock putting the most important case of the Courts term in limbo and creating the opportunity for chaosIn November 2014 President Obama issued a series of memos declaring executive actions on immigration Two of those are at issue in this caseOne memo expanded the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or DACA which since 2012 had allowed immigrants whod come to the US as children to apply for temporary protection from deportation and work permitsThe other one added a new deferred action program  the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program  which would have allowed millions of unauthorized immigrants who have US citizen or permanent resident children to apply for deportation protection and work permits as wellThe two 2014 actions are usually referred to as DAPADACA Since the states won in the lower courts both of them have been put on hold since the first ruling was issued in February 2015 The original DACA program from 2012 however is still in place and isnt being challenged in this suit To prevent confusion Ill just refer to DAPA instead of DAPADACA when talking about the 2014 actionsFederal immigration enforcement has totally transformed over the past 20 years More people are eligible for deportation than ever before The growth of the unauthorized population preGreat Recession meant there were more people to deport After 911 the government got vastly more money and resources for deportation And deportations escalated accordingly  from 183000 in 1999 to a high of 400000 during the first several years of the Obama administrationPresident Obama has spent most of his time in office trying to impose some sort of control on all of this  to make sure the government is choosing whos most important to deport rather than arbitrarily deporting anyone Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents get their hands on His first attempts  setting high and low priorities for deportation and telling immigration agents to follow them  were something both sides in the current court case agree he could do but that rankandfile immigration agents frequently ignored in favor of their own judgmentSo in 2012 President Obama created the first deferred action program DACA  allowing people to proactively apply for protection from deportation rather than simply hoping that ICE followed the memo not to deport them Its been solidly effective After comprehensive immigration reform stalled in Congress in 2013 pressure grew on Obama to use the tool that had worked  deferred action  to protect other groups of lowpriority immigrants and he did just that with DAPA and expanded DACA in 2014DAPA was supposed to be the program that ensured Obamas legacy on immigration turning him from the deporter in chief of his first term to a man who brought immigrants out of the shadows If the Supreme Court lets the program go forward that legacy is assured If it strikes DAPA down Obamas legacy  and immigrants attitude toward the Democratic Party  will be an ambivalent and disappointing oneUnited States v Texas is political in its origins That doesnt at all mean that the states that sued the Obama administration are wrong on the merits  its just an acknowledgment of the circumstances around the cases genesis shortly after Obama announced the executive actionsThere wasnt a serious legal challenge to the original DACA program in 2012 even though many of the criticisms of DAPA in this case would have applied to DACA as well But in June 2012 the country was in the middle of a general election campaign and the Republican nominee was trying to run toward the center and appeal to Latinos In November 2014 on the other hand the relatively unpopular President Obama was responding to an electoral defeat in the midterm elections  including the loss of the Senate  with executive actions on an issue that mobilized the GOP baseThe states on each side of the case have lined up along partisan lines The Texas suit involves 23 states  all but three of them under unified Republican control  as well as four Republican governors three of whom have Democratic attorneys general who wouldnt let the state officially join the case and one Republican attorney general The states that have filed briefs supporting the Obama administration meanwhile represent about twothirds of the states with Democratic attorneys generalTexas is leading the coalition of states bringing the lawsuit for two reasons One its offered the most persuasive case for how DAPA could actually hurt the state more on that later Two it houses the Southern District of Texas which was the court the states chose to file their case in presumably because they knew theyd have a good chance there The administration and its allies have implied that this is unfair but it happens all the timeThey chose wisely In February 2015  just a few days before the government was scheduled to start accepting applications for expanded DACA  Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunctionpreventing the government from moving ahead with the program on the logic that the states were likely to prevail on some of their claims The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction And in January the Supreme Court agreed to hear the caseAs the case has made its way through the courts its gotten much broader Initially the injunction was based on a narrow claim that the Obama administration hadnt used the right procedure in instituting DAPA The Fifth Circuit ruled that DAPA was also or at least was likely to be illegal on the merits And now the Supreme Court has added a constitutional question whether DAPA violates the take care clause of the ConstitutionWhile this is theoretically still a ruling on the injunction the Supreme Court is dealing with the merits of the case  ensuring that if a majority of the Courts eight justices side with the Obama administration or with the states the case is finished and DAPA is alive or dead for the duration of Obamas time in officeThe stakes have risen accordingly The House of Representatives asked and was granted the chance to argue that DAPA violates laws that Congress has passed  something that isnt totally unheard of at the Supreme Court level but certainly raises the political temperature of the caseAnd on the federal governments side the argument on behalf of the Jane Doe immigrant women  not to mention the likely presence of many potential DAPA beneficiaries in the Supreme Court during the oral arguments  will inevitably remind the justices that this is a question of the balance and separation of powers and about immigrants themselvesBecause immigration is such a divisive culture war issue  and because phrases like enforce the law get tossed around frequently as talking points  it sure seems like this case should be a massive legal dispute over what should happen to unauthorized immigrants in the US But its not There are four questions at play in the case and all of them are given the importance of the case relatively narrow1 Is it even legal for Texas to sue the federal government to stop the DAPA programThe states case in one sentence It costs the state government money to give subsidized drivers licenses to DAPA recipients who now qualify for themThe federal governments case in one sentence If that were all it took for a state to sue the federal government over a policy it didnt like the courts would be clogged foreverThe first question the Court has to address whether Texas and the other states had standing  whether they are legally able to bring the lawsuit at all In order to show standing Texas has to show that implementing DAPA causes some direct harm to the stateEven if the substance of Texass legal argument against DAPA is correct if it cant show that it had standing the whole suit gets dismissed  allowing DAPA to go into effect after all This route would give the Supreme Court some appealing options as well get to in a bitThe Republican governors and state attorneys general on Texass side of the case clearly think that allowing unauthorized immigrants to remain in their states is harmful for all sorts of reasons But as is often the case with Supreme Court cases  and is definitely the case with this one  the actual argument being put forward in the courtroom is a lot narrower than the argument over whether unauthorized immigrants are good or bad for America thats happening around the caseSo far courts have found that the states have standing for a single reason Texas drivers license costs Under Texas law people who get deferred action are eligible for drivers licenses  and because fees only partially cover the cost of producing a license the state government covers the rest of the cost DAPA would make hundreds of thousands of Texans eligible to apply for drivers licenses for the first time which would cost the state moneyThe Supreme Court now has to decide whether thats enough of a reason to allow Texas and the other states to sue the federal government over the entire policyThe federal government argues its not President Obamas fault that Texas law would allow DAPA recipients to get drivers licenses Furthermore supporters of the federal governments side in this case argue theres a slippery slope Allow the states to sue the government over a policy they dont like as long as they can show that it costs the state something even if that cost is recouped and the courts will be clogged with lawsuits left and rightTheyre hoping that possibility will scare Chief Justice Roberts who dissented in a previous case about states suing the federal government Massachusetts v EPA into protecting the Supreme Courts legacy by remaining above the dispute2 Is DAPA a substantive new regulation  which the Obama administration didnt follow the proper procedure forThe federal governments argument in one sentence Nope its just a general statement of policy and we do those all the timeThe states argument in one sentence It sets pretty hardandfast standards for who qualifies for deferred action and work authorization that seems pretty rulelikeThis question also seems pretty narrow  its a challenge about whether the Obama administration did DAPA the right way instead of whether it was the right thing to do So it might not get a lot of the Supreme Courts attention But this was actually the basis for the original ruling freezing DAPAissued in February 2015 by Judge Hanen of the Fifth CircuitUnder the Administrative Procedures Act the government cant just issue new regulatory rules it has to propose them and then allow a certain period for public response Hence the term notice and comment which comes up a bunch when people are discussing this aspect of the Supreme Court caseThe Obama administration didnt do this with DAPA It argues it didnt have to because it wasnt a real rule just a general guideline The states disagreeAt root this is a disagreement about how the deferred action programs actually work whether immigration agents actually have the leeway to reject applications for any reason policylike or whether the Obama administration has dictated that anyone who meets the standards should get protection rulelikeAnd because DAPA hasnt gone into effect yet this is really an argument about how the original DACA program is working  even though the existing deferred action program isnt being challenged in this case3 Is DAPA within the presidents authority or does it encroach on parts of immigration law where Congress has already set down the rulesThe federal governments argument in one sentence DAPA is just a way to tell immigrants theyre not being deported  something that both sides agree is legalThe states argument in one sentence DAPA goes beyond that by bestowing lawful presence and work permits on immigrants Congress didnt want to grant either one toLegally this is the biggest question about DAPA Does it violate US law by going beyond what the president is allowed to do on immigration But again the disagreement between the two sides in the actual court case is a lot narrower than youd think given the general heatedness of the immigration debateUS immigration law gives the president a lot of latitude to make policy decisions  more than he gets in a lot of other areas So the states in this case agree that President Obama and the rest of the executive branch have the latitude to choose whom to deport and whom not to deport The states even say it would be okay if the Obama administration issued cards to people who were low priorities for deportation indicating that they were low prioritiesBut they say DAPA goes beyond what the president is allowed to do and crosses into areas where Congress has set firm rules on immigration in two ways It allows deferred action recipients to apply for work permits which the states argue violates Congresss intent not to allow unauthorized immigrants to work legally in the US And they say DAPA deems people to be lawfully present in the US even though Congress has said its illegal for them to be hereThe phrase lawful presence is probably going to be thrown around a lot at Mondays oral arguments  its become increasingly central to the states argument The federal government argues that the states are simply getting confused Lawful presence isnt the same thing as lawful status in immigration law  it doesnt grant anyone the right to be in the US The federal government has started arguing that its really more like tolerated presence3 Is Obama abandoning his constitutional obligation to take care to enforce Congresss laws by implementing DAPAThe federal governments argument in one sentence NopeThe states argument in one sentence YepThis question wasnt even considered in the lower courts  the Supreme Court added it to the case on its own It centers on the Constitutions take care clause He shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executedThere isnt a lot of Supreme Court jurisprudence on what this phrase actually charges the president to do so its interesting that the Court felt it was particularly appropriate here  though its entirely possible that the justice interested in this was Antonin Scalia and the surviving justices dont have any interestThe answer to the take care question depends on whether DAPA violates US law to begin with If the federal government is right and DAPA is within the presidents legal authority then hes not abandoning his duty to execute the laws by implementing it If the states are right and DAPA is illegal then Obama might be violating the take care clause in implementing it  but the program would be struck down in any eventFor people who believe that President Obama is legally obligated to deport unauthorized immigrants under all circumstances the idea that hes violating the constitution by not taking care to enforce immigration laws has some appeal But again neither side is actually arguing that in courtThere are dozens of hypothetical possible answers the Court could reach to any of the four questions above But in terms of the cases practical outcome there are essentially four optionsFurthermore  and this is where things get really messy  the absence of a Supreme Court opinion could allow another circuit court to hear a case on DAPA and rule that it could go forward How such a lawsuit would proceed is unclear maybe some of the states that sided with the Obama administration could find standing But it would create a situation in which DAPA was legal in some parts of the country and illegal in othersIts entirely possible that the Supreme Court would go out of its way to avoid that level of chaos Thats why some analysts think the most likely outcome is thisIf the Court sides with the states nothing changes  programs that currently arent in effect wont go into effect But if the Court sides with the administration an estimated 45 million immigrants who are currently vulnerable to deportation will get three years of protection and the ability to work in the US legallyThe effects this could have on the lives of those immigrants and their families could be hugeThe evidence from DACAwhich has protected about 700000 immigrants for the past three and a half years is promising Threequarters of DACA recipients had been able to get betterpaying jobs 30 percent had gone back to school and 59 percent said they could help support their families Theres evidence that DACA helps keep immigrants integrated into American life  instead of losing interest in school or career because they feel their immigration status holds them backIf the Supreme Court reinstates DAPA at the end of June the Obama administration will only have seven months left in office to process applications  and many of the community groups that would have been able to help people get those applications will be busy mobilizing for the electionFurthermore the election might discourage some immigrants from wanting to sign up to begin with  if theyre worried that Donald Trump will be president come 2017 theyll be much less inclined to turn over their personal information to the governmentDAPA is an Obama administration initiative Theres nothing stopping the next president from ending the program and rescinding its protections even if the Supreme Court upholds it this year Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have already promised to do just that in their first few days in officeThat doesnt mean that the immigrants who have gotten deferred action so far would necessarily get deported In fact thats the bigger decision that President Cruz or Trump would have to make what to do with a database of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are unauthorized but who by definition are welleducated speak English or at least have kids who are US citizensA President Trump might start his mass deportation campaign by targeting the immigrants he can most easily locate former deferred action recipientsSome pundits have argued that this means the real immigration fight is what happens in November rather than what happens in the courts this spring Insofar as the next president will choose whether to end deferred action thats true But the Supreme Court decision could definitely shape what options a president has to expand it as both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have promised to doSanders has explicitly said that hed protect some 8 or 9 million people using deferred action Clinton has said she wouldnt deport immigrants who hadnt committed crimes but hasnt explained how shed protect themIf the Supreme Court strikes down DAPA  or upholds it but articulates a limiting principle that clarifies that this is the most a president can do  both of those plans will be a lot harder to implement but a Democratic president would be under even more pressure to find a way to protect immigrants That could create troubleConservatives siding with the states in United States v Texas argue that if Obama wins this case theres no limit to who could be protected from deportation They make a persuasive caseThe Obama administration argues that while DAPA was legal it wouldnt have been legal to give deferred action to even more immigrants  say parents of DACA recipients But their reasoning on this point is fairly weak and it doesnt help that both candidates for their own partys presidential nomination are promising to do just thatThis lack of limiting principle gives conservatives a lot of pause A president could do whatever he likes on a whole host of issues  say refuse to enforce any environmental regulations or even declare a tax cut by executive fiat Voxs Andrew Prokop lays out some of the optionsHypotheticals like these raise some valid concerns about the use of prosecutorial discretion generally But these are issues with existing law and its not clear that a ruling for the feds in this case would make them any worseMany legal scholars believe that immigration law simply gives the president more discretion than other areas of law So a ruling for Obama in this case wouldnt necessarily create a precedent for other issuesIf the president has historically had a lot of leeway to set immigration policy though a ruling for the states would effectively constrain that powerThe states in this case arent asking the Supreme Court to issue a broad ruling But that doesnt stop the Court from doing so if it wants And if the Court finds that its illegal for the president to allow a large group of immigrants to apply for work permits that definitely calls the original DACA program into question  and raises questions for other uses of executive power on immigrations as well An extremely broad ruling against the president could even dictate that the executive branch cant declare immigrants low priorities for deportation though thats extremely unlikelyBut even a relatively narrow ruling for the states would have implications for other issues where the president didnt have as much leeway to begin withIts possible to imagine a Supreme Court ruling against Obama whose argument implicitly called into question other things hes donefrom delaying the employer mandate to modifying key provisions of No Child Left Behind not to mention the original DACA program It wouldnt automatically strike down any of these but it could open the door to future court challengesWhat legal scholars who side with the administration are particularly concerned about though is what will happen if Texas and the other states are granted standing at all  even if the Court ultimately sides with Obama They argue that this would essentially invite states to sue the federal government over any policy they dont like and then hunt down some way the policy harms them In an amicus brief for example law professor Walter Dellinger argues that states could start suing the IRS over which organizations are exempt from federal taxesTo a certain extent this is what the states are doing anyway  no state has ever sued the federal government for doing something the state likes But the Supreme Court has long tried to avoid becoming a way for states to challenge federal policy willynilly Thats the sort of politics it tends to want to stay out ofThen again the lesson of United States v Texas may very well be that even if politics stop at the Supreme Court door the cases that come in  and what happens to decisions that come out  are political from start to finish
