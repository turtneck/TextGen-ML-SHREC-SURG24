Most of us havent quite realized there is something extraordinary happening A few months ago I freed myself from standardprocedure society I broke the chains of fear that kept me locked up into the system Via AnonHQ Since then I see the world from a different perspective the one that everything is going through change and that most of us are unaware of thatIs Really Something Extraordinary Happening In The World Why is the world changing In this post Ill point out the 8 reasons that lead me to believe it1 No One Can Stand The Employment Model Any Longer We are reaching our limits People working with big corporations cant stand their jobs The lack of purpose knocks on your door as if it came from inside you like a yell of despair People want out They want to drop everything Take a look on how many people are willing to risk entrepreneurship people leaving on sabbaticals people with workrelated depression people in burnout2 The Entrepreneurship Model Is Also Changing Over the past few years with the explosion of startups thousands of entrepreneurs turned their garages in offices to bring their billion dollar ideas to life The vortex of entrepreneurship was to find an investor and get funded To be funded was like winning the World Cup or the Super Bowl But what happens after you get fundedYou get back to being an employee You may have brought in people not sharing your dream not in agreement with your purpose and soon its all about the money The financial end becomes the main driver of your business People are suffering with it Excellent startups began to tumble because the money seeking model is endless A new way to endeavor is needed Good people are doing it already3 The Rise Of Collaboration Many people have figured out that it doesnt make any sense to go on by yourself Many people have awakened from the each man for himself mad mentality Stop take a step back and think Isnt it absurd that we 7 billion of us living in the same planet have grown further apart from each other What sense does it make to turn your back on the thousands maybe millions of people living around you in the same city Every time it crosses my mind I feel blueFortunately things are changing Sharing collaborative economy concepts are being implemented and it points towards a new direction The direction of collaborating of sharing of helping of togetherness This Is Beautiful To Watch It Touches Me4 We Are Finally Figuring Out What The Internet Is The internet is an incredibly spectacular thing and only now after so many years we are understanding its power With the internet the world is opened the barriers fall the separation ends the togetherness starts the collaboration explodes the helping emerges Some nations saw true revolutions that used the internet as the primary catalyst such as the Arab Spring Here in Brazil we are just starting to make a better use out of this amazing toolInternet is taking down mass control The big media groups controlling news by how it suits best what they want the message to be and what they want us to read are no longer the sole owners of information You go after what you want You bond to whomever you want You explore whatever you may want toWith the advent of the internet the small is no longer speechless there is a voice The anonymous become acknowledged The world comes together And then the system may fall5 The Fall Of Exaggerated Consumerism For too long weve been manipulated to consume as much as we possibly can To buy every new product launched the newest car the latest iPhone the top brands lots of clothes shoes lots and lots and lots of pretty much anything we could our hands on Going against the crowd many people have understood that this of way off Lowsumerism slow life and slow food are a few excerpts of actions being taken as we speak pointing out by contradiction how absurdly we have come to organize ourselvesFewer people are using cars fewer people are overspending and more people are swapping clothes buying used goods sharing assets cars apartments offices We dont need all of that they told us we needed And this consciousness of new consumerism can take down any company living of the exaggerated end of it6 Healthy And Organic Eating We were so crazy we even accepted eating anything It only needed to taste good and everything would be alright We were so disconnected that companies started to poison our food and we didnt say anything But then some people started waking up enabling and strengthening healthy and organic eating This is only to get strongerBut what has this got to do with economy and work Just about everything Id say Food production is one of the basic fundamentals of our society If we change our mindset our eating habit and our way of consuming corporations will have to respond and adapt to a new marketThe small farmer is getting back to being relevant to the whole chain of production Even people are growing plants and seeds inside their homes as well And that reshapes the whole economy7 The Awakening Of Spirituality How many friends do you have who practice yoga What about meditation Now think back 10 years ago how many people did you know by then who practiced these activities Spirituality for too long was for esoteric folks those weirdlike and mystic peopleBut fortunately this is also changing Weve come to the edge of reason and rationality We were able to realize that with only our conscious mind we cant figure out everything that goes by here There is something else going on and Im sure you want to get hold of that as wellYou want to understand how these things work How life operates what happens after death what is this energy thing people talk about so much what is quantum physics how thoughts can be materialized and create our sense of reality what is coincidence and synchronicity why meditation works how its possible to cure using nothing but bare hands how those alternative therapies not approved by regular medicine can actually workCompanies are providing meditation to their employees Even schools are teaching the young how to meditate Think about it8 Unschooling Trends Who created this teaching model Who chose the classes you have to take Who chose the lessons we learn in history classes Why didnt they teach us the truth about other ancient civilizations Why should kids follow a certain set of rules Why should they watch everything in silence Why should they wear a uniform What about taking a test to prove that you actually learnedWe developed a model that perpetuates and replicates followers of the system That breed people into ordinary human beings Fortunately a lot of people are working to rethink that though concepts such as unschooling hackschooling homeschoolingMaybe youve never thought of that and even may be in shock But its happening Silently people are being woken up and are realizing how crazy it is to live in this society Look at all these new actions and try to think everything is normal we were taught so far is normal I dont think it is There is something extraordinary happening
