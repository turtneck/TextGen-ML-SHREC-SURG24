Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nomineeThe only way he wont is if something unthinkable happens He could be struck by lightning He could pull off his Trump mask and reveal that hes actually been Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt this whole time Short of that I dunno You never want to say never in American politics but this is the exceptionHe is way up in the polls in Indiana which will net him a bunch of delegates Then hes set to dominate West Virginia and New Jersey further down the road and after that he looks likely towin most of Californias delegates All this means he will probably secure a majority of delegates by early June when the last states have voted  and so hell win on the first ballot at the Republican National ConventionBut even more to the point there is simply no sign that even if he does fall slightly short of an outright delegate majority the party will try to meaningfully contest the convention There are a handful of Republican Party leaders who are fundamentally opposed to Trump but they are genuinely few and far between The vast majority of GOP elected officials dont think nominating Trump is a good idea but they have no intention at this point of doing anything to stop it from happeningThe shortlived CruzKasich pact in which John Kasich would throw the race in Indiana and Ted Cruz would do likewise in Oregon illustrates the fundamental problem  there are steps through which Republican Party actors could have stopped Trump but none of them have ever really come together and now they are out of timeAn Indiana pact was just about the lowestcost form of collaboration imaginable The reason is that for Kasich to instruct his supporters to vote for Cruz in Indiana would be a zerocost move Right now it is mathematically impossible for either Kasich or Cruz to secure a majority of delegates The only way for either one of them to win the nomination is through a contested convention And to get a contested convention they need to stop Trump from getting a majority Indiana allocates a large share of votes to whoever wins a statewide pluralityTherefore far and away the best hope for Kasich is to prevent Trump from gaining a plurality in Indiana And to do that he needs people who want Kasich to be president to vote for Cruz who is currently in second placeThere was a brief moment when Kasich pulled resources out of Indiana but even during the heyday of the alliance he wasnt willing to actually tell his supporters to vote Cruz  even though the benefits to Kasich of a strategic vote for Cruz exist even if Cruz doesnt make any concessions to CruzThats all below the radar of normal people watching the election from the sidelines but its crucially important because it shows the extent to which there is genuinely no antiTrump movement in the Republican Party Theres a Twitter hashtag and a fair amount of talk from conservative intellectuals but the vast majority of the partys elected officials donors and grassroots leaders have been watching nervously and not saying muchThere are lots of people out there ranging from true conservatives like Cruzs supporters to moderates like Kasichs supporters who dont really want Trump to be the nominee But nobody is doing anything to stop him and the closer he gets to winning the more people join his bandwagonThe Trump phenomenon is confounding many people because on the one hand it seems impossible to many that the Republican Party would nominate such a weak general election candidate while it seems impossible to many others that Donald Trump could be such a strong candidateSo lets be clear about this Trump is by every sign available a historically weak general election candidateHis unfavorable numbers are off the charts he is losing to Hillary Clinton in every headtohead poll and his policy proposals are going to attract a level of media scrutiny that Republican nominees normally avoid because conservative intellectuals have spent a lot of time dumping on them over the past five monthsAt the same time Republicans arent going to let these facts stop him from being their nomineeIt turns out that party elites have less sway over the nominating process than many of us thought 12 months ago In particular I would say it turns out that the commercial rightofcenter mass media  especially Fox News and talk radio but also the Breitbart corner of the internet  is simply not that invested in what party elites think or want Trump is not liked by a majority of Americans but he is certainly a compelling television character and catering to the minority taste for Trumpism has proven to be an effective business strategyGiven his ability to attract copious quantities of free media and his personal wealth Trump can overcome the disadvantages of being disliked by the partys professional operative class and leverage his grassroots popularity to victoryVIDEO This is how much conservatives hate TrumpIf you want to understand whats going on with Trump I think you cant do much better than to look at this 2015 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute which reveals a huge partisan gap on a pretty basic question  is racism against white people a bigger problem than racism against racial minority groupsRepublicans said yes Democrats and independents said noThis is why Trumps Republican opponents havent made the obvious criticism of him that hes running a campaign based on racial demagogueryTo Republican primary voters its not obvious that racist demagoguery is a bad thing Or at a minimum it seems like a less pernicious thing than the apparently pervasive discrimination against white people in American societyTypically political parties try to emphasize hotbutton wedge issues where a majority of the public is on their side and deemphasize ones where they are in the minority On the question of racism Republicans are distinctly in the minority But party elites ability to prevent a campaign from being waged on this issue has been checked by Trump So hes going to be the nominee Not because hes an unstoppable juggernaut but because its going to take a Democrat to stop him
