CNN The State Department announced Friday that it will not release 22 emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because they contain top secret information the highest level of government classificationThe decision coming three days before the Iowa caucuses could provide fodder for Clintons political opponents especially Republicans who are likely to make note of the emails top secret designation Clintons email use has haunted her on the campaign trail since it became public early last year that she maintained a private server while leading the State DepartmentState Department spokesman John Kirby said the documents totaling 37 pages were not marked classified at the time they were sent but are being upgraded at the request of the Intelligence Community because they contain sensitive informationBut Kirby said a separate review by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and Research is being held into whether the information in the emails was classified at the time they were sent and received He would not say when the review began or how long it would go and acknowledged its possible there could be classified emails that werent marked as suchIts certainly possible that for any number of reasons traffic can be sent thats not marked appropriately for its classification That is certainly possible Kirby saidBut he added that he wasnt going to make any judgments about this particular caseAll I can tell you definitively is it wasnt marked classified at the time it was sent Kirby saidA senior State Department official said the review began very recently and was initiated by the State Department but the official wouldnt say what prompted itA spokesperson for the Intelligence Communitys inspector general declined to commentKirby also said 18 emails comprised of eight email chains between Clinton and President Barack Obama are being withheld in full to protect the Presidents ability to receive unvarnished advice and counsel But Kirby said they have not been determined to be classified and said they will ultimately be released in accordance with the Presidential records actId love for people to see what I did and I hope that will happen she saidBrian Fallon a spokesman for Clintons campaign said in a statement that Fridays announcement was a case of overclassification run amok and reiterated Clintons position that the emails be made publicBut later Friday Fallon declined to say whether Clinton would ask Obama to declassify the emails when pressed by CNNs Wolf Blitzer on The Situation RoomThe President easily could declassify all of these emails if she asked him and if he agreed right Blitzer askedId really be surprised if this has risen to the Presidents level Fallon replied Because again this a mundane matter of fulfilling a FOIA requestAsked Friday if he had certainty and confidence that Clinton will not be indicted over the email controversy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said any decision to prosecute Clinton would rest with the Justice DepartmentThat is a decision to be made solely by independent prosecutors Earnest said But again based on what we know from the Department of Justice it does not seem to be headed in that directionThe State Department released more than 900 of Clintons emails Friday  242 of which received classification upgrades 11 to secret and 209 more to confidential along with the 22 emails containing top secret information  but the release fell well behind the judgeimposed timetable for producing all of her emailsAmong the most interesting correspondenceThis months release was supposed to be the final one and include just over 9000 pages of documents  the largest number to dateThat delay was then compounded by a huge snowstorm that shut down the federal government for several days according to the State Departments motionSeveral prominent Republicans including presidential hopefuls quickly condemned Clinton the Democratic 2016 frontrunner over Fridays developmentsThe new email release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgment be our next president GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tweetedFlorida Sen Marco Rubio said Clintons email use was a disqualifier for the White HouseHillary Clinton put some of the highest most sensitive intelligence information on her private server because maybe she thinks shes above the law Rubio said at a town hall event in Clinton IowaTexas Sen Ted Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Clintons email controversy would seriously imperil her presidential aspirationsWe are talking about serious offenses for which the Obama Justice Department threw the book at General David Petraeus Cruz said And justice needs to be enforced fairly and impartiallyAnd Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted that Clinton and the Obama administration have obfuscated and misled at every available opportunity adding that she has removed all doubt that she cannot be trusted with the presidencyBut Rep Adam Schiff DCalifornia the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said classification determinations are often very complexIts important to remember that none of these emails had any classification markings at the time they were sent and Secretary Clinton and her staff were responding to world events in real time without the benefit of months of analysis after the fact Schiff saidMeanwhile Clintons top Democratic 2016 rival Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders said in a statement that there is a legal process in place which should proceed and not be politicizedThe American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails he said then to applause
