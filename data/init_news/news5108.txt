Since 1991 murder and violent crime have plummeted in the US But in a widely discussed oped in the Wall Street Journal titled The New Nationwide Crime Wave Heather Mac Donald recently made a startling claim Gun violence in particular is spiraling upward in cities across America She demonstrated this by citing murder rate increases in six citiesMurders of police were also surging out of control she said they had jumped 89 percent in 2014Last week Mac Donald the Thomas W Smith Fellow at New Yorks Manhattan Institute appeared on numerous TV channels including Fox News and CNN As is so common the claims have become exaggerated giving the impression that crime is on the rise all across the USFortunately thats all hype Mac Donald simply cherrypicked those places that had experienced rising crime rates Overall the 15 largest cities have actually experienced a slight decrease in murders There has been a 2 percent drop from the first five months of 2014 to the first five months of this year Murder rates rose in eight cities and fell in seven There is no nationwide murder waveMurder rates fell dramatically in some of these cities Comparing this years JanuarytoMay murder data with last years we find that San Joses murder rate fell by a whopping 59 percent Jacksonvilles fell by 31 percent Indianapolis by 28 percent San Antonios by 25 percent and Los Angeles by 15 percent Presumably we arent going to focus only on these cities and start claiming a national victory over crimeMac Donald is undoubtedly correct that something unusual is happening in Baltimore When comparing this May to last May arrests have plummeted by 50 percent murders have risen by 76 percent and overall violent crime is up by 15 percent This surely has something to do with police officers hesitation to stick their necks out Who can blame them when theyre being labeled as criminals for doing their jobsBut theres no evidence that what is happening in Baltimore is happening elsewhere Murder rates have indeed gone up in Milwaukee St Louis Chicago and Atlanta but higher murder rates alone dont mean a lack of effective law enforcementLast Thursday Mac Donald speculated in a New York Times piece that this years 15 percent increase in murders in New York City is due to a drop in arrests  arrests are down 174 percent through May 31 compared to the same period last year But just as likely part of the drop in arrests might be related to the overall drop in crime While murder rates rose the 55 percent drop in total violent crime and 75 percent decline in property crime are being ignoredThese declines suggest something is occurring that is more complicated than police simply being afraid to do their jobs After all why would police pulling back from their jobs cause more murders but fewer robberiesCrime goes up and down for all sorts of reasons It is too early to figure out why some cities are seeing more crime and others are seeing less Sheer randomness will always cause a few outliersPolice do a dangerous job and any dramatic increase in police killings would be horrible But the nationwide spike in police killings is not all that Mac Donald claims it is After averaging 55 police deaths per year for a decade the number of deaths fell to 27 in 2013 The number went back up to 51 in 2014 Though that was a large increase the unusual year was 2013 not 2014But the biggest problem with these last numbers is that unlike the crime numbers that compare periods clearly before and after the Ferguson effect and the Baltimore riots the spike in police killings occurred too early According to the Officer Down Memorial Page murders of police through May nationwide are down 38 percent this year compared to last year 16 versus 26With misleading claims by left wing groups such as ProPublica claiming that police are shooting young black males at much higher rates than young white males it was probably only a matter of time before some conservatives like Mac Donald made their own misleading claimsFortunately there has been no nationwide spike in murders or police killings so far this year If there is a nationwide Ferguson effect the data dont show it Cherrypicking half a dozen of the worst crime numbers from the largest cities might scare people and get massive media attention but it doesnt tell us anything about policyJohn R Lott Jr is a columnist forFoxNewscom He is an economist and was formerly chief economist at the United States Sentencing Commission Lott is also a leading expert on guns and opeds on that issue are done in conjunction with the Crime Prevention Research Center He is the author of nine books including More Guns Less Crime His latest book is The War on Guns Arming Yourself Against Gun Control Lies August 1 2016 Follow him on Twitterjohnrlottjr
