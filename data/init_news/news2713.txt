As numerous surveys have revealed Fox News may be the mostwatched cable news channel but its viewers are older than those of its competitors though to be fair the competitions viewers are pretty old too and its most devoted ones are consistently conservative Rutenbergs piece raised the possibility that Kelly might be able to attract younger and more ideologically diverse viewers especially independents who watch Fox from time to time but are not regularsThe magazines cover went so far as to suggest that Kellys style and departures from conservative orthodoxy might even make her appealing to  readers of the New York Times That appeal such as it is seems likely to have been undercut in recent weeks by Kellys bafflingly out of touch interview of the Duggars and her resort to the tired racially coded not exactly a saint to describe the teenage girl knocked down by a cop in McKinney TexasThese departures from orthodoxy have become legendary among close followers of the media and have earned her praise from a variety of figures outside the conservative movement Rutenberg calls them Megyn moments occasions when she asks a conservative guest nearly always an older white man a sharp question that doesnt necessarily fit within the conservative worldviewRutenbergs argument struck me as dubious While conducting research for my book on the history of TV news I watched lots and lots of old segments and programs including many from Fox News Im pretty familiar with Bill OReilly Sean Hannity Shepard Smith and the rest of the Fox crew including its regular punditsBut I hadnt seen that much of Kelly Could Ailes really be moving away from his successful formula of pandering to Foxs conservative base By watching Kellys program could I learn about important subjects unreported by the Times and the other mainstream media that I follow Or perhaps acquire new and useful perspectives on things that I thought I understoodTo find out I watched The Kelly File nearly day every from early March through the first week of May I saw her report on everything from the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program to the controversy over Hillary Clintons use of a private email account and watched her interviews with Republican presidential aspirants and her coverage of the riots in Baltimore in the wake of Freddie Grays death But in the end I wasnt impressed  and not because Kelly is a conservative and her program trumpets conservative points of view The problem is that she is a conventional Fox News television anchor and Fox News isnt about nuance or complexity the things I look for in news reporting and analysisIts true that she is less doctrinaire than Hannity And she can occasionally ask good questions  though mostly its her prosecutorial style rather than the question itself that it is noteworthy Watching her regularly however made me realize that shes merely a slightly different version of OReilly  shes a smart engaging television personality whose reports reaffirm the conservative ideology of most of her viewersKellys biggest attribute is her personality Shes intelligent downtoearth and can poke fun at herself as well as at her guests And no doubt much to Ailess delight she has developed a very effective broadcasting style Her husky voice quick wit and experience as a lawyer give her an admirable air of authority In the peculiar style favored by FNC producers she evokes a still glamorous excheerleader She is also a superb performer never losing her cool or command of her program Shes wellsuited for television journalism and in another era would likely have been a big star for the networksSadly however she works for Fox News a purveyor of a kind of television journalism that has become the norm for cable news even among channels that eschew its conservatism That means covering only a few stories usually the ones most likely to appeal to their target audience and following them very closely over the course of the broadcast day sometimes through live reports from the field but mostly by allowing assorted guests to opine and pontificate about them At Fox News and MSNBC anchors routinely join in the pontificating and these breaks with oldschool journalistic practice are part of their appeal It makes them seem real and as Ailes recognized long ago most viewers of TV news prefer this to the detachment displayed by journalists at the major networks and CNN And Fox at least has the ratings to prove it Kelly is most certainly real and she opines and pontificates no less than OReilly and Hannity This is why she is popular with Fox News viewers who expect this from their primetime anchors in particular But I doubt it will appeal to very many real independents as opposed to people with largely conservative beliefs who like to think they are independents or readers of the Times And this isnt just because The Kelly File covers so few stories or because Kelly expresses her opinions about so many things The same can be said about Rachel Maddow Its because Kellys program isnt very informative even when she devotes attention to stories given short shrift by other news outlets With a handful of exceptions  usually compelling breaking news stories like the tragic Germanwings airline crash  every story Kelly and her producers select is predictable And rather than exploring their complexity Kelly and her guests dumb them down so that everything fits neatly into their viewers worldview I was shocked at how few subjects sources and points of view The Kelly File presents and by her almost ritualistic recourse to the same old conservative clichs and talking points during discussion and analysis even when more interesting and complicated angles virtually begged to be examined As on The OReilly Factor the role played by liberal guests is to be flayed by the host and her allies Often this is easy because such guests are academics or policy wonks unaccustomed to talking in sound bites sometimes their statements are so out of touch with reality that they almost invite ridicule Even those famous Megyn moments are too few for my liking And they always are followed by gracious and supportive remarks that demonstrate to viewers that Kelly is on the side of the good guys Watching Kelly reminded me of what I learned while researching my book  that Fox News particularly during prime time really isnt in the news business Its in the entertainment business To a certain degree this is true of most all television news But in FNCs case there is a difference Fox News core audience is more than just a particular slice of the larger consumer marketplace Its a group of people with firm convictions and a coherent ideological worldview  not unlike orthodox Marxists back in the early 1900s And part of what Fox does is make this worldview seem even more coherent  and impervious to information that might undermine or contradict it Thats actually what its viewers want and from the start Ailes and FNC have eagerly given it to them Im sure Ailes would like to expand FNCs audience and win over viewers whose views are less doctrinaire This would be good business and Ailes is a brilliant businessman But I cant see this happening without him alienating his most loyal viewers who prefer every story and virtually every fact filtered through the lens of ideology At least in present form The Kelly File isnt going to do this despite Kellys undeniable appeal as a broadcaster
