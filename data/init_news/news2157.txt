Over the last six years the Obama administration has been trying to address global warmingwith a flurry of rules aimed at reducing US carbondioxide emissions First there were stricter fueleconomy standards for cars and trucks More recently the EPAproposed sweeping carbon regulations for coalfired power plants known as the Clean Power PlanThe overarching goal was to cut US greenhousegas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 That the administration believed would help advance global climate talksBut all of Obamas moves so farhave been insufficient to get to that 17 percent cut by 2020 As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Forcehave argued the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get thereCarbondioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming But its not the only one Theres alsomethaneThe US burns a lot of methane  known as natural gas  for energy But when methane leaks out of oil and gas wells or pipelines and into the atmosphere it acts as a potent greenhouse gas The White House says its 25 times as effective at trapping heat as carbon dioxide Other scientists say 34 timesIn 2012 the EPA estimated that methane accounted for roughly87 percent of US greenhousegas emissions though this may be anunderestimate But experts have warned that methane leaks could be poised to grow in the coming yearsThanks to thefracking boom US energy companies have been extracting more and more natural gas from shale formations On one level thats good news for climate change utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal which means lower carbondioxide emissions from power plantsThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air  and those leaksare undermining the climate benefits of the gas boomIn theory it should be doable to plug these methane emissionswhich can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations Many companies alreadyuse infrared cameras to detect leaks and plug them And they have financial incentives to do so  after all these companies would rather capture that methane and sell it for money than just have it float off into the airMany oil and gas companies are already taking steps to detect and plug leaksStill the White House wants to make sure these leaks really get plugged So on Wednesday itannounced a goal of cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025This would be done through a combination of guidelines for voluntary actions by the industry and a hodgepodge of new regulationscrafted by the EPA and other agencies Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public landsThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures Nevertheless it added emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower themSome environmental groups said the White Houses plan didnt go far enough For example the EPA is currently only working on rules to reduce emissions at new oil and gas wells  and only much later will they work on rules forexisting wells which are by far the biggest source of emissionsWhile setting methane standards for the first time is an important step failing to immediately regulate existing oil and gas equipment nationwide misses 90 of the methane pollution from the industry Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force said in a statementJayni Hein policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU School of Law agreed EPAs steps announced today would trim the sectors methane releases by about a third We can and should go farther by regulating existing oil and natural gas sourcesBy contrast many oil and gas companies dont want new regulations at all  they argue that the industry is already curbing methane leaks as isEmissions will continue to fall as operators innovate and find new ways to capture and deliver more methane to consumers said Jack Gerard head of the American Petroleum Institute in a statement Existing EPA and state regulations are working Another layer of burdensome requirements could actually slow down industry progress to reduce methane emissionsMeanwhile its worth noting that there are other sources of methane besides oil and gas In 2012according to the EPA roughly 30 percent of methane in the United States came from naturalgas and petroleum operations though again that may be an undercountObama is relying on voluntary measures for methane in agriculture By contrast36 percent of USmethane emissions came from agriculture The beef and dairy industry is a major contributor here when cows belch they produce methane known as enteric fermentation Other sources include decomposing cow manure as well as methane from rice cultivation Another18 percent came from landfills When food and other trash decays in a landfill the organisms that feed on that trash emit methane into the atmosphereThe Obama administrationhas been working on steps to cut methane in these areas too Back in March the EPA announced it would come up with standards to reduce methane from all future landfills It will then solicit public comments on whether to regulate landfills that have already been builtAs for cow burps however the administration is relying on purely voluntary measures for now In June 2014 the EPA unveiled a partnership with the dairy industry to speed up the adoption of methane digesters that turn cow dung into energy The hope is to reduce methane emissions from the dairy sector 25 percent by 2020Further reading Obama has promised to cut US emissions 17 by 2020 Is that still possible
