Tensions between the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu escalated Wednesday as top administration officials condemned the Israeli prime ministers plan to address Congress next week and Netanyahu accused six world powers including the United States of giving up on their commitment to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weaponThe unusually public spat marked one of the lowest points in a relationship that has long bonded the two countries Although the new round of recriminations reflected the frosty personal relations between President Obama and Netanyahu it came at a critical juncture in multilateral talks designed to prevent Iran from using a civilian program to develop a nuclear weaponThe prime minister has said the unfolding deal  to which Iran has not yet agreed  could pose an existential threat to the Jewish state Obama however considers a deal a potential legacy that could ease nuclear tensions lift trade restrictions on Iran and alter the regions strategic calculusCongressional Democrats have been caught in the middle of the dispute On Wednesday Sen Timothy M Kaine DVa became the fourth senator to say he would skip Netanyahus speech calling its timing highly inappropriate Several members of the House also have said they will boycott the speechThe latest volley of highlevel criticism began when national security adviser Susan E Rice appearing Tuesday night on Charlie Rose condemned Netanyahus decision to accept the invitation of House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio to appear at a joint meeting of Congress shortly before Israels electionsBy bypassing the White House dealing only with GOP leaders and scheduling the speech just before Israelis vote Netanyahu had injected a degree of partisanship which is not only unfortunate Rice said I think its destructive of the fabric of the relationshipAt a Likud political convention in the Maale Adumim settlement just east of Jerusalem Netanyahu fired back I respect the White House and the president of the United States but on such a critical topic that could determine whether we exist or not it is my duty to do everything to prevent this great danger to the state of Israel he saidCongress could play a critical role in the Iran talks It is weighing whether to add new sanctions to the current onesThe existing sanctions and those adopted by the European Union are widely viewed as having helped push Iran to the bargaining tableBut Obama has vowed to veto any new sanctions and has urged Congress to wait at least a month for the outcome of the negotiations Obama has said that if the talks fail he will move to tighten economic restrictionsSecretary of State John F Kerry defended the administrations negotiations in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee  and took a swipe at NetanyahuIll tell you Israel is safer today with the added time we have given and the stoppage of the advances of the Iranian nuclear program than before Kerry said Referring to the accord that eased sanctions slightly while negotiations took place he said We got that agreement  which by the way the prime minister opposed He was wrong And today hes saying we should be extending that interim agreementNo love has been lost between Obama and NetanyahuThis is clearly the most dysfunctional relationship between an American and Israeli leader said Aaron David Miller a vice president at the Wilson Center and a former US negotiator and adviser in Republican and Democratic administrations Moreover he said the durability is troublingHe said that earlier tensions preceded incremental peace accords but that Obama and Netanyahu remain far apart on basic issues and that Kerrys efforts to bring Israel and Palestinians together failedNow their personal tensions have put Democratic lawmakers in awkward positions that threaten bipartisanship when it comes to IsraelDemocrats have been wrestling over whether to boycott the speech as senior Obama administration officials plan to do This will be the third time Netanyahu has addressed the full Congress tying Winston Churchills recordBecause Netanyahu did not arrange his visit through the White House Obama has said that he will not meet with him and Vice President Biden has made plans to travel abroadThis puts Democrats in a position where they have to choose between their support for Israel and their Democratic president  and do it in a very visible way said Martin Indyk a vice president at the Brookings Institution and a former US ambassador to IsraelThere is no reason to schedule this speech before Israeli voters go to the polls on March 17 and choose their own leadership Kaine said in a statement Wednesday I am disappointed that as of now the speech has not been postponed For this reason I will not attend the speechKaine will join Senate colleagues Patrick J Leahy DVt Bernard Sanders IVt and Brian Schatz DHawaii in skipping the addressAccording to an unofficial estimate by one Senate Democrat about 30 members of that caucus are expected to attend the speech and nearly 15 others are still deciding whether to boycott One such Democrat is Sen Chris Murphy DConn a freshman who serves on the Foreign Relations CommitteeIts really offensive but I think its a protocol breach not a policy break he saidGenerally an ally of Israel Murphy said his biggest concern was the spectacle occurring so close to the Israeli elections I dont want to be part of a campaign speech he said It makes the whole thing look more politicsbasedThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC which said it didnt know about Netanyahus plans ahead of time said lawmakers should put aside the protocol issues and listen to the prime ministers message on the Iran talksNetanyahu was invited by Sens Dianne Feinstein DCalif and Richard J Durbin DIll to attend a separate event with Democratic lawmakers but he declined In a letter he said that it could compound the misperception of partisanship regarding my upcoming visitSen Orrin G Hatch RUtah said Its unseemly what the Democrats have done to try and make this a political issue I think the president has acted like an oaf an oaf Oaf  I dont even want to get into it Im just madMeanwhile leaked details about Iran nuclear negotiations have made many lawmakers more interested in what Netanyahu has to sayI think his voice will resonate more credibly if thats the deal thats in the making said Abraham Foxman national director of the AntiDefamation League Both the president and prime minister share the goal of preventing Iran from going nuclear How to get there is what separates them Foxman initially called Netanyahus speech illadvised but now says he will attendSen Jack Reed DRI one of Obamas strongest allies on the Hill plans to attend Netanyahus speech Im interested in what the prime minister is going to say Reed said I think its already been made an unnecessarily complicated political issue but there is still this need to learn as much as we can about the situationMany will hear Netanyahu on Monday when he addresses the annual AIPAC convention AIPAC expects 16000 people to attend including about 50 lawmakersKatie
