agreement is implemented Irans breakout time goes from two to three months to one year or moreKerry also said the deal Allows Iran to enrich uranium but to no more than 367 percent which is needed for civilian purposes but is much lower than whats needed for a weapon Iran has agreed to turn its Fordow facility which is essentially an underground bunker into a research facility where Iranian and world scientists will work side by side The Arak heavywater reactor which could have been capable of starting production on weaponsgrade plutonium will be rebuilt using a design approved by the international community That design will make the production of weaponsgrade plutonium impossible Kerry saidUpdate at 717 am ET An Opportunity For A New DirectionIn a speech from the White House

twothirds of Irans centrifuges includes a commitment from Iran not to use its advance centrifuges for a decade and limits Irans stockpile of enriched uranium and weaponsgrade plutonium for 15 yearsThe deal also gives international inspectors what Obama said was 247 access to Irans nuclear facilitiesThat means this deal is not built on trust it is built on verification Obama saidNot having a deal

problem can be solved peacefully Obama saidThe president said his administration would brief Congress on all the details of the deal but he warned that it would irresponsible to walk away from this
