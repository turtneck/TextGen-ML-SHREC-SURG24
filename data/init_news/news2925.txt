With nine weeks until Election Day Donald Trump is within striking distance in the Upper Midwest but Hillary Clintons strength in many battlegrounds and some traditional Republican strongholds gives her a big electoral college advantage according to a 50state Washington PostSurveyMonkey pollThe survey of all 50 states is the largest sample ever undertaken by The Post which joined with SurveyMonkey and its online polling resources to produce the results The statebystate numbers are based on responses from more than 74000 registered voters during the period of Aug 9 to Sept 1 The individual state samples vary in size from about 550 to more than 5000 allowing greater opportunities than typical surveys to look at different groups within the population and compare them from state to stateHow the PostSurveyMonkey poll was conductedThe massive survey highlights a critical weakness in Trumps candidacy  an unprecedented deficit for a Republican among collegeeducated white voters especially women White college graduates have been loyal Republican voters in recent elections but Trump is behind Clinton with this group across much of the country including in some solidly red statesThe 50state findings come at a time when the average national margin between Clinton and Trump has narrowed What once was a Clinton lead nationally of eight to 10 points shortly after the party conventions ended a month ago is now about four points according to the RealClearPolitics polling average A number of battleground states also have tightened according to surveys released from other organizations in recent daysThe PostSurveyMonkey results are consistent with many of those findings but not in all cases Trumps support in the Midwest where the electorates are generally older and whiter appears stronger and offers the possibility of gains in places Democrats carried recently He has small edges in two expected battlegrounds  Ohio and Iowa  and is close in Wisconsin Pennsylvania and Michigan each of which Democrats have won in six consecutive electionsAt the same time however Trump is struggling in places Republicans have won consistently and that he must hold to have any hope of winning These states include Arizona and Georgia as well as Texas  the biggest surprise in the 50state results The Texas results which are based on a sample of more than 5000 people show a dead heat with Clinton ahead by one percentage pointClinton also leads by fewer than four points in Colorado and Florida and is tied with Trump in North Carolina In Colorado other polls have shown a larger Clinton lead In Mississippi Trumps lead is just two points though its doubtful that the GOP nominee is in much danger thereIn a twoway competition between the majorparty candidates Clinton leads by four points or more in 20 states plus the District of Columbia Together they add up to 244electoral votes 26 shy of the 270 needed to winTrump leads by at least four points in 20 states as well but those add up to just 126electoral votes In the 10 remaining states which hold 168 electoral votes neither candidate has a lead of four percentage points or betterA series of fourway ballot tests that include Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein project a somewhat narrower Clinton advantage with more states showing margins of fewer than four points between the two majorparty candidates But even here at the Labor Day weekend turn toward the Nov8 balloting the pressure is on Trump to make up even more ground than he has in recent weeks if he hopes to win the White HouseThe poll finds Johnson is poised to garner significant support He is currently receiving at least 15percent support in 15states The libertarians support peaks at 25percent in New Mexico where he served two terms as governor He is only four points shy of Trumps 29percent standing there His support in Utah is 23percent and in Colorado and Iowa it is 16 percent Stein has less support in the poll peaking at 10percent in Vermont and receiving at least 7percent support in 10 statesOverall the results reflect Trumps strategy of maximizing support in older whiter Midwestern states where his antifreetrade message and appeals to national identity generally find more fertile groundBut his struggles elsewhere including places that have long supported Republicans illustrate the challenges of that strategy in more diverse states where his stances on immigration and some other positions have turned off Democrats independents and many RepublicansTo win the election Trump must quickly consolidate the Republican vote With prominent Republicans declaring they will not support Trump and some even announcing they will back Clinton this represents a major challenge for the GOP nominee In the PostSurveyMonkey poll Clinton is winning 90percent or more of the Democratic vote in 32states while Trump is at or above that level in just 13As expected the ClintonTrump contest has split the electorate along racial lines Their bases of support are mirror images On average Clinton does 31points better among nonwhite voters than whites and Trump does 31points better among white voters than nonwhitesThe electorate is also divided along lines of gender and education in many cases to a greater extent than in recent elections Averaging across all 50 states Clinton does 14points better among women than men and Trump does 16points better among men than women Clinton is winning among women in 34states and shes close in six others Trump leads among men in 38states is tied in six and trails in the other sixIt is among collegeeducated voters however where Trump faces his biggest hurdle In 2012 white voters with college degrees supported Republican nominee Mitt Romney over President Obama by 5642 percent Romney won with 59percent among white men with college degrees and with 52percent among white women with college degreesSo far in this campaign Clinton has dramatically changed that equation Among white college graduates Clinton leads Trump in 31 of the 50states and the two are about even in six others Trump leads among collegeeducated whites in just 13 states all safe Republican states in recent electionsAcross 49 states where the poll interviewed at least 100 white collegeeducated women Clinton leads Trump with this group in 38states and by doubledigit margins in 37 Averaging across all states Clinton leads by 23points among white women with college degreesTrumps base among white voters without a college degree remains strong and substantial He leads Clinton in 43 of the 50 states and the two are roughly even in five others She leads among white voters without a college degree in just one state VermontOverall Clinton does 19points better among white college graduates than whites without degrees while Trump does 18points better among whites without degrees than whites with college educations on averageTrumps challenge in the states that remain close will be to produce significant turnout among white noncollege voters to offset those Clinton margins but its far from clear that there are enough of them to be decisive Absent that the GOP nominee must find a way to appeal to these collegeeducated voters during the final weeks of the campaignTrumps strength across some of the states in the Midwest is one potential bright spot for the Republican nominee Clintons biggest lead among the contested states in that region is in Pennsylvania where her margin is just four points In Wisconsin and Michigan she leads by a nominal two points while Trump leads by four points in Iowa and threepoints in OhioRecent polls by other organizations have indicated that Wisconsin has tightened over the past month A recent Suffolk University poll in Michigan shows Clinton leading by sevenpoints and the RealClearPolitics average in Ohio shows Clinton ahead by three points Overall among the quintet of Ohio Michigan Wisconsin Iowa and Pennsylvania Michigan has been the Democrats most reliable of the group always one of the 15 bestperforming Democratic states over the past five electionsThe Rocky Mountain West is another area of fierce competition The PostSurveyMonkey poll shows Colorado closer than other polls there with Clinton leading by just two points and the race tied when Johnson and Stein are included Meanwhile Clinton and Trump are roughly even in Arizona In Nevada Clinton enjoys a lead of fivepoints in headtohead competition with Trump but by just threepoints in a fourway testOf all the states Texas provided the most unexpected result The Lone Star State has been a conservative Republican bastion for the past four decades In 2012 President Obama lost the state by 16points For Democrats it has been among the 10to15 worstperforming states in the past four electionsThe PostSurveyMonkey poll of Texas shows a dead heat with Clinton at 46percent and Trump at 45percent Democrats have long claimed that changing demographics would make the state competitive in national elections but probably not for several more cyclesA comparison of the current survey with the 2008 Texas exit poll there was no exit poll there in 2012 points to reasons the race appears close right now Trump is performing worse than 2008 GOP nominee John McCain among both whites and Hispanics while Clinton is doing slightly better than ObamaAmong men Trump is doing slightly worse than McCain did eight years ago The bigger difference is among women McCain won a narrow majority of women in Texas while Trump is currently below 40percent Thats not to say Texas is turning blue in 2016 Given its history it probably will back Trump in November and possibly by a comfortable margin But at this stage the fact that it is close at all is one more surprise in a surprising year
