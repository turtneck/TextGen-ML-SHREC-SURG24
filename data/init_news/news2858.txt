Ask Holly Whats everyones problem 271016 Dear Holly Apparently hardly anyone wants to listen to me on the radio even though I work so hard discussing pointless drivel with myself for hours on end interspersed with souldestroying tracks by Coldplay and Michael Buble Whats everyones problem Chris London Dear Chris My dads had a great idea for Channel 4s new direction with BakeOff Instead of all this old lady nonsense about Victoria sponges and gingham and witty lesbians the new version should be called The Great British ManOff and itll be a load of competitive middle aged blokes being bawdy and doing manly stuff like resealing the bath and shouting at the radio and getting frustrated with tools Everyone on the show will be worried about going bald and every episode will end with an embarrassing scuffle in a pub car park Hope that helps
