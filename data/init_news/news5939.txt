Now the sales pitch is over The Supreme Court will rule this month inKing v Burwell The lawsuitwill determine whether the Obama administration has the legal authority to dole out billions in tax subsidies toObamacare enrolleesUnlike the last time conservatives took Obamacare to the Supreme Court  when the Republican party major activists and 26 attorneys general joined forces  the new challenge has a more surprising backstory for a big case It is the result of the key players working loosely overcoming lawsuit fatigue in conservative circles pushing an argument that seems more technical than substantive and even a bit of luckI think people imagine a eureka moment It was nothing like thatThere is nothing very organized about it Michael Greve a law professor at George Mason University who supports the case haswritten The litigation has no single mastermind or man behind the curtain The campaign is the product of a loose conservativelibertarian infrastructureThe case now sits with the Supreme Court despite the unusual route it took So while supporters might have viewed it as a nonsense legal challenge  never taking it as seriously as the individual mandate case  they still find themselves back where they were three years ago fearing that the law could fall apart with just one court decisionTom Christina did not want to take on the Affordable Care ActA former Reaganadministration official turned corporate lawyer Christina is part of the 36person employeebenefits practice at the law firm Ogletree Deakins When Congress began to pursue health reform his firm decided that somebody ought to read the actual bill Christina got the assignmentSomeone had to follow the Act in case it got passed he told me in a recent interview I was volunteered for that jobSo Christina read the law And ata poorly attended conference at the American Enterprise Institute in December 2010 he spoke about his findings No one cared too muchThe conference was aimed at finding new ways to challenge the healthcare law There was a thennascent challenge to the individual mandate winding its way through district courts that looked promising Conservatives were still hungry to hedge their bets and find other ways to bring down Obamacare if the individualmandate argument failed as it ultimately didThe bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene Greve then the director of the federalism project at the American Enterprise Institute declared at the panel I do not care how this is done whether its dismembered whether we drive a stake through its heart whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town or if we strangle it I dont care who does it whether its some court someplace or the United States Congress any which way any dollar spent on that goal is worth spendingWhere Greve spoke in bold declarations Christina gravitated towards more subdued legalese When he dropped a bombshell in the form of a darkblue PowerPoint slide none of the attending wonks actually seemed to noticeThe slide pointed out that the section of Obamacare that explained how tax credits work  Section 1401a2 to be exact  specified that the financial help would go to those who purchased coverage on an exchange established by the state There was no similar provision or call out for people who got their coverage on a marketplace that the federal government set upI noticed something peculiar about the tax credits There will be no tax credits for tax payers who live in noncapitulating states Christina told the audienceLooking back on that presentation Christina says he really didnt think much at the time about what this would mean for the healthcare lawI think people imagine a eureka moment says Christina It was nothing like that I was assigned to do this for my firmThe Affordable Care Act did not follow the normal procedure when it became law Normally one chamber passes its own version of a bill The other chamber passes a separate version The two bodies hold a conference where they reconcile any differences between the two bills and generally clean up the language and tighten the statute The merged bill goes back to both chambers which vote againThis did not happen with the Affordable Care Act As anyone who covered it at the time  as I did working as a reporter for Newsweek  remembers the laws passage was an absolute mess Sen Ted Kennedys death in December 2010 lost the Democrats their supermajority in the Senate  and meant that the health law wouldnt survive a second vote in the SenateDemocrats were forced to stick with the Senate bill they had already passed anything they sent back to the chamber for another vote would inevitably fail A final conference never happened All the messy language and loose ends that legislators expected to get ironed out simply became part of the lawDuring the days and nights I spent on Capitol Hill covering the debate the idea of not offering subsidies to some enrollees just never came up Staff who worked on the law say they always intended for all Obamacare enrollees to get healthinsurance subsidies the law simply wouldnt make sense without themThe evidence of congressional intent here is overwhelming John McDonough who worked on the Health Education Labor  Pensions committee during the healthreform debate wrote in an email There is not a scintilla of evidence that the Democratic lawmakers who designed the law intended to deny subsidies to any state regardless of exchange statusAs for the language that Christina highlighted they see that as evidence of the health laws rushed passage Nobody corrected the types of drafting errors that a conference committee would typically addressAt the end of the day this should have never happened and is a product of the rushed way the law was passed says Chris Condeluci who worked as tax and benefits counsel for the Senate Finance Committees Republicans during the Affordable Care Act debateJon Adler cant remember exactly when he came across Tom Christinas presentation Sometime in late 2010 or 2011 he thinks Adler a Case Western University law professor was preparing to present at a University of Kansas conference on the healthcare law and was searching online for what others had said on the issueHe listened to the audio from Christinas presentation while driving and later clicked through the slides Adler included the point about the subsidies in his February 2011 talk It was something I highlighted in my presentation Adler says No one seemed particularly disturbed by itAdler wasnt particularly disturbed by it either like Christina he thought it was an interesting snafu in the law but not much more He happened to mention the issue to Michael Cannon the longtime healthpolicy director at the libertarian Cato Institute over email a few months laterNeither Adler nor Cannon could recall what exactly theyd been emailing about in the first place Adler didnt care much about health policy his expertise was in law But he knew that Cannon had spent the past few years testifying before state legislatures about why they shouldnt implement Obamacare So Adler mentioned one more argument he could add to his presentationHe had been talking about how states shouldnt cooperate And I responded to him with something like If they dont create an exchange they cant get the tax credits Adler recalls He said What And I told him Read the statuteI dont think Jonathan understood the significance of the feature when he told me maybe because he wasnt a healthcare wonk who talked about threelegged stools all the time Cannon saysCannon did hes a health wonk who knew immediately that taking away subsidies would leave Obamacare with a giant holeWhat I recognized was that this allowed states to block one of the three legs of Obamacares threelegged stool the subsidies he says And they could do so in a way that would increase pressure on Congress to reopen the law So I started adding that into my list of reasons states shouldnt establish exchangesThere wasnt much that Cannon and Adler could do with their discovery at that point The federal government still hadnt published the rules governing how the insurance subsidies would work it was still possible that the Obama administration might come out and agree with them saying state exchanges were the only bodies authorized to dole out fundsThe Obama administration eliminated that possibility in May 2012 as everyone expected they issued final rules stipulating that all exchanges both those administered federally and those administered by states could provide shoppers with helpThe search for a plaintiff to challenge the rule was officially onOver the past three years Cannon and Adlers argument against Obamacare has evolved significantlyFor about two years they and other challengers made a purely textualist argument The healthcare law says in plain language that the government can only give financial help to those buying coverage in an exchange established by the statePut aside Congress cries that they meant for any healthlaw enrollee to get subsides this argument goes The government has to live with the language in the law that it passed  and it says that subsidies only go to those enrolled in statebased exchangesCannon and Adler initially thought this way too They wrote a Wall Street Journal oped calling it a glitchBut their argument changed in 2012 Cannon and his research assistant spent months pouring over every mention of the word exchange in the Congressional record of the healthlaw debate Cannon still keeps a thick black binder with the whole thing in his officeThe argument against Obamacare has evolved from one about a glitch to one over Congressional intentThat effort Cannon says convinced him Congress expressly intended to use insurance subsidies as a way to entice states into building insurance marketplacesIf you look at the taxcredit eligibility rules they are very tightly worded Cannon says Its not in one place but in two places it says that the credits are only available through an Exchange established by the StateThis is where I and others who followed the legislative debate over Obamacare have trouble sticking with Cannons version of the events I covered the drafting of the health law in detail and in every conversation I ever had with anyone involved they always believed that Congress meant for every state to have subsidiesThe whole point of the federal exchanges after all was to make sure Obamacare worked in states that wouldnt or couldnt build an exchange of their own Congress always meant for residents of all 50 states to have access to financial help It was never a question during the five years Ive spent writing about Obamacare whether this would be the caseThis is where judges too have found the challengers case to be weak It is clear Judge Roger Gregory wrote in the Fourth Circuit decision against the plaintiffs that widely available tax credits are essential to fulfilling the Acts primary goals and that Congress was aware of their importance when drafting the billSome King supporters are skeptical of Cannons argument too They question whether their efforts are best spent attempting to divine thoughts legislators had five years agoI dont think you have to get into that Its really quite beside the point says Jim Blumstein a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has previously worked on healthlaw litigation He says that in discussions with some of the King litigants hes pushed hard for a focus to be on what the law actually says The intent is not criticalFinding a major flaw in the healthcare law was only half the battle for conservatives They also had to find a plaintiff  someone who the law had harmed who could bring a lawsuit against itThe search for a new Obamacare challenger initially went quite poorly The individual mandate case had failed earlier that summer and among conservatives there was lawsuit fatigue There was no appetite for a lawsuit that appeared to hinge on a drafting errorCannon badgered a halfdozen governors and attorneys general to take the case especially those who had worked on the individual mandate Hes an energetic speaker with a quick wit and an appetite for a long fight For much of 2011 and 2012 he was crisscrossing the country to testify before state legislatures shortly after the birth of his twin daughters he did switch to doing some testimony via video chat Whether in Missouri or Maryland Cannon was turning up at governors doorsteps across the country urging them that they should not in any circumstances help the federal government implement ObamacareNow Cannon had a way that he thought Republicans could in fact halt Obamacare with a new lawsuit The problem was none of them believed himI couldnt interest Ken Cuccinelli or Pam Bondi Cannon says I think I mentioned it to Paul LePage I spoke with Rick Scott and he said he was interested but never did anything Phil Bryant seemed excited but no follow throughNothing worked until Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt became interested He had like many other Republican attorneys general filed a challenge to the health laws individual mandate It was still pending at a district court when the Supreme Court ruled that part of the law constitutionalThe judge gave Pruitt a choice he could drop the suit given the Supreme Court ruling or he could amend his complaint to challenge a different part of the law Pruitt chose the latter On September 9 2012  two years after the AEI presentation and three months after the Supreme Court ruling  his was the first lawsuit to challenge the legality of Obamacares insurance subsidiesInitially conservative healthpolicy experts hoped that the Oklahoma lawsuit would include private citizens challenging the healthcare law alongside the government But the state couldnt scrounge up additional plaintiffs before the deadline to amend its case and ultimately went it aloneThis is part of the reason that six months later on May 2 2013 a separate lawsuit arrived in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Halbig v Burwell The Competitive Enterprise Institute a Washingtonbased think tank had financed the lawsuit and recruited a plaintiff Jacqueline Halbig von Schleppenbach a former Bush administration official turned consultant for the caseThe newly filed lawsuit moved slowly It irked Mike Carvin the lawyer on the suit enough that he sent the district courts chief justice Royce Lamberth a letter asking him to reassign the case to one his colleaguesSo Carvin filed yet another lawsuit in Virginia King v Burwell on September 16 2013 Eventually one of them had to moveThe initial rulings in King and Halbig did not go well for Carvin in early 2014 he lost both district court challenges District of Columbia Judge Paul Friedman described the plaintiffs arguments as unpersuasive The Virginia judge who ruled in King said the challengers had no direct support in the legislative history of the ACA for Plaintiffs theory that Congress intended to condition federal funds on state participationCarvin appealed both decisions And on July 22 the subsidies argument got its first positive news In the span of two hours  and by pure coincidence  the appeals courts for the District of Columbia and the Fourth Circuit issued conflicting rulings The DC Court ruled against Obamacares subsidies the Fourth Circuit ruled for themThis was already a good day for the healthcare law challengers The circuit split gave Supreme Court a stronger reason to step in and resolve the conflict CEI organized an impromptu celebration in its downtown Washington offices for that afternoonAs CEIs general counsel Sam Kazman was heading to the party a coworker pulled him aside On his computer he played a video of MIT economist and former White House consultant Jon Gruber essentially making their main legal argumentIf youre a state and you dont set up an Exchange that means your citizens dont get their tax credits Gruber says in the video taped at a 2012 speaking appearanceGruber has disavowed the remarks saying that he spoke off the cuff and made a mistake Theres reason to believe him Gruber spoke regularly to dozens of reporters during this period and never mentioned this idea to any of them So these comments are at odds with the bulk of his work on this issueBut in the video footage Gruber appeared to be providing at least in part the evidence the Virginia judge said the challengers lacked proof that Congress  or at least an outside advisor who worked with Congress  did intend to condition federal funds on state participationIt was a holy shit moment Kazman says We quickly put it up on our website It went viral overnight and was the subject of a question at a White House press conference the next dayThe Supreme Court agreed to hear King v Burwell on November 7 2014 Oral arguments occurred on March 4 and a decision is expected in JuneThe government has so far won three of the five court decisions on the subsidies issue Court watchersthought the oral arguments went well for the administrationThe governments argument has remained consistent throughout the process of course Congress meant for all 50 states to have subsidies If the legislative language is unclear on whether that is the case then the judicial system ought to give deference to the executive branch in interpreting the lawDuring the time the Act was under consideration no Member of Congress ever suggested that tax credits would be available only in States that established their own Exchangeseven though the language on which petitioners rely was in draft bills for months before the Act was enacted the government writes in its Supreme Court brief Any such suggestion would have produced a firestorm of controversy but there was noneIve talked to about a dozen legal experts who have followed this case the closest Some of them agree with the challengers arguments others dont But none of them are writing off the case as a superficial challenge to the Affordable Care Act A slim majority told me that if they had to place a bet they would expect the Supreme Court to rule against the Affordable Care ActYes they say the Supreme Court did save the Affordable Care Act three years ago by upholding the individual mandate But the legal issues then were about the laws fundamental constitutionality If the court had ruled against the mandate it would have dismantled the lawIn this case the justices may be less likely to view their decision as equally dire theyre simply sending the law back to Congress which would face no constitutional obstacle to changing the law to allow subsidies in all 50 states When experts survey the court they see a panel of justices that could react favorably to the textual arguments that the healthlaw challengers makeAnd they note that it took at least four justices to agree to hear the case It only takes one more to create a majority against the healthcare law The idea of five justices finding the challengers arguments compelling is well within the realm of reality for most observersWhen I read prominent people saying this case was frivolous I winced a bit says Nicholas Bagley an assistant law professor at the University of Michigan who has written extensively on the King challenge This is a serious lawsuit This should make people worry
