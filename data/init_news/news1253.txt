CNN Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are confronting the same paradox the fate of their insurgent campaigns built on scorn for the political establishment rests on how well they play the inside gameFor Trump the challenge is shifting from a strategy of piling up state primary wins to one that also takes into account states that award delegates in a more intricate fashion Trumps organizational weakness in that type of contest was underscored Saturday when he was swept by Ted Cruz in the Colorado Republican conventionSanders meanwhile has to win not only more pledged delegates but also more superdelegates  party officials and other elites who can vote however they choose  if he wants to take the Democratic battle for the White House to the convention floorTrump is already making the case that the system is inherently unfair and is a symptom of the insider politics practiced by distant elites that disenfranchises grassroots voters like those who have flocked to his campaignYou see whats happening to me and Bernie Sanders Trump said Sunday in Rochester New York Its a corrupt deal going onThe 2016 campaigns shift from a simple hunt for primary wins is more than a sign that the electoral calendar is running out and routes to the nomination for both parties are beginning to narrow Its proof that for all of its busted conventional wisdom and broken political rules the wild presidential campaign is at a point where insurgent politics are no longer sufficient to winThe nuts and bolts of presidential politics is an archaic language and very few people understand it Outsiders need insiders to be successful said Republican political strategist Ford OConnell If you want to crack the Da Vinci code you need insidersTrump is doing just that Last week he hired Paul Manafort a master of insider politics to run his convention strategyStill Trump and Sanders start at a disadvantage in the inside gameCruz whose only real hope of heading the GOP ticket lies in a convention fight is rolling out a delegate hunting operation years in the planning Though hes built a political brand on being an outsider himself Cruz has demonstrated a savvy understanding of the hidden ways of Washington and the mechanics of a presidential primary raceThe Cruz campaign has recruited delegates in Arizona and sought delegates won in Louisiana by Sen Marco Rubio  prompting a bewildered Trump who won the state to threaten legal action Cruz also secured all of the final 13 delegates who were selected in Colorado this weekendThe strategy is designed to prepare the way for multiple rounds of convention balloting when delegates awarded to Trump could be freed up to migrate to another candidate It prompted more sniping between the campaigns on SundayManafort accused the Cruz campaign of Gestapo tactics and not playing by the rules in its efforts to wrangle delegatesI win a state in votes and then get nonrepresentative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign Bad systemHe followed up with another tweet later in the dayHow is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary he wrote Great anger  totally unfairMore sour grapes from Trump who continues to lash out in tantrums every time he loses We are winning because weve put in the hard work to build a superior organization she said in a statementTrumps decision to hire Manafort who helped quell the Ronald Reaganinspired delegate uprising against President Gerald Ford at the 1976 convention was a sign of evolution in his campaignThis is an example of Donald Trump managing Manafort said Friday on CNNs New Day Because the campaigns come in stages he also understood that there comes a time when winning isnt enough But its how you win and how much you win He recognized that this was the timeIts unclear whether the move will be enough to help Trump secure the 1237 delegates hell need to win the nomination going into the GOP convention this summer But the new direction is being praised as a smart move even by Republicans strongly opposed to TrumpPaul Manafort is a seasoned professional and he is a smart guy Stuart Stevens senior strategist for Mitt Romneys 2012 GOP campaign told CNN on Friday This is make or break for Donald Trump He has to get to 1237 I think if he doesnt go to Cleveland with 1237 its doubtful that he will be able to come out of there as the nominee of the partyPart of Manaforts job will be to forge links with local state party chiefs and officials influential in populating delegate slates and to ensure that Trump is not outmaneuvered in the rules committee that will set out the parameters of the conventionThe challenge that the Trump campaign faces right now is that Ted Cruz has spent two years working every single one of those members every single state party chair said Republican strategist Doug Heye The Trump campaign is just getting to know those peopleTrumps campaign confronts a challenge beyond Cruzs camp and the more longshot possibility of facing down a convention coup from Ohio Gov John Kasich who is positioning himself as an alternative should both his Republican rivals fail to corral a majority of delegates in a split partyRepublican establishment insiders who in some cases failed to thwart Trump on rival campaigns are still trying to stop him some with super PAC efforts targeting the billionaire with millions of dollars in advertisingThese efforts are also now increasingly turning to influence delegate slates said Tim Miller a former senior Jeb Bush aide now working for the antiTrump Our Principles PACThere is a role we can play whether it is directly speaking or directly messaging to delegates or potential delegates in these states Miller saidWhile the Republican primary campaign has claimed much of the media coverage so far this year an insurgent versus establishment dynamic is playing out in the Democratic primary raceSanders the self described democratic socialist has always been a political free spirit caucusing with Democrats in the Senate as an independent but inhabiting ground to left of the mainstream partyThat leaves him with few insider credentials with the party establishment which could become a liability as he tries to lure superdelegatesHis outsider campaign has posed a much stronger than expected challenge to one of the most powerful names in American politicsBut he faces an uphill climb to the nomination  he would need to win 77 of the remaining delegates at stake to win the nominationClinton is much further along than Trump and Sanders in the process of locking up delegate support  especially among Democratic superdelegates  many of whom have decades of stored up loyalty and connections with her familyClinton lost in 2008 to Barack Obamas outsider campaign that toppled her insider machine Her 2016 campaign team has learned from its mistakes paying far more attention to delegate calculations and individual state electoral math than she did earlierThis has meant that even when she has lost to Sanders she has minimized the deficit in delegates  as happened in Wisconsin last week when she lost by 13 points but only collected 10 fewer delegates than her rival Sanders beat Clinton by more than 10 points in the Wyoming Democratic caucuses on Saturday but they both walked away with seven delegatesThe Clinton campaign infrastructure that is in place has done a phenomenal job of securing pledged superdelegates very early on in the process said Tharon Johnson a senior Democrat from Georgia who was southern regional director for Obamas 2012 reelection campaign They have a very full comprehensive ground organization in states that matter the most to close out the nominationClinton currently enjoys a lead of 1304 to 1075 pledged delegates over Sanders And she has also secured the endorsements of 486 super delegates compared to 38 who have declared for the Vermont Senator according to CNN estimatesThe Clinton campaign maintains that there is no realistic route for Sanders to win the nomination To do so he would have to claim almost every remaining nominating contest into June by large margins in a way that would ensure that neither he nor Clinton would approach the 2383 delegates needed to win the nominationThen Sanders would have to pull off an intricate inside game to persuade hundreds of superdelegates to desert Clinton and support him as the partys standard bearerThats a tall order for Sanders even if he and his allies insist the senator is best positioned to be a Republican in the November general electionThis is what superdelegates have to grapple with they want to win Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN last week We are going to an open convention Everybody is talking about a Republican open convention but the Democrats are going to an open convention
