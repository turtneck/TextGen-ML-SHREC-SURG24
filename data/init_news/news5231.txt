Durham New Hampshire CNN No more fake niceties No more patience No more Martin OMalley to get in the wayHillary Clinton relaunched her campaign Thursday night going directly after Bernie Sanders regarding his attacks on her record stressing her foreign policy experience and making the case to Democrats that its time to stop dreaming and get realSanders didnt hold back either continuing to rail against the political establishment and campaign finance system And he hit Clinton again on her Wall Street connections and vote for the war in IraqHere are the takeaways from the intense MSNBC Democratic debateClinton goes after Sanders for his artful smear campaignIn her second presidential campaign Clinton clearly doesnt want to win through a war of attrition Shes sick of Sanders casting himself as the protector of the progressive realm against the corrupting influence of the Clintons and she is ready to extinguish the Bern nowAfter yet another Sanders swipe at Clinton as part of a political establishment bankrolled by Wall Street and drug companies she unloadedTime and time again by innuendo by insinuation there is this attack that he is putting forth which really comes down to you know anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought And I just absolutely reject that senator and I really dont think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you And enough is enough Clinton saidThen she challenged him If youve got something to say say it directly but you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation I ever receivedAnd finally Clinton made it just a little bit more personal saying I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out in recent weeksAnd she follows with the definition of progressiveIts been a struggle for months for Clinton to find a way to tell Sanders supporters that shes on the same page with them policywise  its just that their big ideas could never ever make it through CongressShe tried a new way of explaining their differences on Thursday night and it was her best yetA progressive is someone who makes progress Clinton saidIt was easy to see Clintons exasperation with Sanders The pattern repeated itself Hed propose a liberal policy and be cheered Shed say she agrees and then add that she has a specific plan to make it happenIm fighting for people that cannot make those changes and Im not making promises that I cannot keep Clinton saidBut Sanders response is potent tooIn going right at Sanders Clinton took a big riskShe is hoping to pick up a few points in New Hampshire and slow Sanders momentum nationally But in doing so she could infuriate the young voters who Sanders has drawn into the political processAt first those young voters were fine with Clinton  liked her even They just saw Sanders as more genuine Now the tone at Sanders rallies makes clear she will have significant work to do to win them over should she win the nominationSanders didnt hit Clinton directly when he responded but he didnt shrink either He lambasted 1990sera Wall Street deregulation under Bill Clinton of course the Koch brothers and ExxonMobilThat is what goes on in America Sanders said There is a reason you know there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system he said and in my view it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working familiesWall Street continues to be full of potholes for the former secretary of stateHer pragmatism and her accusations of an artful smear on Sanders part dont erase the political problem caused by her paid speeches at Goldman Sachs  which she had joked about in a CNN town hall the night before saying with a laugh that the 675000 in speaking fees she received was what theyd offeredI may not have done the job I should in explaining my record she said arguing that she was tough on bankers behind closed doors and has been in the 2016 campaign as wellThirteen years and two presidential campaigns later Clintons vote to go to war in Iraq still haunts her Her experience on foreign policy  as Sanders himself admits  is much deeper But just like thenIllinois Sen Barack Obama in 2008 Sanders keeps using that Iraq vote as Kryptonite on the subjectShe finally found an answer to Sanders criticism A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISISIt allowed Clinton to finally capitalize on a significant weakness of SandersTheres a reason Clintons campaign decided to embrace four more Democratic debates Shes a bareknuckle brawler and shes not going to lose the nomination because she wasnt willing to hit Sanders hard enoughSanders meanwhile will pull his punches  especially on subjects where hes tepidThe big one is foreign policy It never comes up at his town hall meetings and its not at the top of his supporters priorities On the debate stage it showsThe email issue continues to hang over the Clinton campaign  and the question of whether theres some ticking timebomb there that could decimate her campaign in a general election after she wins the nominationAsked directly whether she could reassure Democrats on this Clinton said Absolutely I canMSNBCs Chuck Todd pressed further regarding an FBI investigation into the matter I am 100 percent confident This is a security review that was requested It is being carried out It will be resolvedSanders  as he has before  declined the opportunity to take a direct shot at Clinton on the emails But he did remind viewers that he could attack her if he wanted toThe secretary probably doesnt know that theres not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue he said and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that
