Comments Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator His own recorded words confirm as much as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteenyearold girl and a previously undisclosed second girl who was even younger  The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error but refiled in June with two new witnesses Joan Doe and Tiffany Doe who both say they worked as party planners for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein Part of that planning appears to have been procuring girls for the party as Joan Doe revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim Jane Doe to attend four different parties with promises of money and meeting contacts in the modelling industry  a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trumps parties At one of these parties Jane Doe was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelveyear old named Maria At the fourth and final encounter Tiffany Doe says  I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldnt ever say anything if she didnt want to disappear like the 12yearold female Maria and that he was capable of having her whole family killed Maria hadnt been seen since the previous encounter Trump then forcibly raped Jane Doe who was then raped and sodomized again by Jeffery Epstein who was apparently furious tha t Trump had ta ken her virginity and not him beating her in his fury  Donald Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that Ive known Jeff for 15 years Terrific guy Hes a lot of fun to be with It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side No doubt about it  Jeffrey enjoys his social life Epsteins brother Mark also testified that Trump flew on Jeffreys private jet at least once and records indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004 Epstein eventually recieved a slap on the wrist  13 months in prison and registration as a sex offender  for decades of abuse  according to lawenforcement officials and alleged victims between the years 1998 and 2007and possibly even earlierhe ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around 200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same The more you do the more you are paid one said During these massages girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them they saidwith his finger or a vibrator or his allegedly eggshaped penis The details keep coming and the picture they paint grows darker and more horrifying by they day How much more evidence does America need How many more stories need to be told before the word of one rich man is outweighed by literally dozens of contrasting accounts Donald Trump is a sexual predator and a possible pedophile he deserves a jail cell on Rikers Island not the White House
