WASHINGTON  A new research paper suggests Congress helped the economy to the tune of nearly 2 million jobs when lawmakers killed longterm unemployment benefits at the end of 2013The working paper by economists Marcus Hagedorn Iourii Manovskii and Kurt Mitman is a boon to congressional Republicans who insisted the benefits not be renewed The Wall Street Journal editorial board trumpeted the findings and the House Ways and Means Committee chaired by Rep Paul Ryan RWis touted the paper on its blogBut while the study might help the GOP take credit for an improving economy the story isnt so simple as several other recent studies have found the longterm benefits werent holding back workersThe new paper says the benefit cut led to 18 million additional jobs last year Almost 1 million of these jobs were filled by workers from out of the labor force who would not have participated in the labor market had benefit extensions been reauthorized the authors writeThey reached their conclusion by comparing the 2014 employment growth of adjacent counties in separate states since the federal unemployment insurance program that expired in December 2013 offered different durations of benefits depending on a states unemployment rate Using Labor Department data the paper found that counties in states that lost out on more weeks of benefits saw higher job growth In other words they were better off without the benefitsThe finding is contrary to predictions from the Obama administration and the Congressional Budget Office which assumed keeping the extended unemployment compensation through 2014 would boost the economy Other studies have found that the longterm jobless aid in place since 2008 didnt reduce the likelihood that laid off workers would take available jobsSome commentators both liberal and conservative have taken issue with the papers methodology Using a different set of Labor Department data Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research found a smaller increase in employment in states where the benefit cut was deeperFor some of the workers whose benefits ended that December hardship ensued  at least in the short term Things got desperate for Charlie Walker of Phoenixville Pennsylvania for instance before he got a new job last fall And Brian Krueger of Mount Horeb Wisconsin only got back to work in May 2014 after going on food stamps and nearly losing his house He doesnt see himself as part of a happy story about the economy improving
