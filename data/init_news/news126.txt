The Republican presidential contest is not regardless of what it seems some days all about Donald Trump Theres another dynamic unfolding that has almost nothing to do with the businessmanpolitician currently atop the polls but that will have a major influence on who becomes the partys nomineeThis other struggle involves the competition among former Florida governor Jeb Bush Sen Marco Rubio Fla and Ohio Gov John Kasich History suggests that whoever emerges triumphant in this threeway rivalry will be in a strong position to claim the nomination though admittedly the past has been a poor predictor of events so far in this campaignEver since Trump surged to the top of the polls the other candidates have been trying to assess both his staying power and the costbenefit analysis of engaging him Trump and Bush have clashed almost from the start with growing intensity More recently as Rubio has risen Trump has taken aim at him and Rubio has responded in kindNone of the other candidates has a clear strategy for taking down Trump But they all think he will look like a different candidate  and in their assessments a less formidable candidate  once the field narrows to three or four finalists after the voting begins So they are beginning to focus on one another as much as they are worrying about himWith the first contests still months away none of the three yet looks like a frontrunner In the average of recent national polls Rubio and Bush run fourth and fifth behind Trump retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former HewlettPackard chief executive Carly Fiorina Neither Bush nor Rubio breaks double digits Kasich doesnt even break 5 percentNational polls at this stage are less meaningful than state polls In Iowa where the first caucus will take place in early February Trump and Carson lead with Sen Ted Cruz Tex currently third Bush and Rubio trail the first three and Kasich is even deeper in the pack In New Hampshire Trump also has a big lead but Kasich is jockeying with Fiorina for second with Carson and Bush next and Rubio farther backTrump and Bush take on Rubio in New HampshireIn recent days Bush Rubio and Kasich have shown how much theyre worrying about one another Theyve been sniping at each other and making other moves that underscore the significance of their competitionRubio has long emphasized that the party needs a fresh candidate not one tied to the past an implicit criticism of his fellow Floridian who is part of an American political dynasty Bush a twoterm former governor has belittled Rubios experience or lack thereof Kasich a twoterm governor and longtime House member has claimed that his experience and record are unmatched by any of the other candidatesAdvisers to the three anticipate more attacks ahead The Bush campaign is feverishly doing their opposition research on Governor Kasich and Senator Rubio said John Weaver Kasichs chief strategist An empire like that is not going to go quietly into the night Were expecting pretty sharp elbows to be thrown Were going to handle it head onPast Republican nomination contests often have devolved into competition between a candidate from the centerright or mainstream conservative wing of the party and a candidate from the hard right or populist conservative wing Most times the candidate from the mainstream conservative wing becomes the nomineeThis year the race is more scrambled because of the added factor of the apparent desire by many Republicans for an outsider or nonpolitician That has elevated Trump Carson and Fiorina and has forced the others to adapt Rubio has been stressing that despite being in the Senate hes really not of WashingtonInstead of establishment vs tea party one GOP strategist describes the race this time as a competition between those in the anger or antiWashington lane vs those in the aspirational lane Bush Rubio and Kasich all fall more into the aspirational laneWhat will make the difference Based on how the three candidates are running its clear that they see the path ahead in slightly different ways though each has handicaps he must overcome to winBush has repeatedly pushed back at Trump by arguing that anger and insults cannot win the presidency He seeks to be the aspirational candidate conservative enough because of his record in Florida to be acceptable to a conservative party while offering a positive and inclusive message that reaches beyond the GOP coalitionBut many Republicans see Bush as least able to appeal across the entire party  not much more able to appeal to the hard right than Cruz would be able to attract mainstream conservativesLodged firmly in the establishment wing as the son and brother of former presidents he faces resistance on the far right and among those yearning for an outsider His hope is that he can change perceptions of himself outlast his rivals with superior resources and persuade Republicans that hes their best hope to win a general electionSally Bradshaw Bushs senior adviser said the key remains what it has been from the start of the campaign to portray Bush as a conservative reformer by stressing what he did in Florida People dont know that yet she said When that message burns in his numbers are going to change Thats his pathWhat the pundits said then and now about Donald TrumpKasich is looking to the traditional model He is the compassionate conservative of 2016 who hopes to strike first in New Hampshire and build from there His advisers believe that eventually he can reach across the divide in the party to become the nomineeBut the party has not only moved right in the past decade it also has developed a harder edge than when George W Bush ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000 Kasichs support for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is just one example of a position that will not sit well with many conservativesRubios team sees crosscutting appeal as vital a race that will favor a candidate who can best unite a fractured party The senators goal is to demonstrate skills as a communicator to show depth on the issues to turn his personal story into a positive message for the party to make as few errors as possible and over time generate enthusiasm across the GOP coalitionRubio too has vulnerabilities His past support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants from which he has backed away remains an obstacle in his path So too does his personal profile that of a youthful firstterm senator with limited experience trying to become president  a profile not unlike that of President Obama when he first ran eight years agoDavid Axelrod who was Obamas chief strategist in both campaigns often has said that voters look for a replacement rather than a replica in picking a new president The adviser to one of Rubios rivals put it this way When was the last time this country elected two presidents with similar attributes Rubio will be trying to dissuade his fellow Republicans that he isnt another ObamaThere are wild cards in the calculations of all three camps Maybe New Jersey Gov Chris Christie who occupies similar space will catch fire in New Hampshire and elsewhere although the resistance to him within the party is significant Fiorina has demonstrated fearlessness that has jarred even Trump and can appeal across the party Carson remains a candidate of unknown potentialLast there is the Trump factor and what his support represents For now he remains the dominant force in the GOP race But the advisers to Bush Rubio and Kasich see a turn in the campaign heading into the final months of the year one that will heighten the competition among them with significant consequences for their party
