Fox Business News aired two GOP presidential debates Tuesday a primetime event starring eightcandidates and an earlier debate featuring four secondtier contenders based on an average of recent pollsNot every candidate uttered facts that are easily fact checked but following is a list of 15suspicious or interesting claims As is our practice we do not award Pinocchios when we do a roundup of facts in debatesThis was a great line by Rubio well delivered but its totally off baseThe median wage of welders is 37420 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics The median wage for philosophy teachers is 63630 according to BLSIn fact the average firstyear salary for a college graduate with a bachelors degree in philosophy is 42200  with a midcareer average of 85000 according to Payscalecom For college professors the median salary is 89913 with the top 10 percent having a salary near 200000By contrast the top 10 percent salary for welders is only about 58590 BLS saysCarson has a point but such a trend did not play out every time the federal minimum wage was raisedOur friends at PolitiFact have compiled a chart showing the years Congress raised the minimum wage and the months of job growth in the following oneyear period The chart shows that between 1978 and 2009 raising the federal minimum wage did not always result in job loss or job growth In fact it was split almost evenly out of the 11 times the minimum wage was raised there was overall job growth six times and overall job loss five timesStill the Congressional Budget Office projected that raising the minimum wage to 1010 from the current wage of 725 per hour would result inabout 500000 fewer workers havingjobs and possibly up to 1 million workers would be affected Raising the minimum wage to 9 per hour could result in 100000 to 200000 jobs lost the CBO projectedHowever many more lowwage workers earnings would increase as a result of raising the minimum wage the CBO found Under the 1010 option 165 million workers with hourly wages less than the proposed minimum would see an increase in their earnings Under the 9 option 76 million workers would see an increaseConventional economic analysis may show that increasing the minimum wage reduces employment by increasing the cost to employers and by raising the cost of lowwage workers relative to other inputs like machines or technology the CBO wrote But conventional economic analysis might not always apply according to the CBO For example when a firm is hiring more workers and needs to boost pay for existing workers doing the same work  to match what it needs to pay to recruit the new workers  hiring a new worker costs the company not only that new workers wages but also the additional wages paid to retain other workersTrump likes to cite this historical example to defend his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants but never uses its nowpoliticallyincorrect name Operation WetbackAs our colleague Yanan Wang documented in September this campaign dumped hundreds of thousands of Mexican migrants back into Mexico with few resources to fend for themselves Unloaded from buses and trucks carrying several times their capacity the deportees stumbled into the Mexicali streets with few possessions and no way of getting home  After one such roundup and transfer in July 88 people died from heat strokeMoreover researchers now believe claims that more than 1 million people were deported to be highly exaggerated with the actual figure closer to 250000A Brookings Institution report appears to confirm Pauls claim But at The Fact Checker we always warn readers against correlating the economic trends in a city or state to policy decisions of a single executive or in this case his or her partyA study by the Brookings Institution ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 largest cities in the country by income inequality using 2012 Census data PolitiFact rated Pauls statement Half True based on this studyAmong the 10 cities with the highest income inequality nine had Democratic mayors Atlanta under a Democratic mayor had the highest inequality out of the nations largest cities The other cities led by Democrats were San Francisco Boston Washington DC New York Oakland Chicago Los Angeles and BaltimorePolitiFact found that seven of the 10 cities in the report with the least income inequality had Republican mayors Oklahoma City Omaha Neb Fort Worth Texas Colorado Springs Colo Mesa Ariz Arlington Tex and Virginia Beach VaThe 10 cities with the least inequality obviously are smaller cities than the ones in the top 10 The range of income distribution is wider in larger cities with bigger populationsThis is stale statistic derived from a reportpublished in 2014 by the Brookings Institution which studied Census Bureau data called Business Dynamic Statistics Brookings analyststracked data back to 1978 and found that starting in 2008 business deaths exceeded business births through 2011It soon became a favorite GOP talking point Marco Rubio used it in the last debate But that report is out of date More recent data shows the trend shifted in 2012 and in the past two years business starts began to exceed business deathsIn saying he was against increasing the minimum wage Carson cited a figure for black teenage unemployment that seemed suspiciously highto some viewersApparently he meant to refer to the unemployment rate though it came out sounding like he was saying 80 percent were unemployedBut then a 198 percent unemployment rate sounded suspiciously low Indeed the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that it stood at 256 percent as of OctoberThe Carson campaign initially sent a 2013 report from the American Enterprise Institute that said the jobless rate for black male teens was 443 percent but 198 percent for white male teens Oops Then we were sent a pair of studies that show the summer jobless rate for black teens was 19 percent Seems like a shifting of the goal posts but apparently he was talking about summer employment He just didnt make that very clearWe note this comment because it is very puzzling The Chinese are in Syria The Carson campaign did not respond to a query Update Spokesman Doug Watts sent links to blog posts from September 2015 speculating that China was in Syria and a 2012 article about possibleChinese participation in war games with Russia and Syria which noted the reports were unconfirmedBut while there were reports in Middle Eastern media that China would fight alongside Russia in Syria that has been dismissed by the Chinese media as speculative nonsense A newspaper tied to the ruling Communist Party notedIts not China that brought chaos to Syria and China has no reason to rush to the front lines and play a confrontational roleThis may have been true at the start of his campaign but its no longer valid though Trump loves to keep saying this line In the third quarter of this year the Trump campaign received 4 million in unsolicited donations according to the campaigns latest financial filing Since launching the campaign Trump has spent about 2 million of his own money the filing saidCarson appears to cite the common statistic that 22 veterans commit suicide a day At best this figure is a rough outdated estimate based on partial dataThis statistic comes from the VAs 2012 Suicide Data Report for which researchers analyzed death certificates of veterans from 21 states from 1999 to 2011 They took the percentage of veteran deaths identified as suicides out of all suicides from those states during that period Then they applied that percentage to the number of suicides in the United States in a given year That comes out to 22 suicides a dayBut the sample size was fewer than half the states and did not include some states with the largest veteran populations such as Arizona California Texas and North Carolina Researchers who wrote this report provided a major caveat about their findings It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states and existing evidence of uncertainty in veteran identifiers on US death certificates The Department of Veterans Affairs Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Defense Department have been working on a larger study to accurately quantify the suicide problem among veteransSuicide is a serious concern among veterans and Americans at large In fact suicides among veterans happen at a higher rate than Americans in generalHuckabeeappears to be citing data from a flawed article that appeared in the tabloid Daily Mail in September That one in five figure is simply wrongThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees reportsthat of the nearly 800000 refugees arriving by sea in 2015 52 percent are from Syria followed by 19 percent from Afghanistan and 6 percent from Iraq Nearly 3500 people were dead or missing because of the sea journey Obviously both Afghanistan and Iraq are also wartorn countriesAbout 650000 refugees arrived in Greece followed by nearly 150000 in ItalyUNHCR also says there are nearly 43 million registered Syrian refugees with more than 2 million living in Turkey 1 million in Lebanon and more than 600000 in JordanThe former Arkansas governorgets this depressing factoid correct In January of 2000 there were 173 million manufacturing jobs in the United States according to government statistics As of October this year there were just 123 million manufacturing jobsHuckabee was also right to reach back to 2000 during the Bill Clinton presidency as that was the high point for manufacturing in the past 20 years Almost 5 million manufacturing jobs were lost during George W Bushs term in office  and the nadir was reached during President Obamas term when the United States had only 115 million manufacturing jobs Some of those jobs have been recovered but the total number of manufacturing jobs isstill lower than when Obama took officeNone of the Democratic candidates have said they would boost tax rates so high even on the wealthySen Bernie Sanders an independent from Vermont who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination has not yet released a tax plan but he has repeatedly denied that he would increase taxes from the current marginal rate of 396 percent to as high as 80 or even 90 percent The marginal rate is what you pay on each additional dollar earned Sanders claims he would fund his 1 trillion plan to rebuild US infrastructure by tapping corporate profits now stashed in overseas tax havensThe United States had a marginal tax rate of 90 percent in the Dwight Eisenhower administration and then John F Kennedy proposed to reduce it to 70 percent The plan was approved by Congress after his assassination But even such rates would not take 90 percent of a persons incomeThe crime rate has been decreasing for decades but you wouldnt know it just listening to what Christie says about the rampant lawlessness in the countryThe violent crime rate has been decreasing steadily since 1991 despite overall population growth The FBI Uniform Crime Report which compiles data from law enforcement agencies shows the violent crime rate decreased by 15 percent since President Obama took office in 2009 In 2011 the violent crime rate was the lowest it had been since 1971The murder rate also has been dropping in major American cities including in New York City This has been the trend for the past decade even in cities that once were overrun by crime This trend holds even despite a blip in some cities this summerIts not entirely clear where Santorum got his figure or how the father living at the time the child is born is an incentive not to marry the motherPerhaps Santorum meant that the father was living in the home at the time the child was born leading to his argument about cohabitingIn any case a 2014 Pew Research Center analysis of 2013 Census data show that 46 percent of children younger than 18 years old are living in a traditional family a home with two married heterosexual parents in their first marriage According to the analysis 34 percent of children in 2013 were living with an unmarried parent and most of the unmarried parents were single Four percent of all children were living with two cohabiting parentsSantorum may be referring to a report referenced in a 2014 Associated Press articleby researchers at Harvard University and Cornell University that found found that at least half of mothers who were cohabiting when their child was born were still in relationships with the childs biological father five years later More couples are cohabitating and the trend likely will continue because many couples are postponing marriage until their finances are more stable according to the article citing research by the National Center for Health StatisticsThe National Center for Health Statistics also found that nonmarital births increasingly are likely to occur among cohabiting couples though the rate of births of unmarried women has decreased since the peak in 2008This is one of Jindals favorite boasts about his record but he takes too much credit for saying he cut the state budget 26 percentThe state budget in fiscal 2009 Jindals first budget after taking office in 2008 was 343 billion In fiscal 2016 the proposed budget was 251 billion That is a 92 billion decrease or 268 percentBut this budget decrease was not due to his executive decisions alone Federal funding also decreased by 10 billion during those eight years from 197 billion to 97 billion Part of this decrease was due to waning federal funding for hurricane recovery according to the TimesPicayune
