GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said Friday he has a lot of respect for First Lady Michelle Obama but he doesnt understand the basis of her claim in a her speech Thursday condemning Donald Trump for using what she called sexually predatory language in a conversation caught on a hotmic in 2005I have a lot of respect for the first lady and the job she has done for the American people over the last sevenandahalf years the Indiana governor told the CBS This Morning host Charlie Rose continuing that he does not believe the language described sexually predatory actionsI already spoke about my concerns about the language he used in that 11yearold video said Pence But what he has made clear is that was talk regrettable talk on his part But that there were no actionsFurther Trump has categorically denied these last unsubstantiated allegations that were made this week from at least five women who claimed Trump groped and kissed them against their will in years pastFrankly I think before the day is out the allegations will be questioned said Pence The same reporters who wrote a similar story six months ago for The New York Times have written this story and that story was completely discreditedPence told Fox News Fox  Friends the Trump campaign is working to bring out evidence that will disprove the allegations being made about him and said during an interview with NBCs Today show that evidence is coming in frankly a matter of hoursHe told Today show hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie that Melania Trump has already contacted People Magazine for a retraction of its story about Trump but Lauer commented that was different than showing evidenceJust say tuned Pence told the Today show There is more information coming forward But Donald Trump has made very clear that hes categorically denied these allegations Yet he cant be more definitive than thatAnd the difficulty is that at this point in a campaign it is astonishing to see with all due respect the enormous coverage of these really unfounded allegations unestablished allegations compared to an avalanche of emails coming out of Hillary Clintons years as secretary of statePence said he agrees that allegations such as those being made against Trump should always be taken seriously and respectfully but in the case of Bill Clinton he actually admitted to being involved with a 23yearold intern at the White House named Monica Lewinsky when he was president Bill Clinton actually paid a settlement of over 800000 to one of those women Paula JonesThe remarkable thing as the media goes chasing after unsubstantiated allegations coming from a newspaper that six months ago did a massive similar story that was utterly discredited by the same reporters Pence told Fox NewsIts remarkable to me they continue to literally ignore the hard evidence thats flowing out of Hillary Clintons years as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation whether its a speech supporting socialized medicine in Canada a paid speech supporting open borders in BrazilHe said the most concerning to him was the news that Clintons aides while she was secretary of state were directing contracts for the rebuilding of Haiti after the earthquake to friends of the Clintons I mean this is exactly the kind of paytoplay politics the American people are tired of Its going to end when Donald Trump becomes president of the United StatesPence told CBS that as the father of two daughters and as a public person he does take allegations like those facing Trump seriously but also noted the GOP presidential nominee categorically denied the claims against himFurther the Indiana governor said he urged Trump to apologize which he hasHe also questioned the timing of the news against Trump as we have hard evidence flowing out of the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton years but the unsubstantiated claims are dominating the newsPence said hes spoken with Trump over the allegations being made about him and he believes the presidential candidateDonald Trump has asserted that all of these recent unsubstantiated allegations are categorically false and I believe him said Pence The Donald Trump as I come to know and my family has come to know and spent considerable amount of time is someone who has a long record of not only loving his family and lifting his family up but employing and promoting women in positions of authority in this companyAnd Pence told Rose he gave up a job he loves as governor of Indiana a state he loves to join the Trump race because I think this country is in a lot of trouble and he thinks its time to return the issues and move away from the scandalsThe Trump scandals have caused many to question his character but Pence said he has found Trumps response to be extraordinaryHe apologized for what he said 11 years ago said Pence He showed humility he showed heart He focused that national presidential debate back on the issues that really affect the American people at home and abroadMeanwhile he pointed out that the avalanche of emails from Clintons accounts continue to emergeClinton was advocating open borders when she was giving a speech in Brazil advocating socialized medicine when she gave a speech in Canada said Pence The Haitian issue to me is the biggest one    The friends of the Clintons were given preference shall treatment for contracts for the reconstruction of Haiti after an earthquakeAlso on Friday Pence commented on Trumps claims that the upcoming election may be rigged and he agrees that voter fraud has been an issueWe are currently involved in a pretty vigorous investigation in the state of Indiana over voter fraud said Pence It is in the interest of everybody on every side of the spectrum to defend the one vote one principleThe way elections are managed at the state level is to become involved as a pollwatcher and poll volunteer and we consistently encourage people to do that
