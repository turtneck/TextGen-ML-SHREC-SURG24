BREAKING FBI Gets Search Warrant For State Department Emails On Weiners Computer VIDEO By Michelle Oxman on October 30 2016 Subscribe On Sunday afternoon October 30 2016 the FBI obtained a search warrant for emails on a laptop owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner Youll remember that Weiner was under investigation for sexting a 15yearold girl As it happened the same laptop also contained emails that Abedin Clintons Chief of Staff at the State Department forwarded to her personal Yahoo account so she could print them Thats why FBI agents got Director James Comeys approval to seek access to the emails as Comey told Congress and we reported  on Thursday October 28 A Rather Unusual Warrant Now when is the last time you ever heard about a search warrant being granted I bet you cant think of one Thats because police and prosecutors ask the court to issue warrants in secret That makes sense even to those of us who usually err on the side of supporting civil liberties After all if you knew the police had a warrant to search your home or your computer what would you think of doing Why do we know about this warrant Because James Comey told Congress there were new emails pertinent to the Clinton investigation Trump supporters argued that the government must have reviewed the emails and would only have released the information if there was important new evidence In reality the FBI couldnt do so legally Why Because the warrant to search the computer for evidence of Weiners contact with a 15yearold girl could not have covered Huma Abedins workrelated emails from three or more years earlier Theres a helpful explanation of the legal issues relating to the search warrant in todays Washington Post Still faced with the innuendo and implications of illegality in Comeys vague letter Clinton and her supporters insisted that the FBI disclose what it had Perhaps the FBI didnt want to admit that it didnt know what it had Or maybe the FBI didnt want to admit that it had gotten its knowledge illegally Getting a search warrant bought the FBI time though and left the whole mess hanging over Clintons head as she approaches the last week of the campaign Violating Policy There seems to be no doubt that Comeys letter to Congress violated two longstanding tradition and policies 1 prohibiting discussion of ongoing investigations and 2 not taking actions to favor one side or another in elections Two former Deputy Attorneys General one Democrat and one Republicanpublicly questioned Comeys fitness to lead the FBI because of it In addition others have pointed out that Comey has repeatedly gone beyond established limits in his discussions of the Clinton email investigation The Known Unknowns We still dont know whether any of the emails on that computer contain new information We dont know whether Secretary Clinton ever sent emails to Abedins personal account on that computer or received emails from Abedin via that account We dont know whether classified information was sent or received via this personal computer We dont know what any of the emails would tend to show about Clintons respect for classified information After all it wasnt Clinton but Abedin who forwarded the emails One Final Question Apparently the FBI agents working on the Weiner case became aware several weeks ago that the computer contained emails that Abedin forwarded to herself while she worked at the State Department Why did they wait until last Thursday to tell Comey Surely they anticipated his likely reaction Did they play Comey to manipulate the election results About Michelle Oxman Michelle Oxman is a writer blogger wedding officiant and recovering attorney She lives just north of Chicago with her husband son and two cats She is interested in human rights election irregularities access to health care race relations corporate power and family lifeHer personal blog appears at wwwthechangeuwish2ccom She knits for sanity maintenance Connect
