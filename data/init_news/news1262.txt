Regarding the dissenting justices Um what the hell Arent hardline paleoconservatives supposed to be against frivolous lawsuits Of course they are And of course the King v Burwell case was absolutely a frivolous lawsuit The entire law could have potentially collapsed over a lawsuit that disputed the existence of seven words in an otherwise massive piece of legislation Those seven words through an exchange established by the state That was the basis of the whole thing The plaintiffs argued that based on those words the federal government could only provide subsidies for lower income Americans who purchased insurance through a staterun exchangeIn other words the lawsuit claimed that Obamacare insurance customers in all states that use the national Healthcaregov marketplace shouldnt get subsidies to help cover premium costs Whats perfectly clear in the language however is that the governments of each state decides which exchange its citizens will have to use either a staterun marketplace or the federal exchange Case in point Hawaii was the first state to form a statebased exchange the Hawaii Health Connector But just the other day Democratic governor David Ige announced that the Health Connectors was financially unfeasible and opted to shut it down transferring all customers to the Healthcaregov This is purely a state decision and therefore the subsidies ought to still applyIn Roberts majority opinion the chief justice wrote that in the context of the law as a whole many more than seven words in length the claim against the word usage was untenable Of course To any sentient thinking human untenable is rightSo back to Scalia Alito and Thomas The fact that three Supreme Court justices sided with the plaintiff on Burwell proves how ideological and dumb those three justices truly are To anyone with a basic grasp on reality the language in the law is clear and incontrovertible But in the farright bubble grasping desperately for anything that could undermine the law is de rigueur for the GOP including nearly 60 votes so far to destroy the law in spite of the fact that President Obama would never in a million years sign such legislation The flailing has become so pathetic that three justices in the highest court in the land sided in support of an hilariously frivolous lawsuitIm old enough to remember a time when the Republican Party actively campaigned in support of tort reform especially in the healthcare field Indeed tort reform is still a plank in the GOP platform But lately the congressional Republicans have gone all gushy for frivolous lawsuits going so far as to sue Obama on numerous occasions Rather than doing its job and actually you know legislating Republicans from Speaker Boehner on down the line have opted instead for silly lawsuits aimed at various actions by the White House For example before the Defense of Marriage Act was repealed Boehner tried to sue Obama and his Justice Department for not enforcing the law Elsewhere tea party senator Ron Johnson tried to sue Obama over Congress alleged exemption from Obamacare The latter suit was egregiously and offensively frivolous since Congress isnt exempt from Obamacare at all In fact the law requires members of Congress and staffers who want employeebased coverage to get it through Healthcaregov Obama merely authorized a rule that was requested by yes Speaker Boehner to continue allowing the government to share the premium costs So Johnson was basically suing over a semantic trick  the patently false claim that Congress was exempt from Obamacare was intended to infuriate the base and make it seem as if Congress carved out a special loophole for itself which Obama subsequently signed The reality is that proud Republican Ron Johnson was merely exploiting the ignorance of the GOP base assuming itd go around believing that Congress was truly exempt even though its not at all Obamacare expert and Yale law professor Abbe Gluck told The Washington Post on Thursday The decision sends a strong signal to people who politically oppose the law that the court understands the law and is not going to tolerate more of this frivolous litigation that tries to destroy the statute by distorting it Heres to hoping Gluck is right and the Burwell decision is the end of all this nonsense Really weve reached a point when Republicans who visit the White House will accidentally spill hot coffee in their laps just so they have an excuse to hire the nearest Jackie Chiles rentanattorney and stick it to Obama once and for all For another fantastic Seinfeld reference see also Simon Maloys takedown of the Burwell case here
