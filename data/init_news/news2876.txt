women 10 Firsttime voters are also more likely to back her 16The candidates garner almost equal backing among the party faithful 83 percent of Democrats back Clinton while 81 percent of Republicans support TrumpTo be competitive Trump needs to consolidate support among Republicans and carry independents says Republican pollster Daron Shaw Thats where hes made inroads in the last week mostly by focusing his attention on the economy and Obamacare  Shaw conducts the Fox News Poll with Democratic counterpart Chris AndersonTrumps substantive strength is the economy Hes trusted over Clinton by four points yet thats the only issue where he bests her More trust Clinton to handle foreign policy 15 points immigration 3 and terrorism 3Who would voters put across the table with Russian President Vladimir Putin More trust Clinton to negotiate with Putin by 3 points 4744 percent among registered voters Thats down from a 13point lead on this measure in April 5340 percentAll in all likely voters

in her judgmentPlus Clinton continues to receive more positive personal ratings She has a net negative rating of eight points 45 favorable vs 53 unfavorable while Trump is underwater by 14 42 favorable vs 56 unfavorable In addition when undecided voters and those backing thirdparty candidates are combined 26 percent have a favorable view of Clinton vs 18 percent for TrumpYet despite Trumps weaknesses on traits its still a tight race Thats because at least in part lots of folks prioritize issues when deciding their vote By a 5928 percent margin more say their decision is about the issues as opposed to the character of the candidates Those backing Trump are more likely to be voting on issues than character by a wide 57point margin 7316 percent For Clinton supporters the choice is more about issues by 12 points 4735 percentCompared to 2008 this is a more character driven election At that time voters said issues were more important than personal qualities by a 7114 percent marginThe bottom hasnt fallen out for Trump and Clinton hasnt pulled away but the race isnt as close as the 3point lead suggests says Anderson Trump needs a solid majority of undecided voters and wavering supporters of thirdparty candidates and thats extremely unlikely since most of them think he lacks the judgment temperament and qualifications to be presidentThere are a couple of areas where the two are about evenly matched First 52 percent feel Clinton stands up for people like them and 49 percent feel that way about TrumpAlso on their honesty  or lack thereof a recordlow 30 percent of likely voters think Clinton is honest and trustworthy while 34 percent say Trump isHere are five additional takeaways from the poll 63 percent of Trumps supporters believe things in the United States generally favor other people rather than people like them Fortyfour percent of Clintons supporters feel that way Twice as many voters expect Clinton to win as think Trump will 6426 percent Fully 86 percent of Democrats think Clinton will win while 49 percent of Republicans think Trump will Trump supporters 34 percent are more than three times as likely as Clinton supporters 10 percent to say they wont accept the election outcome if their candidate loses Eightyeight percent of Clinton supporters say theyll accept the outcome up from 74 percent in September The generic congressional ballot test is also tight 47 percent back the Democratic candidate in their congressional district while 45 percent support the Republican Among those backing the GOP congressional candidate 79 percent go for Trump in the fourway presidential race Clinton gets 82 percent of those backing the Democratic candidateModels suggest a 2point Democratic advantage on the generic ballot would result in a gain of about 11 seats in the House and 4 in the Senate says Shaw That means the GOP would retain an edge of about 20 seats in the House while the Senate would be very much up for grabs The political parties are about evenly matched in popularity among likely voters The Democratic Party has a net positive rating of four points 51 percent favorable vs 47 percent unfavorable The Republican Party has a net negative rating by just one point 48 percent favorable vs 49 percent unfavorableThe Fox News Poll is based on landline and cellphone interviews with 1309 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide
