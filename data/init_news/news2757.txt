In the wake of the worst terrorist attack in America since 911 President Obama could have used his Oval Office address on Sunday night to announce different policies than the ones that have obviously failed to keep America safe from radical IslamHe could have explained why a longfeared arrival of lowtech softtarget terrorism had occurred and what he would do to rectify the problembeginning with apologizing for giving a US visa to a jihadist from Pakistan and agreeing to stop his plan to bring more Syrian refugees hereHe could have announced a plan to undermine the ideology of our enemiesradical Islamwhich impelled Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik to wage war in San Bernardino last weekInstead he did what he always does with security threats blame others for his administrations lapses and do the minimum to appear to be reacting to them without actually doing anythingIn calling for Congress to ban those on the nofly list from buying guns Obama is attempting one of his trademark shifts in blame for problems he has created The president instinctively wants to react to every security threat by assailing his domestic opponentsEven if his proposed ban and other gun control measures were in place they would not have stopped the attack in San Bernardino Recent attacks like those in Paris show that jihadists have little problem overcoming gun laws which serve mainly to disarm the lawabiding Obama could also look to his adopted hometown of Chicago to see that gun control doesnt workObamas moralizing about avoiding suspicion and hate implied once again that Americans are bigoted  another attempt to shift blame It echoed a statement last week by Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the government would prosecute antiMuslim speech that edges toward violence whatever that meansThus did our government reveal its contempt for us and our Constitution in the wake of an attack it failed to preventObamas reassurances about the fight against ISIS fell flat In effect a ragtag army of about 20000 men have stood up to a year and a half of a USled war and prevailedall the while expanding their influence around the globe Their success has inspired attacks like the ones in Paris and San BernardinoCalling for Congress to approve retroactively his antiISIS campaign as he did again in his Sunday evening prime time address will do nothing to improve the flagging effort This is merely another attempt to shift blame for failure down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to CongressObama failed to climb down from his assessment that ISIS is containedsomething that not even his own top general believesThe president also preemptively surrendered to ISIS insurgents he said would sap any Americanled ground forces despite the success of the 2007 surge in Iraq that proved otherwise and the fact that a USled coalition could turn administration of Syria over to local tribes after destroying ISISSunday nights sad speech makes one wonder what the White House was thinking Obama has always resisted addresses from the Oval Office for unclear reasons In one of only two other such speeches during his tenure he cheered our exit from Iraq in which hardwon American gains were thrown away and the vacuum ISIS would eventually fill was createdWhatever the reason his aversion to Oval Office addresses may have been wise the setting doesnt suit himThe office awaits a new president who can confidently explain how a restored America with restored alliances can defeat ISIS rapidly and with overwhelming force fight back in the cultural and ideological war radical Islam is waging against us and defend rather than blame the American people Christian Whiton was a State Department senior advisor in the George W Bush administration He is author of 20032009 He is the author of Smart Power BetweenDiplomacy and War Potomac Books 2013
