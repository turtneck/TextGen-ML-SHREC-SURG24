At the old union hall here on a recent afternoon Terry Magnant sat at the head of a table surrounded by 18 empty chairs A members meeting had been scheduled to start a halfhour earlier but the small house with its cracked walls and loose roof shingles was lonely and desolateThere used to be a lot more people coming said Magnant a 51yearold nursing assistant sighingThe antiunion law passed here four years ago which made Gov Scott Walker a national Republican star and a possible presidential candidate has turned out to be even more transformative than many had predictedWalker had vowed that union power would shrink workers would be judged on their merits and local governments would save money Unions had warned that workers would lose benefits and be forced to take on second jobs or find new careersMany of those changes came to pass but the oncethriving publicsector unions were not just shrunken  they were crippledUnions representing teachers professors trash collectors and other government employees are struggling to stem plummeting membership rolls and retain relevance in the state where they got their startHere in King Magnant and her fellow AFSCME members workers at a local veterans home have been knocking on doors on weekends to persuade former members to rejoin Community college professors in Moraine Park home to a technical college are reducing dues from 59 to 36 each month And those in Milwaukee are planing a campaign using videos and posters to highlight union principles The theme Remember Questions linger over Walkers college exit as he mulls White House bid But recalling the benefits that union membership might have brought before the 2011 law stripped most publicsector unions of their collectivebargaining rights is difficult when workers consider the challenges of the presentI dont see the point of being in a union anymore said Dan Anliker a 34yearold technology teacher and father of two in Reedsburg a tiny city about 60miles northwest of MadisonThe law required most public employees to pay more for health insurance and to pay more into retirement savings resulting in an 8 to 10percent drop in takehome pay To help compensate for the loss Anliker said he took an additional 10houraweek jobEveryones on their own island now he said If you do a good job everything will take care of itself The money Id spend on dues is way more valuable to buy groceries for my familySean Karsten a 32yearold middle and high school reading instructor in his first year of teaching in Reedsburg said the unions are just not something I concern myself withI just look to keep improving my teaching in the best way I can and try to keep my nose out of the other stuff he saidWalker has pointed to the unions membership troubles as a victory  presenting himself as a conservative warrior unafraid of taking on big battles against liberal interestsWalkers administration has said forcing public employees to contribute more to retirement plans and health insurance helped local governments save 3billion The governor also has credited the 2011 law with saving homeowners money on property taxes while giving school districts the ability to make reforms that increased thirdgrade reading levels and high school graduation rates And the law has emboldened Republican state lawmakers to further challenge Wisconsins labor movement this year by pushing righttowork legislation that would allow privatesector workers to opt out of paying union dues  a measure Walker has said he would signWe took the power away from the biggovernment special interests and put it firmly in the hands of the hardworking taxpayers Walker told Iowa Republicans recently That is what we need more of in this great country The liberals dont like thatUnion officials declined to release precise membership data but confirmed in interviews that enrollment is dramatically lower since the new law was signed in 2011The state branch of the National Education Association once 100000 strong has seen its membership drop by a third The American Federation of Teachers which organized in the college system saw a 50percent decline The 70000person membership in the state employees union has fallen by 70percentThe decline is politically significant in Wisconsin a presidential battleground where the unions have played a central role in Democrats getoutthevote drivesJohn Ahlquist a University of Wisconsin political scientist who specializes in labor movements said Walker had effectively dismantled the financial and organizing structure of unions in WisconsinAlthough it is too early to tell if unions are near the end of their political power here they are in a very vulnerable position Ahlquist saidThe mass protests that gripped the state Capitol have subsided but anxiety remains high in union halls across WisconsinAt Magnants meeting in King on a frigid February afternoon union members finally began trickling in one by one filling a few of the empty seatsA groundskeeper at the veterans home complained that supervisors were no longer assigning overtime based on seniority because there was no union Others complained that there were no longer enough nursing assistants on shifts while management positions seemed to growThis is what we are trying to live with Magnant said But we cant continue like thisDean Johnson burst through door with a big grin on his face Johnson 55 told the story of how he felt so bold at work that he yelled Join the union in the middle of the veterans home A stalwart union supporter he vowed hed do anything to keep the movement goingBut Johnson said he could no longer do it as an employee He told the group he was retiring  prompting a discussion about the new mantra for those choosing to leave union work Goodbye tension hello pensionWhile some union members have been energized by the fight they say they notice a new more vocal animosity toward them It has been particularly pronounced in rural areas where publicsector jobs were some of the most prized gigs in townIn King population 1700 Magnant said she couldnt change a sign at the union hall without someone giving her the finger Farther west in Stanley prison workers said they ditched their favorite pizza pub because the owner stood by while other customers called them leechesIn Reedsburg that tension surprised Ginny Bourgeois 52 who clerks at a local Kwik Trip The community had always been divided defined as much by the factories manufacturing car parts as it was by cornfields now blanketed in snow Still it was a place where the community got together for spaghetti and corn feeds and filled bleachers to watch the Reedsburg Beavers play Now she said people were fighting over politics at gas stationsStill she felt unions needed to sacrificeEveryone knows teachers insurance was some of the best you could get Bourgeois addedThey do fairly well around here and they do a good job teaching But everyone in this town has had to tighten their belts They should tooJudy Brey a 58yearold speech therapist who taught in the community for 22years said such sentiment hurt teachers morale She said she grew up admiring her dad who put six children through college on his unionsupported job as a forester I dont make a lot but well be okay with retirement she said he told her That she was taught was the reward for public service in WisconsinNow Im always nervous that everyone will think theyre moochers Brey said That Im a moocherWhile some union members across the state knocked on doors to court members Brey tried another strategy finding more alliesA day before Magnant opened the doors for a meeting at the union house in King Brey went to a local restaurant to call to order the meeting of the Reedsburg Area Concerned CitizensOn the top of Breys list was deciding guests for a planned panel discussion on the state of public education Someone raised a handAre we getting any interest from the schools in this one man asked I havent seen any of the teachers out here since we were marching with them on the streets four years agoAt the meeting the husband of the columnist called Walker a pig  which prompted the board supervisor to wonder why he was insulting pigs They debated whether or not its worth it to invite Republicans to the education event but Brey insisted its important to keep things balanced Eventually the group agreedWere getting somewhere Brey said as a waitress handed out checksBut were the unions Brey vowed not to give up on them Two days later she attended a union meeting that had been called to discuss possible changes in teacher retirement Ten of the districts 192 teachers had gathered at the meeting They appreciated that the superintendent had previously met with union leaders even though he didnt have to Still they grew agitated when discussing his proposal to reduce retirement benefitsAnother teacher Linda Zauner 58 said she was working to build a case that teachers wanted to keep benefits the same but she had struggled to get teachers to respond to a survey She said she wanted to emphasize that teachers still thought of health care as a bargained rightThis is the closest thing were going to get to negotiations Zauner saidYou have to be mean she said We never got anything by being nice Weve had to walk out We got things when we banged our fists on tablesSometimes I think she stopped to collect the words delicatelySometimes I think  thats  why they came after us Jenny Because they thought these teachers were too demandingNo we have to fight Fish responded Its for our studentsBrey nodded As long as there were teachers she said shed be fighting along with them
