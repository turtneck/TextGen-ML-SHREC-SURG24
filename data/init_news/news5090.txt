WASHINGTON FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureaus previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clintons handling of classified information restarting a longsimmering debate over the Democratic nominees conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting awayIn aletter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision Comey said the FBI cannot yet assess whether the information is significant nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessmentBut an official familiar with the mattersaid Friday that the new materials perhaps thousands of emails were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15yearold girl Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days resulting in the directors notification to Congress said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publiclyThe emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin Abedin also had access to the same device or devicesThe official said it was not likely that the FBIs review of the additional emails could be completed by Election DayIn a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening Clinton said The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediatelya position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman John Podesta The Democratic nominee called on the FBI to release all the information that it hasAs you know Ive had plenty of words about the FBI lately but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong Justice will prevail Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids Iowa Thursday nightDuring a speech in New Hampshireearlier in the day the Republican presidential nomineegleefullydiscussed the breaking news announcementHillary Clintons corruption is ona scale we have never seen before Trump said and her criminal scheme should not be allowed in the Oval OfficePerhaps justice will be done the GOP nominee said of the developmentIn his statement Podesta demanded that the FBI director provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter to lawmakersUpon completing this investigation more than three months ago FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call Podesta said In the months since Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the FBI and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clintons presidential campaignIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election Podesta addedSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had surfaced to change the presidents opinion and views of Secretary ClintonHes going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day Schultz saidIn July Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of Statehad been extremely careless in the way theyd handled classified information he recommended that no criminal charges be filedIn her press conference Friday Clinton said she was confident whatever is included in the new messages under review will not change the conclusion reached in JulyIn July Comey testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureaus recommendation which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta LynchWere mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached House Oversight and Government ReformChairman Jason Chaffetz RUtah told ComeyComey however was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close callThere is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts he told the House panel on July 7Trump has cited the closed FBI probeas evidence that the election was rigged against him and at a recent debate the GOP nomineesaid that if hes elected president he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate ClintonHillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame said House Speaker Paul Ryan of WisconsinThis decision long overdue is the result of her reckless use of a private email server and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators Ryan said in a statement adding that he was again calling for Clinton to no longer receive classified briefings a traditional courtesy afforded majorparty presidential nomineesRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision so soon before the election demonstrated how serious this discovery must beTrumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway wrote on Twitter that a great day in our campaign just got even betterMeanwhile Democratic Sen Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that without knowing how many emails are involved who wrote them when they were written or their subject matter its impossible to make any informed judgment on this developmentShe added The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results Todays break from that tradition is appallingHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to misrepresent the FBIs workSadly but predictably Republicans are doing their best to  warp the FBIs work to serve their partisan conspiracymongering against Hillary Clinton Pelosi saidThe uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield andwhen it will be completed leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign as Trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground statesUnless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week the likely impact will be to cut into Clintons margin with the bigger effect being on downballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election said Patrick Murray director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in an emailed statementWhatever the longterm impact the shortterm jolt to Trump and his supporters at least seemed clearIn his New Hampshire speech the GOP nominee suggested the rest of hismessage for the day would no longer matter as much given the FBI announcementThe rest of my speech is going to be so boring he jokedContributing David Jackson in
