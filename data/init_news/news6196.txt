The report also discloses new details relevant to Clintons motives and her assertion that the use of a private server was simply a matter of convenience While criminal charges still remain highly unlikely the inspector generals report is significant and unquestionably damaging to Clintons public defenseMost crucially the inspector general directly contradicts Clintons repeated assertions that she complied both with federal law and State Department policies At a minimum the report finds Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and because she did not do so she did not comply with Departments policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records ActThe report goes further noting that while Clintons subsequent production of 55000 pages of emails in response to State Department demands partially corrected these violations the records Clinton turned over were incomplete Remarkably the report includes reference to a previously unreleased 2010 email in which Clinton responding to her deputy chief of staff for operations Huma Abedin directly addresses her lack of an official State Department email account and voices a fear of the risk of the personal being accessible if she had one In a briefing State Department officials were unable to confirm the source of this email but if it was omitted from the records Clinton produced it again would raise questions about the process she used to distinguish between federal records and personal records before destroying the latterThe inspector general also reveals the comments of State Department records management staff in late 2010 expressly raising concerns that Clintons private email server could contain federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy federal recordkeeping requirements A senior official rebuffed these concerns claiming that Clintons email arrangement had been approved by the department legal staff  an assertion the inspector general concluded was untrue  and directed staff never to speak of the secretarys personal email system againSuch facts undermine the argument that the significance of maintaining a private server and the negative effects it could have including on responses to Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional subpoenas were simply overlooked Clintons response to the report is further complicated by the fact that the State Department did not contest the inspector generals findings concurred with its recommendations and even acknowledges in its response that the department could have done better at preserving emails All of this would serve to undermine assertions by Clinton that the inspector generals conclusions are biased or politically motivated Indeed thus far Clintons response has focused on the argument that other secretaries of state also used private email Well there may be reports that come out Clinton commented but nothing has changed Its the same story Just like previous secretaries of state I used a personal email many people did It was not at all unprecedented And it is true that the inspector general does not spare former Secretary Colin Powell from similar allegations documenting his use of private email and his admitted failure to preserve those emails In a nasty campaign can politicians play nice Opinion Yet this arguably only furthers the perception that the inspector generals review was both balanced and nonbiased And Clintons response highlights how her defense  which began with confident assertions that she followed all the rules and broke no laws  has now been reduced to the argument that others did it too or that the rules she violated were not significant Despite the inspector generals report criminal charges against Clinton remain highly unlikely While the report provides previously nonpublic information relevant to Clintons motivations the available public evidence remains insufficient to illustrate two facts needed for a criminal charge  that she knew that emails on her private server were classified and that she intentionally mishandled classified information Who in the world really wants Donald Trump to win Yet the inspector generals report also highlights the uncertainty that surrounds the precise scope of the current FBI investigation To the extent the FBI has limited its inquiry to security issues and the possible mishandling of classified information for example the inspector generals report finding violations of the federal records laws potentially implicates a different criminal statute Removing concealing or destroying federal records regardless of whether they are classified can constitute a federal felony But again courts have generally required prosecutors pursuing this charge to prove that defendants knew they were violating the law for which the evidence against Clinton appears to be lacking In the end extracting the truth in the Clinton email controversy in the current polarized political environment remains a nearly impossible task Some have already begun to seize upon the inspector generals report mischaracterizing it as clear evidence of a crime And when the Department of Justice announces that it is not filing criminal charges  as is both expected and perhaps inevitable  Clinton will likely argue that it constitutes proof that she did nothing wrong Based on the publicly available evidence the reality appears to be nuanced in a way that is satisfying to neither side Clinton violated the law but committed no crime
