Hillary Rodham Clinton is running as the most liberal Democratic presidential frontrunner in decades with positions on issues from gay marriage to immigration that would in past elections have put her at her partys precarious left edgeThe moves are part of a strategic conclusion by Clintons emerging campaign that it can harness the same kind of young and diverse coalition as Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012 bolstered by even stronger appeal among womenHer approach  outlined in interviews with aides and advisers  is a bet that social and demographic shifts mean that no leftleaning position Clinton takes now would be likely to hurt her in making her case to moderate and independent voters in the general election next yearThe strategy relies on calculations about the 2016 landscape including that up to 31percent of the electorate will be Americans of color  a projection that may be overly optimistic for her campaign It factors in that a majority of independent voters already support samesex marriage and the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants that Clinton endorsed this monthThe game plan also hinges on a conclusion by Clinton strategists that the broad appeal of issues such as paid family leave a higher minimum wage and more affordable college will help outweigh any concerns about costs And while the early liberal tilt focuses on domestic issues more likely to drive voters this cycle Clinton will also have to win over liberal voters still skeptical of her hawkish reputation on foreign policyThe campaigns overall calculus relies on a mix of polling  including both internal and public surveys  internal focus groups and what advisers described as gut feelings about the national mood It also reflects what Clinton backers say are her firmly held personal convictions and her pragmatismHer approach to this really is not trying to take a ruler out and measure where she wants to be on some ideological scale Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said Its to dive deeply into the problems facing the American people and American families Shes a proud wonk and she looks at policy from that perspectiveHow Hillary Clinton is running against parts of her husbands legacyClintons full embrace of samesex marriage in the first days of her campaign was followed by clear statements in favor of scrapping gettough immigration and incarceration policies  many of which took root during her husbands administration She has also weighed in with liberal takes on climate change abortion rights and disparities in income and opportunity between rich and poorAll are issues that have been divisive in the past for both Democrats and Republicans But none are now judged to be radioactive for Democrats which gives Clinton more elbow roomBy taking such positions aides and advisers hope Clinton will not only inoculate herself against a serious challenge from the left in the primaries but that she also will be able to push on through the general election Her campaign believes American public opinion has moved left not only since Bill Clinton won election in 1992 on a centrist platform but also since Barack Obama won on a more liberal oneRepublicans  as part of a broader critique of her trustworthiness  accuse Clinton of flipflopping on some positions and hiding on others such as free trade to cater to the liberal baseClintons already moved her position leftward on numerous hot button issues to the base including immigration gay marriage Wall Street and criminal justice reforms conservative America Rising PAC director Colin Reed wrote in a position paper FridayClintons moves reinforce all her worst attributes as a candidate and hurt her image among voters of all stripes Reed said Progressive voters know that shes not truly one of them while swing voters see a desperate politician staking out farleft positions that are outside of the mainstream of most AmericansMany political strategists also say Clinton will be hardpressed to recreate Obamas winning coalition and that the 30percent to 31percent nonwhite turnout that some of her outside backers are projecting may be out of reach Exit polls show nonwhite turnout was 28percent in 2012 and 26percent in 2008 Clinton will have to expand Hispanic support increase turnout among independent women and still hold on to a large share of black voters who were drawn to the first African American majorparty nomineeThe bold stance on immigration is widely seen as one way to jumpstart the expansion of Hispanic support Clinton will need although advisers say she had already made up her mind about citizenship and there was no reason to put off an announcement When outlining her position in Nevada where 1 in 4 residents is Hispanic she made a point of saying that no Republican would go as far  and alleged that the GOP wanted immigrants to have secondclass statusPeople often talk about the electorate moving left said Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan I think its more that the electorate is just getting more practical For Hillary Clinton that matches her evidencebased approach The arguments that persuade her are evidencebased and progressiveHe cited the growing consensus that mass incarceration is expensive and unworkable and that the country is never going to deport all of the more than 11million people who are here illegallyClinton campaigns dilemma What to do with BillAdvisers do not dispute that Clinton has a finger to the wind of the national mood but they insist the timing and substance of her positions are not driven by polling The stillcautious candidate has declined to make clear her position on two key proposals that many liberals oppose the Keystone XL pipeline and Obamas freetrade dealSullivan also noted that some of Clintons early proposals cut against the grain of political liberalism such as her emphasis on improving the playing field for American small businessesClinton will debut policy proposals to ease lending bottlenecks for small businesses on campaign trips to Iowa and New Hampshire this week The impetus came largely from conversations Clinton had in the runup to the campaign and a sixmonth policy review led by Sullivan that looked at how Clinton might address a variety of national concernsThe thing she is most interested in is not what position is most popular its what do people worry about Sullivan saidClintons 2008 campaign was so focused on polling data and the consequences of saying the wrong thing that it sometimes appeared paralyzed Some of that campaigns infamous staff battles focused on the advice from senior adviser Mark Penn a pollster to avoid more liberal positions in the primary that year for fear they would hurt her in a general election contestThis time is different backers say The strategic advantage the Democrats have is that the distance between our base and the middle is shorter than for Republicans said Neera Tanden president of the liberal Center for American Progress and a longtime Clinton confidantIn other words Clintons strategists say she does not face the same whiplash as Republican candidates who seek to dial back hardright positions on issues such as abortion or immigration adopted during a competitive primarySenior campaign officials acknowledged that trade is a divisive and fraught issue for Democrats and for her Clintons past support for the Pacific freetrade pact makes her current silence awkward at best but her advisers are gambling that the issue wont leave an enduring rift within the partyClinton campaign leaders and outside loyalists also bridle at the perception that she is less of a progressive politician than say Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass They point to Clintons early career as a crusading lawyer in Arkansas and lifelong professional commitments to improving womens livesThe making of Hillary 50 Reimagining the Clinton brandWarren has said she isnt running but has declined so far to endorse Clinton Sen Bernie Sanders IVt is running a strongly populist challenge to Clinton and former Maryland governor Martin OMalley  who has suggested Clinton is too hesitant and polldriven  is expected to enter the race this monthIf Clinton and other candidates are not seen as standing with Warren on the TransPacific Partnership trade deal and a number of other economic issues critical to working families it could create an even greater sense of urgency to get Warren into the race said Gary Ritterstein an adviser to the support group Ready for WarrenThe clearest shift in national attitudes and Clintons own has come on samesex marriage She moved from saying she considered marriage to be between a man and a woman when she was first lady to backing civil unions as an alternative to marriage in 2008 to full support of gay and lesbian marriage nowPublic opinion polling suggests she is on safe ground despite ongoing legal fights in several states The firmest opposition to gay marriage is centered in red states and among Republican voters unlikely to consider voting for ClintonPew Research polling shows that in August 2008  when Clinton endorsed Obama as the Democratic nominee  52percent of Americans opposed legal samesex marriage and 39percent supported it The same poll now shows 54percent support for such marriages while 39percent are opposedShifts on criminal justice issues are less dramatic but there are bipartisan efforts now to repeal some of the harshest and least flexible laws on the books for two decades Outrage and revulsion over police killings of black men over the past year made the issue more urgent for many young African American and socially liberal votersLast month Clinton gave an address calling for dramatic changes in policing and prosecution to lessen the rate of incarceration The remarks echo calls among both Democrats and some Republicans such as Sen Rand Paul RKyTwo or three years ago said Clinton policy adviser Ann OLeary that speech might have been seen as a very leftleaning speech
