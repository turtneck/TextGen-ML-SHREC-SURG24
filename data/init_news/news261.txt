  Have you heard of Dr William Thompson If you havent youre not alone His story was completely ignored by mainstream media outlets the same way that they recently ignored the fact that the Pentagon paid a PR firm half a billon dollars to make fake terroristnews videos   Dr William Thompson is a longtime senior CDC scientist He has published some of the most commonly cited provaccine studies  studies which purport to show absolutely no link between the MMR vaccine and autism for example Two studies he and his coauthor published in 2004 and 2007 CDC studies were the most commonly cited studies used by the scientific community to debunk the controversy surrounding the MMR vaccineautism link  Thompson et al 2007 Price et al 2010  Destefano et al 2004  The study concluded that the evidence is now convincing that the measlesmumpsrubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autism spectrum disorder  source  A decade later Dr Thompson came out publicly admitting that that it was the lowest point  in his career when he went along with that paper He went on to say that he and the other authors didnt report significant findings and that he is completely ashamed of what he did that he was complicit and went along with this and regrets that he has been a part of the problem  source  source  source  A study with revised information and no data omission was published by Dr Brian Hooker a contact of Dr Thompson in the peer reviewed journal Translational Neurodegeneration and it found a 340 increased risk of autism in African American boys receiving the Measlesmumpsrubella MMR vaccine on time The study has since been retracted during the same time of this controversy   You can read the full study HERE  although unsurprisingly it has since been retracted Thompsons attorneys Robert F Kennedy Jr and Bryan Smith of Morgan  Morgan also released a statement from Dr Thompson which mentioned Hooker  I have had many discussions with Dr Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders I share his belief that CDC decisionmaking and analyses should be transparent  source  Even provaccine politicians were contacted as these documents were sent to Congress One of them reads as followed as illustrated by congressman Bill Posey  The CDC coauthors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the MMR vaccine study The remaining four coauthors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can CDC Blocking Testimony Disconcertingly Thomas Frieden see picture above the Director of the Centres for Disease Control CDC has blocked Dr Thompsons attempt to testify on scientific fraud and the destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials Attorneys Smith and Kennedy have been seeking to have Thompson testify on medical malpractice specifically with regard to fraud in a series of studies that found no link between vaccines and autism which are cited earlier in the article Mr Kennedy writes that according to Thompson for the past decade his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data about the safety of the mercurybased preservative thimerosal to conceal its causative link to a suite of brain injuries including autism Ecowatch  Dr Frieden said that Dr William Thompsons deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHS Health and Human Services Despite the fact that Thompson revealed a casual link between vaccines and autism or autistic features Frieden stated that Dr William Thompsons deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHD The case seeking the testimony of Dr Thompson is from the family of 16yearold Yates Hazlehurst A lawsuit is currently underway implying that Yates is autistic as a result of vaccine administration that occurred in 2001 Related CE Article With More Information The Top 6 Reasons Why More Parents

research that is published or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines I take no pleasure in this conclusion which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine Dr Marcia Angell a physician and longtime Editor in Chief of the New England Medical Journal  source  The case against science is straightforward much of the scientific literature perhaps half may simply be untrue Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes tiny effects invalid exploratory analyses and flagrant conflicts of interest together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance science has taken a turn towards darkness Dr Richard Horton the current editorinchief of the Lancet  source
