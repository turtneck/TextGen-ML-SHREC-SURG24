events Pool reporters are responsible for sending reports from the trail to the rest of the press corpsYour pooler showed up at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester on a rainy New Hampshire morning at 745 and was greeted in the parking lot by Meredith Thatcher a press staffer with the New Hampshire Democratic Party Thatcher told your pooler that he wasnt the approved print pool reporter for todays pooled events Martosko reported in his first pool report Note Thatcher is actually a press staffer for Hillary for New Hampshire not the states Democratic PartyAsked to call her boss Harrell Kirstein she did so and then reported So Im afraid its a no Youre not on the list She said campaign press secretary Nick Merrill should be phoned with questionsMartosko continued Asked if the print pooler was being prohibited from getting on either of the pool vans Thatcher replied Im afraid thats right Asked why she responded All I know is what Harrell has told me I got an email saying the print pooler would be changed for today SorryDenied a ride in the pool van Martosko toldThatcher that he would drive to the first campaign stop in Rochester on his own in the hope that things would be sorted out during the 75minute driveReached via emailMartosko declined to commentHe apologized for any typos noting Im dictating to phone as I drive Daily Mail spokesperson Sean Walsh said the organization is seeking an explanation from the Clinton campaign as to why this occurred as Mr Martosko was scheduled to be the designated print pool reporter in New Hampshire this morningMerrill the campaigns traveling press secretary did not respond to a request for comment However he did provide an additional explanation to Martosko whichMartosko relayed in a report on The Daily Mails websiteMerrill said that the campaigns position is that the Daily Mail does not qualify because it has not yet been added to the White Houses regular print pool  something Martosko informed him was a timing issue not a White House choice since Francesca Chambers the Mails White House correspondent has been vetted and has a hard pass Were just trying to follow the same process and system the White House has said Merrill Merrill then insisted that the decision had nothing to do with the campaign considering the Daily Mail foreign press We dont consider you foreign press he said Merrill then added This isnt about you Its about a larger and did not continue his sentence Merrill later insisted that his reasons were not based on the foreignpress question but that the campaign simply wanted a day to have a conversation about how to proceedWe want a happy press corps as much as the press corps does And we work very hard to achieve that in tandem with them Its a long campaign and we are going to do our best to find equilibrium and best accommodate interest from as many news outlets as possible given the space limitations of our eventsAfter some confusion about the location of the mornings early childhood education summit in Rochester NH your pooled determined that it was at the YMCA of Strafford County and arrived at about 1020 Secret Service at the main entrance refused to let your pooler in and advised to go in through another entrance near a playground Visiting that doorway another agent asked for your poolers name and outlet to which the pool replied David Martosko with The Daily Mail A voice from behind the door whom your pool later learned was the head of Mrs Clintons Secret Service detail was heard saying Oh No The first agent sent your pooler back to the front door advising that the head of the detail insisted At the front door again your pooler was asked to wait while the first agent on duty checked to see if the pool would be admitted The answer No You cant come inPooler was advised by that Secret Service agent that he had contacted someone with the campaign named Pollard who personally said no your pooler could not come in Its unclear who Pollard is Your pooler asked if he could come inside to use the restroom The Secret Service agent advised that the area had been swept already so he should hit the woods Pool saw a WMURTV truck outside and confirmed with a reporter from a competing local station that there were indeed pool journalist inside from photo and video With a light rain falling your pooler went back to his rental car to file this report after counting about 210 cars in the parking lots and on the street Both press pool vans from Manchester were visible outside along with the nowfamous black Scooby van and a contingent of New Hampshire state trooper vehiclesWe have been working to create an equitable system and have had some concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being a part of the rotation The journalists who coordinate the pool are in touch with them as are we and we simply asked that until we can work all of that out that we send an outlet in keeping with previous precedents
