Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backtracked Thursday from a clear campaign statement that as long as he was the leader of Israel there would be no independent Palestinian stateI dont want a onestate solution I want a sustainable peaceful twostate solution But for that circumstances have to change Netanyahu who won reelection Tuesday told MSNBC in an interviewEarlier this week in the heat of the Israeli campaign with preelection polls suggesting that he might lose Netanyahu made the sensational promise that he would not support the creation of a Palestinian state on his watch an open reversal of his earlier stance supporting a twostate solution to the IsraelPalestinian conflictThe headspinning pivot did not convince White House officials who suggested Thursday that Netanyahus maneuvers could prompt a shift in US policy toward Israel particularly in the United Nations where the United States has been Israels strongest advocate and defender The White House described its commitment to Israeli and Palestinian states existing side by side in peace as a bedrock principle of US policy in the regionWhat now for US IsraeltiesIn a sign of the Obama administrations extreme frustration White House press secretary Josh Earnest denounced Netanyahus actions as cynical divisive electionday tactics that are unworthy of the values that the United States and Israel share Words matter Earnest addedNetanyahus actions had eroded that foundation and will mean that the United States needs to rethink our approach he said And thats what we will doDespite the strained relations President Obama called Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory as well as to express concern about his electioneve rhetoric and to stress US commitment to a sovereign and viable Palestinian stateThe call which also reaffirmed the importance of USIsrael cooperation on matters of intelligence and security reflected the delicate balancing act facing the White House as it weighs the need to support one of its closest allies while also demonstrating its growing frustration with NetanyahuObama had declined to meet with Netanyahu this month when he was in Washington to deliver a speech to Congress that raised concerns about the administrations negotiations with Tehran over Irans nuclear program The speech represented yet another sore spot in the two leaders strained relationshipOne option that the White House is considering is acceding to the passage of a UN Security Council resolution that outlines the broad parameters of a twostate solution and involves significant sacrifice on the part of the Israelis and the Palestinians Such a resolution would set down a marker for both societies and the future said Ilan Goldenberg a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who served as chief of staff to the special envoy for IsraeliPalestinian negotiations in the Obama administrationThe administration has previously opposed such efforts to impose a solution on the conflict from the outside But the White House could argue that such a measure which would probably be drafted by European allies would help shield Israel from more extreme punitive measures such as sanctions or war crimes charges in the International Criminal Court which the Palestinian Authority has vowed to pursue after it joins in AprilThe move would also be seen widely as an effort on the part of the White House to punish Israels prime minister The president has to decide if this is worth it Goldenberg said This is a huge political lift for the White House Such a move would probably come this spring or summer to shield Democratic presidential candidates from the political falloutThe White House said Thursday that no decisions had been made on whether or how the United States should shift its approach to IsraelAfter winning a resounding victory Tuesday to a fourth term as prime minister Netanyahu went on US TV news shows  and not Israeli programs  on Thursday to walk back his statementsNetanyahu who only days earlier suggested that any evacuation of the occupied territories would be akin to ceding ground to radical Islam was suddenly insisting that he hadnt changed his policyAs proof the prime minister cited a speech he gave at BarIlan University in 2009 in which he famously said he supported a twostate solution as long as Israels security was guaranteed and the newly created Palestinian nation was demilitarizedOver the past six years whenever it seemed as if Netanyahu was fighting against a twostate solution his aides referred reporters to his BarIlan speechNetanyahu returned to that speech in an interview with Fox News on Thursday I didnt retract any of the things I said in my speech six years ago he saidInstead he blamed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for his reluctance to continue talks Hes made a pact with the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas that calls for our destruction the prime minister said referring to the militant group that controls the Gaza StripHe added that conditions in the Middle East have changed to the point where any territory we withdraw from is immediately taken up by Iranianbacked terrorists or by the Islamic StateAlthough the Islamic State has no presence in Israel the West Bank or Gaza it does operate in neighboring Syria Its a dozen miles away from us Netanyahu said Its thousands of miles away from youPalestinian leaders scoffed at what they called Netanyahus disingenuous attempt to recast his remarks while blaming othersAbbas said that Netanyahus words are proof if correct that there is no seriousness in the Israeli government about a political solution according to the Agence FrancePresse news agencySaeb Erekat who spent nine months last year as the top Palestinian negotiator in talks led by Secretary of State John F Kerry said What Netanyahu said wasnt electioneering It was himThis new Israeli government is determined to bury a twostate solution Erekat said adding that there is a big difference between tough negotiator and nonnegotiator and that all Netanyahu and his team have brought to talks is makebelieve illusions plays
