Back in 2013 these stooges were promoting the phony notion that Arctic ice has grown to a record levelIt hadnt After that debacle they claimed UN scientists had found their predictions of warming were off by 50 percent or moreThey werent More recently they were pushing the false claim that the globe has beencoolingever since 1998It hasnt been And of course when all else failed they could always fall back on their old standby weaning ourselves from dangerous fossil fuels wont make any difference anyway because China would never do the same But of course China isnow doing soat a rate that should embarrass these jackasses But it wont Because they are never embarrassed about being wrongSo with 2014 recently clocking in as the hottest year for the planet on record according to every major world agency that measures such things and with 13 of the hottest years on record all falling within the past 15 years these clowns are getting pretty desperate for something anything to use to keep the denialist scam going on behalf of the most profitable industry in the history of civilizationThe latest such scam helpfully propagated on several Fox News shows last week is that the socalled scientists have been caught redhanded in the act of lying about raw temperature data Thats right They have been manipulating the data to exaggerate the extent of global warmingExcept of course they havent and they arentDuring anepisode of Outnumberedon Fox News last week in which the hosts were outraged outraged aboutan interviewin which President Obama correctly asserted that more Americans are affected by climate change than by terrorism Foxs mononymouslynamed Kennedy interrupted the shows guest attorney Mark Eiglarsh to nail him with the newest false claim of climate denialistsEiglarsh asked Is there anything factually incorrect about the statement that more AmericansEiglarsh ignored her and continued More Americans are impacted by climate change than by terrorismWhat about theTelegraphreport that shows the original data versus the published data The NASA published data Kennedy continued There was a great disparity because theyliedabout the actual data until someone went back to these weather stations in South America and Antarctica and thought Hmm maybe something is amiss here And they realized there is ascandalousdiscrepancy in what we have been soldWell no they didnt Setting aside Kennedys confusion between the Arctic and Antarctica  an easy enough mistake to make  her spirited gotcha assertion was still flat wrongShe was hardly the first stooge to be taken in by itDays earlierRush Limbaugh announced We have documented that so much of what they say is untrue one of the biggest is the hoax of global warming which the UK Telegraph as a story yesterday exposes it may be the biggest hoax in all of science everDays earlier daffy Christian Broadcast Network host Pat Robertson dutifullyparroted the same inaccurate nonsense on his 700 Clubshow A climate expert ya know has come out and said that they have actually manipulated the figures to try and prove global warmingOn the same day on another Fox show The Five former White House Press Secretary turned Fox News hostDana Perino echoedthe same false claim during another segment attempting to downplay concerns about global warming in favor of concerns about terrorismPerino said the White House is actually kind of lucky that we dont cover climate change as much as we should Because yesterday it was reported that the temperature readings have been fabricated and its all blowing up in their facesAnother host on the show declared that it was fraud science Perino answered Yes I agreeSo just as in the past  as with the bullshit report about Arctic ice or the bullshit revelations that scientists were off in their predictions by 50 percent or the bullshit claims about a pause or reversal of warming since 1998 or the bullshit assertion that China is unwilling to do anything about its own carbon emissions  Rupert Murdochs Fox News and its bedfellows can once again be relied upon toendlessly echothe latest bullshitthatseemslegitbutisinfactbullshit portending to expose the great hoax that is global warmingPolitifact  which is not always a reliable source for news itself  decided to take a look at Perinos version of the claim In this case they got it right anddeclared Perinos assertion as a PantsonFire LieSo heres how this latest scam came to be taken for gospel by the incurious wingnut dupes along with the actualfactsdebunking the false claimAnopinion piece by Christopher Booker in the the Telegraph a rightwing British newspaper declared that Fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever The column was a followup toanother Booker piece two weeks earlier headlined How we are STILL being tricked by flawed data on global warming in which climate changedenying blogger Paul Homewood was cited for having busted scientists for faking temperature data at three weather stations in ParaguayIn each instance Booker asserted based on Homewoods findings the actual trend of 60 years of data had been dramatically reversed so that a cooling trend was changed to one that showed a marked warmingBooker reported that Homewood subsequently discovered other similar cases where temperature recordings had been adjusted in both South America and in some locations in the Arctic to make the average daily temperaturesappearto have warmed over the past 60 years instead of cooled which the deniers are claiming In nearly every case the same oneway adjustments have been made to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded Booker writes before going on to describe the data as a wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record as part of the most costly scare the world has knownYoull be stunned to learn that the claims by Booker based on Homewoods revelations  and dutifully repeated over and again by the wingnuts  are all actually bullshit The controversy comes from adjustments made to the stream of raw data from thousands of land and seabased weather stations around the globe in order to keep them consistent so that an applestoapples comparison of temperatures can be made over time even as the location of weather stations  and the technology used since the mid1800s to measure those temperatures  changes For instance Politifact explains local officials might move a station from a valley to a nearby hilltop They might change the time of day when they record their measurements from sunrise to sunset They might change the kind of thermometer they use In the ocean the practice once was to haul up a bucket of water Later the standard practice was to measure the temperature from the engines intake valve Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA must then make adjustments to some of those raw temps to account for the human factors that would skew the data regardless of what happened with actual temperatures The temperature records are based on weather station data But people didnt expect the data to be used for monitoring longterm climate change when they started collecting it the University of YorksDr Kevin Cowtan explained in a videodebunking the first misleadingTelegrapharticle on this a few weeks ago It was for recording the weather hence the name weather station As a result they werent always very careful about changes to the instruments or their usage When we change an instrument we have to recalibrate to ensure the new instrument gives the same readings as the old one The original weather station operators didnt always do this So NOAA have to do a retrospective calibration by comparing nearby weather stations So yes Homewood has busted NOAA scientists making adjustments to their raw data in a number of locations The problem however is that whenall such adjustmentsare examined the changes actuallylowerglobal temperatures trends overall The issue is perhaps best described in the Politifact piece by Zeke Hausfather a data scientist with Berkley Earth a group of researchers that have been funded in the past by the climatedenying Koch brothers which is a pointnotnoted by Politifact Hausfather says the data cited by Homewood have been cherrypicked in order to seed doubt in climate change science emphasis added They look through all those thousands of stations find a few that show big adjustments and tell everyone that they are evidence of fraud Hausfather said You will rarely see them pick out stations likeRenoParisLondonTokyo or many others where the adjustments dramatically lower the warming trend Hausfather and his colleaguestraced how the adjustment methodschanged the temperature data differently around the world since 1850 In the graph below zero is the baseline Above zero temperatures have been adjusted upward below it temperatures have been adjusted downward  In the United States with about 5 percent of Earths land area the official data file raised temperatures compared to the original readings But the same methods lowered the data records in Africa and for all landbased readings taken together the adjustments basically made no change at all the black line With ocean temperature trends the efforts to compensate for the human factor lower the numbers dramatically The net effect of adjustments is to actually reduce the amount of global warming weve observed since 1880 by about 20 percent Hausfather said Folks skeptical of temperature adjustments are welcome not to use them if theyd like but you end up with more global warming not less Got that Yes some adjustments serve to increase the temperature trends But overall the adjustments actually serve tolowerthe increase in temperatures across the globe over the last 150 years by about 20 percent It is important to keep in mind that the largest adjustment in the global surface temperature record occurs over the oceansNOAA told Media Mattersin an email last week Adjustments to account for the transition in sea surface temperature observing methods actually lowers global temperature trends Want to do away with all of those adjustments Fox News OK But if you do the problem of humancaused global warming is even worse than climate scientists are now reporting it to be And by the way though Politifact doesnt mention it most of the experts they consulted in their article disabusing the claims by Perino Booker and Homewood all happen to be like the Kochfunded Berkley group noted climate changeskepticsthemselves For his part asArs Technicas John Timmer notes BookersWikipedia entryshows that he has a lot of issues with science in general claiming that things like asbestos and secondhand smoke are harmless and arguing against evolution So this sort of immunity to wellestablished evidence seems to be a recurring theme in his writing None of that naturally disqualifies him from being a source for Fox and friends when it comes to The Biggest Science Scandal Ever And its effective The article earned theTelegrapha ton of traffic there are 28872 comments on the item if thats any indication and the bulk of the chumps who clicked on the page bought the bullshit  a survey at the end asks readers if they believed global warming has been exaggerated by scientists 91 percent of the 127199 readers who answered the online poll believe it has been Nonetheless whether Big Carbons stooges have fallen for it or not another climate change denier myth is quashed Dont worry though This one will be repeated anyway and then another will most assuredly rise up in its place soon enough And there will be enough Fox News dupes  both viewers and reporters  willing to both buy and sell it All meant to continue delaying necessary changes that might help stave off our planetary climate crisis just so that the fossil fuel industry and its supporters can continue to make ever more profits for as long as possible cause fuck all of you liberal lefty treehugging scienceloving communists who have fallen for the great hoax that humanity should live on alivableplanet
