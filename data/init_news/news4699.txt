CNN DNA from New York prison escapees Richard Matt and David Sweat has been found inside a burglarized cabin in upstate New York a law enforcement source told CNNThe discovery has reenergized the twoweekold search for the convicted killers who staged a movie scriptworthy escape from Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6 and havent been seen since  at least not by authoritiesHowever a witness on Saturday spotted someone running into the woods near a cabin in the Mountain View community only 25 to 30 miles from the prison according to acting Franklin County District Attorney Glenn MacNeillInvestigators think the figure spotted Saturday could have been one of the fugitive prisoners MacNeill saidSince then law enforcement authorities have flooded the rural community swooping in on helicopters cruisers and allterrain vehicles to scour the region for the men More state and federal teams are to be redeployed on Monday the law enforcement source told CNNBriefing reporters Monday New York State Police Maj Charles Guess declined to get into specifics about what was found at the cabin for fear of jeopardizing the searchIts a confirmed lead for us he said It has generated a massive law enforcement response as you can see and were going to run this to groundThe breakin suggests the men need provisions and are desperate a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNNs Deborah FeyerickTheres no evidence the fugitives have the kind of support network they would need to get away from the prison after their plan to get a ride from prison tailor Joyce Mitchell fell apart the source saidAre they listening to police radio trafficAs part of the investigation into whether Matt and Sweat had help police are reviewing months worth of hotel registries in the area the source saidMeanwhile searchers are now working to contain the two men in the area knowing they are running and on foot the source saidAuthorities also are concerned that Matt and Sweat may be monitoring radio communications the source said without being specific on whether the men have radios or similar devices giving them the ability to monitor police communicationsRegardless the sighting and DNA discovery explain the sudden shift in the search from an area near New Yorks border with Pennsylvania some 260 miles to the southwest of the prison where much of the weekend search had focused after somebody reported a possible sighting of the two fugitivesThat search wrapped up late Sunday New York State Police saidMacNeill urged residents in Franklin County to be alert for potential danger during the search for the escaped killers whom authorities described last week as posing a significant threat to anyone who may come into contact with themBe inside with the doors locked and very diligent MacNeill warned residentsInvestigators are looking into whether Mitchell convinced a prison guard to pass the meat to the inmates in a way that bypassed a metal detector the source said The two escapees were housed in an honor block where they were allowed to cook their own foodTheir escape set off a massive search for them and a probing investigation of employees and practices at the prisonMitchell has been charged with aiding the escapees and a corrections officer has been placed on paid leave authorities have saidWhen its in your backyard its kind of crazyThe troopers set up roadblocks just across the street off county Highway 27 she saidThey set up a command post using ATVs One trooper asked Pulsifer for a map of snowmobile trails in the area which is near a winter ski resort and in an area crisscrossed with recreational trailsIm kind of excited but nervous at the same time Pulsifer told CNN adding that her boss had told her to close the bar early because of safety concernsShe said shed followed the news of the manhunt as it unfolded previously in Cadyville another town in the regionNow when its in your backyard its kind of crazy she told CNN saying she planned to go home and lock up with her gunPulsifers concerns are familiar to people in Friendship the rural town near the Pennsylvania border where somebody reported seeing two men along a railroad line on SaturdayMany residents spent the rest of the weekend holed up in their homes while around 300 law enforcement officers combed the areaGary Baker 80 said he was terrified of the possibility that the killers could be nearbyBaker is a caretaker at the towns Maple Grove Cemetery right next to his home But authorities blocked off the cemetery as search helicopters hovered overheadBaker was left to sit alone in his home with all his doors locked and a rifle in his lapFranklin County and Friendship arent the only communities where police have swarmed in the hunt for Matt and Sweat The manhunt now in its 17th day has primarily been focused in the area around Dannemora where the prison is situatedDescribed by authorities as very dangerous the two killers have been added to the US Marshals Services list of its 15 most wanted fugitives Reward money of 75000 has been offered for information leading to the capture of either manAs many as 800 law enforcement officers have participated in the manhunt which has cleared nearly 200 abandoned buildings hundreds of occupied homes and more than 600 miles of rural trails officials saidState police have asked hunters and homeowners with surveillance cameras to check their footage all the way back to the day of the prison break for any unusual activityThe search has stretched to Canada and Mexico with wanted posters of the escaped killers given out at both bordersAuthorities are still investigating how exactly Matt and Sweat managed to orchestrate their escape which involved cutting through a steel wall and navigating a series of tunnels until the men emerged from a manhole outside the prison wallsMitchell a prison tailor shop instructor is accused of helping them by supplying tools like chisels and drill bits She is in jail and has pleaded not guilty to the charges against herA source familiar with the investigation has told CNN that Mitchell 51 had a sexual relationship with MattInvestigators are looking into whether other prison staff members or inmates played a role in the breakoutAuthorities said Friday that a male corrections officer was placed on paid administrative leave as part of the investigation into the escapeState authorities havent named the officer but his attorney identified him Sunday as Gene Palmer a 28year veteran of Clinton Correctional FacilityRight now Mr Palmer is fully cooperating with any or all questions that are being asked of him attorney Andrew Brockway told CNN on Sunday He spent 14 hours yesterday and he was completely forthcomingPalmer knew Matt and Sweat and had received a painting done by Matt but Brockway said he is sure his client did not know the inmates were planning an escapeHe wants these two individuals to be caught and anything that he can do to help law enforcement do their job hes willing to cooperate Brockway said MondayA retired sergeant at the prison Jeff Dumas said he is sure Palmer was not involved in any escape plotI dont believe that he actually intentionally helped these guys Dumas told CNNs New DayHe said Palmer was one of two corrections officers responsible for escorting inmates to and from work at the prisons industrial building and was always conscientious in his workMy gut feeling is that somehow they may have conned him or taken a shortcut somewhere along the way in procedures during an escort and that would be about it Dumas saidThese two people are psychopaths they are master manipulators Brockway said of Matt and Sweat Theyre obviously in prison for life so they have nothing but time to develop schemes to take advantage of innocent people
