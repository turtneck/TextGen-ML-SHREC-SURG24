To understand what ails Hillary Clinton lets rewind past Iowa and New Hampshire  two years back in fact to a speech in New Orleans before the National Auto Dealers Association and these wordsThe last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996 I remember it very well Unfortunately so does the Secret Service which is why I havent driven since thenThat one passage underscores three of Clintons presentday woes shes lived in a cocoon for well over two decades shes not all that entertaining there may be no limit to what she and her husband will do for a quick buck that one appearance earned Hillary a 325000 honorariumSpeaking of Clintons motoring skills theres a fourth problem rather than turn into the skid caused by alarming droves of young and women voters jilting her for Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders shes overcorrected  trying too hard to pawn herself off as a feverish progressive leaning too hard on Lean In adherents to stay true to the sisterhoodIts one way to parse Thursdays Democratic debate in Milwaukee would Clinton continue her February fishtailing or find a smarter way to pull out of the skidHere are three observations1 Did Hillary Alter Her Message Yes  and it began with her opening statementClinton noted voters anger toward the economy isnt it more like frustration singling out young people as those most furious and sounded Bernielite in calling for unaccountable money to be taken out of the system and claiming that Americas economy is rigged for those at the top but certainly not those industrious souls giving sixfigure speechesCredit Clinton with waking up to 2016 reality Which didnt come easy  not until New Hampshires gobsmackingIn 1992 Bill Clinton had the luxury of running in a predigital time when the Democratic hard left beaten down after three presidential meltdowns offered little in the way of resistance In 2008 having voted for the Iraq war Hillary was too late to wake up to liberal Sturm und DrangIn 2016 Clinton understands the kooky old guy to the right of her on the University of WisconsinMilwaukee stage physically not philosophically is on to something  and she wants in on his actAnd so its official Hillary Feels the Bern    until Bernies out of the race2 Is Bernie Serious About Winning This We can quibble over the small stuff  like the batch of spending ideas doubling the national debt Or how hed win a single vote in CongressNot unlike Donald Trump Sanders is an implausibly electable candidate whos cornered the market on youre being ripped off simplicity The American people are tired of establishment politics tired of establishment economics  The problem preaching the Democratic socialist gospel isnt a blueprint for victory beyond the most lilywhite of Democratic electorates Sanders needs to call out Clinton in more glaring terms Otherwise hes gum on her shoe  a protest vote that wont win many states and as weve already seen postNew Hampshire will get rolled in the contest that counts most the delegate countTake the issue of illegal immigration as an example of how Sanders falls short In trying to clarify his 2007 Senate vote against a Senate reform plan he opted to get all prickly about childrens lives rather than prick holes in Clintons record  beginning with not being consistent on immigrationIt wasnt the only opening he missedSanders could have asked how Clinton could credibly bemoan the state of Black America having watched her husband sign welfare reform and federal sentencing laws or why she now espouses gay rights having opposed samesex marriage in 2008Sanders trump card  and Hillarys Achilles heel  is authenticity he believes what he says she says what she believes will win the momentIf Sanders wants to prevail beyond a random few states he has to drive home that argument Waiting until the debates closing minutes to remind Democrats that she ran against Obama not him doesnt cut it3 On Wisconsin    To Nevada and South Carolina The drinking game only a fool would have accepted imbibing whenever Clinton tossed a line to those voters she most immediately needs well that and Bernie saying billionaires or Wall StreetFor a Nevada thats almost 28 percent Latino 50 percent above the national average and votes on the Democratic side a week from Saturday Hardworking immigrant families living in fear who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better futureFor a South Carolina thats almost 28 percent black compared to 1 in New Hampshire and holds its Democratic primary the following Saturday AfricanAmericans who face discrimination in the job market education housing and the criminal justice systemToss in a shoutout here or there to women equal pay for equal work and Hillary was the grizzliest of pander bears Her jacket may have been acidyellow her intentions were transparently black and brownMilwaukee lays claim to several innovations  the first steel automobile frame and outboard gasoline engine the latter courtesy of a local named Ole Evinrude not to mention the icecream sundaeThe citys also home to sewer socialism and the idea that the natural counter to the Industrial Revolution was to spruce up society with new sanitation systems municipallyowned utilities and better schools and parksHillary Clintons challenge moving forward convincing her party that Bernies socialism is a losing proposition for her party even with the Democratic modifierAnd if that doesnt work in Nevada and South CarolinaThis race will wind up in the sewerBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford
