One of the goals of President Obamas State of the Union last night was to emphasize liberal issues such as gun control that could ease Hillary Clintons path to the White HouseBut first shes got to win the Democratic nomination and for the first time in this contest the mainstream media are considering the possibility that this isnt a slam dunkThe medias conventional wisdom has long been that Hillary might stumble in an early state or two but she was still a virtual lock to be the nominee But suddenly the punditry fueled by recent polls is starting to shift with news organizations now at least considering the possibility that this is a real raceThe Bernie phenomenon overshadowed by the Trump phenomenon hasnt really gotten its full due in the media And Bernie agrees having recently ripped the corporate media for giving his campaign a tiny fraction of the attention that The Donald getsHe has a point Although Sanders has been on the cover of Time the press has largely underplayed the fact that hes drawing huge crowds raised 73 million last year and is exciting the liberal grass roots And the reason is simple Virtually no one in the punditry universe believes that Sanders can win the nominationBut now come a spate of eyecatching polls A new Monmouth survey has Sanders leading Clinton by 14 points in New Hampshire on the heels of a Fox poll giving him a 13point leadWell the prognosticators have long expected that Sanders from neighboring Vermont would probably take New Hampshire But now comes a Quinnipiac poll showing Sanders with a 5point edge in IowaNow its true that Clinton has a much bigger advantage as the contest moves to bigger states where Sanders would not get many minority votes and her union backing would definitely help But if the heavily favored Hillary Clinton goes 0 for 2 in the first two contests would that create a media explosion and seriously wound her candidacyThe Washington Posts Chris Cillizza says that would be a total nightmare for Clinton Period Its also a lot more likely to go from fantasy to reality than most people  including most establishment Democrats  understandThats why Hillary has stopped treated Bernie as a nuisance and has sharpened her attacks In an Iowa appearance she said there is a big difference on guns between her and Sanders If you say stand up to special interests then stand up to the gun lobbyAnd its hard to believe that Clintons proposal yesterday to slap a 4 percent income tax surcharge on those earning more than 5 million a year wasnt influenced by Sanders soaktherich campaignSanders who has avoided attacking Clinton personally has been pushing back accusing her of running a panicky campaignMost journalists concluded that Sanders wasnt serious after the first Democratic debate when he took a key issue off the table by saying he was sick of hearing about her damn emails The media have pretty much treated him like Larry David ever sinceClinton is still the overwhelming favorite But for the first time in many months the press is questioning whether she might be derailedand someone else drawn into the race Im sure it was just a coincidence that Joe Biden just said that Bernie not Hillary has long been fighting against income inequalityHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
