President Barack Obama will not meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he travels to Washington in March the White House said Thursday one day after being caught offguard by Republicans invitation for the Israeli leader to address a joint session of CongressSpokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said that in keeping with longstanding practice and principle the president does not meet with heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their electionsAccordingly the president will not be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu because of the proximity to the Israeli election which is just two weeks after his planned address to the US Congress Meehan saidNetanyahu is scheduled to speak to Congress on March 3 and will push for additional sanctions on Iran He was initially scheduled to address lawmakers in February but the date was changed so that it could coincide with Netanyahus trip to Washington to address an annual conference held by AIPAC the proIsrael lobby group in early MarchThe invitation was a coordinated effort by House Speaker John Boehner ROhio and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy with staff discussions beginning last year according to a senior Republican aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to publicly discuss the private talksBoehner contacted the Israeli ambassador on Jan 8 to assess Netanyahus interest and received a positive response The GOP leaders reached out to the Israelis without consulting with the White House or State Department a move that appeared likely to deepen the White Houses already tense relations with congressional Republicans as well as the Israeli leaderObama has been urging Republicans as well as some members of his own party to hold off on passing new Iran sanctions legislation while the US and international partners are in the midst of nuclear negotiations with the Islamic republic Last week British Prime Minister David Cameron said he had been making a similar case to US lawmakersWhite House chief of staff Denis McDonough said Thursday that the nuclear negotiations were at a delicate phaseWe ought to give some time and space for that to work he saidNetanyahu stands to gain politically at home from the US visit He is in a tough fight to win reelection in Israels upcoming March vote Netanyahus Likud Party is running behind the main opposition group headed by Yitzhak Herzogs Labor Party which has been highlighting rancor in the countrys critical relationship with the United StatesHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was inappropriate for Boehner to invite Netanyahu to address Congress in the shadow of the election and give the appearance of endorsing the prime ministerIf thats the purpose of Prime Minister Netanyahus visit two weeks before his own election right in the midst of our negotiations I just dont think its appropriate and helpful Pelosi said
