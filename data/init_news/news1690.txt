WATCH As Chris Cuomo Tells Rudy Giuliani You Live In FactFree Trumpland By Andrew Bradford   There was a battle royale this morning on CNN and when it was over with host Chris Cuomo made sure Rudy Giuliani was reduced to rubble The interview began with Cuomo telling the former New York City mayor that he didnt smile very much at last weeks Al Smith charity dinner when Hillary Clinton took a few comedic jabs at him You looked like Grumpy Cat Sullen and sour Giuliani said Clinton should be in prison and wearing an orange jumpsuit But when Rudy began trying to filibuster Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server Giuliani wasnt entitled to make things up Next Giuliani began ranting about some bribe that predated the email controversy and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line  My entire life because youre so accurate and all of a sudden youre in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place As if he hadnt been embarrassed enough Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017 As a result because the Democrats forced this down the Republicans throat the ACA they decided to punish them And they wont work with the Democrats to fix any of the problems that they could fix Cuomo was ready for that line too and again lit into his guest  Oh thats a bunch of nonsense They created it themselves They cut out bipartisan support When it was over with you could tell by the look on Rudys face that he knew he had just been bested Maybe Trump should rethink letting the unhinged Giuliani be one of his main surrogates He really stinks at it Heres both parts of the interview Featured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford Andrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta A member of the Christian Left he has worked in the fields of academia journalism and political consulting His passions are art music food and literature He believes in equal rights and justice for all To see what else he likes to write about check out his blog at Deepleftfieldinfo Connect
