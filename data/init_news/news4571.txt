Update On March 13 2016I realized I was wrong about thisWhen not delighting in the epic meltdown of establishment Republican Party politics many people I know  my wife my boss etc  are expressing terror at the notion that Donald Trump might actually become president of the United StatesIm more sanguine Not out of any particular love for Trump but because hes actually running on a much less extreme agenda than his establishment rival Marco Rubio whos offering a platform of economic ruin multiple wars and an attack on civil liberties thats nearly as vicious as anything Trump has proposed  even while wrapping it in an edgy anxious overreactionprone approach to politics that heavily features big risky bets and huge unpredictable changes in directionRubio has proposed a tax cut that will reduce federal revenue by 68 trillion over 10 years Numbers that large dont mean anything to people so for comparisons sake lets say that if we entirely eliminated American military spending over that period we still couldnt quite pay for itBut of course Rubio doesnt want to eliminate military spending  he wants to spend more He also promises to avoid any cuts to Social Security and Medicare for people currently at or near retirement For good measure he is also proposing a balancedbudget amendment to the Constitution You could eliminate the entire nondefense discretionary budget and youd still need 100 billion to 200 billion more per year in cuts to make this workThis is of course totally unworkable And the process that led Rubio to this point is telling and troublingRubio entered the Senate at a time when an intellectual movement known as reform was hot in conservative circles which argued that Republicans should concentrate less on supplyside tax cuts and more on tax policy focused on the working class This originally took the form of a 24 trillion tax cut plan crafted by Utah Sen Mike Lee that Rubio signed on to but then kept transforming into a larger and more regressive tax cut as Rubio came under pressure from the supplyside wing of the party and it became clear that the constituency for reform conservatism was limited to a handful of media figures Eager to prove that his dalliance with the reformocons was over he actually ended up proposing to entirely eliminate taxes on investment income meaning that billionaire captains of industry could end up paying nothing at allThe upshot is a plan that is costly and regressive yet paired with other commitments around entitlements military spending and constitutional amendments that make it completely impossibleTrumps tax plan is even costlier than Rubios by most measures But in his defense he barely ever talks about it and hasnt compounded the cost problem with a balancedbudget amendment or a firm commitment to enormous quantities of new military spendingRubios approach to world affairs essentially repeats the lets have it all and who cares if it adds up mentality of his fiscal policy His solution to every problem is to confront some foreign country more aggressively with no regard to the idea of tradeoffs or tensions between goals or limits to how much the United States can bite off at any particular timeHed start things off by alienating Latin American allies by undoing the Obama administrations normalization of relations with Cuba in order to return to a decadeslong failed policy of isolationBut thats small potatoes compared with the consequences of Rubios pledge to cancel the nuclear deal with Iran on day one He isnt too worried that this will lead to Iran building a nuclear weapon because there will be a credible threat of military force if Iran decides to ramp up its program He also wants to deploy more American troops to Syria and Iraq to fight ISISHe wants to attack ships and aircraft bound for North Korea that are suspected of carrying material related to North Koreas nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programsHe is also hoping to convince China to help with the Korea situation but his China policy calls for tougher measures to stand on the side of freedom and human rights both inside China and on its peripheryHe also wants to send more weapons to Ukraine increase sanctions on Russia move more heavy weapons into Eastern Europe and clarify that there will be no USRussia cooperation in the fight against ISIL until Russia brokers the departure of Bashar alAssad from powerWe really did have a president who tried to govern this way for a year or two His name was George W Bush and starting some time in 2004 he realized it was unworkable With a larger army already occupying Iraq and a smaller one in Afghanistan there was no way to make coercive military force the main terms of relating to Iran and North Korea to say nothing of Russia and ChinaOver the next several years Bush steadily recognized the need to pull back and adopt a more realistic approach to dealing with the world Not everyone in the Republican Party was happy with this retrenchment and Rubio is essentially running as the candidate of that faction that wishes Condoleezza Rice never rose in stature to check Dick Cheneys influence and Robert Gates never came in to replace Don RumsfeldIn contrast to Rubio Trump is more prone to offering simply ignorant remarks but also has considerably more restrained instincts Trump essentially takes the worldconquering nationalism of George W Bush and turns it inward offering suspicion of outsiders and a reluctance to launch new wars This kind of quasiisolationist thinking isnt exactly my cup of tea but it certainly reduces the risk of utter catastrophe relative to a return to high BushismOf course what has most highminded liberals alarmed about Donald Trump isnt his tax or foreign policies  its his bashing of Muslims and immigrants to the United StatesBut while Rubio clearly didnt get into the race to push these issues his response to Trumps rise has been telling and alarming After the Paris attacks Trump vowed to shut down mosques where radical preaching might be taking placeRubio said that didnt go far enough and that a Rubio administration would be willing to stamp out Muslims freedom of assembly wherever it might present itself Hetold Fox NewsRubio said Trumps proposed ban on Muslim immigration wouldnt pass muster constitutionally but agrees we should block any Syrian refugees from entering the country Rubio also opposed a bipartisan effort to curb the National Security Agency mass surveillance and promises to permanently extend mass surveillance as presidentMost famously of course Rubio was a leading proponent of a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill until it became clear that hed underestimated the extent of conservative opposition to the idea and began furiously denouncing his own work Now Rubio is an enforcementfirst guy who takes such a dim view of both immigration and any concept of limits to the power of the federal government that he wants to cut off all federal funds to towns and cities whose local police departments have chosen to deprioritize immigration enforcement work in favor of crimes that do actual damage to human life and propertyUnder pressure from Ted Cruz Rubio is now promising to start deporting DREAMers as soon as he takes office Hes even turned a winknudge promise to bring back torture as an instrument of government policy into an applause line in debates and on the stumpNobody knows what lurks in Rubios heart on these matters of course But one could say the same about Trump What we do know for sure is that Rubios strategy for beating back the most repugnant aspects of Trumpism is to imitate themMore than any particular policy stance what is perhaps most troubling about the ebbs and flows of Rubios positioning is the larger picture they paint of a tendency toward systematic overreactionIn the wake of Rubios funnybutnotserious debate gaffe where he repeated the same canned line several times McKay Coppins wroteI sympathize with this a lot Two or three days before the launch of Voxcom I succumbed to my personal occasional propensity to panic and was insisting that we had to delay or cancel the debut of the site The good news is that more levelheaded voices prevailedThe even better news is that it is extremely unlikely that I am going to become president of the United States And I like to think that if the possibility did present itself my friends allies and advisers would have the good sense to politely suggest that a propensity to panic in moments of crisis both real and imagined is not a great quality in a chief executive and that addressing the substantive concern would be a more valuable contribution to the nation than laboring to keep it from public viewBut so far playing his hand aggressively has paid off for Rubio He beat a sitting governor to get into the Senate and has displaced his own mentor as the favorite of the party establishment Many of Rubios moves have looked reckless but many of them have paid off And reckless moves that didnt pay off  like the reformocon tax cut or the Gang of Eight immigration bill  havent killed him either because he was able to swing hard and fast enough in the other direction to stay aliveAs president Rubio would likely stick with the approach thats worked for him so far  gambling hard and counting on his ability to swerve sharply if something like launching his presidency by provoking a major international crisis around Iran turns out to create some problemsIf were all very lucky it just might work But I have some concerns
