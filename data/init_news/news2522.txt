Gary Johnson is the presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party and a former governor of New Mexico The views expressed are his own Watch CNNs Libertarian Town Hall with Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on Wednesday at 9 pm ETCNN What does it say about the level of discontent in our country that a professional salesman can launch a presidential campaign with a promise to build our very own Great Wall of China and a vague promise to make America great again  and become the Republican standardbearerAnd the Democrats It is long overdue that we have a woman as a legitimate contender for the White House But Hillary Clinton is the definition of the establishment so many are determined to rejectWhat does all this tell me It tells me that America may finally be ready for a presidential candidate who believes in the free market but rejects crony capitalism They may be ready for a candidate who actually governed a border stateand DOESNT believe that a Great Wall is a substitute for immigration reform that todays politicians cannot summon the courage to enactOf course I finished my second term as governor of New Mexico more than a decade ago  back in 2003 And when I left office I was doneI had been elected governor when everyone said I didnt have a chance A businessman who had never sought or held elected office running as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state My prospects for success were dismissed by pretty much everyoneBut I worked hard and told New Mexicans what I would do if elected Reduce the size of the government cut taxes and apply businesslike common sense to the job of governing My state elected me I did what I said I would do and they reelected me by an even bigger margin After that second term I walked away to resume what was  and is  a pretty good lifeI have had the good fortune to be able to climb the highest mountain on each of the seven continents I have enjoyed the freedom I had gained from building a successful business from scratch making some money and creating the lifestyle I wantedAs for being governor I did what I said I would do I told people the truth and I tried to run the state the same way I ran my business and my life Dont promise what you cant deliver Deliver what you can on time and under budget And most of all dont waste anyones time or money I vetoed bills we didnt need nor couldnt afford  750 of them To this day some call me Governor VetoI enjoyed being governor I didnt enjoy the politics but it was satisfying to make a difference in peoples lives force debates on issues that needed to be discussed and put the principles of smaller government and greater freedom into practiceAfter my service as governor was finished I largely stayed away from politics I went home pursued my passions for skiing and cycling climbed Mount Everest built my dream house and enjoyed my freedomBut there was a big problem I found I could not sit on the couch and watch as the politicians in Washington Republican and Democrat alike ran up trillions in debt sent our young men and women into harms way to fight illadvised wars and turned our government from a protector of freedom into a threat that is intruding into virtually every aspect of our personal and financial livesI couldnt stand by and do nothing I had my freedom and I had my comfortable life but I couldnt accept the fact that the politicians were making it increasingly difficult for my kids and millions of others to achieve their dreams as I had achieved mineSo in 2012 I ran for president  But it became clear rather quickly that the system wasnt ready for my kind of classical liberalism I tried to run as a Republican but didnt fit into the mold demanded by the Republican primary gauntlet I couldnt evangelize about family values that may be wonderful personal values but that are frankly none of the governments business I couldnt talk about increasing defense spending at a time when we are broke And I had to tell the truth about entitlements that must be reformed if we are ever to balance the federal budgetSo I went home to the Libertarian Party Libertarians broadly speaking are fiscally conservative and socially liberal Running as the candidate who could unapologetically advocate those principles was well liberating I didnt win but I garnered more votes than any Libertarian candidate in historyAlong the way I learned a lot about the American people Americans are fed up with politicians who lie who dont really want to change anything and for whom being elected and reelected are ends in themselvesMillennials  who will soon be a full onethird of American adults  may be especially ready to become engaged in politics with a candidate who wants to give them a government that will leave them alone and get its finances in order so that they dont inherit an economic collapseBut all Americans who are rightfully and deeply concerned that a feckless foreign policy is allowing the likes of ISIS to not only threaten our safety but humiliate us may be ready for a candidate who will pursue realitybased foreign and military policies that actually fulfill governments most basic responsibility to keep us  and our freedoms  safeSo  for those who are asking Why am I running for president in 2016 the answer is simple I believe America might be ready for something  and somebody  different
