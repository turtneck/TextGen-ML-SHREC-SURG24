For many Americans who have long felt threatened the election of Donald Trump raises deepseated fears that they could again become targets of hatred and prejudiceDemonstrators protest against Presidentelect Donald Trump in front of the Trump International Hotel in Washington ThursdayA Muslim mother of four Nadia has for the most part escaped overt racism in her tiny hometown about an hour outside New YorkBut lately her 8yearold daughter has been having nightmares Amid calls during the presidential campaign to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States it feels like something has changed in the atmosphere says Nadia who asks that her last name not be usedAt a parentteacher conference last week a student 8 or 9 years old came up to her and said When Donald Trump gets elected youre going to get deported she saysThere was no question to her where the behavior came from and on Tuesday night it felt like voters sent her an inescapable message That behavior was an acceptable part of the new AmericaWe have these nobullying initiatives and then we are showing kids that bullies can win Nadia says I dont know how we can reconcile that in the futureOn Wednesday night and again Thursday shock sadness anger and fear spilled across the nation in protests against the election of Mr TrumpTens of thousands of demonstrators marched lighted fires and chanted antiTrump slogans The boldest and brashest talked of secession on social media But for many like Nadia acceptance has come in waves of bitter disbeliefTo them the election of Trump directly contradicts the values they cherish and associate with America Interviews with women people of color immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community across the country reveal deepseated fears that Trumps words and behavior have too often embodied what they have spent their lives opposing racism sexism homophobia and a white patriarchy that for centuries has shared its power only reluctantlyIn the wake of Tuesdays election these voters  particularly in liberal cities and states  are struggling to come to grips with a nation they say they hardly recognize Americas promise to embrace all before so bright now seems perceptibly dimmerThere was a staggering amount of shock says Raphael Sonenshein executive director of the Edmund G Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University Los Angeles This was an extraordinarily intense campaign and were seeing a lot of angst and concern especially in communities that were talked about in a negative wayAs a woman of mixed black and Persian parentage Shirin Shoai identified deeply with President Obama in both 2008 and 2012 This year she had connected as a woman with Hillary Clinton  and been appalled by Trumps offhand remarks about sexual assaultOn Wednesday morning she couldnt believe what she saw when she woke upThe notion that millions of her fellow citizens could support Trump was frightening for what it said about the depth of the divide within America she says As a psychotherapist in Berkeley Calif her job is to forge connections between people She wonders now if the nation is capable of itI think its going to take a lot of work to get us together as a country Ms Shoai says It requires a kind of empathy and availability to that other person that I dont know on a national scale that we haveFor Jessie Earl the concern stems from the discrimination she has faced as a transgender woman In many ways she has been fortunate she says Even in the small conservative town in New York State where she grew up she was often surrounded by supportive friends and family Still the sting of bigotry is familiarLast week she went into a bathroom in a building close to the Los Angeles office where she works as a digital editor A woman upon seeing her said loudly that it seemed a man had made his way into the ladies room A supervisor was called in who defused the situation Ms Earl saysBut that was terrifying to me she says I wanted to hideEarl worries that Trump through his words and actions would legitimize that sort of discriminationItll tell people that that behavior is acceptable she says And while she lives in Southern California where such incidents are less likely to take place she knows that others are not so fortunateI have friends in North Carolina who are transgender she says I dont want them to live in a society that says its OK to ostracize themAmong immigrants and the Hispanic community the fear of what a Trump administration might mean is perhaps even more palpableTwo years ago USborn Paola Hernandez married Emmanuel Ramirez and now the Tucson Ariz couple has an 18monthold daughter But Mr Ramirez is here illegally having sneaked across the USMexico border 14 years agoHe can apply for legal status through his wife But he hasnt begun the process because he cant afford to hire an attorney which can cost 8000 Ramirez a native of Mexico has worked for years as a dishwasher and cookTrump said he would do raids and there are so many families that would be affected because were here illegally says RamirezThe risk of estrangement is more emotional than physical for Debbie YenThe millennial daughter of ChineseAmerican immigrants in Californias Orange County Ms Yen says her parents shaped who she has become  teaching her to value integrity to stay calm in the face of adversity and to take the high roadBut they voted for a man that to her embodies the opposite of all those thingsI cant help but feel disappointed in them says Yen a freelancer who works in production Everything that Ive been raised up to this point to be is the exact opposite of what Trump has done and said and been throughout his campaignAmid the disillusionment however most of those interviewed said they wanted to learn from the loss keep fighting for progress and  perhaps most importantly  reach out to the other sideI understand the anger the feeling of betrayal says Earl in Los Angeles But it doesnt help if you just yell at someone That just adds to the environment of not listening that led the country to where it is in the first placeHer new goal she says is to engage more with people who view the world differently than she does She doesnt believe everyone who voted for Trump is a bad person but she does want to better understand where theyre coming fromWe dont expose ourselves to other peoples ideas So were not seeing each other as people she saysShoai the Berkeley therapist plans to start working with a group called Sidewalk Talk which invites people on the street to stop and share their feelings for about 10 minutes She laughs sheepishly as she explains the conceptThings like that that sound really woohoo soft Shoai says But we just need to be more vocal about that stuff If half of the country is feeling really left behind theres something going on that we need to know aboutThats sort of my sadness and my hopeNadia also urges action Weve been sitting on the sidelines for too long she says If were going to turn this around we have get out thereTo make her own small mark she intends to run in her towns next school board elections And she hopes others across the country  especially the millions of people who voted with a vision of a united America  will take similar stepsWe are Americans she adds We define what America will beLourdes
