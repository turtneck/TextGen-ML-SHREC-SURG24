A truck bomb detonates in a lively street congested with pedestrians headed to markets and school kids making their way home The blast is temporarily deafening and the shock knocks people to their kneesThose able to pull themselves up describe a disorienting moment of stillnessa ringing in their ears that drowns out the chaos the shattered bones and the crumbling of nearby buildings into a dusty mess of rebar and brick But the quiet like a slow motion scene in a movie quickly gives way to confusion and frenetic activity the ringing gives way to a blurring amalgamation of screaming and sirensThis scene is too frequent familiar as an al Qaeda AQ tactic and again with its newest incarnation ISIS Headlines are dominated by everruthless brutality senseless violence and unspeakable injustice the audaciousness of which leaves us baffledThis isnt really new Genghis Khans audacity and brutality unnerved his foes into submissionBut part of it is very newAlthough tiny compared to the Mongol hordes operating with apparent orchestrated synergy ISIS is seemingly everywhere Deft battlefield advances interwoven with terrorist strikes create a frightening kinetic reality that flies and multiplies across 21st century connectivity to assault our senses and undermine our confidence Like savvy investors ISIS uses speed and digital leverage to geometrically increase their perceived powerAnd in war perception is realityIn our fight against al Qaeda in Iraq in 2004 we found our elite teamwith worldclass technology training and intelligencewas losing to a comparatively ragtag group We pulled all the traditional leversmore personnel raids and intelligenceto no avail The ringing in our ears was too frequent too disorientingThe solution we discovered was internalFaced with a 21st century threat we faced the hard realization that being a great team was not enough We learned through painful trial and error the necessity of transforming into a system that mirrored the speed and interconnectedness of the distributed networks we were facingWethe US government international community and forces on the groundhave all the tools and resources required to defeat ISIS and any of its future manifestations What we dont have is an organized unified approach and structure to harness our collective will resources personnel equipment intelligence policy and diplomatic efforts to defeat them Success demands connecting an everdispersed and intricate organization into a Team of TeamsThis will require a fundamental shift in the way we organize ourselves the traditional command and control structures of large organizations like the government military or corporations were developed to provide order and efficiency at scale But this comes at cost of speed and decentralized decisionmaking Even in a hierarchical command of teams decisions tend to be made at higher levels A Team of Teams approach to create networked structures spreads valuable contextual information and empowers individuals closest to the problem to react in real time At its core it makes us adaptableIn Iraq we were driven to connect across boundaries in completely new ways break silos to solve problems and execute faster than we ever thought possible This didnt happen overnight it took us the better part of five years to transform the way our organization operatedDefeating ISIS necessitates a new operating model but also to recognize that ISIS isnt a singular challenge but rather the byproduct of a new order defined by complexity It is essential to imbue our organizations with adaptability the challenges will continue to mutate and we need to adapt alongside There cant be a temporary taskforce or unit to defeat ISIS that is dismantled when the mission is complete The new mission needs to foster a Team of Teams otherwise well find ourselves knocked to our knees time and againStanley McChrystal retired from the US Army as a fourstar general after more than thirtyfour years of service His last assignment was as the commander of all American and coalition forces in Afghanistan His memoir My Share of the Task was a New York Times bestseller He is coauthor of the new book Team of Teams New Rules of Engagement for a Complex World PortfolioPenguin May 12 2015 He is a senior fellow at Yale Universitys Jackson Institute for Global Affairs and the cofounder of CrossLead a leadership consulting firm
