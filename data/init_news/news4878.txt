Originally appeared at The American Conservative Donald Trump played a wily capitalistic trick on his Republican opponents in the primary fights this yearhe served an underserved market By now its a clich that Trump while on his way to the GOP nomination tapped into an unnoticed reservoir of rightofcenter opinion on domestic and economic concernsnamely the populistnationalists who felt left out of the reigning marketlibertarianism of the last few decades Indeed of the 17 Republicans who ran this year Trump had mostly to himself the populist issues that is opposition to open borders to free trade and to earnedentitlement cutting When the other candidates were zigging toward the familiarand unpopularChamber of Commerceapproved orthodoxy Trump was zagging toward the voters Moreover the same sort of populistnationalist reservoirtapping was evident in the realm of foreign affairs To put it in bluntly Trumpian terms the New Yorker hit em where they werent The fact that Trump was doing something dramatically different became clear in the makeorbreak Republican debate in Greenville SC on February 13 Back in those early days of the campaign Trump had lost one contest Iowa and won one New Hampshire and it was still anybodys guess who would emerge victorious During that debate Trump took what seemed to be an extraordinary gamble he ripped into George W Bushs nationalsecurity recordin a state where the 43rd president was still popular Speaking of the Iraq War Trump said George Bush made a mistake We can make mistakes But that one was a beauty We should have never been in Iraq We have destabilized the Middle East And then Trump went further aiming indirectly at the former president while slugging his brother Jeb directly The World Trade Center came down during your brothers reign remember that In response Jeb intoned the usual Republican line He kept us safe And others on the stage in Greenville that night rushed to associate themselves with Bush 43 In the aftermath of this verbal melee many thought that Trump had doomed himself As one unnamed Republican strategist chortled to Politico Trumps attack on President George W Bush was galacticlevel stupid in South Carolina Well not quite Trump triumphed in the Palmetto State primary a week later winning by a 10point margin Thus as we can see in retrospect something had changed within the GOP After 911 in the early years of this century South Carolinians had been eager to fight Yet by the middle of the second decade theyor at least a plurality of themhad grown weary of endless foreign war Trumps victory in the Palmetto State was decisive yet it was nevertheless only a plurality 325 percent Meanwhile Sen Marco Rubio running as an unabashed neocon hawk finished second So we can see that the Republican foreignpolicy market is now segmented And while Trump proved effective at targeting crucial segments they werent the only segmentsbecause in actuality there are four easily identifiable blocs on the foreignpolicy right And as we delineate these four segments we can see that while some are highly organized and tightly articulate others are loose and inchoate First the libertarians That is the Cato Institute and other freemarket think tanksReason magazine and so on Libertarians are not so numerous around the country but they are strong among the intelligentsia Second the oldright isolationists These folks also known as paleocons often find common ground with libertarians yet their origins are different and so is their outlook Whereas the libertarians typically have issued a blanket anathema to all foreign entanglements the isolationists have been more selective During World War I for example their intellectual forbears were hostile to US involvement on the side of the Allies but that was often because of specifically antiEnglish or proGerman sentiments not because they felt guided by an overall principle of nonintervention Indeed the same isolationists were often eager to intervene in Latin America and in the Far East More recently the temperamentally isolationist bloc has joined with the libertarians in opposition to deeper US involvement in the Middle East Third the traditional hawks On the proverbial Main Street USA plenty of peoplenot limited to the activeduty military veterans and lawenforcersbelieve that Americas national honor is worth fighting for Fourth the neoconservatives This group which takes hawkishness to an avantgarde extreme is so praised and so criticized that theres little that needs be added here Yet we can say this as with the libertarians they are concentrated in Washington DC by contrast out beyond the Beltway they are relatively scarce Because of their connections to big donors to both parties however they have been powerful even preeminent in foreignpolicy circles over the last quartercentury Yet today its the neocons who feel most threatened by and most hostile to the Trump phenomenon We can pause to offer a contextual point floating somewhere among the first three categorieslibertarians isolationists hawksare the foreignpolicy realists These of course are the people following in the tradition of the great scholar Hans Morgenthau who pride themselves on seeing the world as it is regarding foreign policy as just another application of Bismarckian wisdomthe art of the possible The realists disproportionately academics and thinktankers are a savvy and wellcredentialed groupor according to critics cynical and worldweary Yet either way they have made many alliances with the aforementioned trio of groups even as they have usually maintained their ideological flexibility To borrow the celebrated wisdom of the 19thcentury realpolitiker Lord Palmerston realists dont have permanent attachments they have permanent interests And so it seems likely that if Trump winsor anyone like Trump in the futuremany realists will be willing to emerge from their woodpaneled precincts to engage in the hurlyburly of public service Returning to our basic quartet of blocs we can quickly see that two of them the libertarians and the neocons have been loudly successful in the battle of ideas That is almost everyone knows where the libertarians and the neocons stand on the controversies of the moment Meanwhile the other two groupsthe isolationists and the traditional hawkshave failed to make themselves heard That is until Trump For the most part the isolationists and hawks have not been organized theyve just been clusters of veterans cops gun owners and likeminded souls gathering here and there feeling strongly about the issues but never finding a national megaphone Indeed even organized groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars sizable as they might be have had little impact of late on foreign affairs This paradoxical realitythat even big groups can be voiceless allowing smaller groups to carry the dayis well understood Back in 1839 the historian Thomas Carlyle observed of his Britain The speaking classes speak and debate while the deepburied working class lies like an Enceladusa mythological giant imprisoned under a volcano Yet Carlyle continued the giant under the volcano will not stay silent forever one day it will erupt and the inevitable eruption has to produce earthquakes In our time Trump has provoked the Enceladuslike earthquake Over the past year while the mainstream media has continued to lavish attention on the fine points of libertarianism and neoconservatism the Peoples of the Volcano have blown up American politics Trump has spoken loudly to both of his groups To the isolationists he has highlighted his past opposition to the Iraq and Libya misadventures as well as his suspicions about NATO and other alliances Here the libertarians too are on board At the same time he has also talked the language of the hawks as when he has said Take the oil and Bomb the bleep out of them Trump has also attacked the Iran nuclear agreement deriding it as one of the worst deals ever made Thus earlier this year Trump mobilized the isolationists and the hawks leaving the libertarians to Rand Paul and the neocons to Rubio Now as we move to the general election it appears that Trump has kept the loyalty of his core groups Many libertarians meanwhile are voting for Gary Johnsonthe former Republican governor at the top of the Libertarian Partys ticketand they are being joined most likely as a oneoff by disaffected Republicans and Democrats Meanwhile the neocons most of them have become the objective allies if not the overt supporters of Hillary Clinton Even if Trump loses his energized supporters having found their voice will be a new and important force within the GOPa force that could make it significantly harder for a future president to say liberate and democratize Syria  Yet now we must skip past the unknown unknowns of the election and ask what might we expect if Trump becomes president One immediate point to be borne in mind is that it will be a challenge to fill the cabinet and the subcabinetto say nothing of the thousands of Schedule C positions across the administrationwith true Trump loyalists Yes of course if Trump wins that means he will have garnered 50 million or more votes but still the number of people who have the right credentials and can pass all the background checksincluding for most of the top jobs Senate confirmationis minuscule So here we might single out the foreignpolicy realists as likely having a bright future in a Trump administration after all they are often wellcredentialed and by their nature have prudently tended to keep their antiTrump commentary to a minimum Theres a piece of insidetheBeltway realist wisdom that seems relevant here Youre for what happens Yet the path to realist dominion in a Trump administration is not smooth As a group they have been in eclipse since the Bush 41 era so an entire generation of their cadres is missing The realists do not have long lists of ageappropriate alumni ready for another spin through the revolving door By contrast the libertarians have lots of young staffers on some thinktank payroll or another And of course the neocons have lots of experience and contactsyes they screwed up the last time they were in power but at least they know the jargon Thus unless presidentelect Trump makes a genuinely heroic effort to infuse his administration with new blood he will end up hiring a lot of folks who might not really agree with himand who perhaps even have strongly if quietly opposed him That means that the path of a Trump presidency could be channeled in an unexpected direction as the adherents of other foreignpolicy schoolsincluding conceivably schools from the leftclamber aboard As they say in DC personnel is policy Still Trump has a strong personality and its entirely possible that as president he will succeed in imprinting his unique will on his appointees On the other hand the career government starting with the State Departments foreign service officers might well prove to be a different story Looking further ahead as a hypothetical President Trump surveys the situation from the Sit Room here are nine things that will be in view 1 Trump will recall always that the Bush 43 presidency drove itself into a ditch on Iraq So he will surely see the supreme value of not sending US ground troopsbeyond a few advisorsinto Middle Eastern war zones 2 Trump will also realize that Barack Obama for all his talk about hope and change ended up preserving the bulk of Bush 43s policies The only difference is that Obama did it on the cheap reducing defense spending as he went along Obama similar to Bushreally Yes To be sure Obama dropped all of Bushs democratic messianism but even with his cool detachment he kept all of Bushs alliances and commitments including those in Afghanistan and Iraq And then he added a new international commitment climate change In other words America now has a policy of quintuple containment Russia China Iran ISISalQaeda and of course the carbondioxide molecule Many would argue that today we arent managing any of these containments well others insist that the Obama administration perversely seems most dedicated to the containment of climate change everything else can fall apart but if the Obamans can maintain the illusion of their international CO2 deals as far as they are concerned all will be well In addition Uncle Sam has another hundred or so minor commitmentsincluding bilateral defense treaties with countries most Americans have never heard of along with special commitments to champion the rights of children women dissidents endangered species etc On a onebyone basis its possible to admire many of these efforts on a cumulative basis its impossible to imagine how we can sustain all of them 3 A populist president like Trump will further realize that if the US has just 4 percent of the worlds population and barely more than a fifth of world GDP its not possible that we can continue to police the planet Yes we have many allieson paper Yet Trumps critique of many of them as feckless even faithless resonated for one big reason it was true So Trump will likely begin the process of rethinking US commitments around the world Do we really want to risk nuclear war over the Spratly Islands Or the eastern marches of Ukraine Here Trump might well default to the wisdom of the realists big powers are just thatbig powersand so one must deal with them in all their authoritarian essentiality And as for all the other countries of the worldsome we like and some we dontwere not going to change them either Although in some cases notably Iraq and Syria partition supervised by the great powers may be the only solution 4 Trump will surely see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his lifemaking deals This instinct will serve him well in two ways first he will be sharply separating himself from his predecessors Bush the hotblooded unilateralist warofchoicer and Obama the cool and detached multilateralist leaderfrombehind Second his dealmaking desire will inspire him do what needs to be done build rapport with world leaders as a prelude to making things happen To cite one immediate example theres no way that we will ever achieve anything resembling peace with honor in Afghanistan without the full cooperation of the Talibans masters in Pakistan Ergo the needed deal must be struck in Islamabad not Kabul Almost certainly a President Trump will treat China and Russia as legitimate powers not as rogue states that must be singlehandedly tamed by America Moreover Trumps dealmaking trope also suggests that instead of sacrificing American economic interests on the altar of US leadership he will view the strengthening of the American economy as central to American greatness 5 Trump will further realize that his friends the realists have had a blind spot of late when it comes to economic matters Once upon a timethat is in the 19th centuryeconomic nationalism was at the forefront of American foreignpolicy making In the old days as Americas Manifest Destiny stretched beyond the continental US expansionism and Hamiltonianism went together as they used to say trade follows the flag Theodore Roosevelts digging of the Panama Canal surely ranks as one of the most successful fusions of foreign and economic policy in American history Yet in the past few decades the economic nationalists and the foreignpolicy realists have drifted apart For example a Reagan official Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute has been mostly ignored by the realists who have instead embraced the conventional elite view of free trade and globalization So a President Trump will have the opportunity to reunite realism and economic nationalism he can once again put manufacturing exports for example at the top of the US agenda Indeed Trump might consider other economicnationalist gambits for example if we are currently defending such wealthy countries as Kuwait Saudi Arabia and Norway why arent they investing some of the trillions of dollars in their sovereignwealth funds into say American infrastructure 6 Trump will also come into power realizing that he has few friends in the foreignpolicy establishment after all most establishmentarians opposed him vehemently Yet that could turn out to be a real plus for the 45th president because it could enable him to discard the stodgy and outworn thinking of the experts In particular he could refute the prevailing view that the US is and always must be the benign hegemon altruistically policing the world while allowing its allies satellitesand even rivalsto manufacture everything and thereby generate the jobs profits and knowhow That was always of course a view that elevated the ambitions and pretensions of the American elite over the wellbeing of the larger US populationand maybe Trump can come up with a better and fairer vision 7 As an instinctive dealmaker Trump will have the capacity to clear away the underbrush of accumulated obsolete doctrines and dogmas To cite just one small but tragic example theres the dopey chain of thinking that has guided US policy toward South Sudan Today we officially condemn both sides in that countrys ongoing civil war Yet we might ask how can that work out well for American interests After all one side or the other is going to win and we presumably want a friend in Juba not a Chineseaffiliated foe On the larger canvas Trump will observe that if the US China and Russia are the three countries capable of destroying the world then its smart to figure out amodus vivendi among this threesome Such practical dealmaking of course would undermine the moralistic narrative that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are the potentates of new evil empires 8 Whether or not hes currently familiar with the terminology Trump seems likely to recapitulate the multipolar system envisioned by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s Back then the multipolar vision included the US the USSR Western Europe China and Japan Yet multipolarity was lost in the 80s as the American economy was Reaganized the Cold War grew colder and the Soviet Union staggered to its selfimplosion Then in the 90s we had the unipolar moment when the US enjoyed hyperpower primacy Yet as with all moments unipolarity soon passed undone by the Iraq quagmire Americas economic stagnation and the rise of other powers So today multipolarity seems destined to reemerge with a slightly upgraded cast of players the US China Russia the European Union and perhaps India 9 And of course Trump will have to build that wall along the USMexican border  Some might object that I am reading too much into Trump Indeed the conventional wisdom even today maintains that Trump is visceral not intellectual that he is buffoonish not Kissingerian To such critics this Trump supporter feels compelled to respond when has the conventional wisdom about the New Yorker been proven correct Its not easy to become president In all of US history just 42 individuals have been elected to the presidencyor to the vice presidency and succeeded a fallen president That is indeed an exclusive club Or as Trump himself might say its not a club for dummies If Trump does in fact become the 45th president then by definition he will have proven himself to be pretty darn strategic And thats a portent that bodes well for his foreign policy Did you enjoy this article  Consider helping us Russia
