I have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking he explained But as president of the United States I would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate Iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing  if and only if it can advance the interests of the United StatesOn Tuesday morning seven years after that address the logical endpoint of the worldview Obama outlined at AIPAC was achieved Speaking from the White House at 7 am Obama announced the conclusion of nuclear negotiations in which Iran agreed to dramatically downsize its nuclear infrastructure in exchange for sweeping sanctions relief from the US and the international community Once the deal is implemented Iran will have slashed the number of centrifuges it spins and disposed of the bulk of its stockpile of uranium which can be enriched to use as fuel for a bomb It will also be bound to intrusive inspections by the UN and subject to the reimposition of sanctions if it is found to be reneging on its commitments under the dealThe president has staked his reputation on this foolish errand and I predicted all along that they would cave in to whatever it was in the end  Over time history will judge it very harshly said Sen John McCain RAriz who hammered Obama for his foreign policy naivety during the campaign in 2008 and who during that election infamously sang to the tune of that old Beach Boys song Bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb IranIf he had two main themes during the campaign to put it simplistically it was We arent going to get stuck in stupid wars and that we are going to engage our adversaries in diplomacy said Brian Katulis a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress He has more or less done both and this Iran deal comes at the end of a prolonged diplomatic process with Iran but after a string of engagement with other countriesWhen Obama first declared hed negotiate with adversaries it was by accident  an unprompted declaration during a Democratic primary debate  and it set his campaign into a minor tailspin We did not expect him to say that former Obama spokesman Bill Burton told The Huffington Post of that debate moment We were like Oh my God How do we walk it back Former Secretary of State Madeline Albrights attacking usAfter just two months in office Obama took the unconventional step of sending Iranians a holiday message on Nowruz the Iranian new year For nearly three decades relations between our nations have been strained he said But on this holiday we are reminded of the common humanity that binds us together Shifting his focus from the Iranian people to the Iranian leadership Obama looked into the camera My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before usWe managed to convince the world said Ilan Goldenberg who worked on Iran at the Pentagon between 2009 and 2012 Up until that point it was Is Iran being obstinate or is it the US Obama was able to demonstrate that we were open and negotiating in good faith Which in turn allowed us to build up support for the sanctions regime he added referring to the eventual coalition of nations that agreed to sanction Iran  including reluctant countries like Russia and ChinaBut the Obama foreign policy portfolio was always more robust than just a pledge to negotiate with enemies And even as he was reaching out to Iran Obamas instincts seemed to guide him away from the very positioning that defined his campaign As Dr Edward Levine who spent over 30 years as a staffer on the foreign relations and intelligence committee in the Senate put it Engagement is one tool in the toolboxWhen he won the Nobel Peace Prize shortly after taking office Obama gave a speech that to the surprise of many served as a defense of war On one of his first major decisions he authorized a major escalation of US troops in Afghanistan to the gratification of his military advisers Drone operations expanded dramatically in both frequency and geographic scope And in 2011 he signed off on US airstrikes in Libya to both prevent a humanitarian slaughter and to expedite the ouster of Col Muammar GaddafiAccording to advisers it was the latter decision more than the others that prompted rethinking within the administration about overall foreign policy strategy The ease of the intervention was eclipsed only by the messiness of the aftermath And soon enough the voices of those inside the administration advocating for caution multilateralism and retrenchment  to borrow the phrasing of critics  were ascendentYou had different schools of thought in the administration said Richard Haass president of the Council on Foreign Relations Youve had humanitarian interventionism which got you to do more in Afghanistan initially and more in Libya And then you had the retrenchment mentality which led you to not follow up in Libya to have these calendarbased withdrawals rather than conditionbased withdrawals from places like Iraq and Afghanistan So I think theres been competing impulses You articulate a pivot to Asia but you dont do a whole lot to make it real So I just think there is all along then a kind of duality to the foreign policy
