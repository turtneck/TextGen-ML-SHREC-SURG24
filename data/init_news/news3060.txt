  With Hillary Clinton making history this election season by becoming the first women nominated by a major party the sexism has been on full display The misogynists on the Right have questioned her health her stamina and everything in between That is of course code for the little woman doesnt belong in the Oval Office However one Texas Republican has taken the misogyny to a whole other level Meet Sid Miller the Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas He is also a former lawmaker Miller like most Republicans doesnt make his hatred for Hillary Clinton any secret Instead he somehow thought that it was perfectly appropriate to take to Twitter and express his feelings in a most disgusting way while tweeting about the polls Millers tweet reads TRUMP 44 Cunt 43 punctuated with a cheering Go Trump Go In the predictable firestorm after Miller tried to make the public believe that his account was hacked Millers staff hastily relesed this defense of his post The campaign was retweeting information today and inadvertently retweeted a tweet that they were not aware contained a derogatory term The tweet was taken down as soon as possible Commissioner Miller finds the term vulgar and offensive and apologizes to anyone who may have seen it Theres a problem with that though The tweet was not a retweet It was simply a tweet Therefore either Sid Miller himself or someone on his staff wrote this Naturally Miller is Donald Trumps number one man in Texas according to the Texas Tribune  No surprise there Further Miller is no stranger to making tasteless and offensive jokes with regards to Hillary Here is one that is just a few hours old as of this writing That tweet written in reference to the fact that the reason Hillarys emails are in the news again is because of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiners sexting scandals So in other words this Sid Miller character is the perfect Donald Trump supporter  a misogynistic and deeply ignorant asshat who cant stand the idea of losing to a woman Featured image via screen capture from The Daily Beast Share this Article
