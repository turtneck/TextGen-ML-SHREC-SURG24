Theres nothing quite like playing in front of the hometown crowd to get your mojo back And thats exactly what Donald Trump did in the New York primary Tuesday winning 61 of 62 counties and all but one congressional district en route to scooping up 90 delegatesIn the end Trumps resounding victory may have been as vital to the tone of the race coverage as it was to his actual path to the Republican nomination After a month of taking on water thanks to staff shakeups organizing failures and a big loss in Wisconsin The Donald trounced his rivals in the media capital of the worldBut its probably not enough as he tries to secure the 1237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination before reaching the GOP convention in Cleveland The most likely scenario will have Trump getting about 1185 delegates Heres whyNew York marks a crucial geographic segue in the race as the calendar turns away from the Ted Cruzfriendly interior and into Trumps midAtlantic wheelhouse With 156 bound delegates at stake next Tuesday the test for Cruz and John Kasich will be how many they can pick offYou can start by penciling in 39 delegates for Trump as the likely statewide winner in Delaware Pennsylvania and Maryland Exceeding the 50 percent mark in Connecticut would mean another 13 delegates who would otherwise be split among the fieldAnd Trump can expect to win about half of Rhode Islands 19 proportionally allotted delegates The rest will be awarded to the respective winners of each congressional districtThe best delegatepoaching opportunity for Kasich comes in the affluent Maryland suburbs of Washington DC where polls show Trump dead last behind Cruz Winning three or four districts between the Beltway and the Connecticut Gold Coast would be a big success The best news for Trump opponents is that the single biggest trove of delegates will be the 54 unbound Pennsylvanians elected independently of candidate affiliation or obligation While many have pledged to support the winner of the state or their district all would be in play in Cleveland a wrinkle that complicates Trumps pathTrump would be wise to maximize his April opportunities Other than New Jersey on June 7 there are no more gimmes and few opportunities to reap a disproportionate share of delegates even from those states Trump might win The Mountain West has been inhospitable terrain The Pacific Northwest states split their delegates proportionally And even West Virginia in the heart of Trumps Appalachian sweet spot has a delegate system so complicated that he may come away shortchangedThe bellwether to watch will be Indiana The criminally underpolled state holds promise both for Trump open primary bluecollar sensibilities and his opponents affluent Indianapolis suburbs for Kasich grassroots conservatives and evangelicals for Cruz and awards 30 atlarge delegates to the statewide winner If Cruz can reprise the Midwestern magic that carried him in Wisconsin he can stop the Trump offensive in its tracks Short of that he and Kasich must peel away as many congressional districts as possible to prevent Trump from heading into June needing only a glorified chip shot to clinchIn the end the race will come down to California and its massive cache of 172 delegates in what will amount to 53 unpredictable miniprimaries across disparate terrain Ninety delegates will be awarded in districts where President Obama received 60 percent or more of the vote Twothirds of those will be decided in seats where Mitt Romney won 30 percent or less including eight bona fide rotten boroughs where he couldnt even crack 20 percentTrump can hardly expect a New Yorkstyle romp here meaning he needs at least 1100 delegates coming inCruzs argument at an open convention will be stronger if he can claim more than 800 delegates while keeping the deficit to a minimum The California endgame will hinge on what happens in Indiana If Cruz can battle through the coming adversity for a Hoosier State victory the odds are were headed to ClevelandBottom line Even if Trump wins Indiana and staves off Kasich in the burbs hed probably end up just shy of what he needs  perhaps as close as 1230 delegates But its more likely that Indiana proves tougher for him and leaves him closer to 1185 delegates  putting all eyes on Cleveland
