Washington CNN In an awkward meeting at the White House this month Mitch McConnell had a message for his adversaries Democrats had only themselves to blame for the escalating war over the Supreme CourtMcConnell according to two sources familiar with the session singled out the four Democrats in the room Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid Vermont Sen Patrick Leahy Vice President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama himself He said all four of them did something he and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley did not do Attempt to filibuster Samuel Alitos nomination in 2006 setting a new precedent in the Supreme Court warsYou reap what you sow McConnell said according to the sourcesIn the aftermath of Obamas Wednesday decision to nominate federal judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court Republicans now are planning on setting yet another precedent Denying confirmation hearings for a nominee something that has not been done since such proceedings became common practice more than 60 years ago The hardline has given Democrats ammunition against the GOPled Senate for treating a qualified nominee unfairly an argument they plan to make as they try to defeat a handful of vulnerable senators in swing states in NovemberBut in interviews with CNN the Republican leaderships resolve to deny a hearing for Obamas pick only seemed to be hardening after the Presidents announcement And they got backup from some key atrisk senators who said that the next president  not the current one should make the Supreme Court choiceNew Hampshire Sen Kelly Ayotte one of the most endangered Republicans this year said out of courtesy and respect shes open to meeting with Garland breaking with McConnell who opposes scheduling such a visit But she was firmly in McConnells camp when it came to whether Garland should be considered by the full SenateI still believe this position is a lifetime appointment and one that will have a consequential impact on the country and the Supreme Court for decades to come So I continue to believe that we should consider the peoples view on this by waiting for the confirmation process to go forward after the elections in November Ayotte saidOther vulnerable senators like Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania sided with AyotteAdam Jentleson a spokesman for Reid said the GOP is taking obstruction to a whole new levelMitch McConnell is the worlds most accomplished hypocrite Jentleson said Alito received fair hearings floor consideration and was confirmedThe public pressure will begin Thursday when Garland begins to make the rounds on Capitol Hill as GOP senators are split on whether to even meet with him It will intensify over the next two weeks in the home states of endangered Republican senators with protests by activists that they hope can turn into negative media coverage over the GOPs hardlineDemocrats have privately circled July 4 as their target date to get the GOP to crack before the party conventions that month the August recess and a brief September session ahead of the November electionsI think the Republican leadership position is completely untenable and unsustainable said Sen Richard Blumenthal DConnecticut Because No 1 the American people are absolutely fed up with a Senate that is stuck in gridlock and constant paralysis What I hear most commonly from my constituents is why cant you get things doneSome Republicans seemed receptive to that argumentSen Mark Kirk who faces a tough reelection in the blue state of Illinois said he will assess Judge Merrick Garland based on his record and qualificationsAnd the Maine moderate Sen Susan Collins who voted in 1997 to put Garland in his current spot as the chief judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said shed meet with the judge and called on the Judiciary Committee to move forward with hearingsI believe the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing Collins said That would be the normal courseI supported him Roberts said when asked why he voted for him in 1997Would he vote for him nowIts not about the person Roberts said repeating the mantra from this party leadership Its about the process Let the people decidePennsylvanias Toomey one of the vulnerable Republicans facing a tough reelection in a swing state dashed from reporters in the Capitol Wednesday refusing to take questions about Garland and whether he would meet with him However in a press release issued by his office the firstterm senator said a confirmation should wait until after the election to give the American people a more direct voice in picking a justiceAnother threatened Republican Portman of Ohio acknowledged he will face enormous pressure from Democrats and outside groups on the issue but said he still thinks a nominee should wait for a new presidentIm sure there will be ads on both sides This is not about politics Its about whats best for the country he saidRepublicans believe its worth spending some political capital in their standoff with Democrats to prevent a major shift in the direction of the court should the seat of the late Antonin Scalia a reliable conservative be filled by a more liberal justiceThe GOP holds a slim 5446 majority in the Senate and must defend 24 seats in November compared to just 10 for Democrats if they are to maintain the majority Republicans insist they wont get hurt politically by their defiant stand arguing voters are more interested in terrorism national security jobs and the economy than a Supreme Court vacancyWe have a real comfort level in allowing the American people to voice their feelings about the direction of the Supreme Court said Sen Roger Wicker of Mississippi who chairs the Senate GOPs campaign committee We trust the people and we think they will appreciate being given an opportunity to speak first
