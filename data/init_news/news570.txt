Critics of the TransPacific Partnership trade deal  and the Senate bill to give the president fast track authority to negotiate it  say it will hurt American workers Here is a look at some of those claimsPresident Obama delivers remarks on trade at Nike corporate headquarters in Beaverton Ore Friday Mr Obama pressed fellow Democrats to support his push for a trade deal with Asian countriesThe Obama administration has a tough sell convincing Congress to grant it fast track trade negotiating authority so it can complete negotiations on the biggest regional trade deal in United States history  the TransPacific Partnership agreement involving a total of 12 nations though not ChinaThe administration sees this as a tremendous opportunity for economic growth It wants fast track  which would require Congress only an upordown vote on a final agreement  to help it secure the best deal it can Opponents mostly Democrats but some Republicans too say fast track and TPP will cost America jobs But supporters say their approach is new and improvedBelow are some of the critics chief concerns and how fast track and TPP supporters respondCritics say free trade kills jobs Business says it creates them However its not that simpleMost economists agree that broadening trade results in economic growth but benefits are shared unevenlyTrade liberalization promotes overall economic growth among trading partners but  there are both winners and losers the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report Its also extremely difficult to calculate how a trade deal affects job creation and loss due to a lack of data and important theoretical and practical matters CRS saidIn reviewing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement CRS found that NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supportersThe Obama White House admits that while the overall benefits of trade expansion may be large they may also be unevenly distributed Trade therefore can also have adverse effects for some workers the Council of Economic Advisers CEA said in  The Economic Benefits of US Trade a report issued earlier this monthSo the White House is arguing to members of Congress that policies the administration supports such as investment in infrastructure worker training and education can offset jobs lost as a result of trade dealsAssistance for the displaced Is it enough Trade adjustment assistance TAA programs provide help beyond traditional jobless benefits for workers displaced by trade Displaced workers get help to train for a new career Without such extra help the thinking goes these workers might find new jobs but have to take a big cut in pay  or they might drop out of the job market entirelyThe programs are also designed to boost chances of passing trade legislation drawing in some Democrats who might otherwise be in the no camp In a separate bill TAA has been beefed up to raise benefits and to include service sector workers for the first timeWhether TAA works however is a matter of debate One 2012 Labor Department study found that after four years participants had earnings comparable to a group of nonTAA job losersThat can be viewed as bad news even with the help they arent doing any better than other people recovering from joblessness Or as good news this is a particularly hardhit group of workers who might have fared worse without the trainingPolitically If TAA made even a relatively modest contribution to the ease of enacting freetrade policies the programs benefits would outweigh its costs said the reportWhen countries such as China and Japan artificially lower the value of their currencies it costs Americans jobs because foreign imports become cheaper and US exports more expensive So critics want language in the fasttrack bill against currency manipulationThe bills supporters dont dispute the dangers Thats why for the first time fasttrack legislation makes the issue a negotiating objective for the administrationBut an enforcement mechanism is too strong a remedy to include in the bill the administration says claiming that it would derail trade negotiations It could also endanger Americas ability to manage its own currency and lead to retaliation and trade wars US officials say They point to modest success in recent years in pressuring China to increase the value of its currencySen Charles Schumer D of New York who calls currency manipulation the most significant trade challenge this country faces succeeded in getting a currency amendment in a related customs bill Its not yet clear what will happen to this measure or other attempts to address the issueDont know whats in the TPP Thats because its top secret criticizes Sen Elizabeth Warren D of Massachusetts a vocal opponent of fast trackThat was a complaint that her colleague Sen Ron Wyden D of Oregon heard a lot at town halls As a result I really went to the mat on these secrecy issuesSenator Wyden said at a recent Monitor breakfastSenator Wyden who is the administrations point man on trade in the Senate points out that with the fasttrack bill the full text of the TPP and any other trade agreements will be public for the first time  60 days before Congress starts voting on it Under fast track any member of Congress can have access to classified negotiating texts Members can attend negotiating rounds or be briefed by the administration on requestThats not good enough for Senator Warren Shes pushing a petition that tells US trade officials No vote on a fasttrack for trade agreements until the American people can see whats in this TPP deal Members of Congress also complain about restricted access for their staffs on whom they heavily relyCritics are up in arms over the way corporations settle disputes over alleged violations of freetrade agreements The investorstate dispute settlement or ISDS lets foreign countries sue governments in special tribunals rather than going through the countrys court systemThe problem with this they argue is that the tribunals grant huge payments to corporations for the violations  such big payments that countries are then incentivized to change their regulations Not only do supporters of labor object they worry that foreign companies will use the tribunals to force changes in US regulations and lawsThe administration says it is writing safeguards into the TPP that will prevent this from happeningPresident Obama also told Yahoo Politics There is no chance zero chance that the US would be sued on something like our financial regulations and on food safety and on the various environmental regulations that we have in place mainly because we treat everybody the same He added We treat our own companies the same way we treat somebody elses companiesFor the first time a nonfreemarket economy such as Vietnam will be included in a broad trade deal involving the US and thats a problem say critics Americans should not be forced to compete against desperately poor workers like those in Vietnam who make as little as 56 cents an hour Sen Bernie Sanders I of Vermont wrote in a letter to to US Trade Representative Michael Froman last monthIn 2013 the US trade deficit with Vietnam was 196 billionBut supporters argue that fast track and the TPP are precisely intended to protect against this problem The fasttrack bill raises the bar for labor environment and human rights standards says Wyden Trading partners must adopt and maintain core international labor and environmental standards with trade sanctions if they do not comply he said in a statement last monthStaff writers David Cook and Mark Trumbull contributed to this report
