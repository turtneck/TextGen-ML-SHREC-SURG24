Social conservatives are animated by religious concerns  everything else is tangential On most issues theyre out of step with the country but that has never mattered For the committed political martyrdom is preferable to compromise or winning electionsReligious conservatives have supported the Republican Party almost exclusively since the 1980s But that support was always conditional Eventually the GOP had to deliver on some of the cultural issues like samesex marriage or abortion So far they havent and the conservative base knows itThe GOP has embraced this segment of the party for practical reasons and theres no doubt that it helped them in the shortterm But the union is becoming more fractured by the day as the religious right continues to lose the culture war From abortion to drug law reform to contraception to gay marriage Republicans have surrendered to majority opinion  and the cultural momentum now seems inexorableIn this election the right is clamoring for an outsider if only to protest against an establishment that has taken them for granted And this internal dissent has upended the Republican presidential race Candidates like Donald Trump Ben Carson and Ted Cruz owe much of their success to this resentmentIt appears the GOPs intrafamilial squabble has spilled onto the editorial page of the Wall Street JournalAs Politico reported the Journal has turned its guns on Ted Cruz the ascendant outsider candidate Cruz is a talented demagogue he knows his evangelical base and hes made every effort to woo them Although a sitting US senator Cruz has positioned himself as the antiestablishment candidate someone who will force the Washington cartel to deliver the goods to religious conservatives This was clear enough in September when Cruz vowed to shut down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood a move he knew had no chance of succeedingThe Journal has become increasingly critical of the Texas senator and for very good reasons Itrepresents the establishment and itseditorial page studiously defends deregulation supply side economics and interventionism all of which are essential to mainstream Republicanism  theyve never been particularly concerned with the culture warsLike the probusiness Republicans who read their OpEds however the WSJ editorial board knows the GOP cant win a general election with Cruz at the top of the ticket According to the latest polls both Clinton and Sanders would easily defeat Cruz in a general election and the gap is likely to widen as independents and moderates pay closer attention to Cruzs shenanigansRepublican insiders also know Cruz is a huckster His brinksmanship in the Senate tells you everything you need to know about his seriousness as a legislator Cruz is a creation of the conservative mediaindustrial complex and as popular as he may be inside that bubble hes positively toxic outside of itThe Journal insists its criticisms of Cruz are rooted in nothing more than substantive policy differences particularly as it relates to immigration trade and national security issues Its not a personal thing said editorial page editor Paul Gigot Its a business thing Its a professional thing We call them as we see them Naturally the paper has been friendlier to Marco Rubio who has become the default establishment candidate postJeb This prompted Cruz to glibly suggest that The Journal should change their header to the Marco Rubio for President Newspaper because their attacks  and its going to keep coming because Marco fights for the principles they emphasis mine care about Cruz addressed the Journals hostility at length on MSNBCs Morning Joe Listen Joe there are no conservatives in America who think The Wall Street Journal is the voice of conservatism As I talked about in my book as you know I wrote a book this summer called A Time for Truth The opening chapter talks about how the Washington cartel the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests how they work and the way Republican leadership punishes anyone who stands up to the cartel is they engage in public flagellation  as I describe in that opening chapter Mendacity the most potent tool they have is The Wall Street Journal editorial board And anytime Republican leadership is mad at you  with me thats quite often  you can set a stop watch and within 72 hours The Journal hits you and they usually hit you twice All of this plays perfectly into Cruzs outsider narrative If the conservative paper of record castigates him for being unconservative well thats because theyre not real conservatives The WSJ represents the very establishment against which the religious right is reacting and so a denouncement by them is a badge of honor for Cruz As Matt Strawn former chairman of the Iowa GOP told Politico If the Journals opposition does anything with those voters Tea Party and evangelical voters it validates Cruz as an outsider not favored by the political and media elites Does the WSJ editorial board have clout with many in the Republican Party Of course Does it have clout with the segment of Republican voters that Ted Cruz needs for success in the Iowa Caucuses Not really If anything then the CruzWSJ spat only exacerbates the internal conflict within the GOP The establishment Republicans who read the Wall Street Journal and the people who support Cruz or Trump or Carson have very divergent concerns This will become more and more apparent as the presidential contest heats up next year
