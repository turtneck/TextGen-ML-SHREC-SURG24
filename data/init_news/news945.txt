Much is being made of Hillary Clintons private email server which she used when she was Secretary of State To me the real issue is not that Hillary endangered national security by sending classified information in the clear No  the real issue is that the Clintons act as if they are above the rules and laws that apply to the little people They are superior and smug totally devoted to themselves and their pursuit of power and the privileges that come with it Its a matter of character in other words Hillarys evasiveness her lack of transparency her selfrighteousness her strong sense of her own rectitude make her a dangerous candidate for the presidencyMy second point is this The issue of classification should be turned on its head The real issue is not that Hillary potentially revealed secrets No  the real issue is that our government keeps far too much from us Our government uses security classification not so much to keep us safe but to keep the national security state safe  safe from the eyes of the American peopleAs The Guardian reported in 2013 A committee established by Congress the Public Interest Declassification Board warned in December that rampant overclassification is impeding informed government decisions and an informed public and worse enabling corruption and malfeasance In one instance it documented a government agency was found to be classifying one petabyte of new data every 18 months the equivalent of 20m filing cabinets filled with textNowadays seemingly everything is classified And if its classified if its secret we cant know about it Because we cant be trusted with it Thats a fine idea for an autocracy or dictatorship but not so fine for a democracyGovernment of the people by the people for the people Impossible when nearly everything of any importance is classifiedToo bad Hillary didnt send everything in the clear  what a service she would have done for the American people and for democracyWilliam J Astore is a retired lieutenant colonel USAF He taught history for fifteen years at military and civilian schools and blogs at Bracing Views  He can be reached at wastorepctedu  Reprinted from Bracing Views with the authors permission
