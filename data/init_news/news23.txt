Mitch McConnell has an unusual admonition for the new Republican majority as it takes over the Senate this week Dont be scaryThe incoming Senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning reasonable majority on Capitol Hill that scores some measured conservative wins particularly against environmental regulations but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the healthcare law McConnells priority is to set the stage for a potential GOP presidential victory in 2016I dont want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress thats going to be a scary outcome I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible rightofcenter governing majority the Kentucky Republican said in a broad interview just before Christmas in his Capitol officeIts a far cry from his defiant declaration in 2010 that his single most important goal was to make President Obama a oneterm president an antagonizing oath that Democrats frequently invoke to embarrass the GOP leader  Obama won reelection comfortably in 2012 and McConnells party lost seatsNow in charge at both ends of the Capitol Republicans aim to avoid the worst excesses of the past four years and make sure the public isnt fearful of the GOPs courseThere would be nothing frightening about adding a Republican president to that governing majority McConnell said explaining how he wants voters to view the party on the eve of the 2016 election I think thats the single best thing we can do is to not mess up the playing field if you will for whoever the nominee ultimately isBut McConnell who will become majority leader Tuesday is not planning to avoid conflict altogether He wants to use the annual spending bills to compel Obama to accept conservative policy riders that will divide Democrats similar to the December spending bills inclusion of a provision benefiting Wall Street firms involved in risky derivative trades That rider brought a liberal outcry but did not end up torpedoing the bill which had Obamas supportMcConnell has been coaching his members to understand that in the initial rounds they will have to almost unanimously support the budget outline and the spending bills because few Democrats will support their policy ridersWith 54 Republicans in his caucus McConnell knows that hes a long way from getting 67 votes to override an Obama veto and that it wont even be easy getting six Democrats to regularly support legislation so that he can overcome likely filibusters led by the incoming minority leader Sen Harry M Reid DNev Still on some issues such as energy and taxes on the health industry McConnell thinks theres enough bipartisan support to get bills onto Obamas deskTheyd like to be relevant Theyd like to be part of the process he said of discussions with some rankandfile Democrats Assuming we will have on most issues a largely unified conference  I dont expect that on everything  it wouldnt take a whole lot of Democrats to actually pass legislation in the SenateBut McConnell said those who are craving some grand deal as a way to measure the next two years should lower their expectations Hes very skeptical of such bargains with Democrats on tough issues such as immigration and entitlement reform Instead he believes three issues have potential common ground international trade deals an overhaul of the tax code and new revenue streams for infrastructure projectsCould the country use a lot more You bet But theres no way you can overcome a reluctant president on something really large McConnell said The best he can do on some of those bigger issues is force Obama to break out his veto pen so there is a clear set of Democratic policy stances Republicans can campaign against in 2016Democrats are dubious of McConnells pledge to avert edgeofthecliff moments They believe he will run into the same problems that have bedeviled House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio during the past four years  including the inability to corral rabblerousers such as Sen Ted Cruz RTex to support an agenda that conservative critics will probably view as not bold enough in challenging Obama Appeasing those farright conservatives will lead to an agenda that Democrats hope to exploit in 2016What Senator McConnell wants people to think and what they will think when they see the results for themselves are two very different things said Reids spokesman Adam Jentleson Senator McConnell heads a caucus that is obsessed with rigging the game against working people in favor of wealthy special interests Thats a scary fact indeed and he wont be able to hide itWhile McConnells office is adorned with a portrait of Kentuckys only other Senate majority leader  Alben W Barkley whose tenure was often marked by clashes with his own partys president Franklin D Roosevelt  his model more resembles that of George Mitchell the Democratic majority leader from 1989 through 1994Without ever shutting down the government Mitchell stared down a president of the opposite party George HW Bush and won several liberal victories in a 1990 budget showdown Mitchell also delivered a slew of legislation to Bushs desk that drew a veto helping frame the debate for the 1992 election on domestic policyMcConnell has recently studied other twoterm presidents on how often they vetoed legislation in their last two years in office Obama has issued only two minor vetoes over technical matters largely because the previously Democraticrun Senate prevented anything from reaching his desk that he opposedMcConnell suggested that a veto strategy would help clarify issues for voters I think his bureaucracy across the board has done a lot of damage to the country  Id at least like for him to have to personally take responsibility for it even if he in the end decides to veto the bill over some restriction on EPA regulationsMcConnell is keenly aware of the challenges of reining in some of the impulses that his fellow Republican lawmakers have developed over eight straight years in the minorityThe first test will come on an energy debate which could begin by the end of this week McConnell is trying to keep his side from offering amendments not related to energy issues In recent years when some rankandfile Republicans wanted to stop the Senate in its tracks they would threaten amendments related to how Congress gets its health careIve asked my members to restrain themselves he saidRestraint has been hard to come by in this political era particularly because a small army of conservative groups has made it a mission to push Republicans to the most strident stands even if it means shutting down the government or risking default on the national debtMcConnell faced some of those groups firsthand when they supported his 2014 primary challenger and he faced a grinding general election against a Democrat who was well financedIt cost nearly 30million from his campaign war chest and tens of millions of dollars more from outside groups Winning both races handily McConnell is delivering a message to Republicans on how to behave heading into 2016Dont try to reinvent yourself Be yourself number one And dont be afraid of a primary We will win all the primaries We did it in 14 We will do it in 16 McConnell saidShortly after Election Day this fall McConnell sat down with Obama for a rare oneonone meeting in the Oval Office a huddle that both sides kept largely secret In the preChristmas interview McConnell acknowledged that the meetings purpose was only to discuss areas where the president and Republicans might find bipartisan agreement  because their disagreements on other issues were too intractableThat meeting he said focused on trade deals a tax code overhaul and infrastructure funding Can we get there on tax reform trade infrastructure he saidHe eschewed the idea of holding the debt ceiling hostage to gain spendingcut concessions from Obama a tool Republicans had to use before because they were in the minorityWe are in the majority We can pass a budget We can determine how much were going to spend he saidAvoiding those moments could make for a less scary Congress giving the Republicans a better chance in 2016 to hit the trifecta and gain the White House His own horse is already chosen Sen Rand Paul RKy but dont expect McConnell to be out on the campaign trail or doing any other favors for his homestate colleagueIm going to be supporting Rand Paul But he knows that beyond that I wont be involved in presidential politics Ive got a big job here he said
