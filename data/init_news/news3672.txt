Washington CNN The nations most elite conservative donors are just as split as Republican voters are about who to support for president  and its keeping many of the leading moneymen on the sidelines of the campaign as it barrels through the summer of 2015Only a quarter of the top conservative donors in 2012 and 2014 have decided to exclusively support one White House hopeful according to a CNN analysis of super PAC filings posted Friday In a splintered field where no presidential candidate holds a commanding lead the records reveal in the clearest terms yet just how few financiers have made their decisionsSome like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson the partys top giver in 2012 have not cut any checks to Republican candidates allied groups Others like Houston Texans owner Bob McNair have donated simultaneously to as many as four aspirants spreading their money around the fieldTheres nobody clearly ahead said Jay Bergman a top Republican donor who has given sparingly to the super PACs that have courted him for the past six months Until that emerges a lot of people are not going to commit themselvesMonths before they formally announced their bids potential candidates courted contributors at lavish resorts and with oneonone visits This weekend five Republican hopefuls will travel to Dana Point to woo the network of donors organized by Charles and David Koch two of the countrys richest Americans who themselves have not donated to any candidates super PAC so farThose groups raised 250 million in the first half of 2015 records show 103 million of which was raised by the super PAC supporting former Florida Gov Jeb Bush Four years ago Mitt Romneys super PAC led the field at the time by raising 12 million in the same filing periodThanks to 2010 Supreme Court decisions that led to an explosion in super PACs which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations nearly every candidate has eyed the nations billionaires to bankroll their political ambitions And the reports Friday reveal theyre as dependent as ever on their goodwill A single hands worth of Republican funders comprise a majority of most of the allied outside spending groups that will go to war with one another this year as the Iowa caucuses approachBut these donors influence will wane as more and more wellheeled contributors join in the political giving that they revolutionized in 2012 and 2014 Fundraisers and Republican operatives say that when the super PACs file their next campaign finance reports in early January many of the top donors will no longer be uncommittedVoters as well as donors may have preferences but the numbers are really soft Saul Anuzis a fundraiser for the Republican Governors Association said of the current landscape Just like any activist letting it play itself out there are lots of donors letting the final process play itself outIn the meantime politicians are left waitingIn addition to Adelson and the Kochs New York investor Paul Singer who gave 105 million to outside groups in 2014 remains uncommitted As do Silicon Valley angel investor Peter Thiel and Kentucky executive Wayne HughesAnd theyre not alone according to a CNN analysis that tracked current giving by 90 people who were ranked by the Center for Responsive Politics as being among the most prolific donors to conservative groups in 2012 and 2014 Among those donors half are currently sitting outBut for those who are giving they seem to have a strong preference for the governors in the raceBush has a clear lead among the megadonors in CNNs analysis with 30 of the elite donors giving to his super PAC Right to Rise USA No other candidate in the race was able to persuade so many of the top conservative donors to open their wallets at this early stageAnother favorite is New Jersey Gov Chris Christie but his megadonors are hedging their bets The five donors that contributed to his super PAC also gave to groups supporting Bush Sen Marco Rubio of Florida and former HewlettPackard Chief Executive Carly FiorinaWith an unprecedented number of hopefuls in the race many donors are shying away from investing in just one candidate Half of the elite donors who are giving this year donated to multiple groupsA lot of it is bethedging said top donor John Jordan who owns a California winery and is backing Scott Walker Thats what a lot of people do if they like more than oneCandidates like Rubio Fiorina and Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal were the second choice of many who gave to multiple groups according to the CNN analysisThe most prolific doubledonator was McNair the Texans owner who contributed 500000 to groups supporting Bush Walker Cruz and Sen Lindsey Graham of South CarolinaStill its impossible to know for sure how much money is flowing Super PACs must disclose their donors as they did Friday with hundreds of pages of filings with the Federal Election Commission But for donors looking to give discreetly some candidates have allied nonprofit organizations that are registered with the IRS but dont ever have to name namesSuper PACs are taking over more and more functions of traditional campaigns this cycle with the outside groups organizing field programs in earlyvoting states and even announcing endorsements given to the official campaign But the risk for candidates is that these groups are heavily dependent on a few billionaires to sustain their presidential operationsSen Ted Cruz of Texas who shocked many Republicans by corralling 38 million for his super PAC raised 36 million of that from three families alone Former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee a favorite of Iowa evangelicals posted only a 36 million haul  a sum that would be significantly lower had Arkansas poultry producer Ronnie Cameron not given Huckabees group 3 millionThe fortunes of groups linked to toptier Republican candidates like Walker and Rubio were similarly attached to the pockets of their financiers Half of Walkers 20 million haul came from two people Half of Rubios came from twoSome other Republicans showed the potential to have a deeper reservoir of financial firepower Bush shattered fundraising records by deploying his familys fundraising network to collect 103 million for his super PAC But he also built that support on a wider base His top 24 donors only accounted for about a quarter of all the money raisedBut candidates shouldnt fear that juggernaut said Anuzis who is supporting CruzWith almost all the candidates in single digits this is a wide open ballgame he said
