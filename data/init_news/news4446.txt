The press is full of chatter about what the other candidates could shouldmustdo to derail the Trump juggernaut at tonights CNN debateNaturally the big audience for the second presidential debate offers the other Republicans a prime opportunity to make a lasting impression in this Donalddominated campaign So I expect there will be no shortage of canned zingersBut every candidate on that stage has to be wary of getting into an insult contest with a gut fighter who doesnt play by the usual rules of political politenessIts all well and good for candidates to talk about creating a moment but that cant seem artificial or staged or the attacker will look phony and a tad desperate Trumps rivals have to deliver a positive message about themselves while drawing a sharp contrast with the real estate mogul not just denounce him as Bobby Jindal did as a narcissist and egomaniacAnd consider this If half of the other 10 candidates try to whack Trump wont that make him look larger Wont that reinforce the narrative that Trump has so shaken the Republican establishment that his opponents are feverishly trying to bring him downTrumps task is far easier He can uncork his usual lines about the very very stupid people running the government and jab back at those who challenge him bad polls low energy and so on Andremember the Fox debateif he gets a detailed question that he doesnt like he can take a swipe at the media and the gotcha gameIn terms of the medias focus its going to be Trump vs Whoeveras long as Whoever is named Carly Ben or Jeb The truth is that journalists have lost interest in most of the other candidates who are mired in single digits as is Jeb but hes still got the money the Bush name and the fading aura of the person the pundits thought would be The Man to Beat That could change but right now theyre eclipsed by TrumpCarson told me in the interview we aired Sunday on Media Buzz that he would not be throwing punches in this campaign and that he regretted questioning Trumps faith and felt he needed to apologize So even though yesterdays CBSNew York Times poll has him at 23 percent close behind Trumps 27 percent I dont expect Carson to take him on The question for the okay doctor in Trumps words is how he handles it if The Donald starts denigrating himThe media are really hoping for a dustup involving Fiorina whose Super PAC made a clever ad aimed at women boasting she has earned every wrinkle on her 61yearold face after Trump told a Rolling Stone reporter Look at that face Trump has taken to hitting her as a failed CEO dumped by HewlettPackard but keep in mind that she took him on in the Fox happyhour debate even though he wasnt thereNever before in American presidential politics has a candidate who has drawnaccusations of sexismand bullying been forced to personally confront the female recipient of his insults on live television the New York Times declares And with Mrs Fiorina bragging that she is getting under Mr Trumps skin their showdown is emerging as one of the most intriguing subplots of the second debateAnd heres the Wall Street Journal After punching her way onto the big stageCarly Fiorina is poised to take on her partys heavyweights in Wednesdays Republican presidential primary debate where she will come facetoface with the candidate who found fault with her faceStill Carly was very restrained in responding to Facegate telling Megyn Kelly only that she must be getting under Trumps skin So dont expect any pro wrestlingWhats getting a lot of traction online is Mark Halperins Bloomberg analysis of why Trump has a commanding positionWith Trump the rules have changed So far he has proven to be largely immune from attack and also a master killer himself with a unique political arsenal With a few months to go before voters vote Trump has squashed the poll numbers and personas of a host of his rivals without resorting to significant traditional opposition research paid media or surrogates He simply uses Instagram Twitter and his virtually unlimited access to the news media to unsheathe his sharp tongue cutthroat sensibility and unerring perverse humor And Trump can shift to kill mode without strain or hesitationFrom the getgo of his entrance in June Trump has engaged intuitively in killorbekilled tacticsDeadly rhetoric aside one of the reasons I warned from the beginning that Trump shouldnt be underestimated is that I saw how his buzzsaw style was sharpened in New Yorks tabloid culture But you cant just be a Don Rickles figure Some voters are also drawn to his successful career in real estate and reality TV and the wealth that enables Trump to thumb his nose at the donor classOne thing to watch If Trump uses the debate to raise his recent arguments about overpaid CEOs and taxing hedgefund millionaires youll know hes decided to shrug off the notreallyaconservative attacks and stay on his populist pathClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host
