President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaignsBut increasingly there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting himAccording to James Sherk a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation government employee unions want bigger and more expensive government in contrast to private sector unionsSherk added those private groups are pushing back and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline which they believe will benefit their members That has put them on a collision course with Obama who last summer proclaimed We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this countryThe presidents insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members and they understandably dont like it Sherk saidCongress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project although Obama has vowed to veto it Just days ago Sean McGarvey president of North Americas Building Trades Unions made a direct appealWe urge the president of the United States to put our men and women back to work across the length of this pipeline as soon as possible McGarvey said adding We urge the president to sign the billUnion leaders also have a longstanding beef with the administration over the Affordable Care Acts enormous tax on socalled Cadillac health insurance plansThe plans offer high dollar benefits and are used as a recruiting toolAlthough the tax doesnt kick in for several more years as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers In a letter written in July of that year union officials including James Hoffa president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying We voted for youWe have a problem you need to fix itAnalysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions Just days ago Rep Frank Guinta RNH introduced a measure hes calling Ax the TaxA similar measure didnt get far in the Senate last year but may have a better chance with the GOP now in control of both the House and Senate
