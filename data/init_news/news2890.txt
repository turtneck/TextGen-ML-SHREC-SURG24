With just five weeks of campaigning left Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are scrambling to win over female voters in Americas suburbs as welleducated white women have emerged as perhaps the presidential campaigns most pivotal swing voting groupThe Democratic and Republican nominees and their surrogates are making direct appeals to female voters in campaign appearances in the suburbs of North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania and other battleground states in television ads on channels such as Bravo and shows such as Dancing With the Stars and on Facebook where peoples feeds inundate them with campaign commentaryBut polls and focus groups as well as interviews with women here in the battleground state of New Hampshire show that Trump  who spent the past week haranguing a Latina former beauty queen over her weight  has a considerable challenge with many female votersIts very clear that Trump is doing extremely well among white noncollegeeducated men  but white women with a college degree is a huge impediment to getting where he needs to be said Whit Ayres a veteran Republican pollster Im not sure what he can do about it given all the comments hes made about women over the last 15 monthsTrumps troubles were evident here in Nashua a commuter exurb of Boston where six women in a knitting circle were lounging on the couches and armchairs of a yarn shop the other day talking about  what else  Trump They were Republicans Democrats and independents all of them moms  and all of them ready to give him a permanent timeoutYou just want to smack him said Pam Harrison 56 who voted for Republican Mitt Romney four years agoWatching Trump debate reminded Kristen Schwartz 40 of dinnertable conversations with her inlaws Its not polite to interrupt people but if you stop to breathe or think about your point they just talk over you and the conversation just gets louder and louder and louderIn an unnerving campaign season what keeps their anxieties in check is the belief of Sandy Zielie 46 the shops owner Women are going to save this country this electionFemale voters may not save the country in the way the knitters of Nashua would like but they almost certainly will swing the election Clinton and Trump are targeting many intersecting groups and subgroups of swing voters but strategists for both campaigns said white women with college degrees are at the top of their listsTrumps bad week is a nightmare for the GOPTrumps temperament has been a flash point since he entered the race especially among women So it was that many of Clintons surgical strikes against Trump in their first debate were designed to sow fresh doubts especially when Clinton recounted how he had shamed Venezuelanborn Alicia Machado the 1996 Miss Universe pageant winner for gaining weight The controversy continued for days as Trump lashed out at Machado including maligning her in an erratic series of tweets starting at 320am FridayThe Miss Universe episode has not gone over well with the female voters he needs to win overI have always voted Republican but I dont feel like I could vote for Trump this year Rosanna Koehlert 58 a college graduate and housewife said as she shopped the other day in Merrimack NH He shouldnt be making fun of people and making them selfconscious about the way they look Thats not what a president should beThe modest lead Clinton has held in national and state polls can be attributed to her outsized advantage among white women with college degrees Four years ago Romney carried this demographic over President Obama 52percent to 46percent according to exit polls Yet Trump is losing it badly  32percent to Clintons 57percent in a late September Washington PostABC News poll of likely votersAmong white women without college degrees however Trump leads Clinton 52percent to 40percent The two candidates are virtually tied among white women overall 46percent for Clinton and 44percent for Trump according to the PostABC surveyFor Clinton who would make history as the nations first female president winning a larger share of white women voters than Obama did could help her offset any relative erosion in support from young voters for instance It also could balance any rise in turnout among white men for Trump a group with which he enjoys an over 2to1 leadEverythings about swing voters said a senior Clinton campaign official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy We know that white suburban women are critical for both parties  and the lowest hanging fruit for expansion among that group is more likely to be collegeeducated white womenMeanwhile Trump is trying to squeeze as many votes as he can from whites generally  including a subgroup with which he is quite unpopular collegeeducated women  to offset losses among blacks Latinos and other minoritiesSome women have already gone into their respective corners and they will support Clinton or Trump and not move said Kellyanne Conway Trumps campaign manager and pollster But the persuadables are swinging back and forth because they know theres always more to learn more to see more to knowMargie Omero a Democratic pollster who closely studies the political attitudes of female voters said women have been cool to Trumps candidacy for several reasonsIts not just about the toxic language he uses towards all the various women he knows publicly but its also his lack of fluency on policy his lack of understanding about caregiving Omero said Its clearly not his comfort zone Hes got this very harsh tone in general that a lot of women respond very badly toFor months now Clintons advertisements have used Trumps own words to undermine his character The spots have been aimed at women and evoke visceral responses One of the campaigns most recent ads called Mirrors depicts girls looking at their reflections as Trump is heard talking crudely about womens bodiesClinton is laboring to persuade voters who identify as moderate regardless of their party affiliation In 2012 moderates made up 41percent of the electorate and Obama won them 56percent to Romneys 41percent exit polls show Many moderates live in suburban areas and although they cross over into many demographic groups the Clinton campaigns private data suggest they hold similar values and beliefsThere are threads here that make these groups very important to winning the presidency said the Clinton campaign official saying they support samesex marriage prioritize climate change and education and recoil against candidates seen as sexist or bigotedTo repair his image among moderates Trump has enlisted his elder daughter who rates as one of his most effective surrogates according to the campaigns internal research Ivanka 34  who has three small children and is an entrepreneur and an executive in her fathers real estate company  helped Trump craft a childcare policy which they rolled out together last month in a Philadelphia suburbIvanka stars in a new ad her first of the general election in which she says that her father understands the needs of a modern workforce and is committed to changing outdated labor laws to support women with children The spot called Motherhood will air this week nationally and in swing states on womenfocused cable channels including Lifetime Bravo and OWN the Oprah Winfrey Network as well as on network primetime shows including Dancing With the Stars Greys Anatomy and The VoiceIvanka Trump stars in new campaign ad to help her father appeal to womenTrumps womenfocused ad campaign will continue with a second spot called Childcare that casts Trump as a champion of affordability and fairness for middleclass families Conway saidThis is partly an attempt to change the subject from Trumps temperament and character and to tell voters that he is more of a change agent than ClintonIf this election is about Hillary Clinton and is fought on the issues Donald Trump wins Conway said She ticked through the issues she wants Trump to focus on in the final weeks security not only terrorism but also opioid abuse affordability fairness and ethicsConway said the Trump campaign recently analyzed the advertising of Clinton and her superPAC allies and found that the two issues discussed the least were education and health careI said Bingo Thats what well talk about every day  health care and education Conway said She says shes been fighting for women and children but wheres the product Wheres the deliverable Why do so many women live in poverty Why do so many women not have health insuranceIt may be difficult for female voters to tune everything else out however Lisa Faust 45 one of the knitters here in Nashua was trained as a chemical engineer and is raising a son with Down syndrome She cant stop thinking about the time Trump mocked a disabled journalistWhats distressing to me is that Trump has made it socially acceptable to embrace bigotry and racism Faust said How do you say to an 11yearold child Thats not acceptable behavior but the leader of our country thinks its acceptable That really gets to meEmily Guskin in Washington contributed to this report
