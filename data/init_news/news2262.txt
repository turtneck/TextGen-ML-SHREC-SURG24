The move will help Trump consolidate the Republican Party apparatus under his leadership now that he has become the partys presumptive presidential nomineeIt marks an official departure from Trumps claim that hes selffunding his campaign and allows him to repay himself for the money he has already spent if he chooses to do soUnder the deal the Trump campaign and the RNC will establish two committees Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again CommitteeTrump Victory  for which the maximum contribution is 449400  will benefit 11 states whose Republican parties are part of the agreement Arkansas Connecticut Louisiana Mississippi New Jersey New York South Carolina Tennessee Virginia West Virginia and WyomingNotably absent from that list swing states The only big general election battleground included is Virginia The agreement doesnt cover states like Ohio Florida and Colorado where the race could be won or lost Helping Trump Victory will be Lew Eisenberg the RNCs finance chairman Hell work with Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin Lew Eisenberg is going to do an outstanding job leading this effort RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement announcing the deal Lew has already helped the RNC raise a record 135 million in support this cycle and I have every confidence his track record of success will continue in this new role The Trump Make America Great Again Committee is a joint fundraising committee between the RNC and Trumps campaign Joint fundraising committees are a regular part of the presidential election process Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has announced similar groups with the Democratic National Committee The biggest benefit of the joint committees is that they allow donors to write checks much larger than the 2700 limit for individual candidates The joint fundraising agreements structure will allow Trump to raise money not just for the general election but for the primary  taking advantage of a window to bring in extra money before he officially accepts the GOPs nomination That could potentially allow Trump  who regularly boasted that he was selffunding his campaign  to reimburse himself for some of the millions of dollars he shelled out during his primary election fight Trump however said on Wednesday that he has absolutely no intention of paying myself back for the nearly 50 million dollars I have loaned to the campaign Its not unusual to see states that arent up for grabs in November included in joint agreements because federal law limits the amount donors can give to 10000 per state under such deals  which means the more states that are included the more money the candidate and the party can ask from each donor Candidates also tend to include state parties they have strong relationships with as another way to exert control over the money raised For instance Mitt Romneys joint fundraising agreement in 2012 funneled money to Utah and Massachusetts  states where Romney owned homes and had existing relationships The 4494000 limit includes a maximum limit of 2700 for the Trump campaigns general election fund 33400 for the RNC 110000 for the 11 state parties and hundreds of thousands of dollars for partys building legal and convention funds We are pleased to have this partnership in place with the national party Trump said in a statement By working together with the RNC to raise support for Republicans everywhere we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton keep Republican majorities in Congress and in the states and Make America Great Again
