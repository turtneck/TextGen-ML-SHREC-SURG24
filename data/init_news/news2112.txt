little different than the story of my brother and my dad This may come as a shock to you but you have brothers and sisters so you may appreciate this Were not all alike We make our own mistakes in life were on our own lifes journeyThursday night in Concord Bush joked that he is not running to try to break the tie between the Adams family and the Bush familythe only two in American history to produce fatherandson presidentsHe was selfeffacing when asked about a matchup with Hillary Clinton which would mean one of their two last names had been on primary or general election ballots in seven of the last eight presidential electionsI have enough selfawareness to know that that is an oddity Bush saidHe also tried to disarm his skeptics Asked at the New Hampshire GOPs summitthe event that drew the entire Republican field into the state for Friday and Saturdayabout the prospects of a dynastic Clinton vs Bush election he said I dont see any coronation coming my way trust meI mean come on he added What are you seeing that Im not seeingBush hasnt officially entered the presidential race yet But his Right to Rise political action committee has hired three key staffers in New Hampshire

summit Bush sought to strike a forwardlooking toneWe will not win if we just complain about how bad things are Bush said We also have to offer a compelling alternative so that more and more and more people join our causeHe didnt mention any GOP foes by name butthrough the cloak of an assault on President Barack Obamatook a veiled shot at the three freshman Republican senators who have entered the race so far Floridas Marco Rubio Texass Ted Cruz and Kentuckys Rand PaulBush said that accomplishment matters and suggesting that his time as Florida governor is better preparation than Congress added The big desk is different than perhaps United States senator or another jobBush didnt throw much red meat to hardline conservatives standing by his controversial stand in favor of immigration reform during his stops in New Hampshire downplaying the importance of samesex marriage and defending his calls for higher education standards even as he said the federal government shouldnt push Common Core on statesBut his biggest selling point was the eight years he spent as Floridas top executive saying his record is an Imnotkidding conservative oneThe summits attendeesparticularly those who remembered the Bush familys first two presidentssaid it wasnt his policies that concerned them less than one year away from the states primaryThe Bush family has been terrific but I think we need a change said Jim McHugh a 63yearold consulting business owner from PortsmouthIts probably not fair to him simply because his dad and his brother were president but I think I would like to see someone new said Donna Slack a 66yearold Greenland retireeI certainly dont have anything against him personally I think he did a wonderful job in Florida she addedBush earned strong reviews though from University of New Hampshire studentsboth of whom were in their early teenage years when Bushs brother was president and who werent alive when his father left officeHes extremely personable compared to some other candidates he said Some crowds Ive seen him speak at are not exactly his type of conservatives but I think he really knows how to adapt to every situationMichael Raccio 21 another UNH student said Bush really impressed me but hell probably back a more conservative contender like Cruz because Bush didnt address illegal immigration and he has a shaky record on thatI was looking for him to address why he was in favor of giving instate tuition to illegal immigrants in addition to giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants and he never mentioned a thing he said So Im still left with a couple questions
