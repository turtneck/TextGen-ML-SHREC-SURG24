targetingThe French Defense Ministry said that 10 aircraft dropped 20bombs on facilities used by themilitant group which has claimed responsibility for Fridays terrorist attacks in Paris striking a command center a militanttraining facility and an arms depotOpposition activists reached in Raqqa said they counted at least 30 bombs which they said had hit among other things a soccer stadium a museum and medical facilities They said the strikes had knocked out electricity in the city of about 200000 peopleThe French statement said the operation launched from bases in the United Arab Emirates and Jordan was conducted in coordination with US forces which have compiled an extensive target list in Raqqa American officials speaking at the Group of 20 summit here that President Obama is attending said the French operation was discussed between the two militaries as well as in telephone calls Saturday and Sunday between Defense Secretary Ashton B Carter and his French counterpartUS planes have repeatedly struck in and around Raqqa in northcentral Syria in recent monthsIn Iraq on Sunday Foreign Minister Ibrahim alJafari said Iraqi intelligence had obtained information before the Paris attacks that the Islamic State was planning an imminent terrorist strike overseas that may have been aimed in particular at France the United States and IranWe notified these countries and warned them Jafari said in a statement which did not include specifics of when the Iraqis acquired the information US intelligence officials did not confirm the reportAdministration officials said the United States would not alter its strategy against the Islamic State in response to the Paris attacks despite evidence that the terrorist group was expanding its ability to hit Western targets In recent weeks Obama has approved the escalation of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq and has authorized the deployment of 50 Special Operations troops to assist Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces pushing toward RaqqaOfficials said that in response to the attacks in Paris the administration was seeking renewed global commitment to that intensified military action and to a negotiated settlement of Syrias civil warFrances retaliation came as Obama held talks with allied leaders and with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit being held in this Turkish Mediterranean resort cityObama vowed again on Sunday to help France hunt down the perpetrators of the attacks Deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama agreed with French President Franois Hollande that the rampage which killed at least 132 and wounded more than 350 was an act of war But he and others disputed suggestions from Republicans that Obama who said in an interview last week that the USled coalition had contained the Islamic State has consistently underestimated the adversaryManhunt in Europe for at least 1 suspect directly involved in Paris attacksThe president was referring to recent setbacks for the militant group on the battlefield in Iraq Rhodes told reporters The Islamic State also known as ISIS ISIL and Daesh a derogatory term in Arabic has long harbored ambitions to sow bloodshed farther from its home base in Syria he said emphasizing that Obama has been realistic that the fight would be long and difficultIts the manifestation of what has been the ambition of ISIL for some time now  to conduct attacks beyond Iraq and Syria Rhodes said The president indicated when he launched the counterISIL strike campaign that he knew ISIL had those ambitions which is why we have always focused on the threat of foreign fightersThe highly coordinated assaults on several locations in Paris on Friday evening have shaken the gathering of global leaders here The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks which intelligence officials said were carried out by three teams of terrorists affiliated with the extremist groupThe attacks prompted Hollande to declare that France would lead a merciless fight against the Islamic State a move that could increase pressure on the Obama administration to take stronger actions to ensure that the Islamic State cannot attack the United States directlyGOP leaders including some presidential candidates have faulted Obamas strategy as too limited to contain the Islamic State The Paris attacks along with the recent bombing of aRussian commercial plane claimed by the group have thrust the administrations approach in the Middle East into the 2016 campaign for the White HouseDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton who served as secretary of state in Obamas first term has struggled to articulate how she would deal with the threats Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush said in an interview on NBCs Meet the Press that the United States should declare war and harness all of the power the US can bring to bearIn Paris a soccer game an Asian dinner a concert  and then terrorAfter a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the summit host Obama said that the attacks in Paris and last month in Ankara were attacks on the civilized world and that the United States would stand in solidarity with the victims in hunting down the perpetrators of this crime and bringing them to justiceRhodes emphasized that the attacks did not change the White Houses reluctance to establish a massive ground force of US troops in the region saying the administration remains confident that it can push back the Islamic State by relying on local forces it is training and advising in Iraq and Syria along with punishing airstrikesThe further introduction of US troops to fully reengage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge Rhodes saidIn Vienna on Saturday diplomats from the region and from Europe the United States and Russia agreed to press the various factions they back in Syrias civil war to come together no later than Jan1 to begin talks on forming a transitional governmentOnce that process starts participants agreed they will support a UNmonitored ceasefire between forces of President Bashar alAssad backed by Russia and Iran and a wide array of rebel groups variously backed by the United States Saudi Arabia Turkey and othersCoordinated assault seems to mark new chapter in terrorismThe administration has said that settling the ongoing civil war would allow global competitors to focus on defeating the Islamic State in both Syria and IraqThe Paris attacks Rhodes said can serve to create a greater sense of urgency in the international community behind supporting various elements of the counterISIL campaign and support for a diplomatic resolution of the Syrian conflictObama met with Putin on the sidelines of the summit White House officials said that they spoke for 35minutes and that the discussion centered around ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria an imperative made all the more urgent by the horrifying terrorist attacks in Paris and on the diplomatic progress achieved in Vienna While the United States has insisted that Assad must relinquish power Russia Assads main backer has bombed rebel forces in a bid to help him remain in controlObama and Putin were joined in their meeting held in the lounge area of a hotel conference center by US national security adviser Susan E Rice and a man who appeared to be an interpreter A closedcircuit video feed showed them sitting around a coffee table with Obama leaning forward in his chair and talking intently with Putin who was also leaning in as other world leaders milled aboutThe president also met here with Saudi Arabias King SalmanIn Brussels NATO dropped the flags of its 28 member nations to halfstaff to honor the French dead NATO officials said that France so far has declined to invoke the alliances Article 5 which would oblige all members to join its fight against the militantsThe only time Article 5 has ever been invoked  at the request of the United States  was after the September 2001 alQaeda attacksWe support the French authorities in their determination to deal with the terrorist threat a NATO official said Sunday and a number of allies are already working with France on their ongoing operations and investigations in the wake of the attacksLoveday Morris in Dahuk Iraq and Hugh Naylor in Beirut contributed to this report
