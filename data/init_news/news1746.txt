The Republican party was struggling to heal its deep wounds on Thursday as House speaker Paul Ryan claimed he was very encouraged by his meeting with Donald Trump but again declined to endorse himIn a series of eagerly watched meetings on Capitol Hill that drew placardwaving protesters and hundreds of reporters the presumptive Republican nominee held peace talks with GOP leaders in a bid to unify around something more than hostility toward Hillary ClintonRyan and Trump issued a joint statement that hailed a very positive step toward unification adding We will be having additional discussions but remain confident theres a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goalRyan admitted last week that he was not ready to throw his weight behind Trump becoming the highestranking Republican to withhold his endorsement after a primary election plagued by extraordinary rancour Despite growing pressure from his own ranks he declined again on ThursdayI think we had a very encouraging meeting he told reporters afterwards Look its no secret that Donald Trump and I have had our differences We talked about those differences today Thats common knowledgeThe question is what is it we need to do to unify the Republican party and all strains of conservative wings in the party We had a very good and encouraging conversation on just how to do thatIt was important to discuss core principles that tie Republicans together added Ryan who was running mate to Mitt Romney four years ago and is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2020These included the constitution separation of powers and supreme courtI was very encouraged with what I heard from Donald Trump today Ryan said I do believe that we are now planting the seeds to get ourselves unified and bridge the gaps and differences and so from here were going to go deeper into the policy areas to see where that common ground is and see how we can operate from those same core principlesBut he admitted This is a process It takes a little time You dont put it together in 45 minutesAsked specifically whether he was endorsing Trump and what was holding him back the speaker sidestepped by replying The process of unifying the Republican party which just finished a primary about a week ago  perhaps one of the most divisive primaries in memory  takes some timeHe added Its very important that we dont fake unifying we dont pretend unification that we truly and actually unify so we are full strength in the fall I dont want us to have a fake unification process here I want to make sure that we really truly understand each otherTrumps insurgent campaign has put him at odds with the Republican establishment and won him almost 11m votes giving him a strong hand in the negotiations An increasing number of Republicans in Congress have called on Ryan to accept the popular will despite his objections to Trump on both substance and tone including his call for a temporary ban on MuslimsRyan acknowledged Its really kind of unparalleled I think He has gotten more votes than any Republican primary nominee in the history of our country and this isnt even over yet  Its really a remarkable achievementThe challenge is to keep adding voters without subtracting any through a positive vision based on core principles he added Heres what we agree on a Hillary Clinton presidency would be a disaster for this country Its effectively a third Obama termRyan met Trump behind closed doors for 45 minutes at the Republican National Committee RNC headquarters in Washington along with chair Reince PriebusAlthough he declined to offer specifics on the issues discussed Priebus described the meeting as a positive step towards unification in an interview with MSNBC shortly after its conclusionIt was a positive mood it was a mood of cooperation and a feeling of its time to unify the party And I think both parties wanted to do that he saidThe RNC chair also sought to downplay Ryans reluctance to endorse Trump saying the expectation had been that the primary would continue for another month or twoI think everyone was caught a little off guard by how quick it all ended I think we all were surprised Priebus saidTrump and Ryan were then joined for a second meeting with other members of the House Republican leadership team majority leader Kevin McCarthy majority whip Steve Scalise conference chair Cathy McMorrisRodgers and deputy majority whip Patrick McHenryMcMorrisRodgers like Ryan has yet to back Trump as the party standardbearer while McCarthy and Scalise have said they will support the nomineeTrump then met with the Senate Republican leadership at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial CommitteeSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell was characteristically mum when returning to the Capitol after his sitdown with Trump offering only that it was a very good constructive meetingJohn Cornyn the secondranking Republican in the Senate used similar words to describe the meeting in a tweet that showed him posing alongside TrumpCornyn later told reporters on Capitol Hill that he expected the party to ultimately unite behind TrumpAmong the issues discussed was immigration Cornyn added including Trumps broader tone on the subjectThere is a way to talk about these issues that isnt offensive to people he saidA handful of Republican senators joined Trumps meeting with the leadership Roger Wicker of Mississippi Orrin Hatch of Utah Deb Fischer of Nebraska Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Rob Portman of Ohio and Jeff Sessions of AlabamaSessions one of Trumps chief surrogates has criticized Ryans reluctance to endorse TrumpI think he made a mistake on that Im not sure what was in his mind Sessions told reporters on Capitol Hill this week But I think that can be repairedAlthough Senate Republican leaders have been more willing to rally behind Trump their members find themselves in a decidedly precarious position Twentyfour Senate Republicans are up for reelection in November with many facing tough races in key battleground statesWicker who chairs the NRSC the organization tasked with keeping the Senate in Republicans control has already committed to backing Trump Following the meeting the senator reiterated his support for the nominee while adding Trump and GOP leaders had a very positive and productive conversation today aimed at unifying the party for victory this fallAs the lawmakers huddled with Trump for what is expected to be the first of many meetings protesters gathered outside to show their disdain for the former reality TV star Professional organisers from Code Pink held up signs stating Stop hatred against immigrants Islamophobia is unAmerican and Trump is a racist Other protesters included socalled Dreamers immigrants brought to the US as children from the advocacy group United We Dream A giant Trump mask and a cardboard coffin were displayedHundreds of journalists flocked to the scene of the meeting even as the Republicans in attendance declined to address the cameras A handful of lawmakers who did not participate in the meeting did however offer their perspective on what to expect as Trump presses forward with his charm offensive on Capitol HillChris Collins a representative from New York who is backing Trump said he was baffled at the assertion by some of his colleagues that they would not vote for Trump in November But he was confident about Trumps ability to win over those still on the fence through oneonone meetingsPeople will see the Donald Trump I know not necessarily the one you see in the rallies Collins saidTrumps overtures while in Washington extended even to his fiercest critics South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham who exited the race in December and has openly declared that Trump would destroy the Republican party told reporters on Thursday that the two had a cordial pleasant phone conversationGraham said the 15minute call centered predominantly on national security and he provided Trump with his assessment of the nuclear accord with Iran and the war against IsisSteps away from the chaos Democrats at the US Capitol used the opportunity to portray Republicans as belonging to the Party of TrumpThe Senate minority leader Harry Reid said the meetings served as the latest sign that the Republican leaders in both houses are marching lockstep with Donald TrumpThe Nevada senator aimed his fire in particular at McConnell who threw his support behind Trump last week when it became all but certain that the real estate mogul had clinched the nominationDonald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nominee His policy positions are identical to the Republican party platform Reid said in remarks on the Senate floorHe then proceeded to tie the GOP to Trumps inflammatory rhetoric toward immigrants and women pointing out that Republicans in Congress have blocked action on immigration reform and policies such as equal pay for women and paid family leaveTrump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and to the policies that hes led Reid said It was an obstructionist antiwoman antiLatino antiMuslim antimiddle class antienvironment and antiObama and antieverything Republican party of the last eight years that made Donald Trump a realityReids counterpart in the House of Representatives minority leader Nancy Pelosi took a similar approach in tying congressional Republicans to TrumpSince when have the House Republicans been so concerned about intolerant statements and discriminatory ideas Pelosi said at her weekly press briefing on Capitol HillJosh Earnest the White House press secretary said he read Ryan and Trumps joint statement with amusement and commented I dont know anybody here whos going to lose any sleep over the meetingEarnest told reporters Speaker Ryan has described his view that the entire Republican party including the presumptive nominee should rally behind the agenda that Speaker Ryan has put forward I think the reason he may be encountering some difficulty is hes the speaker of the House He should be implementing that agenda alreadyHe accused the Republicans of inaction over releasing funds to combat the Zika virus the Puerto Rico financial crisis and the opioid abuse epidemicUnfortunately the Republicans seem much more focused on the elections than they do on embracing the results of the last elections that gave them a majority in CongressIf Republicans had much conviction about their agenda theyd be trying to implement it now rather than trying to convince Trump and their own members Earnest added I think thats why there might be skepticism both inside and outside about whether Republicans actually do have a governing agenda
