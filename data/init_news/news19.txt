While paging through Pews best data visualizations of 2014 its awesome I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics Here it isThe chart which comes from Pews amazing political polarization project shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselvesand increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years As recently as 1994 seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican As of 2014 its a whopping 94 percent Same goes for Republicans 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today In addition the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent according to PewTo me this chart is so important  particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington  because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isnt some sort of only in Washington thing The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country After all thats who elects these people to Congress rightSo when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington dont believe it We have the Congress we want  even if we arent totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is And we get the results  not many  from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours
