As volatile and nervewracking as the great ClintonTrump Slugfest of 2016 has appeared from the outside polling data have for months suggested a far more stable race Polling aggregators and election prediction markets have consistently shown Hillary Clinton with an enduring lead over Donald Trump Then with less than two weeks remaining until Election Day FBI director James Comey decided to get involved firing off a maddeningly vague letter to Congress alerting them to the renewal of an investigation into new emails that may or may not pertain to Clintons use of a private server as secretary of state and throwing the race into chaos The Mexican peso plunged as Wall Street started pricing in the rising possibility of a Trump win and the media went into overdrive hyperventilating over a spate of new polls that showed the race tightening Now as we head into the final weekend before Americas muchanticipated day of reckoning the Hive offers a perspicacious overview of all the multifarious reasons to panic no matter who youre voting for on TuesdayYes the polls could be misleadingThe Chicago Cubs had a smaller chance of winning than Trump currently does as Kellyanne Conway is quick to remind us That isnt to say that the statistics showing a likely Cubs win didnt accurately take into account everything that sports bettors and analysts knew about both teams at the time Its merely to say that predictions are just thatour best guess for what will happen All polls include a margin of error and right now Donald Trump is pretty close to striking distance According to FiveThirtyEight Trump lags Clinton by just 33 points in a pollsonly forecast in 2012 average polling turned out to be off by 27 points Even if the electoral college seems to place Clinton ahead by wider margins in certain states this presumes that the states behave independently from national trends when in fact they tend to move in tandem writes Nate Silver  If national polls are off by 27 points for example that would be more than enough to flip Wisconsin and Minnesota into Trumps column Silver notes She has quite a gauntlet to run through to hold her firewall and she doesnt have a lot of good backup optionsTheres a worrying degree of variation among polling aggregators data scientists and political analysts While HuffPost Pollster which excludes outlier polls currently gives Clinton a 979 percent of victory Silvers model is far more conservative giving Clinton a 681 percent chance to account for increased volatility Everything depends on ones assumptions but I think that our assumptionsa Clinton lead sure but high uncertaintyhas repeatedly been validated by the evidence weve seen over the course of the past several months Silver recently told PoliticoOthers are far more optimistic Neuroscientist Sam Wang who outpredicted Silver in 2012 has observed that while some individual polls may place Clinton narrowly ahead Trumps rise shouldnt be confused for momentumOne thing thats been apparent is that a major feature of voter opinion for last five electionsthis is the sixthis that voters have become entrenched says Wang The movement of voter opinion has been within a narrow range In finance and other types of statistical analysis we call this kind of movement a regression to the mean It happened in 2008 in 2012 and its happening this year When things go too far in one direction theyll start to head back to a midpoint Clinton is now at the low end of where shes been this season But if the regression to the mean holds we should see a little movement back to Clinton But well seeWangs Princeton Election Consortium pegs Clintons chances of winning at over 99 percentThe myth of the secret Trump voterThe silent majority is back Trump declared less than a week after Clintons FBI drama broke out into the open He was referring to a longstanding belief possibly backed by political science that there exist a vast swath of Trump supporters too embarrassed to tell pollsters they plan to vote for him When I poll I do fine But when I run I do much better he braggedExperts have thrown cold water on that idea A POLITICOMorning Consult study this week suggests that the myth of the shy Trump voter may be only halfright according to the survey Hillary Clinton led Trump by five points 52 to 47 whereas if asked in an online poll or an automated calltwo situations in which there was no possibility of social judgmentthat gap narrowed to three points with Clinton leading 51 to 48 Still the effect was marginal and Clinton won in both scenariosNate Cohn at the Upshot has argued that the mysterious newly registered voter is actually more liberal than most pundits have assumed While Trump may have more enthusiastic white supporters data shows no new registration surge in this category whereas more younger white voters minorities and women registered for the first time Pollsters and analysts Cohn mused were ignoring these missing nonwhite voters and that its Mrs Clintonnot Mr Trumpwho stands to gain from a surge of new votersOther data also support the idea that polling is underestimating Clintons support While black turnout has been soft compared to four years ago Latinoswho are usually underpolledappear to be registering and voting at higher levels than before Talking Points Memo reports that Latino early voting is up 100 percent in Florida 60 percent in North Carolina and 25 percent in Colorado and Nevada Latino Decisions a Latino advocacy group told TPM that they are projecting as many as 35 million more Latinos will vote in 2016 than in 2012 which could help her win all four aforementioned swing statesSo where does that leave usThe latest Clinton email drama may not have caused any significant shifts nationally outside of a brief hiccup but it may have rearranged Clintons pathway to victory A week after Comey sent his letter Silver caught up with the recent polling and found that Clintons socalled blue firewall has started to weaken with states such as New Hampshire and Michigan suddenly in greater danger of tilting Trump Its not clear that things are getting any worse for Clinton but its also not clear that theyre getting better he concluded In fact nothing is getting much clearer than it has ever beenwhich perhaps is liberating in its own way
