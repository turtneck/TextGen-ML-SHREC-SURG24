0 comments In case you didnt already know the glaringly obvious MSNBC is widely considered to be one of the most liberal cable news channels of all the mainstream media Now in a stunning segment on his show MSNBC host Chris Matthews basically endorses Donald Trump Hillary must be feeling pretty crappy about herself because this latest scandal appears to have been pushed Matthews onto the Trump train A liberal Thats sad Hillary Matthews reviews a string of Obamas failures then goes on to say that if you like them vote for Hillary If you want to change those failures the only option is to vote for Trump This is HUGE You know you are on the losing end when staunch Democrats even hate you He even stated that we have the chance to change the status quo unless weve become too dainty to do that I seriously cant believe I heard that from Chris Matthews on MSNBC Related Items
