The calamity brought upon the Republican Party by Donald Trump was laid bare Thursday by its two most recent presidential nominees who delivered unprecedented denunciations of the candidate that set the stage for a raucous evening debateMitt Romney awoke from his political hibernation to deliver a sweeping pointbypoint indictment of Trump  of his policy proposals his business dealings his erratic judgments his moral character and his insults to women Latinos and the disabled The former GOP nominee who sought and accepted Trumps endorsement in 2012 implored Republicans to now reject the billionaire he labeled a phony and a fraudTrumps three rivals took up similar attacks later Thursday night at a Fox News Channel debate in Detroit in which the ferocious sparring and namecalling revolved almost entirely around the frontrunnerWhat started with Trump asserting that he was well endowed in a rejoinder to Rubios campaigntrail joke about his manhood devolved into an ugly affair with the candidates yelling over each other at times unintelligibly as they sought to discredit one anotherTaken as a whole the day only served to harden the divisions tearing the GOP apart and raise dire doubts about whether its factions could unite in the general electionIt began at sunrise in Palm Beach Fla where Trump phoned into network television shows to mock Romney as a failed politician Then in Salt Lake City Romney gave his speech asserting that Trump was a danger to the nation and to democracy itself in Washington Sen John McCain Ariz shared in the dismay in Trenton NJ Gov Chris Christie called a news conference to insist he was not a prisoner of Trumps and in Portland Maine Trump rallied fans by demeaning Romney with crude languageThe events culminated at nightfall in Detroit where Sens Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov John Kasich faced Trump and tried desperately to score points against himThe very first question was aimed at Trump and for the next two hours the moderators and candidates quizzed scrutinized and mocked the frontrunner He was on the defensive through much of the event struggling to explain many of his policy ideas as well as defend his hiring of foreign workers and the manufacturing of Trumpbranded clothing overseasYoure making your clothes overseas and youre hiring your workers overseas Rubio said at one point referring to the widespread use of foreign workers on visas at Trumps MaraLago property in Palm BeachTrump acknowledged that he brings in foreign workers to do jobs on work visas at his club and defending himself said it is difficult to get American employees to work in service for the fivemonth period he called the seasonWe will bring them in and bring them out he said to boosTrump reversed himself on a key part of his immigration platform calling for an increase in visas for highly skilled foreigners Im changing he said We need highly skilled people in this countryTrump added With immigration  as with anything else  there always has to be some tug and pull and deal  You have to be able to have some flexibility some negotiationThe evenings fireworks came when the candidates exhausted after three months of breakneck campaigning leveled caustic attacks at one anotherThis little guy has lied so much about my record Trump said of Rubio whom he repeatedly called Little MarcoOne of the lowest points of the night came near the start when Trump responded to a joke that Rubio had told days earlier about Trump having small hands You know what they say about men with small hands Rubio said pausing to let the audience laugh You cant trust emHe hit my hands Trump said showing his palms Nobody has ever hit my hands Look at those hands Are these small hands And  if theyre small something else must be small I guarantee you theres no problemAt times the debate was so focused on the personal that Kasich thundered Lets stop fightingCruz too sought to claim the moral high groundI dont think the people of America are interested in a bunch of bickering schoolchildren he said They are interested in solutions not slogans Its easy to say Make things better make things great You can even print it and put it on a baseball cap But the question is do you understand the principles that made America great in the first placeThe GOPs implosion over Donald Trumps candidacy has arrivedRubio and Cruz pounced on Trump regarding fraud cases filed against him and a real estate training company known as Trump University Rubio said the university was a scamThey asked him for their money back and you refused to give them their money back Rubio said calling Trump a con artistTrump said the process needs to play out in court Its called pending litigationThe real con artist is Senator Marco Rubio Trump shot back bringing up Rubios attendance record in the Senate He doesnt go to vote Hes absent The people of Florida cant stand him He couldnt get elected as dogcatcherCruz asserted that the GOP cannot afford a nominee facing a fraud trialLet me just ask the voters at home Cruz said is this the debate you want playing out in the general electionThe 11th Republican debate also marked a return engagement for Trump in his offandon feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly one of the comoderators She asked him about the possibility that he might change his immigration policies once he gets into office citing an offtherecord meeting with the New York Times that was reported by BuzzFeedRubio and Cruz tagteamed Trump insisting that he give the newspaper permission to release the interview He has a very simple solution Cruz said Simply release the tapeCruz seized on the episode and others to prosecute his case that Trump has no ideological core and is flexible on a range of issues important to the conservative baseDespite the harsh rhetoric Cruz Kasich and Rubio all said in response to a question that they would support Trump if he was the nominee and Trump said he would do the same if one of his rivals wonThe hottest topic in Michigan  the tainted water scandal in Flint  was brought up in only one question and it came more than halfway through the debate Only Rubio was given the chance to respond and when he did so he expressed outrage while also complaining that Democrats have politicized the issue as if somehow Republicans woke up one morning and decided Oh its a good idea to poison some kids with lead Its absurd its outrageousHeres who supports Donald Trump  and whyRomney set the tone for the debate with his morning address at the University of Utah where he methodically litigated the case against a Trump presidencyDonald Trump is a phony a fraud Romney said Hes playing members of the American public for suckersRomney himself a onetime business titan worth hundreds of millions of dollars sought to rub away at Trumps golden sheenHis bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them Romney said Whatever happened to Trump Airlines How about Trump University And then theres Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage A business genius he is notRomney said the president helps define the values and principles of the United States for the world and sets an example for young Americans He asked his audience of roughly 700 students and other guests to ponder Trumps personal qualities the bullying the greed the showing off the misogyny the absurd thirdgrade theatricsTrump fired back with a verbal tirade a couple of hours later at his Maine rally He bemoaned Romneys nasty critique and dismissed him as a choke artist who in Trumps assessment botched an easy chance to turn President Obama out of officeTrump recalled his endorsement on Romney in February of 2012 describing the candidate as yearning for Trumps stamp of approvalHe was begging for my endorsement Trump said I couldve said Mitt drop to your knees and he wouldve dropped to his knees He was begging True True He was begging meOn the debate stage Trump dismissed Romney in similar terms He failed miserably and it was an embarrassment to the entire Republican PartyThe Fix Romney did Trump a big favor by attacking himThe clash comes at a crucial point in this unpredictable GOP primary season Trump has won 10 of the first primaries and caucuses including dominating this weeks Super Tuesday contests and has a significant lead in the race for Republican convention delegatesBut in a divided field Trump still has fewer than half the delegates awarded so far That leaves his opponents with a viable if risky and destructive strategy The only way to stop Trump from winning the nomination may be to stop anyone from winning it  dividing up the delegates so that no one has a majorityThen the theory goes the party would head into a chaotic convention  the first true floor fight for any party in decades  and hope that a candidate other than Trump emergesThis is just the scenario Romney encouraged when he recommended that Floridians cast ballots for Rubio Ohioans cast ballots for Kasich and everywhere else voters back the candidate best positioned to deny Trump a victory in that stateIt was unclear whether Romneys speech would move any voters away from Trump It could have the effect of intensifying support for the rebellious outsiderBut within the Republican establishment Romneys speech drew immediate and enthusiastic praise Within minutes McCain issued a statement effectively joining forces with RomneyI want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our partys most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr Trump and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next CommanderinChief and leader of the free world McCain saidBut not every member of the establishment was speaking out against Trump Christie has been Trumps most visible endorser of late standing stonefaced behind Trump at his victory event Tuesday night in Palm Beach It has sparked mocking memes on social media and laughs on latenight televisionChristie addressed that at his news conference in Trenton on ThursdayI want everyone to know for those who were concerned I wasnt being held hostage I wasnt upset I wasnt angry I wasnt despondent said Christie who ended his candidacy last month after a disappointing finish in New HampshireOKeefe reported from Salt Lake City Jose A DelReal in Portland Maine Steve Friess in Detroit and David A Fahrenthold in Washington contributed to this report
