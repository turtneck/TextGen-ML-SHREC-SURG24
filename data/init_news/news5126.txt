in the face of terrorist attacks on the homeland and around the worldAfter the Republican National Convention got off to a chaotic start because of an afternoon procedural skirmish Trump made a splashy debut on the convention stage to introduce his wife Melania whose speech was a highlight of an otherwise uneven eveningI have been with Donald for 18 years and I have been aware of his love for this country since we first met she said He never had a hidden agenda when it comes to his patriotism because like me he loves his country very muchBut minutes after she finished the Quicken Loans Arena began emptying out as retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn delivered a rambling and unfocused speech that dragged on for nearly half an hourThe result Sen Joni Ernst of Iowa poised to deliver a breakout

of the people she said That includes Christians and Jews and Muslims It includes Hispanics and African Americans and Asians and the poor and the middle classAfterward Donald Trump returned to the stage kissed his wife and pointed at her with his signature gesture as if to show her off to the roaring crowdFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani gave one of the nights most impassioned addresses strongly defending Trump whom he has known for decadesWhat I did for New York Donald Trump will do for America said Giuliani who steered his city through the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 2001Many of the earlier speakers delivered hardedged remarks seemingly designed to play to Trumps base supporters A trio of speakers railed against undocumented immigrants  whom they repeatedly called illegal aliens  for killing their loved ones and argued that only Trump could keep the country safeMy sons life was stolen at the hands of an illegal alien said Mary Ann Mendoza mother of fallen police Sgt Brandon Mendoza Its time we had an administration that cares more about Americans than about illegals A vote for Hillary is putting all our childrens lives at riskOthers who took the stage in prime time here in Cleveland aimed at ClintonPatricia Smith whose son Sean died in the 2012 terrorist attacks on a US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi Libya reduced convention delegates to tears with an emotional address about her sons death  which she said she blames on Clinton thethen secretary of stateI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son Smith said She pointed out a delegate

African American cried out Blue lives matter in America His call of support for law enforcement officers was received with chants of USA USA USA in the convention hall Clarke went on to criticize the Black Lives Matter movementGiuliani bemoaned the racial divisions on display across the country and that first responders have a target on their backWhen they come to save your life they dont ask if you are black or white the former mayor said They just come to save youAn emotional high point early in the night was a speech from Marcus Luttrell the former Navy SEAL immortalized as the Lone Survivor who got involved in politics after former Texas governor Rick Perry and his wife Anita took him in as a surrogate son and nursed him to healthLuttrell said that after spending time with Trump he is confident the business mogul could fix chronic problems in the Department of Veterans AffairsWeve got to make sure the hell the veterans return from is not the hell the veterans come home to okay Luttrell said Thats what was promised and thats whats deserved PeriodThe focus on national security and immigration comes at a perilous time Recent terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad coupled with police shootings in Dallas and Baton Rouge La have created fear and worryWillie Robertson the longbearded star of Duck Dynasty took the podium wearing an American flag bandana around his head and vowed repeatedly that Trump would have your backDuring the conventions afternoon proceedings antiTrump forces expressed vocal dissent from the convention floor though party officials snuffed out attempts to slow Trumps march to the presidential nominationA renegade group of delegates seeking to force a rules vote that would have embarrassed Trump fell short They were hoping to register disapproval of new party rules that favor Trump but a handful of state delegations backed out under pressure from party leadersThe outcome cleared the path for Trump who touched down in Cleveland around 730 pm to accept the GOP presidential nomination later this week without having to clear new hurdles But it underscored the deep rifts that continue to plague the Republican Party during a week that was supposed to reflect unityThe Trumps arrive in a convention city with Republican rifts ever raw both on the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena and on the sidelines Trumps top backers on Monday aggressively disparaged Ohio Gov John Kasich and other Republicans who have declined to support the celebrity mogul for president  an unusual provocation for a team hoping to foster unityOn the convention floor proTrump Republicans dealt the decisive blow to antiTrump Republicans in a pair of voice votes That prompted an outcry and a disorderly sequence of events on that was broadcast live on cable news networksRoll call vote Roll call vote angry delegates chanted while Trump supporters sought to overpower them with chants of Trump Trump The Colorado delegation briefly walked off the floorSen Mike Lee of Utah a Trump critic expressed befuddlement and indignation that no roll call vote was held and that the podium was briefly abandonedTheres no precedent for this in parliamentary procedure Lee told reporters on the convention floor We are now in uncharted territory He called the outcome surrealSchedule See who is speaking on the second day of the Republican National ConventionEarlier in the day former senator Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire came to the convention floor claiming to be holding a packet of documents with the requisite number of signatures from enough states to force the vote they wanted Trailed by dozens of reporters Humphrey delivered the signatures to a convention official who reviewed themBut thats as far as it went as three state delegations pulled back their support according to Rep Steve Womack of Arkansas who presided over the drama That left the Trump foes below the threshold they needed to reachSeparately New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said it was unacceptable for former candidates who pledged to support the eventual nominee to hold out now And Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort targeted Kasich who is in Cleveland this week but refusing to step foot in the convention and the Bush family who are skipping the festivities altogetherThe broadsides from Trump allies which drew some swift rebuttals from Kasich backers inflamed tensions at the start of the quadrennial confab which will feature four days of speeches meetings and parties that will culminate in Trumps formal acceptance speech on Thursday nightCertainly the Bush family we would have liked to have had them Theyre part of the past Were dealing with the future Manafort told reporters Monday morning Manafort said on MSNBC that Kasich was embarrassing his state by skipping the conventionChristie reminded Michigan Republicans that as a candidate for president he and other GOP candidates pledged to support the eventual nomineeIt is unacceptable to me and it should be unacceptable to you that anyone who signed that pledge is not now adhering to that pledge and supporting our partys nominee said Christie The governor who is now a staunch Trump supporter and surrogate didnt call anyone out by nameSeven things to watch at the Republican convention in ClevelandAs White House hopefuls Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush pledged loyalty to the eventual nominee before later backing away So did Sen Ted Cruz Tex Like Bush and Kasich Cruz has not endorsed Trump But Cruz is speaking at the conventionKasichs allies defended the governor on social media Ohio GOP Chairman Matt Borges tweeted Manafort still has a lot to learn about Ohio politics Doesnt know what hes talking about Hope he can do betterImpossible to know strategy behind this tweeted John Weaver a top Kasich adviser in his presidential runChristie added Everyone has a right to their own conscience and their own beliefs But the fact of the matter is as I said before if youre a Republican and you have voted for Republican nominees for president and youre not working for Donald Trump youre working for Hillary And thats the bottom lineFor Trump the convention comes at a crucial time He is trying to put weeks of distracting feuds and staff turnover behind him and demonstrate to the country that he is the bestqualified candidate for the White HousePeter Holley Jenna Johnson Louisa Loveluck Karen Tumulty and Laura Vozzella contributed to this report
