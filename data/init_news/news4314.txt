California and Oregon will be the first states in the nation to allow women to get birth control pills and other hormonal contraceptives directly from their pharmacists  without a doctors prescriptionAs California officials were busy finalizing regulations on a state law passed in 2013 Oregons governor Kate Brown signed a similar bill into law last weekThe two measures were hailed by womens health advocates They noted that men have long had an easier time getting birth control simply purchasing condoms over the counterWe support efforts like these that remove barriers to women gaining access to birth control and other reproductive health care said Kathy Kneer president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California in a written statementShe added that hormonal contraception has been widely studied and shown to be safe  so safe that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that it be available over the counterThe contraceptives wont be available like cough drops or antacids however In California pharmacists can only dispense them after providing a health screening to women and taking their blood pressure Oregon will also require a health screening but the states specific rules havent been developedThe laws differ somewhat Californias law has no age restrictions on patients  minors have the same access as adults In Oregon pharmacists may only give new birth control prescriptions to women 18 or older Women under 18 must show proof of prior birth control prescriptions from a physician Also Oregon likely will require pharmacists to undergo more training than the one hour of education required of California pharmacists said Marcus Watt executive director of the Oregon State Board of PharmacyCalifornias rules are expected to take effect after Oct 1 and Oregons law after Jan 1Elizabeth Nash senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive health think tank said other states could end up following Californias and Oregons approaches depending on how they workA lot of eyes are watching whats going to happen next she saidThe laws moved ahead despite partisan debate in Congress over access to birth control There members of both parties support legislation allowing overthecounter access  without any prescription  but Republican legislation would not require insurers to pay for itDemocrats say that is an attempt to get around requirements to cover prescription birth control under the Affordable Care Act and would effectively make hormonal contraceptives off limits to many poor women They have introduced a bill that would require insurance coverage of overthecounter hormonal contraceptivesCalifornias regulations and Oregons law do not address insurance coverage of birth control But Californias pharmacists have voiced concerns that insurers wont pay for time spent screening women and dispensing birth control as they would for a doctors visitPharmacists in California say they are preparing for the new regulations and hoping to resolve the reimbursement issue It has taken nearly two years to develop regulations implementing Californias 2013 law which also allows pharmacists to prescribe other medications that once required a doctors prescription including travel medicines smoking cessation treatments and the opioid overdose antidote naloxoneThe overall expansion of pharmacists prescribing authority is aimed at relieving the burden on physicians faced with an influx of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care ActHonestly were really excited said Ken Thai partowner and manager of the El Monte Pharmacy Group with 10 stores in Southern California Medical clinics in the area are overflowing with long wait times Were already doing other services like immunizations and cholesterol checks and our customers already see us as a resource Were ready for something like this Its been a long time comingUntil now California pharmacists could only provide emergency contraception also known as the morningafter pill without a doctors prescriptionMost major pharmacy chains will likely participate in offering nonprescription birth control because they were involved in developing the protocols said Virginia Herold executive officer of the California State Board of PharmacyRepresentatives from CVS Walgreens and Costco would not confirm their chains participation either declining to comment or saying that they are awaiting the final regulationsSome patients welcomed the change  glad for the convenience if nothing elseI think its really wonderful said 26yearold Anne Wong who lives in San Francisco Its a drag to have to go to clinic and talk to the doctor to get birth control pills  it takes a chunk out of your dayWong who at age 17 emigrated with her family from Thailand said the new access would help women in her community practice safer sex The topic is still taboo Wong saidBut with the new regulations I could just tell my parents Im going to a store for something All Id need to do is just walk to the Walgreens near my houseKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation
