Pope Francis has been brushing up on his English ahead of his arrival in Washington in September and tickets to his US events are already a hot commodity But anyone expecting his message to be simply one of mercy and love could be in for a distinct surpriseIn his speech to a joint meeting of Congress the pope of the poor could well deliver a harsh message for the worlds richest nation For all the genuine warmth of his smile his track record suggests he sees it as his job not just to comfort the afflicted but also to afflict the comfortable And however delicately he finetunes his language the hard fact is that he believes the United States is as much a part of the problem as the solutionFor more than a century popes have made nuanced criticisms of the freemarket capitalism that drives the American dream But Pope Francis with an unprecedented vigor is locking horns with much that Washington and Wall Street hold dear Why does he take such a hard lineIn the twoplus years since his election he has enchanted and bewildered the world in equal measure with his compassion and his contradictions But he has also proved himself a wily and sophisticated politician Understanding this side of Franciscapable of crafty maneuvering unafraid of confrontation ready to seek out unlikely alliesis essential for understanding the complicated effect he is having on American politicsThe pope born in Argentina as Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been called both a Marxist and a reactionary But unpack the long biography of this 78yearold cleric and a more complex and intriguing reality emerges Francis has never embraced one particular political ideology though he has been comfortable around people who have His first boss the woman who ran the Buenos Aires chemistry laboratory where he worked was a Communist whose diligence and integrity he greatly admired Marxist ideology is wrong the pope said in 2013 but in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people so I dont feel offendedWhat has shaped Francis instead is his lived experience Born into an Italian immigrant family he has a longstanding bias toward the underdog and those who must struggle to survive The most formative part of his priestly life was the 19 years he spent among the very poorest in the shantytowns of Buenos Aires where he was known as the bishop of the slumsBut there is another key to understanding the popes worldview His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI was above all a theologian Pope John Paul II before that was originally an actor and a philosopher But Francis trained as a scientist One of his adages is Facts are more important than ideas The intersection of these two threads in Francis lifehis sympathy for the poor and his insistence that reality comes before theoryhelp account for how the United States and its unrestrained capitalism have come into the papal crosshairsLike many Latin Americans Pope Francis is ambivalent toward America He combines both a sense of respect and a feeling of resentment at the economic and cultural dominance of his bigger neighbor one senior member of the Roman Curia told me As a young man Bergoglio was schooled in the politics of Argentine President Juan Domingo Pern Peronism was a curious alliance of labor unions the army and the church It sought what Pern called a third position between communism and capitalism It favored authoritarian nationalism and looked to the state rather than the market for solutions Francis was much influenced by the latterIn his later years as archbishop of Buenos Aires Francis saw firsthand the devastation wrought upon ordinary people by economic policies originating in Washington During Argentinas 2001 economic crisis when half the population was plunged into poverty the International Monetary Fund World Bank and US Treasury agreed to policies that imposed severe austerity on Argentinas lower class Six years later Francis took the leading role in shaping the propoor anticolonial spirit of the Latin American church articulated by the regions bishops at their seminal meeting in Aparecida BrazilPope Francis is no kneejerk liberal He has held the traditional Catholic line on issues like abortion gay marriage and even contraception yet he has radically shifted the focus of the Catholic Church away from sexual ethics onto the morality of moneyThat became clear in the ecoencyclical he released this year Laudato Si To the horror of climate skeptics it endorsed the worldwide scientific consensus that global warming is largely humancreated It was ironic that before publication Catholic Republican presidential candidates like Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum had been admonishing the pope that science is better left to scientists That was exactly what Francis the former chemist thought he was doing by accepting the view of 97 percent of actively publishing climate scientists For Francis the source of the Earths degradation was clear The degree of human intervention often in the service of business interests and consumerism is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful ever more limited and greyIn July Pope Francis delivered his fiercest condemnation of contemporary capitalism to date addressing an assembly of political and community activists in Bolivia Behind global capitals indifference to the poor and the planet and all the pain death and destruction it brings he said there lies the stench of what Basil of Caesareaone of the churchs first theologianscalled the dung of the devil An unfettered pursuit of money rules The service of the common good is left behind In this subtle dictatorship capital has become an idol In response Francis called for changereal change structural changeusing the word no fewer than 32 times Land lodging and labor were sacred rights and working for their just distribution was a moral obligation and for Christians a commandmentSuch talk has had an immediate impact in American politics The AFLCIOs policy director Damon Silvers who is not a Catholic said I couldnt recall any leader of any religion in my lifetime speaking so plainly about economic justice and how that is at the core of how we human beings are supposed to treat each other At the other end of the political spectrum Fox News Greg Gutfeld a former altar boy labeled the pope the most dangerous man on the planet Big Catholic donors like American billionaire Ken Langone working to raise 180 million for the restoration of St Patricks Cathedral in New York have been so upset by the popes unvarying pronouncements that they warned cardinals that wealthy Catholics might stop giving to the church The popes aversion to redblooded capitalism is just too apocalyptic for Americas tycoonsoverlooking the curative powers of technology ignoring the way the free market had lifted millions from poverty and refusing to consider that Catholic teaching on contraception is partly to blame for our overcrowded planetYet Francis supporters argue that he is not advocating a specific political program rather than taking political sides he is trying to open peoples minds to the generosity openness and inclusiveness of the gospel Its not Marxism one cardinal told me Its classic Catholic social teaching as developed by previous popes What after all is Francis joyful embrace of the poor and the rejectedkissing a man with a terrible skin disease visiting thousands of African migrants washed up on Europes shores in Lampedusa Italybut an echo of Jesus of NazarethIts this appeal to ordinary people that underscores just how bold Francis agenda truly is He addresses his message not only to Catholics but as his documents have insisted to all people of good will His call for society to break with compulsive consumerism and move to a more sustainable pattern of life will affect thousands of Catholic schools parishes and hospitals throughout the United States and the world But his plea that rich nations should turn down the airconditioning embrace carpooling and make other lifestyle changes has the capacity to enthuse many who do not normally look to Catholic moral theology for inspirationAnd it has left freemarket advocates and politicians around the world with a troubling question What if the people actually respond
