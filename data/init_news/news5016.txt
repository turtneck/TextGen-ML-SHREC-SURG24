Marco Rubio has been forced to speed up plans for an allout assault on the billionaire businessmans characterHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueA flood of mainstream Republican officials and donors have lined up behind Marco Rubio in the week since former Florida Gov Jeb Bush suspended his campaign for presidentAnd yet Rubios team concedes that neither the influx of support nor the conversion of many of Bushs wealthy donors is enough to stop Donald TrumpInstead of riding the wave of new support alone Rubio has been forced to speed up plans for an allout assault on the billionaire businessmans characterRubio had hoped to wait until the chaotic Republican nominating campaign had shrunk to a twoman race But with a growing sense of urgency among GOP stalwarts to settle on a Trump alternative the young Florida senator is trying to simultaneously slow Trump and cast himself the savior of the partys futureI will never quit I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement Rubio thundered at a rally with 2000 people in Oklahoma City on FridayRubio a 44yearold firstterm US senator is trying to project leadership in the party while also going after Trump using his own game marked by mockery and uncanny aim for his opponents vulnerabilitiesBut the hardnosed strategy is necessary says Tennessee Gov Bill Haslam Rubios latest big endorsementRubio looked around and thought Well I might not like it but thats what the media is covering and thats what people are responding toBut Rubio is quickly getting a feel for what he began during Thursdays debate launching a direct challenge to Trumps appeal to working class votersIn recent days Rubio has dished about Trumps onstage perspiration and alluded jokingly that Trump may have wet his pants Hes also taken to referring to the billionaire businessman as a con artist dozens of times a day while campaigningIts amazing to me A guy with the worst spray tan in America is attacking me for putting on makeup Rubio charged as he campaigned in Georgia on Saturday Donald Trump likes to sue people He should sue whoever did that to his faceOver the weekend Rubio and Cruz attacked Trump for refusing to c ondemn the endorsement from David Duke a former Ku Klux Klan leaderRubio went further in a message to thousands of supporters in Leesburg Virginia We cannot be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan Rubio said Not only is that wrong it makes him unelectable How are we going to grow the party if we nominate someone who doesnt repudiate the Ku Klux KlanBut make no mistake Rubios new tack is a fight for survivalHe trails Trump in virtually all of the 11 states holding nominating contests on March 1 known as Super Tuesday The Florida senator has finished in no better than second place in the first four primary contests Trump has won three out of four And Texas Sen Ted Cruz remains a toptier contender even after finishing in third place in the last three contestsGiven Trumps momentum Rubios team says publicly the senators best chance for the nomination might be a contested national convention in July That could happen only if Rubio prevents Trump from accumulating the majority of delegates in the monthslong primary season that extends through JuneSome Floridabased donors as well as top donors and fundraisers in Washington DC Chicago and elsewhere were ready to join Rubios team immediately after Bush left the raceThere are a number of us now that Gov Bush is out of the race who were very impressed with his debate Thursday and see him as the one to take down Trump said Chicago investor Craig Duchossois who shifted from Bush to Rubio He showed hes not going to take any crap from himIn the past two weeks Rubio has also won the backing of four governors and 20 members of Congress more than all of his Republican rivals combinedRubio had hoped to forestall a oneonone brawl with Trump until there were only two Cruz Ohio Gov John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson remain in the race although none have the level of support from as many governors and members of Congress as RubioIn a year of the outsider however its unclear how much that will boost his momentumAnd in the meantime Rubios assault on Trumps character continuesAudiences in Super Tuesday states Oklahoma Georgia and Alabama ate up the tough talk as he whipped through Southern statesIts about time he take his gloves off and start fighting said Gary Baker from Okmulgee Oklahoma I think he should have started punching soonerBetter late than never said Greg Strimple a Republican pollster and former adviser to the National Republican Senatorial CommitteeThe Rubio campaign needs to setup a contrast on Trump equate Trump to the culture of corruption Americans hate  where the rich get richer and middle class pays the price Strimple saidRubio says theres time but none to wasteIf you sense a sense of urgency its not just about winning Rubio said Its about the idea that the party of Reagan and the conservative movement could fall into the hands of a con man whos pulling the ultimate con job on the American people
