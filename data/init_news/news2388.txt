A sobering new Security Council  SC  analytical report on the US presidential election states that a new American Revolution has begun which todays popular vote is just the beginning of and that could fully last up to an entire decade especially if this election is stolen from Donald Trump Note Some words andor phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian wordsphrases having no exact counterpartAccording to this report Federation intelligence analysts in their decipheringuncovering what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on outliers a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system such as artificial intelligence  AI  models social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorateThis report notes that the Security Councils use of these outliers to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the antiestablishment candidate Donald TrumpExamples of this being true this report explains lie in too many examples to fully citebut includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton  news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing  and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too Unlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election however this report continues the objective and independent scientific outliers used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winningbut winning in a landslide victoryEvidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win this report notes lies first with artificial intelligence analysisthat includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama  and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clintons 249 Social media trend lines in this election likewise proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election this report continues as his FacebookTwitterInstagramYouTube presence dwarfs Hillary Clintons by a staggering 74 million and that is further validated by the over 700000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies as opposed to the barely 60000 that have attended Hillary Clintons Most fascinating though of the outliers used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called  We Need Smith whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America The We Need Smith project this report explains is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political systemand that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold ofCritical to note about the We Need Smith project too this report continues is that it was cofounded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976 but also presided over Carters unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald ReaganSeeking to understand how President Carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years this report details Patrick Caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining itand coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true they are all just tired of being lied to In fact this report continues Caddells research proved that the American political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgencyand with a staggering 84 of the American public believing that the elites live by a different set of rules and laws than ordinary people do  anyone running against them is assured victoryInterestingly to note too this report says is Caddells scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the American people towards their elites comes from both the left and right and as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party insurgencies This report grimly concludes however with a warning that Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalins attributed statement Those who cast the votes decide nothing Those who count the votes decide everything may indeed be active in the present US presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that Hillary Clintons main supporter multibillionaire George Soros has not only been manipulating the entire American election system  but one of his companies is also providing vote county software to 16 States  theyve since denied and that should Donald Trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revoltSource
