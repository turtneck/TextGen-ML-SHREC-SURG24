The Islamic State appears to be starting to fray from within as dissent defections and setbacks on the battlefield sap the groups strength and erode its aura of invincibility among those living under its despotic ruleReports of rising tensions between foreign and local fighters aggressive and increasingly unsuccessful attempts to recruit local citizens for the front lines and a growing incidence of guerrilla attacks against Islamic State targets suggest the militants are struggling to sustain their carefully cultivated image as a fearsome fighting force drawing Muslims together under the umbrella of a utopian Islamic stateThe anecdotal reports drawn from activists and residents of areas under Islamic State control dont offer any indication that the group faces an immediate challenge to its stranglehold over the mostly Sunni provinces of eastern Syria and western Iraq that form the backbone of its selfproclaimed caliphate Battlefield reversals have come mostly on the fringes of its territory while organized opposition remains unlikely as long as viable alternatives are lacking and the fear of vicious retribution remains high Syrians Iraqis and analysts sayThe bigger threat to the Islamic States capacity to endure however may come from within as its grandiose promises collide with realities on the ground said Lina Khatib director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in BeirutThe key challenge facing ISIS right now is more internal than external she said using another term for the group Were seeing basically a failure of the central tenet of ISIS ideology which is to unify people of different origins under the caliphate This is not working on the ground It is making them less effective in governing and less effective in military operationsMost striking are the growing signs of friction between the foreigners lured by its statebuilding experiment and local recruits who have grown resentful of the preferential treatment meted out to the expatriates including higher salaries and better living conditionsRead The Islamic State is failing at being a stateForeign fighters get to live in the cities where coalition airstrikes are relatively rare because of the risk of civilian casualties while Syrian fighters are required to serve in rural outposts more vulnerable to attacks said an activist who opposes the Islamic State and lives in the town of Abu Kamal on Syrias border with Iraq The activist spoke on the condition of anonymityShootouts have erupted on several occasions on the streets of the town including one last week between foreign fighters and Syrians who refused an order by a Kuwaiti commander to deploy to the front lines in Iraq the activist said The Syrian faction under the command of Saddam Jamal a former Free Syrian Army leader remains in the town keeping a tense and wary distance from the faction led by the Kuwaiti he saidIn an incident in the Iraqi city of Ramadi in January local allies battled a group made up mostly of Chechens after the foreigners decided to head back to Syria according to Hassan alDulaimi a retired police general who works with tribal fighters aligned against the Islamic State The Iraqis feared they were being abandoned he saidThere have been signs too that some foreign jihadists are growing disillusioned with activists in the Syrian provinces of Deir alZour and Raqqa describing several instances in which foreigners have sought local help to escape across the border to Turkey The bodies of between 30 and 40 men many of whom appeared to be Asian were found last month in the Raqqa town of Tabqa They are thought to be the remains of a group of jihadist fighters who tried to flee but were caught according to the activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently which monitors Islamic State activitiesNew restrictions on travel in and out of areas controlled by the Islamic State have been imposed in recent weeks including a prohibition on truck drivers transporting men without permission the activist group says Public executions a core component of Islamic State discipline have in recent weeks been extended to about 120 of the groups own members according to the Britainbased Syrian Observatory for Human RightsSome were accused of spying and one of smoking but suspicions are widespread that most were simply fighters caught trying to fleeMeanwhile territorial losses in northern Syria and elsewhere in Iraq are contributing to the sense that the group that stunned the world with its triumphant sweep through Iraq and Syria last summer is now not only on the defensive but also struggling to find a coherent strategy to confront the multiple forces ranged against itThe Islamic State is battling major offensives waged on at least three fronts  by Kurds in northern Syria Kurds in northern Iraq and the combined force of Iraqi army and Shiite militia fighters advancing on the central Iraqi city of Tikrit Islamic State fighters have also been expanding into eastern areas of the Syrian provinces of Homs and Damascus but the incremental advances there arent as spectacular as its conquests last yearIn campaign against terrorism US enters period of pessimism and gloomMost of the setbacks have come in nonSunni areas such as the Kurdish enclave around Kobane or the mixed province of Diyala in eastern Iraq where the Islamic States territorial ambitions may have been doomed by the absence of allies on the groundA far bigger test of the Islamic States military capabilities is the battle underway for control of Tikrit the Sunni home town of Saddam Hussein As the ethnic and sectarian sentiments driving the fight for territory harden across Syria and Iraq a victory for the overwhelmingly Shiite forces would also test the ability of nonSunni groups to retain hold over conquered Sunni territories analysts sayThe Islamic States losses in terms of land and blood have been fairly substantial including the loss of hundreds of villages around the Kurdish town of Kobane in Syria near the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar and in the eastern Iraqi province of DiyalaThe battles appear to have taken a high toll on the groups strength estimated at about 20000 foreigners alongside an unknown number of Iraqis and Syrians The Pentagon claimed last week that coalition airstrikes have killed 8500 fighters though that figure cant be confirmedSyrians say the bloodshed is deterring the recruitment of local citizens who were clamoring a few months ago for the opportunity to earn salaries by joining the only new source of employment availableIncreasingly the Islamic State is recruiting fighters among children and teens who remain more vulnerable than older adults to the groups propaganda said a businessman living in Raqqa who last week paid condolences to family friends whose 15yearold son had been killed on the front lineThe parents didnt know he had gone to fight and learned of his death from a neighbor just days after he had disappeared from home recalled the businessman who like others interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears for his safetyIntensified efforts to persuade Syrians to go to the front lines in Iraq include offers of up to 800 a month in salary according to Ahmed Mhidi who arrived in Turkey two weeks ago from the Syrian city of Deir alZour and is setting up an opposition group called DZGraph The offer has won few takers he saidThe Islamic State was never popular but people supported them because they were scared or they needed money he said Now people want nothing to do with them and if the Islamic State puts pressure on them they just fleeThe province of Deir alZour bordering Iraq appears to be where opposition to the Islamic State is hardening the most Smallscale attacks involving ambushes of Islamic State patrols or checkpoints are on the rise  including one that killed 12 members of a feared police group SundayThe atrocities of the Islamic StateForeigners continue to volunteer streaming across the Turkish border into the Islamic States selfstyled capital of Raqqa according to residents there The citys population has been swelled by thousands of Europeans Asians Arabs and Africans Upon arrival they are given cars and apartments and they mill about among the citys cafes and markets lending a cosmopolitan air to streets where foreigners once were rare according to Abu Ibrahim alRaqqawi the pseudonym of one of the founders of the Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently group who now lives in TurkeyMany of the foreigners show little inclination to travel to the front lines he said They just want to live in the Islamic State he said They didnt come to fightHow useful they would be to the Islamic States military efforts is also in question said the Carnegie Middle East Centers KhatibUltimately they are only attracting people on the margins of society without much education or useful skills she said Its not exactly bolstering their military capabilitySam Rifaie and

danger of losing its main supply route
