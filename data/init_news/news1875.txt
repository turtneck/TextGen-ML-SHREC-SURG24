Governors and legislatures across the country are considering increasing their state tax on gasoline amid a combination of falling pump prices and depleted transportationconstruction fundsAt least eight states have proposed increasing their gas tax as Washington also looks for ways to find money for highway and transit projectsRecently falling gas prices have made the situation more urgent But state and federal coffers that pay for such projects have been moving deeper into the red for years as Americans drive less vehicles are more fuel efficient and construction costs have increasedStill motorists appear resistant to a tax hike despite gas prices at a roughly sixyear low and state taxes on gasoline in some cases having not been increased in the past 20 yearsThe situation also presents a dilemma for elected officialsThey are responsible for keeping roads and bridges safe and fulfilling pressing needs to build more transportation infrastructure but must make the politically unpopular request for higher taxes to help meet those demandsIn New Jersey for example a poll released this week by Farleigh Dickenson Universitys Public Mind found respondents opposed increasing gas taxes by a more than twotoone margin 68to24 percentThe pollsters said residents see the need for road repairs but want policymakers to look beyond overtaxed wallets to find the revenueIts a calculation not without risk New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski said on Wednesday But we are flirting with disaster by not investing in infrastructureWisniewski a Democrat has a plan to increase the state gas tax by 25 cents a gallon with amendments to ensure the money goes toward its intended purpose instead of becoming slush fund revenueHe told FoxNewscom that his argument before constituents would in part focus on the states urgent need for more rail tunnels underneath the Hudson River to get commuters to work in New York and the bridges across the state that are in desperate need of repair including a countyowned one closed last week by the state because it was structurally deficientGov Chris Christie  a potential 2016 White House candidate and one of several Republican governors in at least eight states considering a tax increase  mentioned neither the gas tax nor transportationfunding issues last week in his State of the State addressIn addition to New Jersey Georgia Iowa Louisiana Michigan South Dakota Tennessee and Utah are considering increasing their state gas tax to bail out underfunded transportation budgetsLouisiana transportation officials say they have a 12 billion backlog in road repairs which has prompted lawmakers to consider several options to increase revenue which includes replacing the gas tax with a sales tax on all fuelsRepublican governors in Iowa and Michigan have taken different approaches  letting voters decideIn Iowa Gov Terry Branstad says improving roads is a 2015 priority and is asking state lawmakers to help him craft a bipartisan solution He has expressed openness to a plan in which each county holds a referendum to increase the sales tax on gas and diesel fuel by 1 percentWithout action Iowas roads and bridges face an uncertain future he said recentlyThe existing 22centsa gallon tax has remained unchanged since 1989In Michigan Gov Rick Snyder has agreed to spend an additional 13 billion a year for roads and other transportation program if residents in a May 5 referendum vote to increase the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent according to USA TodayIn Washington DC the average price of gas was 250 a gallon when the new Republicancontrolled Congress convened earlier this month which sparked talks about increasing the federal tax on gas and diesel fuel for the first time in more than 20 yearsBut GOP leaders are tamping down expectations leaving no clear solution to the funding problemI dont know of any support for a gastax increase in Congress Texas GOP Sen John Cornyn the No 2 Senate GOP leader recently saidThe federaltax on gas is 184 cents a gallon and 244 cents a gallon on diesel fuel They were last increased in 1993Fuel taxes bring in about 34 billion a year to the federal Highway Trust Fund but the government spends about 50 billion a year The trust fund has been the main source of federal transportation aid to states for more than 60 yearsCongress has kept transportation programs teetering on the edge of insolvency since 2008 by repeatedly transferring just enough funds from the general treasury  and making corresponding spending cuts elsewhere in the federal budget  to meet obligations for a few more months or in one case as long as two yearsBut finding acceptable spending cuts to offset the transfers gets more difficult each timeEven President Obama has rejected the notion of a gastax increase while calling on Congress to pursue other bipartisan measures to fund infrastructureObama mentioned infrastructure five times in his State of the Union address on Tuesday and renewed his call to instead fund projects with revenue from eliminating tax loopholes for US companies with overseas holdingsThe Associated Press contributed to this report
