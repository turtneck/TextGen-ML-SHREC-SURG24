previous calls Some Iowans at least are interested in KasichHe told participants on the phone call that hed appreciate any boost he can get from their caucus votesWhat about caucusgoers who worry about throwing away their votes on a lowpolling candidateI vote for the person that I like I dont worry about throwing away my vote I vote for the person who can do a good job Kasich said in the interviewIn the teletown halls Iowans get a taste of the same Kasich theyd see in person  minus the teal puffy coat hes been wearing this winterthe national debt tickerthat decorates his townhall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the New Hampshire snowWith Kasich voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies plus exhortations to take care of each other seek a personal purpose become part of something bigger than themselvesHe also makes jokes that make fun of audience members or himself or the presidential process He drops names Hes friends with John McCainwho twice won the New Hampshire primaries He got Leonardo DiCaprios autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this monthHe sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for themMy mind works very fast you know and theres things that they say that trigger something that I cant wait to tell them he said in the interview Im really not trying to cut anybody off and Im certainly not trying to show them any disrespect but  cant we just kind of get to it Im just bursting to tell themRushad Thomas walked right into a Kasich joke Monday night at a town hall in Lebanon New HampshireI
