The presidential campaign of Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee on Friday arguing that the party had unfairly suspended the campaigns access to key voter information After several tense hours both sides announced a deal had been reachedThe suit came shortly after campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged at a Washington news conference that Sanders staffers had improperly reviewed information gathered by rival Hillary Clinton earlier in the week But he accused the DNC of overreacting to the breach by suspending the Sanders campaigns ability to access the computer system containing information about Democraticleaning voters including data the campaign has gathered about its own supportersAfter midnight Sanders and the DNC put out statements that both indicated the impasse had been resolved but that put remarkably different spins on the outcome Sanderss campaign said the DNC had capitulated and that Sanders would soon regain access to the data The DNC said what happened was completely unacceptable and that it would continue to investigate the circumstances even as Sanders regained access to the valuable informationWithout a quick resolution the messy public brawl threatened to overshadow Saturdays third Democratic presidential debate and cast doubt on the DNCs ability to manage the sophisticated data tools necessary for the party to win the White House next year And it sparked significant suspicions among Sanders supporters that the party was conspiring to give a boost to ClintonDNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz rejected that allegation Friday alleging that Sanders staffers had exploited a software error to essentially steal data from Clintons campaign Wasserman Schultz said the party would not allow Sanders access to the critical database again until his campaign agreed to an independent audit of what happenedThe suit filed in federal court in Washington argued that under a contract between the DNC and the campaign governing the data systems use formal notice in writing is required if either side believes the other has violated the deal In addition each side is supposed to be allowed 10 days to address any concerns the suit saidThe DNC may not suspend the Campaigns access to critical Voter Data out of haste or desperation to clean up after the DNCs own mistakes the suit saysThe voter data is heavily used to raise money and the Sanders campaign estimated that it is losing 600000 a day in critical fundraising and publicity opportunities without access to the filesThe incident strained the relationship between the campaign of an upstart Vermont senator who until this year has run as an independent and a national party his supporters have long accused of favoring ClintonWeaver accused the party of purposely sabotaging Sanders by refusing to restore access to the voter informationBy their action the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign Weaver said I think if you look at the pattern of conduct  it looks like in this case theyre trying to help the Clinton campaignNGPVAN the computer vendor that provides Democrats with detailed information about voters has said that a computer error on Wednesday briefly allowed the campaigns to review information that had been gathered by their rivalsThe company maintains a master voter list for the DNC and rents it to national and state campaigns which then add their own proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by rival campaignsThe Sanders campaign has acknowledged that several of its staffers probed the system during the time of the error cited by NGPVAN One operative data director Josh Uretsky was fired as a result of the incident Weaver said the actions of several others are being reviewedLanding at the airport in Manchester NH ahead of Saturdays debate Wasserman Schultz said that Sanders himself was unaware of the breach until she called to discuss it 24 hours after it took place He was stunned she said I know that Sen Sanders had absolutely nothing to do with this  Unfortunately he has staff who acted inappropriately and they need to be held accountableThe severity of the data breach itself remained an issue of serious dispute FridayAudit data from NGPVAN and provided to The Washington Post by the Clinton campaign showed that four Sanders staffers conducted 24 separate searches of Clinton data during a 40minute window Wednesday targeting early voting states and searching for lists of voters most and least likely to support Clinton The logs show that in some cases the staffers saved the search results in new folders created within the systemThis was a very egregious breach and our data was stolen This was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook told reportersOn CNN Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon accused the Sanders staffers of acting like kids in the candy storeThey went hog wild downloading as much data as they could he saidLater Friday the Clinton camp struck a more conciliatory tone issuing a statement in which Fallon said that his campaign was hopeful the matter would be resolved Friday night and that the Sanders team would get access to its voter files right awayUretsky told The Post that he and the others conducted the searches of Clinton data after they discovered the software glitch only in an effort to discover the extent of their own data exposure We intentionally did it in a way that was trackable and traceable so that when they did an audit they would be able to see exactly what we did he saidUretsky said there was no attempt to take Clinton information out of the software systemWeaver blamed the software vendor for the breach which allowed all campaigns to access one anothers data for a time insisting that the Sanders campaign had actually quietly alerted the DNC to problems with another vendor system in OctoberIn the lawsuit the campaign argued that a similar security incident during the 2008 presidential campaign resulted in unintentional transmission of confidential information to Clintons unsuccessful presidential campaign against Barack ObamaWeaver said a ticktock provided to the Sanders campaign by the computer vendor confirmed that staffers were not attempting to remove significant Clinton data from the systemWe are running a clean campaign he said We dont need dirty tricksEven before this week Sanders backers had accused the DNC of trying to protect Clinton by limiting the number and prominence of debates  a narrative that plays into his antiestablishment appealTheyve been sabotaging Bernies campaign all along said RoseAnn DeMoro executive director of National Nurses United an 185000member union that is backing SandersNews of the data breach broke just as Sanders was enjoying a fresh burst of momentum after months in which his campaign appeared to have stalledOn Thursday Sanders received his biggest union endorsement to date from the 700000member Communications Workers of America He also was endorsed by Democracy for America a progressive group that claims 1million members nationwide That group founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean who is backing Clinton said it had surveyed its membership and found 88 percent favored endorsing SandersSanders who has raised most of his money from small donors over the Internet also this week celebrated a fundraising milestone more than 2 million contributions to his campaign That figure made him competitive with the effort of President Obamas 2012 reelection effort during the same stretch
