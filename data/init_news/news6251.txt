Comments Famous techno musician Moby tore into Republican nominee Donald Trump today in an oped published in RollingStone magazine tearing into the racist rabblerouser with unrepentant fury Im tired of being a mealymouthed NPRlistening lefty who has to respect other peoples opinions writes Moby Trump is an actual sociopath Distraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton Moby disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election If you have a 25yearold whos a Jill Stein supporter but they were nine when Ralph Nader handed the presidency to George W Bush they dont know better There are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble like young women who just assume that Roe v Wade will always be the law of the land I think that theres an innocence that is informing a lot of peoples desire not to vote or to vote for Jill Stein but its because theyve had eight years of Obama And I think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional He then goes on to detail just why a Donald Trump presidency is enough of a threat for him to be so undiplomatic in his approach I think there is something seriously broken inside him where hes an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath Hes done nothing to indicate that hes even capable of feeling empathy for anyone except for himself A Trump presidency would be death by 1000 Republican cuts It basically gives the NRA the ability to write gun policy It gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy Its handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just  again I try and be diplomatic but theyre trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country With Trump you get a belligerent racist whos most likely a sociopath and definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience And with Hillary you get an incredibly bright progressive strong experienced legislator Theres no choice unless youre ignorant delusional or racist Hes absolutely right on that point While the death by 1000 Republican cuts is the threat posed by any Republican candidate for the Presidency the figure of Donald Trump is a threat to our Republic as we know it and there can be only one choice Ive given more money to Democrats this cycle than Ive ever given in an election season Ive done phonebanking tweeted Facebooked and Instagrammed probably to my own personal detriment  the detriment of my friendships and certainly the detriment of my professional life  but honestly the results of this election are more important than most Id rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep Donald Trump out of the White House than trying to protect a career A career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet What I learned a long time ago is if youre a public figure and youre opinionated and outspoken people will hate you for it  even if they agree with what youre saying But its really nice Ive been doing this for a long time and at this point I just dont care Whats someone gonna do  not buy my records Its 2016 no one buys records anyway
