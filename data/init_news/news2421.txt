To become the 45th president of the United States Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump has to win 270 electoral college votes The candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal combat but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor Well probably If theres a 269vote tie or a mandatory recount prepare for constitutional chaosEach state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes ultimately based on its population California has the most with 55 Seven states  Alaska Delaware Montana North Dakota South Dakota Vermont and Wyoming  have just three electoral votes Washington DC gets three tooWhile there are 50 states in the US most of these are safely Republican or Democrat They vote the same way every time going back at least six elections So the presidential election boils down to just a handful of swing states  the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both Republicans and DemocratsThis is why voters in places such as Ohio Florida Iowa North Carolina Virginia Nevada Colorado and New Hampshire are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops Its also why you have not seen Clinton and Trump holding rallies in Louisiana safely Republican or Washington safely DemocraticTrump faces a much more difficult path to victory He needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next president whereas if Clinton wins two or three she wins the raceThis is because Democrats start from a stronger position There are 18 states plus DC that have voted for a Democrat for president in every election since 1992 That batch amounts to 242 electoral votes There are only 13 states that have voted for a Republican in every election since 1992 Those states carry just 102 electoral votesIf Clinton simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent past then adds Florida which has 29 electoral votes she is the next president If she loses Florida but wins say Virginia and North Carolina she will be the next presidentTrump needs to hold on to all the historically Republican states win states such as Georgia and Arizona  which are usually Republican but where he has struggled in the polls  and then win enough swing states to tip him over 270Buckle in because now the real fun begins polls close in eastern Kentucky and most of Indiana Parts of each state are on central time

Virginia very quickly  Trump should win easilyNorth Carolina and Ohio are swing states and will take longer Ohio has been seen as a reliable bellwether state voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 That run might be coming to an end however either because of the states changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current contest in terms of the unfavorability of both candidatesWhile its demographics are complicated  a mix of Rust Belt big cities Appalachia farmland and more  the Ohio electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean That trend appears to account in part for Trumps strength in the Buckeye State this yearElection soundtrack The Pretenders Message of Love Because Chrissie Hynde is was born in Akron

polling experts believe that if Trump doesnt win there it is effectively game over Fivethirtyeightcom gave him less than a 1 chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the Buckeye StateLikewise if Trump loses North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Florida it also becomes very difficult for him to winAnd beyond that if Clinton can win Georgia  remember these are usually solidly Republican  it would suggest she is in for a blowout victory that could see the election called for her very earlyIn 2012 Virginia was only called for Obama after midnight and Florida was not called
