Eric Zuesse Heres why Hillary has repeatedly said We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose nofly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air Opposition forces on the ground with material support from the coalition could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe This would mean that US fighterjets and missiles would be shooting down the fighterjets and missiles of the Syrian government over Syria and would also be shooting down those of Russia The Syrian government invited Russia in as its protector the US is no protector but an invader against Syrias legitimate government the Baathist government led by Bashar alAssad The CIA has been trying ever since 1949 to overthrow Syrias Baathist government  the only remaining nonsectarian government in the Middle East other than the current Egyptian government The US supports Jihadists who demand Sharia law and they are trying to overthrow and replace Syrias institutionally secular government For the US to impose a nofly zone anywhere in Syria would mean that the US would be at war against Russia over Syrias skies Whichever side loses that conventional airwar would then have to choose whether to surrender or instead to use nuclear weapons against the other sides homeland in order for it to avoid surrendering Thats nuclear war between Russia and the United States Would Putin surrender Would Hillary Would neither If neither does then nuclear war will be the result Here are the two most extensive occasions in which Hillary has stated her position on this To the Council on Foreign Relations on 19 November 2015 We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose nofly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air Opposition forces on the ground with material support from the coalition could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country rather than fleeing toward Europe This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS choking off its supply lines It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing  QUESTION When you were secretary of state you tended to agree a great deal with the thenSecretary of Defense Bob Gates Gates was opposed to a nofly zone in Syria thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous This seems to me the major difference right now between what the president  what Obamas administration is doing and what youre proposing Do you not  why do you disagree with Bob Gates on this CLINTON Well I  I believe that the nofly zone is merited and can be implemented again in a coalition not an Americanonly nofly zone I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a nofly zone But if you look at where we are right now we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military now supplemented by the Russian air force And I think we have a chance to do that now We have a nofly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds And it proved to be successful not easy  it never is  but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans I also believe as I said in the speech that if we begin the conversation about a nofly zone something that you know Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012 it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what theyre going to do And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now So I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations  QUESTION Jim Ziren ph Madam Secretary Hi Back to the no fly zone are you advocating a nofly zone over the entire country or a partial nofly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven And in the event of either do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians CLINTON I am advocating the second a nofly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish ph border cutting off the supply lines trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they dont have to leave Syria creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that She expects Putin to join Americas bombing of Syrias government and troops and shootingdown of Russias planes in Syria but no question was raised about this  To have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone  for Syrians so they wouldnt have to leave but also for humanitarian relief  would give us this extra leverage that Im looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria During a debate against Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries Hillary Clinton in a debate with Bernie on 19 December 2015 argued for her proposal that the US impose in Syria a nofly zone where Russians were dropping bombs on the imported jihadists who have been trying to overthrow and replace Assad I am advocating the nofly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians Im also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia She said there that allowing the jihadists to overthrow Assad would help us on the ground to protect Syrians somehow and also that somehow shooting down Russias planes in Syria the nofly zone gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia Bernie Sanderss response to that was I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be He didnt mention nuclear war as one of them The nofly zone policy is one of three policies she supports that would likely produce nuclear war she supports all of them not merely the nofly zone Hillary Clinton has never been asked What would you do if Russia refuses to stop its flights in Syria Donald Trump has said nothing about the proposal for a nofly zone other than I want to sit back and see what happens  because most Americans support that idea  and hes not bright enough to take her on about it and ask her that question Probably if he were supportive of it hed have said so  in which case it wouldnt still be an issue in this election Trump muffed his chance  which he has had on several occasions But clearly he unlike her has not committed himself on this matter Hillary Clinton is obviously convinced that the US would win a nuclear war against Russia  The question for voters is whether theyre willing to bet their lives that she is correct about that and that even if the US wins only Russia and not also the US and the world would be destroyed if the US nuclearattacks Russia Every other issue in this election pales by comparison to the noflyzone issue which is virtually ignored in favor of issues that are trivial by comparison But a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for nuclear war against Russia regardless of whether or not the voters know this And a vote for Trump is a vote for the unknown Could the unknown be even worse than Hillary Clinton If so would it be so only in relatively trivial ways This election should be about Hillary Clinton not about Donald Trump
