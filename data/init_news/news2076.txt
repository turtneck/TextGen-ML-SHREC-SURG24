Jeb Bush had some cleanup work to do yesterdayThe former Florida governor showed a keen grasp of policy during a 20minute interview with Megyn Kelly that aired Monday night appearing relaxed as he defended positions that dont sit well with much of the Republican baseBut then there was IraqIts a politically explosive topic for Jeb for two big reasons The war became a quagmire and its so closely associated with his brotherMegyns question was quite explicit Knowing what we know now would you have authorized the invasionBush answered as if it was 2003I would have and so would have Hillary Clinton just to remind everybody and so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got Bush saidBut thats an answer framed around our state of knowledge 12 years ago in the face of a massive campaign by his brothers administration to convince the world that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destructionSo Bush either misheard the question as he now says or answered the way he did because its easier to frame an explanation that ropes in the prominent Democrats who supported the invasion in that post911 periodBush tried to clarify things by calling into Sean Hannitys radio show with this admission I interpreted the question wrong I guessSo would he have sent troops to Iraq knowing what we know nowI dont know what the decision would have beenthats a hypothetical said JebObviously Jeb Bush doesnt want to get painted into a corner where he says he would not have invaded Iraq based on what we know today that Saddam didnt have illegal weapons If he uttered those words there would be thousands of stories about how hes renouncing his brothers legacy trying to prove his independence and on and onWhat bothers me though is the way the media are clobbering Bush not for the substance of his answer but on linguistic grounds What happens nextyou know the patternis that the noise gets so loud that everyoneleft right and centerhas to deal with it So rather than having a debate about Iraq and foreign policy and where Bush stands today were having a shoutfest about semantics Its the media as parsing policeSo lets return to the substanceWhen Megyn followed up by asking if the decision was a mistake Jeb talked about faulty intelligence and the lack of early focus on security in Iraq By the way guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well George W BushNo daylight nothing to see hereThe first indication that Jeb felt the need to clarify came on CNNs New Day where conservative commentator Ana Navarro a surrogate for Bush said shed been in touch with him by email I said hey I am a little confused by this answer so I am wondering did you mishear the question and he said yes Navarro explained She also opined that people are salivating to see Jeb throw his brother under the busA less generous interpretation came from Laura Ingraham the Fox News contributor on her radio showYou cant still think that going into Iraq now as a sane human being was the right thing to do If you do there has to be something wrong with you she saidAnd it leads to mockery such as this Roger Simon column in Politico on how Jeb is supposed to be the smart one in the family The headline Was Jeb dropped on head as a childIts safe to say this issue will not quietly fade away Its a version of the larger problem Jeb faces however unfairly because of his last name Is the country ready to hand the White House to a third member of the Bush family in a quarter century And Iraq becomes a kind of shorthand for that the most controversial and consequential decision of George Ws presidency whose aftershocks are still being felt todayWhat was also fascinating as Jeb defended his stance on a path to legalization for immigrants who broke the law was this comment Do you want people to just bend with the wind to mirror peoples sentiment Whoever is in front of you Oh yes I used to be for that but now Im for this Is that the way we want to elect presidentsThats his way of saying hes going to run the campaign he wants and hes not going to unduly pander to the right wing that voters who dont agree with him on Common Core or immigration can look elsewhereAt the same time Bush doesnt speak in punchy sound bites which could hurt him and he tends toward the low key which can translate as a lack of passionBut he did throw down the gauntlet here Ive had 20 press gaggles I dont have you know I dont do town hall meetings Dont screen the questions Dont have a protective bubble like Mrs Clinton does Dont have town hall meetings or roundtable discussions where I pick who gets to come and I screen the questions and the press has to behave a certain wayJeb who hasnt officially declared had not given an interview in two months until he sat down with Megyn Kelly If he does a few more does that put pressure on the woman who also carries some baggage because of her last nameClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of
