The revival of middleclass jobs has been one of Obamas mantras since he took office in 2009 fighting the worst economic crisis in generations It was a major theme of his last State of the Union address and is expected to feature in the one scheduled for TuesdayObamas administration can take credit for stabilizing the US economy which is growing again and last year added jobs at the fastest clip since 1999But for the middle class the scars of the recession still run deep Federal Reserve survey data show families in the middle fifth of the income scale now earn less and their net worth is lower than when Obama took officeIn the six years through 2013 over the recession and recovery that have spanned Obamas tenure jobs have been added at the top and bottom of the wage scale a Reuters analysis of labor statistics shows In the middle the economy has shed positions  whether in traditional trades like machining or electrical work whitecollar jobs in human resources or technical ones like computer operatorsThe trend is in plain sight in Dalton Georgia a manufacturing hub 90 miles 145 kilometersnorth of Atlanta Massive factories that made it the carpet capital of the world were slammed by the collapse of the housing bubble During the recession with machines idle they began investing heavily in new technology and are now laying plans to restore some lost jobsBut the new positions are more skewed to the high and low end and there will be fewer of them per dollar of output than before the recession said Brian Anderson president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of CommerceWe can produce a whole lot of new carpet with not a lot more people Anderson said Companies have spent between 15 and 2 billion on retooling and innovation reducing demand for labor while higher than average regional unemployment continued to hold down wages he saidFirms like flooring giant Shaw Industries pared jobs  dropping 5000 from a prerecession labor force of 28000  but with new technology have rebuilt revenue to near previous levels The company is boosting wages for master mechanics to around 30 an hour but feels no pressure to increase wages for the unskilled positions it retainsThe heavy investment in robotics and mechanization has raised expectations said Paul Richard Shaws vice president of human resources It has put more emphasis on associates that can bring technical skillsAhead of Obamas annual address the business community is expecting the president to press for passage of the TransPacific trade treaty though a debate rages within the Democratic Party over whether that would create more middle class jobs than would be lost to increased importsOthers say he may seek more overtime pay for midlevel salaried workers propose a higher federal minimum wage or renew calls for major infrastructure spendingObama has proposed expanded access to community college education and improved family leave policies while some of his allies have called for an outright wealth transfer from the top to the middleFor Obamas legacy none of that may matterThe forces at work in the American economy appear so entrenched that Obama may be remembered as the president who pulled the nation from its worst downturn since the Great Depression but failed to arrest deepening economic inequalityThe Federal Reserve under Obama appointee Janet Yellen has put money in almost all Americans pockets with near zero interest rates that have held down mortgage payments allowed companies to reinvest and boosted job creationBut the Feds Survey of Consumer Finances shows how uneven the distribution of that stimulus has been Between 2010 and 2013 as recovery took hold and stock markets soared the average net worth of families in the top 40 percent of income earners grew For all others average net worth shrank declining 19 percent for the middle fifthSimilarly the average earnings for families in the top 10 percent grew more than 9 percent from 2010 through 2013 while those at other levels stagnated or shrank For the middle fifth average earnings fell 46 percentOver the six years through 2013 the middle fifths average annual family earnings fell to 47243 from 53008 while their average net worth dropped to 170066 from 236525Obama had a good start in ending the recession and a good start to recovery and then we were knocked off that trajectory said Josh Bivens an economist with the Economic Policy Institute a leftleaning think tank that advocates higher minimum wages and other policies to boost incomesBivens blamed the end of stimulus programs and a standoff in Congress over the federal debt ceiling that curbed government spending for the loss of initial momentumTo a degree the administration has also been a captive of broad technological and global trends Automation and the offshoring of manufacturing and service jobs continue to transform industries and communities such as DaltonObamas changing rhetoric over time appears increasingly to acknowledge the magnitude of the challengeIn 2011 he called the erosion of middle class jobs a Sputnik moment that should energize the country to outproduce and outinnovate the rest of the world By last year the tone was more tempered The cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by  let alone get ahead And too many still arent working at all Obama said in last years State of the Union address Our job is to reverse these trends It wont happen right away
