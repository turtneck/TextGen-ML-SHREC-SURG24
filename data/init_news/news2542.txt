David Axelrod is CNNs senior political commentator and host of the podcast  The Axe Files  He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns The opinions expressed in this commentary are hisThats where the Republican Party finds itself today both in its nominating battle and in its implacable not even a hearing stance on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick GarlandPrivately and to some degree publicly Republicans seem resigned to death in November by fire or by hanging The prolonged nominating process is merely a means of determining the nature of the execution and limiting the risk to other candidates on the ballotThe normal pattern of GOP nominating contests for the past two decades is that the party endures heated primary fights between populist evangelical and centerright candidates only to settle on the leading establishment choiceHaving stoked antiObama fever in order to score midterm victories at the polls and then failed to deliver on pledges to derail major elements of the Presidents agenda the party elite now finds itself overrun by a wave of outrage and discontentThat wave has carried Donald Trump to the brink of the nomination a hostile takeover that so horrifies the Republican establishment that many are now turning in desperation to a man they dislike almost as much as the prospect of Trump as their standardbearerSen Ted Cruzs entire tenure since his arrival in Washington in 2013 has been dedicated to taunting a Republican leadership he views as accommodationistHe called Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate He led the party over the cliff of a government shutdown in a vain effort to derail Obamacare To this day he casts his campaign as one to upend the Washington cartel of insiders and lobbyists who he says have betrayed the GOP and the countryNow that same cartel is slowly and grudgingly embracing Cruz who is currently running a distant second to Trump as their last best hope to deprive the bilious billionaire of the 1237 delegates he needs to win the nominationSen Lindsey Grahams painfully tepid endorsement of Cruz last week followed by Mitt Romneys announcement that he would stand up for the Texas senator in Tuesdays Utah caucuses reflected the dilemma in which the GOP finds itselfIn backing Cruz neither of these pillars of the Republican establishment spent a whole lot of time extolling his virtues focusing instead on the man they are desperate to stopToday there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism Romney said Through the calculated statements of its leader Trumpism has become associated with racism misogyny bigotry xenophobia vulgarity and most recently threats and violence I am repulsed by each and every one of theseSo hes for the other guyJeb Bush followed in similarly measured fashion on WednesdayMany are gravitating to Cruz arguing as Bush did that his predictable views are more plausible in a Republican nominee than the philosophically promiscuous cult of personality spectacle that is TrumpI dont like Cruz but I can defend most of his positions with a straight face one prominent Republican leader told me I dont know how I go on TV and make an argument for TrumpThere is a potential bonus of a Cruz nomination this party leader explained For the past several cycles conservative activists have complained that by nominating relatively moderate candidates  Romney in 12 and Sen John McCain in 08  the party spurned its base and depressed Republican turnoutLets have Cruz and we will put that issue to rest said this party leader convinced that the Texans appeal pitched to evangelicals and the right is too narrow to command a general election If its Trump there will be no resolution Each side will blame the other for the disasterBut all these efforts to stop Trump may well be too late Even if they succeed in depriving him of the delegates he needs to clinch the nomination his victory in Arizonas winnertakeall primary meant Trump probably will come closeThat would leave the party establishment in the unhappy position of either embracing the frontrunner or courting a rebellion among his supporters by dumping him And while a few weeks ago many still talked hopefully about swapping in a fresh and more appealing recruit  say House Speaker Paul Ryan  the somber realization is seeping in that it will be hard enough to topple Trump much less bypass Cruz at the same timeThough Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee would enter a general election campaign with historically high negatives she is running well ahead of Trump whose unfavorable ratings eclipse even hersCruz runs a tighter race in early polls But as a factional candidate his ability to grow is very much in questionOnly Gov John Kasich is outrunning Clinton in general election trial heats But Kasich has won just one of the first 37 nominating contests  his own state of Ohio  and netted not one delegate in Tuesdays races in Arizona and UtahKasichs brand of compassionate conservatism might sell in a general and he would be a comfortable choice for the party establishment But he has struggled to find traction within a party riven by angerThe party leaders are prisoners of their baseBase politics also has trapped the Republican leadership when it comes to Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme CourtWhile some opponents have portrayed Garland as a threat to the Second Amendment his record over 19 years on the federal bench makes it hard to paint the judge out of the mainstream He is more liberal than Republicans in the Senate would prefer but as moderate a choice as they probably would get from any Democratic presidentA solid majority of Americans feels that the Senate should take up the Garland nomination rather than allowing the seat left vacant by the death in February of Justice Antonin Scalia to go unfilled for more than a yearBut were Garland seated to replace Scalia a conservative judicial icon he would shift the balance of the court giving it a majority of Democratic appointees for the first time in decadesThats why McConnell has ordained that the Garland nomination will not get even a hearing much less a voteThe right has threatened summary expulsion for any Senate Republican who breaks ranks with the majority leader over GarlandErick Erickson an influential conservative commentator threw down the gauntlet on my podcast The Axe FilesIf Republicans cave I mean this would be more the end of the Republican Party than Donald Trump he said Because I mean going back to Ronald Reagans election in 1980 the Supreme Court has been the issue of the Republican Party It comes up in every campaign  presidential campaign it comes up in every congressional campaign every evennumbered year And if the Republicans were then to say in this year  after years of saying The Supreme Court hangs in the balance you must vote Republican  Hey were going to go through with this it would be game overAll this has put the six Republican senators running for reelection in states that voted for Obama in a terrible bind Swing voters in those states already probably influenced by the presidential race also would be among those favoring action on the Garland nominationThat group includes Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa who suddenly is facing a challenge from a former Democratic lieutenant governor the aptly named Patty JudgePlaying base politics  tolerating nativism birtherism and promising obstruction at every turn  could cost Republicans the presidency and threaten control of the SenateAnd if the GOP crashes and burns it will probably get a more liberal court nominee than Garland from the next President ClintonFor seven years the GOP establishment knowingly and cynically rode the antiObama tiger feeding the beast with a steady diet of red meatNow whatever happens at the Cleveland convention the party elite may wind up as dinner
