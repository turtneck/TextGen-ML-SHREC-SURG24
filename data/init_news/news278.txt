Washington CNN This time eight years ago when she first ran for president Hillary Clinton was already officially a candidateIm in it to win it she said in a YouTube video posted on January 21 2007But even though a second Hillary Clinton for president campaign is all but certain she and those close to her are debating when she should jump in the race potentially delaying her entry by monthsThere is no waiting for Republicans who are engaged in a furious behindthescenes scramble for advisers and donors Mitt Romney Republicans nominee in 2012 announced Friday he would bow out after just three weeks on the presidential speculation treadmill Three Republican senators two current governors and one former governor have all made active moves toward campaignsThere could be ten or more Republican candidates by this summer That might be when Hillary Clinton gets around to officially moving toward a campaign if she heeds some confidantes who are privately arguing for an announcement in July to coincide with the start of the third fundraising quarter Delaying until the summer is an idea that is said to be gaining momentum against those who want to stick to the plan for an April start dateThe possibility of the delay is very real but still unsettledI would say its 40 percent in the direction of those arguing for a delay said one Democrat who supports a spring debut for Clintons presidential campaign Another Democrat who saw merits in both time lines put the odds of a delay at 50 percentDemocrats on both sides of the debate spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity so they could make their case without upsetting Clinton or those close to her for talking openly about internal deliberationsSome Clinton loyalists worry that as the increasingly crowded Republican race heats up the attacks on her could begin to stick without an apparatus in place to answer themThe liberal superPAC American Bridge has been countering Republican attacks on Clintons behalf but many Democrats think its no substitute for a campaign messaging operationTheyre doing terrific research said one but they dont know what her specific policy agenda is going to be She should get in and start putting together a substantive policy agenda so the attacks that are going to begin to come from every single Republican who is jumping in to the race can be answeredThe Democratic National Committee is beginning to take on a larger role in an effort to protect Clinton and the party brand but many Democrats are concerned even that wont be enoughOther supporters want Clinton to lay low as the Republican field heats up convinced Clinton will avoid some fire if shes undeclared and GOP candidates will take aim at each other insteadNever interrupt your opponent when its destroying itself That event in Iowa  nobody hated that more than RNC chairman Reince Priebus said one Democrat referring to the recent Iowa Freedom Summit the first GOP cattle call for prospective candidates of many Republican presidential hopefuls though noticeably neither Jeb Bush Mitt Romney nor Rand Paul attended Lets get Sarah Palin out there lets get Donald Trump out there  the whole clown carSome Democrats believe its also in Clintons best interest to wait until President Obama whose approval ratings have begun to rebound becomes more popular since a campaign by his former secretary of state will undoubtedly be seen as an extension of his presidency Its a view shared by many at the White House who eye the entry of Clinton into the 2016 contest as the beginning of Obamas lame duck phaseBut if Clinton waits she could run the risk of looking like shes taking the Democratic nomination for grantedThe American people dont like to see a candidate assume that something is theirs for the taking warned one Clinton supporterIf Hillary Clinton is trying to avoid a coronation it really is a terrible way to go about it It sends a message that we dont have to campaign in the primaries said a Democratic operative in Iowa who warned it leaves an opening It really does require another candidate to fill that voidAnd so far no one hasVice President Joe Biden former Maryland governor Martin OMalley former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have all made the trek to Iowa in the last year but none are being particularly agressive in recruiting staff or taking on ClintonOMalley hired one staff member the other day and thats all anyone is talking about said the Iowa operative of the unusually quiet political scene in the early state Its kinda weirdIn 2008 Clintons air of inevitability was off putting to many voters Clinton and her advisers have been looking to avoid it this time aroundBut without an insurgent Obamalike candidate waiting in the wings Clinton insiders are now pretty much convinced that populist darling and Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren wont run despite initial concerns she could mount a serious challenge from the left many loyalists argue Clinton is safe to waitIf shes out there working hard making her case speaking to voters thats whats going to matter said a Washingtonbased Clinton backer who thinks a delayed campaign launch could benefit herIt wont benefit her campaign coffers howeverMoney will not flow until shes actually running said one Democrat who cited powerful donor support for a Clinton run but acknowledged People dont give that kind of money on speculationThe numerous Clinton loyalists interviewed for this piece admit there are arguments for both timelines But perhaps the most important factor in deciding when to jump in the race is Hillary Clintons personal inclination to put off campaigningThe last time she ran for president she entered the race in January 2006 almost two years before the election The Democratic primary contest turned into a bruising slog that she is not eager to repeatYou cant dance in that spotlight for two years a Clinton loyalist said Shes not Rand Paul shes the most famous woman on earth and every move is scrutinized
