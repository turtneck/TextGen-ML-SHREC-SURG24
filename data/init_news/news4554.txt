Washington CNN In order to pursue a presidential bid Florida Sen Marco Rubio has agreed not to run for reelection leaving Democrats with a shot at retaking the seat and with it increasing their chances of reclaiming the SenateBut its no easy feat  especially as Florida Democrats may have a primary problem ahead of themNational and state Democrats see Rep Patrick Murphy a secondterm centrist Democrat with a proven ability to fundraise as their best shot at a win The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this week endorsed Murphy in an effort to dissuade others from jumping into the primaryBut that hasnt discouraged liberal firebrand Rep Alan Grayson from the race If anything its made him more eager to competeFlorida Democratic voters choose our party nominee not outoftouch party bosses sipping cognac in a smokefilled room in Washington Grayson said in a statement shortly after the DSCC announced its endorsementIts a prospect that already has Democrats worriedIt would certainly be better to not have him in the race said Florida Democratic strategist Steve Schale a Murphy supporter Grayson tends to sort of rely on hyperbole and invective and Im not sure thats the kind of primary which is healthy for usI think its a centerright state I think he is not electable in a general and I think he has the ability to create a pretty divisive primary if he runs he saidBut Grayson has a different theory on what it takes to win in Florida He believes there are no more swing voters in the state and so Democrats must offer a clear contrast with Republicans to turn out otherwise apathetic voters and disaffected DemocratsWe consistently fail them by making it seem like were Republican light he said Its not the winning formula to pretend youre a Republican and hope some Republicans vote for you Its not the winning formula to be wishywashy on the issuesWhile he declined to discuss Murphy by name he referenced somebody else in the primary race who might have the partyswitcher vote  a veiled jab at the younger member who was a registered Republican up through 2010 though he claims he backed John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaignThats part of whats given the congressman reason for such strong interest in a run and Murphys supporters reason for concern Grayson has a much clearer appeal among Democratic primary voters than Murphy whos made a point of breaking with his party on key issues like the Keystone XL pipeline While its Murphys willingness to compromise and centrist profile that has Democrats bullish on his chances statewide those could also be hurdles in a Democratic primary if Grayson were to force the issueI would be very surprised if I ever lost a primary in my life Grayson boasted Our voters will crawl over hot coals to vote for meThe congressman is already fashioning himself as the heir to liberal darling Sen Elizabeth Warren who pulled out a difficult win in one of 2012s most expensive hardestfought senate races Indeed Grayson said hes had many discussions with her and her campaign staff about this alreadyAnd I think we can duplicate her success not only in fundraising but in the enormous grassroots army she put together he saidBut the prospect of a MurphyGrayson faceoff could make things difficult for Democrats as regardless of the outcome its likely to become a nasty personal fightGrayson is not one to mince words he once compared the tea party movement to the KKK and ran a campaign ad in 2010 calling GOP challenger Dan Webster Taliban DanAnd Democrats wary of Grayson hurting the partys chances in the state are already promising that the lurid details of his messy annulment which included accusations of abuse bigamy and cheating  will gain greater notice if its clear hes serious about jumping inGrayson detractors believe once progressives are more familiar with his personal issues theyll question their support for his policiesAnd a bruising resource draining intraparty fight through the end of August when Florida holds its primary leaves the eventual nominee little time  just nine weeks  to replenish depleted campaign offers and correct any negative attacks that stuck during the primary Itll be a hugely expensive race said former Democratic state Sen Dan GelberMoney plays an outsize influence in Florida because of the number and expense of the media markets he said We have 11 expensive media markets and creating an identity with voters is incredibly expensiveHe predicted the primary alone could require candidates to spend up to 15 millionTheres also a chance the field could become more crowded in the weeks ahead Floridas Supreme Court has yet to issue a final ruling on the states contested congressional map and if legislators are directed to redraw it the changes would cause a domino effect that could make some House incumbents decide a run for Senate is more attractive than a tough reelection fightSchale indicated at least one candidate whos already opted out of the Senate race  Gwen Graham a freshman Democratic rising star whos facing a tough reelection fight in Floridas 2nd district  could change her mind in such a situationShell reassess what her options will be and make a decision said Schale who described himself as close to the Democrat and said he speaks with her oftenHe emphasized however absent something dramatically changing that is not in her control there is no way shes not running for reelectionOthers still are keeping their names in the mix Gelber said he hasnt ruled it out but that hes not right now prepared to do it because of the significant time and energy commitment and his young familyBut he added Id have to see what happened in the raceStill Democrats say if they do end up with a messy primary it cant possibly rival the GOPs which is facing a field in disarray after two toptier candidates unexpectedly opted out A number of conservative groups have already expressed support for tea party favorite Rep Ron DeSantis but a number of establishmentpreferred candidates have shown interest including Carlos LopezCantera the states lieutenant governor
