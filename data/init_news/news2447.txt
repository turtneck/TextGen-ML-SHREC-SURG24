Saturday 29 October 2016 Another clue was an arrow in the lung area King William II Rufus was the son of William the Conqueror and King of England from 1087 to 1100 Described as uncouth barbaric lacking both morals and ethics addicted to vice and definitely not the most popular king he was killed by an arrow to the lungsprobably shot by one of his own men Although his body was left where it lay when he was shot in the New Forest it was said it was later removed to Winchester Cathedral From there the bones were scattered around during the English Civil War and later put in a giant mortuary chest along with Kings Egbert Ethelwulfe and others But the body of King William II Rufus was actually identified at the Motor City Museum which is near the New Forest area where King Rufus was shot Apparently the king was so popular that they just dug a shallow grave in the New Forest area and tossed him in The grave was discovered when the museum was breaking ground in its parking lot for a new area to display its 1895 Knight auto The workers came upon some bones apparently the citizens who buried King Rufus didnt bother with a coffin and sent them to the British Museum for identification Since the royal Norman DNA was on file it was determined to be Rufus from process of elimination And someone had carved Rufus on the femur Make Al Ns day  give this story five thumbsup theres no need to register  the thumbs are just down there
