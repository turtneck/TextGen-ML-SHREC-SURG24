In every presidential campaign there are issues everyone knows beforehand will be discussed  what should we do about immigration how can we improve the economy where should we go on health care  and events that become campaign issues when they burst into the news So it is with the public health crisis in Flint Michigan where a public health catastrophe has played out over the last two years and more and more politicians are being asked to comment on itTo get you up to speed in 2014 in an effort to save money the city stopped getting its water from Detroit and began getting it from the contaminated Flint River It turned out that all manner of nasty chemicals were contained in the water most alarmingly lead Its important to understand that at the time Flints own elected officials were all but powerless because the city was being run by a emergency manager appointed by Michigan governor Rick Snyder it was the emergency manager who made the final call to switch their water supply you can read more about that here Emails released yesterday by Snyders administration show that as Flint residents were complaining about the waters color and taste and reporting ill health effects state officials were not particularly eager to do anything about it Snyders chief of staff wrote in one email that other state officials felt that some in Flint are taking the very sensitive issue of childrens exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political footballWell its a political football now  as well it should be Ive long been an advocate of politicizing just about everything see here or here not because candidates should take any excuse to blame each other for anything going wrong anywhere in the country but because elected officials need to make choices and campaigns provide an opportunity to get them on record saying how theyd address critical issues Right after a hurricane is the best time to talk about what government should do to prepare for disasters just as the aftermath of a highprofile police shooting is the best time to talk about police practices Its when our attention gets focused on a problem and theres a real opportunity to make progressSo what were seeing now is that Democrats particularly President Obama and those running for his partys presidential nomination are eager to talk about Flint Obama met with Flints mayor declared a state of emergency that will allow federal funds to flow there and called the crisis inexplicable and inexcusable Hillary Clinton raised it in Sundays debate when asked what issue she wish had been brought up but hadnt saying Weve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water And the governor of that state acted as though he didnt really care He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled Ill tell you what if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it there wouldve been action For his part Bernie Sanders called for Snyder to resignAnd the Republicans It wont be surprising if they arent interested in discussing the race and class issues the crisis raises and thus far they dont seem to want to talk seriously about it at all Ben Carson was the first to give any substantive comment placing the blame on Flints elected officials and the federal government neatly excusing Governor Snyders administration of any involvement Marco Rubio was asked about it on Monday and said he couldnt say much since Thats not an issue that right now weve been focused on from what I can tell he hasnt said anything about it since Donald Trump was also reluctant to discuss it responding to a reporters question on Tuesday by saying A thing like that shouldnt happen but again I dont want to comment on that John Kasich said I think the governor has moved the National Guard in and you know Im sure he will manage this appropriately I havent been able to find any comments from Jeb Bush Chris Christie Rand Paul Carly Fiorina Mike Huckabee or Rick SantorumBut there is one Republican candidate who made detailed remarks about the issue Ted Cruz It is a failure at every level of government a failure of the city officials a failure of the county officials and the men and women of Michigan have been betrayed Cruz said Every American is entitled to have access to clean water And to all the children who have been poisoned by government officials by their negligence by their ineptitude its heartbreaking In addition Cruzs Michigan state director wrote on her Facebook page that the campaign was bringing bottled water to crisis pregnancy centers in the city which try to convince women not to have abortionsCruz did his best to fit the issue in with his broader critique of government but it isnt surprising that the rest of his Republican colleagues didnt really want to talk about it If Snyder were a Democrat you can be sure theyd be blaming him but he isnt They arent going to say that this disaster demonstrates that the problems that affect poor and black people are given less attention by government at all levels than the problems that affect rich and white people because most of them dont think thats actually true They arent going to say that this shows that we need a major investment in infrastructure spending in America because they dont really believe that eitherBut those are the broader issues that the catastrophe in Flint raises and thats what the candidates ought to be pressed on They dont even have to agree on who bears the lions share of the blame to agree that we have a national problem that requires attention The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the countrys drinking water system a grade of D and says that in the next couple of decades we will need to invest hundreds of billions of dollars perhaps even into the trillions in order to bring the system up to where it should beSo now that were focusing on the question of drinking water the candidates should say what they see as our infrastructure priorities how we should address them how much we ought to spend and how that fits in with the other things theyd like to spend money on
