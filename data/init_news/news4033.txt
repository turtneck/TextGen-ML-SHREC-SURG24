While some on the Right want to downplay the race angle others on the Left suggest that the entire success of the modern GOP was premised on exploiting Southern racism Interestingly though much of what both sides think we know about this trend appears to be wrong Elections analyst Sean Trende recently argued that while the dominant narrative continues to insist that the South began to realign toward the Republicans in the wake of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in fact Southern loyalties had begun to weaken during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt As evidence Trende notes that the South voted increasingly Republican every year of FDRs presidency and that although Eisenhower lost Dixie he did so by only three points What is more while Eisenhower was gaining support in the South he was simultaneously pushing civil rights legislation So why did the South become increasingly Republican starting in the 1940s According to Trende Southern whites simply became wealthy enough to start voting Republican This of course flies in the face of everything we think we know about why the South became solidly Republican This is not to suggest that race wasnt involved in the shift that really began to reach a tipping point after the 60s but it does suggest that history is more complex than the Readers Digest or rather the Mother Jones version many of us are taught in schoolAfter the postCivil Rights Act Dixiecrat shift economics and airconditioning conspired to send American voters fleeing the Rust Belt for the Sun Belt further eroding the power of the Northeast Republican establishment personified by the New York governors and presidential aspirants Thomas Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller This is a trend that is still under way according to the US census the city of Austin Texasthe liberal enclave in a deeply red statewas by far the fastest growing city in America from2010 to 2013 Its unwise to write off an entire swath of the nation but thats just what Barry Goldwater who represented Arizona in the US Senate seemed to do when he declared that sometimes I think the country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern seaboard and let it float out to sea The Johnson campaign turned that line into a devastating ad in which the eastern side of a US map floating in water is literally sawed offTruth be told the Souths influence came to dominate both parties Democrats soon saw that the only way they could win would be to cut into the GOPs base For a while it looked like the only path to Democratic victory was through nominating a son of the South From Texan Lyndon Johnson to Georgia peanut farmer Jimmy Carter to Arkansass Bill Clinton and even to yes Al Gore seemingly only Southern Democrats could win the White Houseand even that trend was not very recent consider Virginiaborn segregationist Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman the descendants of slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers or even Warm Springs Georgia resident FDR In the postReagan years Southerners so dominated both parties that at one point we had a president from Arkansas Clinton a vice president from Tennessee Gore a Majority Leader from Mississippi Trent Lott and a House Speaker from Georgia Newt Gingrich The chairman of the GOP was Haley Barbour from Mississippi President George W Bush of Texas Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee and House Majority Leaders Dick Armey and Tom DeLay Texans soon followed in what was perhaps the apex of Southern domination of the GOP and simultaneously of Republican triumphalism Talk circulated that the GOP had achieved a permanent governing majorityRonald Reagan downplayed his intellectual and cosmopolitan credentials to accentuate his everyman persona In similar fashion Dwight Eisenhower the former supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe and president of Columbia University dodged questions by employing bumbling answers at press conferences In public he wore a costume of affability optimism and farmboy charm wrote David Brooks in The Road to Character As president he was perfectly willing to appear stupider than he really was if it would help him perform his assigned role He was willing to appear tonguetied if it would help him conceal his true designs Biographer Andrew Sinclair said much the same thing about the muchmaligned Warren Hardings mute your own horn leadership style In this regard George W Bush simply followed a longstanding traditionalbeit with a Texas twang Tevi Troy the former Bush aide who authored What Jefferson Read Ike Watched and Obama Tweeted believes that Bush probably read more history than Jack Kennedy If that sounds absurd its partly because Kennedy highlighted his intellectual credentials while the Yaleeducated Bush downplayed his As a result we consider Kennedy no dummy but no genius either smarter Is this only the result of a liberal media painting Republicans as illiterate Babbitts Hardly To be fair Troy writes Bush was not blameless in acquiring a reputation for not readingIn 2000 the New York Times Nicholas Kristoff wrote that Kent Hance believes he helped teach Mr Bush the need to be more folksy As Mr Hance put it He wasnt going to be outChristianed or outgoodoldboyed again If this is true and one suspects it is then its hard to fault Bush for doing what he had to do to win And lets not forget that he wasnt just trying to forge his own comeback he was also attempting to avenge his fathers defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in 1992 What is more his father former President George H W Bush had been mocked as a taxraiser and a preppy wimp George W Bush did everything possible to be the opposite of that The adoption of the Texas persona helped but the younger Bush overswaggered and overtwanged But hey he managed to win two elections and winning is everything rightThe problem was although this is a bipartisan phenomenon it just happens to have disproportionately impacted the Right Again Republicans are thought of as the stupid party Both sides of the political aisle occasionally genuflect at the altar of rural superiority even if Republicans are decidedly better at it Although President Obamas appeal to urbanites and minorities is obvious he is not above the affectation of droppin his gs and prattlin on about folks Likewise prep schoolbred John Kerry Can I get me a hunting license here experimented with some downright downhome Forrest Gump elocution during his 2004 race Hillary Clinton has been known to affect a Southern accent when convenient Even less subtle was the overthetop twangy country music song Stand With Hillary released in late 2014Put your boots on and lets smash this ceilin where all the gs were dropped The producer of the Stand With Hillary song also produced a 2008 viral mariachi video Viva Obama Nothing happens by accident in politics Hillarys pandering is a transparent attempt to woo the real America Noting the dichotomy between Obamas popculture outreachwhich featured the WillIAm song Yes We Canand HillarysBen Domenech publisher of The Federalist website observed The attempt to pander to the white working class voters left out by the Democratic agenda for so many years is obvious and clumsy but also revealing signaling their perception of whats happened to the electorate in the course of the Obama eraFor all the GOPs problems it is perhaps instructive to remember that Democrats also face their own challenges which include struggles to win white votesand their own gender gap with men Putting aside politics the notion that America should have one de facto white party and one de facto minority party strikes me as unhealthy We should all resist this sort of racial balkanization And of course just as Republicans confront regional geographic problems the Democrats missed winning the White House in 2000 at least partly because Al Gore couldnt deliver his home state of Tennessee Just a dozen years ago former senator Zell Miller a conservative Democrat penned a book titled A National Party No More lamenting the fact that his beloved party had written off the South and would continue to pay an electoral price Today our national Democratic leaders look south and say I see onethird of a nation and it can go to hell  he wrote This is a good example of how political fortunes can quickly change Just as Millers book hasnt aged well electorally speaking the Democrats seem to have made the right political moves a dozen years from now this book might seem antiquated I wont be at all upset if that happens Still almost all the longterm trends including demographic shifts and shifts in public opinion seem to suggest the GOP is in trouble if it doesnt adapt and overcomeIn the introduction of this book I wrote about my rural background in western Maryland and the deep abiding respect I have for rural Americans who have done much to make this a great country I dont want to see an America where everyone is huddled into cities In the words of Hank Williams Jr we need Americans who still know how to skin a buck and run a trotline But one of the many challenges confronting conservatives is that America has transitioned from the agrarian age to the industrial age to the information age Unlike the industrial age where the topdown assembly line model favored liberals the tech revolution may favor the rugged individualism embraced by libertarianleaning conservatives Regardless given these trends it makes little sense for a movement or a party to allow the ruralversusurban paradigmand the many cultural issues tied up in thatto define and assign membership status So long as Republicans could win this way it made perfect sense to exploit the cleavage between city folks and Real America Not only was this smart politics but it also tapped into deepseated beliefsSo where did this traditional deification of rural areas come from Among other things credit or blame the influence of religion think the Garden of Eden versus the Tower of Babel philosophy Rousseaus notion about noble savages and later transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emersonand Walden Woodsloving Henry David Thoreau and various ideas conceived during the time of Americas founding such as Thomas Jeffersons agrarianism I think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries Jefferson wrote Madison as long as they are chiefly agricultural and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of America When they get piled upon one another in large cities as in Europe they will become corrupt as in Europe This was bipartisan Believe it or not in the runup to his 1932 election Groton and Harvardeducated Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed far more support from rural and Southern voters than with bigcity typesand painted himself not as a former Wall Street lawyer but rather as a simple farmerThis brings us to a contradiction within conservatism Much of conservatisma belief in free markets for instanceis premised on the dynamic notion that more people equal more ideas But while optimistic free marketeers adhering to this Reagan and Kemp model subscribe to this theory most populists do not The more optimistic worldview made major strides when economists like Julian Simon and Ester Boserup took on the Malthusian catastrophe argument which erroneously predicted that global overpopulation would lead to mass starvation and demonstrated that more people equals more ideas innovation and prosperity When you think about it it makes sense Rural societies tend to work on subsistence you eat what you grow be careful what you wish for local foods advocates but cities by their very nature demand free market economic skills such as cooperation specialization and trade These things make us rich And cities are the areas where these things are appreciated and magnified And let us not forget that great cities after all not only have fostered great hedge funds but have also built great cathedrals stone by stoneLeaders emerge during times of tragedy and crisis and it was at this moment that Nikki Haley the female Indian American governor of South Carolina who also happens to be a conservative Republican seized the moment Today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our capitol grounds Haley said at a press conference on June 22 2015 This flag while an integral part of our past does not represent the future of our great state She was flanked by Republican senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott who is one of only two African Americans in the US Senate And in a way the South Carolina governor and these senators represent a changing Republican Party as well as a changing South Graham the only white representative is probably the least conservative of the three But they bring diverse perspectives that not very long ago were absent from Republican politics in the South The biggest reason I asked for that flag to come down was I couldnt look my children in the face and justify it staying there Haley later told CNNs Don Lemon What I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and they felt hurt and pain No one should feel pain  My father wears a turban My mother at the time wore a sari It was hard growing up in South Carolina
