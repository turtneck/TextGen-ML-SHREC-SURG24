But Benjamin Netanyahus reelection was regarded with apathy by many Palestinians in the West Bank and some even welcomed the news albeit as the best of several bad optionsUnder Netanyahu things will deteriorate But if it cant get any better it might as well get worse Ahmad who declined to give his full name told Salon His customers browsing for phone accessories in central Ramallah agreed When youre in the West Bank it doesnt much matter whos in the Knesset settlement expansion military crackdowns and wars have taken place on the watch of both the left and right and theres been realistic progress toward statehood under neitherThe experience of the Palestinians is clear Since the assassination of Rabin nothing in Israeli politics has brought something good Huneida Ghanem the general director of the Palestinian Forum for Israeli Studies MADAR told Salon Time and time again election after election after election has just brought something worse Palestinians see this and in their head they understand that nothing is going to change that it will just get worse and worseThis year Ghanem said some did hope that Herzog and Livni had the potential to change things a wish that only makes Netanyahus win even more disappointing But she also believes that any trust in the pairs centerleft Zionist Union which until the elections final hours was billed as a likely winner is misplaced The sense is echoed across the West Bank where most dismiss the Israeli opposition with a laugh refusing to refer to it as left wing in any meaningful senseNetanyahu Herzog Lieberman if anyone from those Zionist parties become prime minister it wont make any difference They all have the same strategy to fulfill their ideology Bassam Shweiki told Salon A literature enthusiast and activist Shweiki speaks English with a London twang despite the fact hes lived most of his life in Hebron A West Bank city carved up by Israeli settlement enclaves and military closures the city barely featured in election campaigns aside from a prosettlement visit by rightwinger Avigdor LiebermanThe Zionist ideology says Israel is the homeland for the Jewish people that God promised so theres no place for any other nations in the promised land Shweiki continued The strategy is to hold the peace process without announcing its death while continuing to establish settlements demolishing homes confiscating Palestinian lands and so on while deceiving the world by saying that there are negotiationsShweikis view that expansion is inevitable in Zionism is shared by most in the West Bank and its the reason many are even pleased at Netanyahus win Unlike other leaders they believe he wont obscure that fact and with policies of occupation laid bare pressure on Israel for a just solution can only increasePersonally Im glad that he won This proves to the world that it is Israel and its people that do not want peace Amer Khader a postgraduate nutritionist from Ramallah told Salon His speech was clearly stating that if he wins the Palestinian State will not see the light that Jerusalem is forever the capital of the state of Israel and for the continuation of the illegal settlements in the West BankWhats the worst that can happen More houses to be taken when more than 2000 have been demolished in East Jerusalem Another war on Gaza Its already destroyed More settlements Let it be It is just more isolation of Israel through its racist discriminatory apartheid policiesThe bleak irony in Khaders view comes from long experience Even for those Palestinians who are able to vote  those citizens of Israel who make up some 20 percent of its population the achievements of this election have transpired partly from the countrys right wing shooting itself in the foot Last year Israeli lawmakers raised the electoral thresholda move supported in part by rightwingers who hoped it would push small Arab parties out of representation altogether Instead several Palestinian and leftwing parties banded together to create the Joint List a broad coalition that won 14 seats and made Arab Israelis the third biggest power in the Knesset Even as they bemoaned the Knessets rightward tilt its leaders celebrated a new era of Palestinian political involvement on election night I came here to see resistance and to be proud of my community to get the best for us and to further our aims of two states 18yearold Razi Misherqui wearing a party Tshirt and draped in a Palestinian flag told Salon as the results came in I think Arab unity is really important and we can use this to show that we can make change and challenge whats going on In Ramallah Ghanem called the Joint List victory the surprise story of the election and it wasthe only reason that many Palestinians bothered to watch the political news at all But that doesnt mean its a gamechanger Many Arab Israelis believing any political activity in the Knesset is doomed to fail still boycott the elections and even the Joint Lists most ardent supporters are measured in their optimism Even as he pledged to challenge the consensus of the election leading Joint List MK Ahmad Tibi bemoaned a disappointing result in which the extreme rightwing got the upper hand And in the West Bank where Palestinians havent been able to vote for their own representation in nearly a decade hope for any changes the joint list might make is guarded With peace negotiations bearing only bitter fruit an occupation with no clear end and a political mood characterized by frustration and extremism the only sure thing about the path to a solution is that it will be tough Nothing is going to come from the Israeli state if the Israelis dont feel they dont pay any price for the Israeli occupation Ghanem told Salon The last 10 years theyve been building up this rightwing narrative this plan for Eretz Israel in the political scene Things that were once unacceptable to talk about are now part of the hegemonic discourse in Israel And Im not talking about buses on Shabbat Im talking about fascist discriminatory policies the settlement enterprise the occupation People feel very failed by the international community she added As theyve grown older they put so much hope into the peace process Over the years theyve tried violence and that didnt work the intifada and that didnt work peaceful resistance and none of it worked And then the international community came to them saying if you do this if you do this you can have a state But theyve done that and its led nowhere Still theres a strong feeling in the West Bank that change from the outside looks more likely than from within the Israeli state Real international pressure and action Ghanem said with a strong stress on the word real is the best hope for statehood If thats the case Khader said than a Netanyahu win might be a blessing in disguise Netanyahu is the worst for the economy of Israel and its international relations And the only way Israel will get weaker is through screwing their own relations which is happening he told Salon Let it be It wont get any better till it is screwed
