Tuesday 8 November 2016 Daily Mail forced to lie down in darkened room after confirmation Prince Harrys girlfriend is mixedrace The Daily Mail has been forced to go and lie down in a darkened room for a while after learning that Prince Harrys new girlfriend is one of those brown ones Doctors were called after the newspaper reported feeling faint at reading the Kensington Palace statement confirming the relationship The Daily Mail explained I know weve been reporting the relationship for days but wed hoped against hope it wasnt really true Sure weve trawled her entire career and social feeds going back years to find video clips and photos that might make her look unsuitable as a girlfriend for a member of our royal family all without ever saying its just because shes a brown foreigner  but you kinda knew that right I mean we cant just say we dont like her because shes brown and foreign Otherwise wed probably find our editor Paul Dacre being reported to himself in his other role at the Press Complaints Commission That wouldnt be good for anyone But now its bloody well confirmed shes definitely going out with him and well oh hear Im coming over all faint again Do you realise that any child they might have would be 6th in line to the throne Can you imagine a BROWN king At that point the doctors asked us to leave so they could administer an emergency sedative
