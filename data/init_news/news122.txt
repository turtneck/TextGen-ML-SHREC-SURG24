Watch live coverage of ceremonies in Selma commemorating 50 years since Bloody Sunday starting at 11 am ET Saturday on CNN and CNNgoCNN Fifty years ago this weekend a 25yearold John Lewis was beaten so badly by Alabama state troopers that they fractured his skullLewis calls the Edmund Pettus Bridge  where the troopers and and a group of white men deputized into a posse by the sheriff attacked hundreds of peaceful protesters on Bloody Sunday March 7 1965  an almost holy placeNow a Democratic US congressman Lewis is returning to Selma  as he has nearly every year since that historic march  to remember the fight for voting rights and to push voters across the country to participate in the political process He also wants people to continue to speak up about the problems of racial injustice and poverty that persist in American societyIt is important to come back to remember Selma Lewis told CNN in an interview at First Baptist Church The vote is powerful It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society and I dont want people to forget that people paid a priceSelma these churches and these people gave it everything they had We wouldnt be where we are today as a nation and as a people if it hadnt been for this communityChurches  like Selmas First Baptist and Brown Chapel  served as important meeting places during the movement in part because they were run by the black communityAnd music was vital as a unifying forceWithout music the movement would have been like a bird without wings Lewis saidHe recalled how people would often sing during the marches sometimes making up songs along the wayMusic helped create a sense of solidarity and there were people in some communities in some towns and cities like Selma saying if the meetings are being held at the church it must be all right Thats the house of the Lord They must be doing something that is rightActivists had been working for years in and around Selma trying to help people register to vote At the time only 21 of blacks in Dallas County were registered Lewis said When blacks attempted to register they were often given impossible tasks like counting the number of jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap to complete before being allowed to sign up Black lawyers doctors business people public school teachers and college professors were told they could not read and write well enough to pass the socalled literacy testAs chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Lewis  along with many others  would spill blood to change that not only as a leader of the Bloody Sunday march but in other confrontations across the SouthLewis was arrested some 40 times during the 1960s as he challenged the segregationist Jim Crow laws that kept blacks oppressed He spent 44 days imprisoned in Mississippi during the Freedom Rides in 1961 As a student at Fisk University he organized sitins at lunch counters in Nashville Tennessee even spending his birthday in jail there in 1961  so Lewis was no stranger to runins with the law But the events of Bloody Sunday would prove fateful for the movementTelevision cameras and photographers captured the troopers attacking the marchers with night sticks and whips  one man in the posse even had a rubber hose wrapped with barbed wire Lewis wrote in his memoir Walking with the WindThe troopers trampled the crowd with their horses and released nauseating tear gas The pictures horrified citizens across the country Eight days after the march President Lyndon B Johnson spoke before Congress about voting rights He signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug 6 to ensure that all citizens would be able to vote regardless of their skin colorFive decades later Lewis said a great deal of progress has been made in the struggle for equality But he added that despite having twice elected a black man to the nations highest office the country still has a long way to go to become the socalled Beloved Community Dr Martin Luther King Jr envisioned where we can lay down the burden of raceWe have a black president Weve made a lot of progress but were not a postracial society yet he said We still have a distance to go The scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American societyThe need for righteous indignationLewis who has written a trilogy of graphic novels for young adults about his life called March said it was important not to sweep the problems that still plague America under the rug and to instead speak up with a sense of righteous indignationYou cannot be quiet You have to speak up You have to speak out You have to find a way to get in the way and make some noise he said referring in particular to the killings of unarmed black men by police last summer in Ferguson Missouri and New York CityHe urged those demonstrating against police brutality and racial injustice to study and model the nonviolent methods of the civil rights activists of the 1950s and 60sThe poverty affecting people of all races across the country still gnaws at Lewis as does a lack of access to a good education He believes people should be outraged about hunger and violence and fired up to renew and strengthen the Voting Rights Act after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling gutted the key provision requiring certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to preclear any changes to voting laws with the federal government before implementing themOn Saturday Lewis and nearly 100 members of Congress from both parties will join President Barack Obama at the bridge in Selma  a bridge that still bears the name of a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader  to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday The bipartisan event comes as efforts to update to the Voting Rights Act have stalled in Congress Still Lewis is optimistic both parties can come together to fix itWe must do it Its the right thing to do he said There is a deliberate systematic effort to take us back Weve made too much progress to go back He was referring to efforts in some states to do away with early voting and voting on Sunday or on weekends and to require photo IDs moves he said make it harder for young people seniors and minorities to voteIm afraid that if we fail to fix it many of our fellow citizens will not be able to become participants in the democratic process he concluded
