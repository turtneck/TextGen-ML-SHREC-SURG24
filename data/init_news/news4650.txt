Kim Davis  the Rowan County Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Courts order to issue marriage licenses citing Gods authority  has been ordered to stand before US District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldnt be jailed and fined for her actionsIn a statement released after she refused for the fourth time to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license Davis said that to issue a marriage license which conflicts with Gods definition of marriage with my name affixed to the certificate would violate my conscience It is not a light issue for me It is a Heaven or Hell decisionI was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk she continued and I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County but I cannot violate my conscience That she is an elected official has become a point of contention because as such she cant be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Courts ruling Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session which could be prohibitively expensiveIn the meantime no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that since Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform they want Judge Bunning to impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous  but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt The scene at Davis office this morning was raucous with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building Praise the Lord yelled one Stand your ground Another demanded Davis Do your job One of her supporters was her husband who noted that his family has received death threats and warned people that hes a firm believer in the Second Amendment Im an old redneck hillbilly he warned Thats all Ive got to say Dont come knocking on my door Watch video via the CourierJournal below
