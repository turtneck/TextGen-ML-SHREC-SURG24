Washington CNN Donald Trumps attacks against Hillary Clinton are entering a new more personal phase in an already raucous election seasonThe firefight started last week after Trump said Clinton got schlonged by President Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries  taking the Yiddish word for penis and making a verb out of it which shocked even Yiddish scholarsThe following day Clinton unloaded on Trump in an interview with The Des Moines Register  saying that was not the first time hes demonstrated a penchant for sexismThere was a cease fire of sorts over Christmas but Trump restarted the next day turning Clintons words back on her and attempting to pull Bill Clinton into the fightHillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HES DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate Trump tweeted SaturdayTrump was even more explicit about Bill Clintons past indiscretions during an interview on Tuesday on NBCs Today in which he said Monica Lewinsky Paula Jones and many other women who have accused him of having affairs with them would be fair game in his continuing fight The interview marked the first time Trump explicitly named the Clinton accusersThe war of words comes as Bill Clinton is slated to hit the campaign trail for his wife next weeks after spending months in a mostly behindthescenes role And it offers a preview of the type of race that may be in store later in 2016 if Trump and Hillary Clinton win their partys nominations  even though the first primary races are still weeks awayThe hits on Bill Clintons past have long been simmering in the Republican primary Sen Rand Paul kept up his attack Monday saying that Bill Clinton was Hillarys womens problem But it wasnt until Trump brought them up that they caught fireWhen Trumps insults are directed at women immigrants AsianAmericans Muslims the disabled or hard working Americans looking to raise their wages  Hillary Clinton will stand up to him as she has from the beginning a campaign spokeswoman saidShe was asked about his attacks Tuesday while campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday but declined to answer reporter questions from the ropelineIts a long way from the phone call between Bill Clinton and Trump just seven months ago where Trump alleged that Clinton urged him to run for president  Clinton denied that he asked Trump to run  and even further from the chummy appearance of Bill and Hillary Clinton in photos with The Donald at his third wedding in 2005To get an idea of just how far the relationship between Trump and the top members of the Clinton family have fallen rewind to October 2008 when in one sentence Trump argued thenPresident George W Bush should be impeached for marching the nation to war and Clintons impeachment over the Lewinsky affair wasnt meritedLook at the trouble Bill Clinton got into with something that was totally unimportant And they tried to impeach him which was nonsense And yet Bush got us into this horrible war with lies by lying by saying they had weapons of mass destruction by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true Trump told CNNs Wolf Blitzer in 2008Well if you look at the different situations of course you could name many of them I could get you a list and Ill have it sent to your office in two seconds But there certainly were a lot of abuse of women you look at whether its Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or any of them and that certainly will be fair game Trump said on NBC Certainly if they play the womans card with respect to me that will be fair gameOn Tuesday evening Clinton passed up a chance to comment on Trump Speaking to a group of about 200 people in Berlin New Hampshire she only made an oblique reference to the GOP frontrunners famous catchphrase I happen to think that America is great and if we work together we will be greater Clinton said
