Ted Cruz won more delegates than anyone else on Saturday night further narrowing the race between Trump and Cruz and weakening Marco Rubio as the race heads to FloridaTed Cruz crushed the Kansas and Maine caucuses on Super Saturday while Donald Trump narrowly won the Louisiana and Kentucky prizes But perhaps the biggest news was Marco Rubio fading in the field to a distant third place despite racking up major endorsements across the mapOver the past six weeks the GOP establishment has moved from denial to anger to bargaining in the stages of grief that have accompanied this outsider election But with Rubios big fade the Hail Mary of a brokered convention looks even less likely And whats left of the partys centerright is heading for the next stage of depression A hug and a drink are in order as their party prepares to be wrested away from reform RepublicansThe Florida Republicanstruggling to present himself as the establishmentfriendly alternative to Donald Trumphad perhaps his worst night yet racking up zero wins and failing to even snag a secondplace finish anywhereIn fact Rubio finished third in three of the four states contested on Saturday And with just 8 percent the Florida senator fell to fourth in Mainefailing to get the minimum 10 percent necessary to win any delegatesMarco has to get out of the race Has to Trump saidTheres now no question that Rubios decision to descend to Trumps level of discourse has been a total failure The attacks on the size of Trumps hands the jokes about him wetting himself the con artist namecalling have all fallen flatAnd the losses on Saturday could rob his campaign of desperately needed momentum Rubio has repeatedly stated that he expects to win in his home state of Florida on March 15 And of course thats technically possible But he has yet to lead in a single public poll of the state And he doesnt want to talk about what hell do if Florida doesnt work outThe billionaire businessman with the flair of a pro wrestler said he hoped for a headtohead matchup with CruzIf Rubio takes Trumps advice then some hot CruzTrump oneonone action could be in our future Best election ever
