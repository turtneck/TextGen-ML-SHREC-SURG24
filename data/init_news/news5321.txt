District over two daysWint so far is charged only in the death of the family patriarch a wealthy socialite and business executive who ran American Iron Works a large supplier of iron and steel to construction projects Officials said additional charges are likely in the deaths of the wife son and housekeeperWint appeared in court with his wrists and ankles shackled escorted by three marshalsHe said only his name at the hearing At times he shook his shoulderlength dreads out of his eyesHis attorney Natalie Lawson of the Public Defender Service said in court that the case was based on speculation and guesswork She added He is innocent There is no link to the killings or the death of the decedent There is nothing linking him to these deathsMagistrate Judge Errol R Arthur ordered

fingerprint on a water bottle at the house and that prosecutors were seeking to compare it with Wints fingerprintsPolice also have been examining confusing and mysterious text messages sent among the

moments before the killingsThe housekeeper who died Veralicia Figueroa wanted to return to El Salvador In the affidavit police said the assistant told detectives that Savopoulos called him on the morning of May 14 and told him to go to the iron company pick up a package and deliver it to the DC houseThe assistant told police two versions of how he obtained the package  a red bag filled with 40000 that had been withdrawn by other Iron Works employees from one of the companys accounts at Bank of AmericaThe assistant said Savopoulos instructed him to take the money from the red bag and put it in a manila envelope then place it inside a red car parked in the garage at the family home The assistant then texted another person a photo of a red bag with what appeared to be two bundles of money wrapped in white bands Authorities declined to comment on the assistants text or say who received itThe arrest affidavit says matteroffactly that after the money was delivered the four decedents were killedPolice said Wint took the familys blue Porsche which was found later that day burned in a church parking lot in Prince Georges County two miles from Wints parents homeWints capture was
