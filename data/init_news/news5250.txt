SAN BERNARDINO Calif Authorities were still trying Thursday to establish a motive for the deadliest US mass shooting in nearly three years even as they revealed that the two attackers had amassed a large stockpile of explosives and ammunitionThe rampage killed 14 people wounded 21 and locked down a swath of Southern California for much of the day Wednesday as investigators scrambled to determine whether they were looking at a terrorist attack or an extremely unusual and lethal case of workplace violenceThe killers were a young husband and wife who welcomed the birth of a daughter just six months ago and showed no outward sign of Islamist radicalization psychological distress or a desire for mayhem The couple were slain in a wild police shootout on a residential street four hours after the massacreThe FBI which has authority to investigate potential terrorism announced Thursday that it had taken over the investigation Authorities were carefully picking through three crime scenes the Inland Regional Center where the mass shooting occurred the San Bernardino street where the couple died in the gun battle with police and the couples rented home in Redlands Calif where robots helped investigators root out an arsenal of pipe bombs and thousands of bulletsPolice identified the shooters as Syed Rizwan Farook 28 a county health worker born in Chicago and Tashfeen Malik 27 his Pakistani wife who was in the United States on a visaIll take a bullet before you do Scenes from the San Bernardino shootingFarook who had a college degree in environmental health and a steady job as a health inspector traveled to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan last year and returned with Malik whom he had met online They were married in the United States police saidAuthorities have said the two were not on any watch lists A senior US law enforcement official said that Farook was in contact with persons of interest with possible ties to terrorism but that these were not substantial contactsFarooks supervisor Amanda Adair who also went to college with him at California State University at San Bernardino said he got along with everybody but he kept his distance She said that she cant imagine the shooting was about work and that she had no inkling that Farook had the capacity for such violenceWithout a firmly established motive authorities said Thursday that they could not determine whether they were dealing with terrorists a disgruntled worker who had enlisted his wife in his cause or some kind of hybrid of those two scenariosWe do not yet know the motive David Bowdich assistant director in charge of the FBIs Los Angeles office said at a news conference It would be irresponsible and premature for me to call this terrorismThe case doesnt fit any familiar template If it was terrorism why would the shooters target coworkers in a small city that many Americans couldnt find on a map rather than some more spectacular target If it was workplace violence why build up an arsenal of bullets and pipe bombsIve never witnessed something so sad in my life Stories of the San Bernardino victimsIt is possible this was terroristrelated but we dont know President Obama said Thursday in somber remarks in the Oval Office It is also possible this was workplacerelatedMark Pitcavage director of the Center on Extremism for the AntiDefamation League said that based on what is known now about the case it certainly is unusual and does not fit neatly into any of the traditional models of violence that were familiar withPolice said Farook and Malik were dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles handguns and multiple ammunition magazines when at about 11 am they strode into a conference room where about 80 people were gathered for a staff training session that was transitioning into a holiday partyThey opened fire spraying 65 to 75 rounds and hitting more than a third of the people A bullet struck a sprinkler head and the sprinklers began soaking the room as the fire alarms went off The shooters fled in a rented black Ford Expedition leaving behind a bag with three pipe bombs designed to be triggered with a remotecontrol device from the SUV The device malfunctionedSan Bernardino police Lt Mike Madden the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the center described the fresh scent of gunpowder and a horrifying scene for which years of training had not fully prepared himThe situation was surreal Madden said Thursday It was unspeakable the carnage we were seeingFarook had been with his colleagues at the party earlier in the morning police said Authorities could not say conclusively whether there had been a dispute that led Farook to leave the party But police said a survivor of the shooting told them that Farook slipped away before the massacreThat tip led police to check Farooks name which led to the discovery that he had rented an SUV that matched the description of the getaway carSoon authorities were staking out the couples home in Redlands a suburb 15 minutes to the east Several hours after the shooting the SUV rolled by and then sped away and police gave chaseThe SUV stopped on San Bernardino Avenue a few miles from the massacre Cellphone videos captured the furious gun battle that followed Police said the couple fired 76 rifle rounds police fired 380Farook and Malik died at the scene Two officers were injured but the wounds were not lifethreatening The SUV so riddled with bullets that it looked as if it had been hit with a bomb was due back at the rental agency that day police saidPolice found more than 1600 rounds of ammunition on or near the couple suggesting that they were prepared for a long siege Police recovered two assault rifles and two 9mm pistols all legally purchased according to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Two of the weapons were traced to one of the assailants said Dannette Seward an ATF spokeswoman while the other two were traced to another person who has not been publicly identifiedThe striking difference between the San Bernardino suspects and other mass shootersThe FBI is chasing down any contacts these two may have had and whether those contacts are indicative of radicalization or external plotting or are purely incidental said Rep Adam B Schiff Calif the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence CommitteeSchiff who was briefed Thursday on the attack said that on the basis of what I heard and where the FBI was I wouldnt conclude that there was radicalization hereThe congressman said the shooting also did not appear to be an act of spontaneous workplace violence But he said it could have been the culmination of a longerterm grievanceThere appears to be a degree of planning that went into this San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Nobody just gets upset at a party goes home and puts together that kind of elaborate scheme or planHours before San Bernardino shooting doctors urged Congress to lift funding ban on gun violence researchAt a morning news conference authorities said they had gathered a number of items that were being analyzed to investigate the couples digital trail including thumb drives computers and cellphones But the two had left behind remarkably little in the way of a digital record  no apparent criminal record no Facebook page no Twitter accountSpeaking to the Los Angeles Times coworkers who knew Farook described him as a quiet polite man who held no obvious grudges against people in the office The office had recently held a shower for the couples baby and the two seemed to be living the American Dream Patrick Baccari a fellow inspector who shared a cubicle with Farook told the TimesIt is incredibly rare for there to be multiple mass shooters  or for them to be womenA number of families in this city were shattered by Wednesdays violence On Thursday officials released the names of the 14 people slain at the holiday party The eight men and six women ranged in age from 26 to 60 One ran the coffee shop in the building Twelve of the 14 were county employeesShaken too were Muslims in Southern California At the Islamic Society of CoronaNorco Ray Abboud said Muslims were horrified by the shooting He said he fears people will paint Muslims with one brushIt breaks our hearts to see 14 people die Abboud said We feel sorry for everything that happened but we cant blame ourselves for being MuslimHe said people in the community were keeping a close watch on their children to make sure they dont fall into any crazy stuffBefore the attack Farook and Malik dropped off their 6monthold daughter with Farooks mother saying they had a doctors appointment according to Hussam Ayloush executive director of the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations in Los Angeles The council organized a news conference late Wednesday featuring Farhan Khan who is married to Farooks sisterI have no idea why he would do something like this Khan said of his brotherinlaw I cannot express how
