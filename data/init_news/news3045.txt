Its amazing to go back and watch Bernie Sandersspresidential campaign announcement Nearly everything about Sanderss campaign would change over the following 14 months  except for the candidate himselfThere are no introductions Sanders begins by pulling a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket before turning to a small scattering of reporters gathered around a makeshift podiumTheres not a single Sanders supporter in sight  no banners noBernie Tees or Feel the Bern pins or even as much as a cardboard sign Sanders speaks for about 10 minutes and answers a few questions before turning to walk back to the US Capitol aloneWashington reporters chuckled They knew that Clinton would put on a slick show and she did  kicking off her bid on Roosevelt Island to 5400 cheering supporters waving American flags standing on a stage carved out to show her campaign logoBut over the course of the campaign Sanders would be the one routinely packing stadiumsize rallies drawing rallies of tens of thousands of people and getting introduced by liberal icons like former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and actor Danny Glover The substance of his message is almost exactly the same but now theres someone  millions of them in fact  eager to hear itOn Tuesday Sanders iswidely expected to finally endorse Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire His team can boast a number of accomplishments  a radical new way to finance the modern presidential campaign the mainstreaming of critical liberal policiesrunaway popularity with young voters  but he is now shorn of the the outpouring of energy that powered his campaign for monthsThe end of Sanderss movement however also marks the beginning of the debate over what it meant Was Bernie just a typical leftwing insurgent who scared the centrist candidate Or did he light the spark of a political revolution  and show the promise of a new kind of Democratic politicsFor Bernies closest allies lefty academics and other writers the surging interest in Sanderss campaign shows that hes more than a candidate of the left wing of the party They see the massive growth of inequality in America as fundamentally reorienting our politics and think Sanders is the candidate who most capitalized on that transformationTo them Sanderss run is not like Bill Bradleys in 2000 or Howard Deans in 2004 but the start of something else altogether In this interpretation Sanderss success is not principally the result of winning the Democrats left flank its the result of a populist rebellion that drew the masses to his causeHeres RobertReich a prominent Sanders ally and a public policy professor at the University of California BerkeleyReich goes on to argue that Sanderss rock star popularity is the result of his laserlike focus on challenging financial elites at every turnYou can disagree with this analysis but theres certainly plenty of evidence for it  including Clintons support among wealthier voters and Sanderss runaway popularity in coal country states like West VirginiaSanders denounced inequality with more ferocity than any other presidential candidate and inequality really has skyrocketed in America over the past few decades Its certainly theoretically possible he became the major beneficiary of that shiftSanderss allies see evidence for this thesis bubbling up at every corner of the campaignThe most obvious is the senators shocking success at the ballot box From starting at essentially zero in polling at the races outset Sanders rocketed to within a few points of Clintons popularity among Democrats pulled in more than 9 million votes and gave the prohibitive favorite a far greater scare than essentially anyone expectedAs the Nations Steve Fraser says in one typical column the idea of Sanderss success as a reaction to widening financial inequality also appears to to explain Donald Trumps rise on the rightSanderss alliessee the Democratic primary as a battle between the upper class and the middlelower class everywhere they look in Clintons reliance on Wall Street and sixfigure donations over Sanderss small donor army in the mass turnout at his campaign rallies and in the corporate media that has allegedly helped her over the organic social media that has driven his campaignThen theres the matter of Sanderss polling numbers against Donald Trump Voxs Matt Yglesias lays out the case to be skeptical of these numbers here but polling really has consistently shown Sanders outperforming Clinton in headtohead matchups against TrumpIn a standard leftright framework Sanders running ahead of Clintondoesnt make any sense But if you think politics has been spun on its head and should now be thought of primarily on an elitepopulist axis then maybe it doesBut while some see Sanders as a transformational figure political scientists and mainstream pundits tend to see in his candidacy a largely unsurprising leftwing insurgency that  like others before it  has benefited from the dynamics of a Democratic primaryAs Slates Jamelle Bouie argues convincingly in a piece called There is no Bernie Sanders movement Sanders really represents a faction of largely white ideological liberals  not some populist uprising against the elites  whose dissatisfaction with mainstream Democrats weve seen demonstrated in nearly every recent presidential primaryMoreover we dont know how much Sanderss velocity was the result of an unusually open Democratic field Echoing Bouie Boston College professor Dave Hopkins punctures the idea of a transformative Sanders movement by noting that any candidate who ran against the compromised Clintons would have a shot at winning over young voters in big numbersSanderss overwhelming margins among young voters might have been attenuated had he been facing a more conventional Democratic opponent or opponents who could also claim to be a fresh political face and who remained free of the baggage left by the Clintonist compromises of the 1990s and early 2000s Hopkins says If Sanders were running against some combination of Cory Booker Chris Murphy and Amy Klobuchar would voters under the age of 35 appear equally enthusiastic about the prospect of implementing socialism as the defining creed of the Democratic PartyHopkins added that theres no reason to be assured that Sanderss popularity with young voters  heoutperformed even Barack Obama with voters under 30  will guarantee a longterm shiftI know of no survey evidence that shows that the difference between younger and older Democrats on substantive issues is anywhere near as large as the generation gap in support between Clinton and Sanders he says which suggests to me that Sanderss fairly remarkable appeal among the young is based on more than just policyBut perhaps the most damning rebuttal to the idea that Sanders has ignited a new classconscious politics is that he doesnt actually appear to be doing any better among poorer voters than ClintonBack in April Voxs Dara Lind showed that Sanderss campaign had failed to mobilize the poor it was explicitly designed to attract And while some commentators have thought Sanders has performed better with the white working class political scientists have demonstrated that this is mostly an artifact of young people having less money Theres not much of any evidence for a brewing political revolution of a previously untapped underclass of voters in other wordsSome have doubted that even Sanderss young legions of supporters are genuinely committed to his policy ideas In the New York Times Vanderbilts Larry Bartels and Princetons Christopher Achengo as far as arguing that we cant even reasonably assume Sanderss young supporters are backing his candidacy because theyre more liberal than the rest of the partySanderss campaign has the energy of the moment  the mass mobilization of young people and by extension the ability to organize rallies that dwarf Clintons in sizeIts an undeniably impressive accomplishment But its far from clear if it also represents the future of American politics
