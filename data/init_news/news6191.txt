Congress appears to be on the glide path to passing legislation to avert a government shutdown later this week as conservatives eager for a funding fight have now set December as the best time to confront President Obama on spending levels and abortion policiesA stopgap spending bill that would fund the government at current levels through Dec 11 cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate Monday on a 77 to 19 vote  and the upper chamber is expected to pass the measure as soon as TuesdayIf all goes according to the plan hatched by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnnell RKy and Speaker John Boehner ROhio the House could clear the stopgap funding bill on Wednesday averting a shutdown with hours to spare before the Oct 1 deadlineThe only potential speed bump standing in the way of quick consideration of the bill in the Senate was Sen Ted Cruz but Senate leaders took procedural steps to limit the Texas Republicans optionsCruz railed against Planned Parenthood and the Iran deal on the Senate floor following the vote Monday saying he believes the votes are cooked in Congress He said a spending bill without any policy restrictionsis essentially a blank check to ObamaThats not very clean to me  it actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill Cruz saidHe and other conservatives for weeks have been calling on GOP leaders to confront Obama over abortion policies by using the spending bill needed to avert a shutdown this week to cut off funding for Planned ParenthoodBut they are now focusing their attention on DecemberThis turnabout occurred following HouseSpeaker John Boehners ROhio announcement on Friday that he will resign at the end of October rather than continue to battle with the most conservative members over how aggressively to confront Obama over issues such as spending abortion and the Affordable Care Act known as ObamacareConservatives now view December as the better time to challenge the president because there will be a new House GOP leadership team in place that theywill pressure to take a tougherapproachRepublican leaders are moving ahead with a separate strategy for confronting Obama over Planned Parenthood and Obamacare by using the fasttrack budget reconciliation process under which bills can not be filibustered in the Senate This would allow Republicans to pick a veto fight with the presidentThree House committees on Monday announced plans to begin the process of attempting to repeal parts of the presidents health care lawand defund Planned Parenthood through the reconciliation processThe House Ways and Means Energy and Commerce and Education and the Workforce Committees will markup bills this week to start the reconciliation process Once those bills pass the House the Senate is expected consider them as wellIt is not clear that the reconciliation strategy will satisfy Cruz and other conservatives and cause them to abandon their argument that a governmentspending bill is the best way to challenge the presidentThis fight certainly isnt over Weve got to remember that this is a shortterm funding a sort of patch so well likely be back here in December the Cruz ally said December will be a similar fight Its a new bite at the appleMany GOP senators and moderate Republicans in the House are wary of conservatives attempts to force a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood or other differences with Obama They worry Republicans will be blamed for a shutdown hurting the part in advance of the 2016 electionsFor instance Sen Kelly Ayotte RNH wrote to Cruz earlier this month asking him to detail his political strategy for defunding Planned ParenthoodAyotte wrote that she voted for a bill to redirect funds from Planned Parenthood to other womens health providers but that legislation didnt have enough votes pass let alone enough votes to reverse a veto from Obama She asked him to explain how he planned to overcome those hurdlesDuring the last government shutdown I repeatedly asked you what your strategy for success was when we did not have the votes to achieve the goal of defunding Obamacare but I did not receive an answer she wrote I am again asking this question and would appreciate you sharing your strategy for success with all of us before any damaging government shutdown becomes imminentSimilar tensions could arise again in December if threats of ashutdown fight resurface
