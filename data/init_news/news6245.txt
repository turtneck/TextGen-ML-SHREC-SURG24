Bill OReilly responded to a Mother Jones story accusing him of making false claims about his reporting on the Falklands War by calling its author a liarThe Fox News host told me in an interview that he has always accurately described what happened during that period and that David Corn Washington bureau chief of the leftwing magazine is a liar a smear merchant and will do anything he can to injure me and the network Everybody knows that Everything Ive reported about my journalistic career is trueCorn who is also an MSNBC contributor said last night that he had tried repeatedly through emails and voice mails to obtain comment from OReilly or FoxId never speak to him OReilly saidThe crux of the story involves OReillys role as a CBS correspondent in the 1982 shooting war between Britain and Argentina over the disputed islands Referring to the press corps OReilly told me Nobody was on the Falklands and I never said I was on the island everCorn was a Fox News contributor from 2001 to 2008 whose contract was not renewedThe adversarial tone of the story he coauthored is telegraphed in the headline Bill OReilly Has His Own Brian Williams ProblemThat clearly accuses OReilly of telling lies on par with the false tale that prompted NBC to impose a sixmonth suspension on Williams who had to apologize for claiming that he was on a helicopter hit by a rocketpropelled grenade over Iraq in 2003And yet the Mother Jones piece appears to turn on semantics not some specific story that OReilly told about being in the Falklands Among the examples citedIn a 2001 book OReilly said Ive reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the FalklandsIn a Washington panel discussion OReilly said Ive covered wars okay Ive been there The Falklands Northern Ireland the Middle East Ive almost been killed three times okayIn a 2004 column OReilly wrote Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war I know that lifeanddeath decisions are made in a flashBut that referenceOReilly saying he was in Argentinaundercuts the thrust of the story that he claimed to have covered the Falklands combatThe same phrase in Argentina also appears in some 2013 comments by OReilly cited by CornI was in a situation one time in a war zone in Argentina in the Falklands where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete And the army was chasing us I had to make a decision And I dragged him offIn the interview OReilly described the scene in Buenos Aires in the aftermath of the hostilities in the Falklands Thousands took to the streets Hundreds of troops surrounded the presidential palace I was in the middle of that A reporter was shot in the legs People were throwing rocks bricks some had gunsSo the dispute comes down to OReillys shorthand use of the Falklands and the term war zoneCorn who gained public attention when he obtained the Mitt Romney 47 percent tape during the 2012 campaign defended his focus on OReillys languageHe covered a protest Corn said It might be a minor point but the war was over If Mr OReilly wanted to make that case he certainly could have I would have gladly put it in the story Instead of responding to the substance hes out there just calling namesBut Corns own piece largely backs up OReillys account of the dangerous situation except for OReillys recollection that there were fatalitiesDispatches on the protest filed by reporters from theNew York Times theMiami Herald and UPI note that thousands did take to the street setting fires breaking store windows and that riot police did battle with protesters who threw rocks and sticks They say tear gas was deployed police clubbed people with nightsticks and fired rubber bullets reporters were assaulted by demonstrators and by police and a photojournalist was wounded in the legs by gunfireThats a far cry from a bogus claim of having been shot down in a helicopter the explicit comparison made by the headlineOReilly said the material he gathered for CBS led Dan Rathers newscast and he received internal praise for his reporting He called the Mother Jones story total bullThere is not any way anyone on earth could say I said I was on the Falkland Islands OReilly saidHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
