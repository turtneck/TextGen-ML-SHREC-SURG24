CNN Investigators think a woman who worked with Richard Matt and David Sweat at the Clinton Correctional Facility planned to pick the convicted killers up after they escaped but changed her mind at the last minute a source familiar with the investigation tells CNNJoyce Mitchell went to a hospital this weekend because of panic attacks the source saidMitchell is one of several prison employees who has been questioned in the case She has given a statement and is being somewhat cooperative a source said She has not been chargedHer cell phone was used to call several people connected to Matt another source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Its unclear who made the calls or when the calls were made Authorities are trying to determine whether Mitchell was aware her phone was being usedHer son Tobey Mitchell has come to her defenseHe told NBC that she wouldnt risk her life or other peoples lives to help these guys escape He said his mother was in a hospital with severe chest pains about the time of the escapeAuthorities scoured farms and fields around an upstate New York town Tuesday looking for the pair who escaped from a prison days earlier a local official saidThe search was prompted by someone who spotted two suspicious men walking down a road in Willsboro in the middle of a driving rainstorm overnight in an area thats all  large farms and fields and wooded lots Town Supervisor Shaun Gillilland said As the citizens car approached them they took offThey were walking down the road not dressed for the elements Gillilland said They ran into the fields from what I understand So this behavior  was suspiciousGiven the meticulous detail involved in the escape there were concerns fugitives Richard Matt and David Sweat put a similar level of planning into their getaway including transportationLocal state and federal authorities set up a search perimeter there As of 2 pm Gillilland wasnt aware that any clothes vehicles or other evidence had been found but it was still relatively early in the processThe stormy overnight spotting in Willsboro a town of 2000 people on Lake Champlain is one of the first big potential breakthroughs since prison guards found Matt and Sweats beds empty at 530 am SaturdayUntil then the closest might have been an account from two Dannemora residents about two men whom they now believe to be the escaped killers walking through their backyard shortly after midnight FridayI go look at him and I say What the hell are you doing in my yard Get the hell out of here  one of the residents told ABCs Good Morning America of that encounterThe two men complied one apologizing that hed been on the wrong street It wasnt until the next day that the resident who asked not to be named and his female friend realized who the trespassers probably wereThey are killers whom authorities fear could do so again to evade captureElizabeth Ahern who lives in Plattsburgh about five miles from the prison and 25 miles south of the Canadian border isnt taking any chances The North Country she says is a place where people usually dont bother securing their doors and have weapons to hunt not to guard themselves against criminalsIts a scary situation Ahern told CNNs New Day We are now closing our doors and locking them and making sure we have knives and guns ready to go just in caseExpert They had to have helpFinding the two fugitives is job No 1 for authorities Job No 2 is figuring out how they got out  and who if anyone helped them become the first inmates to escape Clinton Correctional in its 170year historyMatthew Horace a law enforcement veteran who spent years with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives said They had to have help  I wouldnt be surprised if when this all pans out theres more than one two three or five people that helped them on the insideMatt and Sweat cut through a cell wall that included steel a quarterinch thick maneuvered across a catwalk shimmied down six stories to a tunnel of pipes followed that tunnel broke through a doublebrick wall cut into a 24inch steam pipe shimmied their way through the steam pipe cut another hole so they could get out of the pipe and finally surfaced through a manholeIf other people are proved to have played a role in Matt and Sweats escape or their life on the lam theyll pay a price An accomplice could be convicted of a misdemeanor for helping introduce nondangerous contraband into a prison Or they could get up to seven years in jail for the class D felony of hindering prosecution by providing criminal assistance to someone sentenced to 20 years to life for a violent crimeSlain deputys brother I just hope he doesnt come backMatt and Sweat are convicted killers whose behavior is prison appears to have been goodMatt was convicted on three counts of murder three counts of kidnapping and two counts of robbery after he kidnapped a man and beat him to death in December 1997 state police said He was

While at Clinton Correctional they were in the prisons honor block for those who have gone years without significant disciplinary action according to a state official briefed on the investigationBeing in an honor block carries privileges such as having hot plates and refrigerators in their cells and congregating for hours in a central gallery area each evening with fellow inmates said Rich Plumadore who worked at Clinton Correctional for 35 years About 250 to 300 inmates are in this unit at the prison
