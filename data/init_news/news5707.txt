CNN The aggressive Jeb Bush that his allies have been waiting for emerged this week  and it was an attack on his family that got him goingThe former Florida governor launched his most forceful attempt yet to paint Donald Trump as an unserious candidate unfit for the foreign policy decisions that face the countrys commander in chiefFirst he punched back hard at Trumps suggestion that his brother George W Bush bore responsibility for the September 11 2001 attacks and that Trump could have prevented themIn a series of interviews Bush then questioned Trumps intellectual heft and understanding of complex world eventsTuesday he leveled his most blistering critique to date with a National Review oped accusing the real estate magnate of echoing the attacks of liberal filmmaker Michael Moore and the fringe left on national security issuesLets be clear Donald Trump simply doesnt know what hes talking about Bush wrote adding that Trumps bluster overcompensates for a shocking lack of knowledge on the complex nationalsecurity challenges that will confront the next presidentThis is a critical moment for Bush who like other establishment Republicans has been unable to break through against Trump As much as Bush and his allies like to talk about having resources for the long game early next year the next few weeks are key for whether his foreign policy message and electability arguments will click into place and capture the interest of votersPolls have shown very little excitement about his candidacy in any sector of the Republican base That fact is not only evident in polls but also in interviews with voters on the ground in early states who often describe Bush as lacking dynamism enthusiasm and energyDespite heavy advertising in New Hampshire and an impressive list of endorsements in the early states a CNNORC Poll released this week showed Bush tied in an unimpressive third place with Florida rival Marco Rubio at 8And even after raising 134 million last quarter many heavyhitting Republican donors  particularly those who supported Mitt Romney  are still on the sidelines attracted to the candidacy of Marco Rubio and eying other contenders like John Kasich and even Chris ChristieAs part of the campaign to assuage concerns of donors and allies who have watched in surprise as he struggles Bushs longtime strategist Mike Murphy  who runs the Right to Rise super PAC  also emerged in a rare interview to blast Trump as a false zombie frontrunner and outline his theory of the race on why Bush will outlast the other GOP candidatesHes dead politically hell never be president of the United States ever Murphy said of Trump in an interview with Bloomberg Politics Murphy who is legally prohibited from coordinating with the Bush campaign jabbed Trump by predicting that his bid would collapse and adding I dont think you can be a frontrunner if youre totally unelectableNoting that hes worked with Bush for 18 years Murphy argued that Bush builds slowly and gets better and better pointing to his improved debate performances as an example of thatSome of Bushs most stalwart supporters have long felt that a pivot to foreign policy could help his standing in the fieldHis exchange with Trump after the real estate magnate called his brothers administration a disaster during the CNN debate was one of his strongest performances of the night and this weeks 911 debate seemed to help him sharpen his critiques of TrumpBush allies still believe Rubio is vulnerable on the question of experience because of his short stint in the US Senate and the ease with which his rivals could compare him to Barack Obama who won the presidency just four years into his first term on Capitol HillAnd while his bungled response to questions about his brothers decision to invade Iraq created problems for Bush earlier this summer the renewed debate over 911 this week offered Bush an opening to critique Bill Clintons handling of Osama bin Laden in the 1990sThe Clinton administration made a mistake of thinking bin Laden had to be viewed from a law enforcement perspective Bush said in an interview with FOXs Sean Hannity Similarly President Obamas polices seemed to be focused on that as wellMurphy appeared to use Bushs air war this week to emphasize the candidates staying powerHe can outlast the noise his candidate performance will be excellent and were an amplifier Murphy said in the Bloomberg Politics interview alluding to the 100 million war chest raised by the independent group earlier this summer Laying out the super PACs strategy for navigating the primary he argued that the group can keep Bush on the air and get his message out through the gantlet of primariesWe see February 1 to March 15 45 days as our period to seize the nomination and get in front Murphy said outlining his theory of the race We have the resources to pursue that campaign Most of these other guys are all running on spec Were at a point now where were significantly funded for those 45 days cash in the bank today Nobody else is in that situation in this race Nobodys closeStill outsider candidates Trump and Ben Carson led the pack in the CNN poll with 27 and 22 respectively and their supporters expressed a far higher level of enthusiasm about their candidaciesNearly a third of Trump supporters and a quarter of Carson backers said they were very enthusiastic about the two mens bids When Bushs supporters were asked that same question only 3 said they were very enthusiastic about his candidacyBush has not fared much better in early state polls despite having a sizable organization on the ground a dozen staffers in Iowa 13 in New Hampshire seven in South Carolina and more than a halfdozen in NevadaIn what could be a sign of things to come for the campaign one surrogate who recently has come to his aid on the fundraising front is his brother Behind closed doors during a recent fundraiser George W Bush expressed confidence in his brothers slow and steady approach to the race and distaste for another rival Ted Cruz who worked on George W Bushs campaignThe former president will also headline a fundraiser for his brothers presidential campaign while hes in town for a BushCheney alumni event according to an invitation obtained by CNNWhile the elder Bushs presidency has created a headache for Jeb Bush by forcing him to constantly explain to voters how his leadership style would differ from his brothers allies noted the irony this week of the fact that Jeb Bush seems animated and passionate when defending his brotherI think as a general matter that Jeb Bush does not want to be engaged in combat with Donald Trump because youre distracting from your own message and your own ability to get better known if youre just known for fighting with somebody said Charlie Black a Republican veteran strategist who advised President George HW Bush but is neutral in the 2016 raceIn this case because Jebs brother was attacked theres no doubt that hes going to come out strong and be aggressive said Black But going forward Bush will need to move his message beyond Trump to show he can sustain his own spotlight When Trump hits Jeb Jeb should not respond surrogates should respond and let Donald fight with the surrogates
