When it comes to energy policy the 2016 presidential election really isnt all that complicatedHillary Clintonplans to continue President Obamas strategy of pushing down carbon dioxide emissions via regulations That means using less coal and oil and more wind and solar Donald Trump by contrast doesnt much care about global warming and plans to greatly expand US oil drilling and coal mining  largely by repealing various environmental rulesOn May 26 Trump fleshed out his vision in a speech at an oil industry conference in Bismarck North Dakota There were no real surprises Trumps energy policy sounds nearly identical to Mitt Romneys energy policy in 2012 only with more exclamation points At one point Trump actually used the phrase very very pure sweet beautiful oil Hes happily adopted the standard GOP playbook fewer regulations more domestic fossil fuel production approve the Keystone XL pipeline and cancel the Paris climate deal The crowd loved itHere were six big takeawaysBefore the speech many reporters were wondering if Trump might finally clarify his views on global warming This is a guy after all who once tweetedThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive Surely hed like to elaborateInstead Trump mostly  ignored the issue He talked about guns in his energy speech He talked about rising crime in cities He even reiterated his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico  evidently a hit at North Dakota oil gatherings But he barely discussed climate changeHe did promise that upon taking office hed rescind all jobdestroying Obama executive actions  including the Climate Action Plan Here hes referring to a series of regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency has enacted over the past eight years to cut US carbon dioxide emissions Trump would presumably try to scrap ObamasClean Power Plan which aims to reduce CO2 from power plantsIve written about how Trump might go about dismantling Obamas climate policieshere Suffice to say this would be easier to do if a GOPcontrolled Congress could pass a law taking away the EPAs authority over carbon dioxide Itd be harder but not impossible for Trump to do via executive action aloneTrump also pledged to cancel the Paris climate agreement  the deal reached last December in which every country on Earth pledged to restrain emissions and address global warming While Trump couldnt just scuttle a global deal by himself he could certainly undermine it by abandoning Americas efforts to cut emissionsTrump also seemed perplexed about how the Paris agreement even works claiming it gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use This isnt true at all Under the deal every country submitsits own voluntary plan for curbing emissionsThe United States is currently the largest producer of petroleum and natural gas in the world thanks in part to the massive fracking boom thats been taking place around the country since the 2000sBut to hear Trump tell it were barely producing anything at all He wants more  much more On his first day in office American energy dominance will be declared a strategic economic and foreign policy goal of the United States he said Its about timeTrump dropped a few hints about how hed try to expand oil and gas drilling He criticized the Obama administration for keeping certain federal lands and waters off limits from drilling  including parts of Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf Romney proposed opening up these areas in 2012 you could likelyget more production by doing so though the impacts are often exaggerated Trump also attacked Clintons proposals to regulate fracking like Obama shehas backed rules to restrict methane leaks from natural gas operationsAt times Trump didnt seem to appreciate that energy production is frequently outside the presidents control For instance he blamed Obama for the fact that the number of active drilling rigs in the United States has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade The rig counthas indeed plummeted But thats primarily due to the fact that the recent US oil boom has created a glut of oil worldwide causing crude prices to crash and giving companies less incentive to drillUnder my administration Trump promised well accomplish complete American energy independence Complete Imagine a world in which our foes and the oil cartels can no longer use energy as a weapon It will happen Were going to winPresidents have been promising energy independence since forever and a day but it doesnt really make much sense The US currently produces enough crude oil to supply about 74 percent of its needs In theory with vastly expanded production we could bump that up to 100 percent But we still wouldnt be shielded from foreign oil cartelsOil is traded on the world market and if tensions in the Middle East cause prices to spike everyone is affected regardless of where they get their crude The easiest way to observe this is to look at Canada Canada is a net oil exporter a bona fide oilindependent nation But gasoline prices in Canada still rise and fall in accordance with world events just as they do in the United States or Japan or EuropeThere are perfectly sound reasons to boost domestic energy production  as Trump says it can create jobs and economic activity But energy independence is a misguided notionCoal production in the US has fallen off a cliff in recent years Back in 2008 the country produced a record 12 billion short tons of coal By 2015 that had fallen 25 percent Coal mining employment has also plummeted as a result  a real blow to various communities in places like West Virginia and eastern KentuckyThere are a couple of reasons for coals recent fall The fracking boom has led to a flood of cheap natural gas propelling many utilities to switch from coal to gas But Obamas EPA has also enacted a number of strict air pollution regulations  on mercury and sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide from coalburning plants  that have accelerated this shift to gas Falling Chinese steel productionhas also weakened demand for metallurgic coalDonald Trump wants to bring back coal mining by repealing those EPA regulations Were going to save the coal industry Trump promisedBut utilities wouldnt necessarily rush back to coal once that happened because natural gas would still have a cost advantage And remember Trump wants to expand natural gas production Its extremely unlikely that the coal industry would rebound to its former levelsIndeed even coal industry execs who support Trump are skeptical that he can bring back all those lost jobs I dont think it will be a thriving industry ever again coal mining CEO Robert Murrayrecently told Taylor Kuykendall of SNL It will be an extremely competitive industry and it will be half size  The coal mines cannot come back to where they were or anywhere near itIn his speech Trump said that his energy strategy does include nuclear wind and solar But he added he wouldnt support them to the exclusion of other forms of energy  referring to fossil fuels  that right now are working much betterIn his press conference with reporters before the speech Trump elaborated I know a lot about solar he said The problem with solar is its very expensive He made no mention of the fact that solar prices have been dropping precipitouslyHe also criticized wind turbines for killing birds in California Wind is killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles one of the most beautiful one of the most treasured birds he said So wind is a problem While this is technically true wind turbines kill orders of magnitude fewer birds than power lines or windows or cats And many wind developersare currently experimenting with ways to reduce bird deathsA Trump administration will focus on real environmental challenges not the phony ones Trump said Well solve for environmental problems like the need for clean and safe drinking water Later he elaborated My priorities are simple clean air and clean waterBut he gave no indication of how hed actually do that In the past the EPA has been a major driver of cleaning up Americas air pollution As the chart below shows the six most common air pollutants in the US have all fallen 72 percent since 1970  due in large part to rules imposed under the Clean Air ActTrump made clear hes not a fan of the EPA So hed push for clean air and water  how He didnt sayRead more How the next president could expand Obamas climate policies  or dismantle them
