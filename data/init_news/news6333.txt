together top officials from Ethiopia Uganda Kenya Sudan and the AU to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks failAfrican nations led by Ethiopia have been trying to broker a peace in South Sudan through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD a regional body and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties The two sides

leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan The group included Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta African Union Chairperson Dlamini Zuma and Sudans minister of foreign affairs Ibrahim GhandourThis gives me and the US delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress Obama said Our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately needThe question of South Sudan  a nation that the United States helped bring into existence in 2011 after years of effort by both the George W Bush and Obama administrations  has vexed American policymakers for yearsIn December 2013 South Sudan President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar who had served as his vice president of attempting a coup detat The two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups  Kiir is Dinka Machar is a Nuer  who had come together to form a government when the country was first createdWhile tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict the war has been largely focused on control of the nations oil fields South Sudans primary source of revenuePrinceton Lyman US special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013 noted that when he first took over as envoy the United States had spent 10 billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations and that was four years ago This is a big investment he addedAt this point more than 25 million people are facing food shortages while roughly 15 million are displaced from their homes An additional 520000 South Sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries including EthiopiaThe conflict also poses a major economic problem for Kenya which had major investments in South Sudan before the fighting broke out The LAPSSET Corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from South Sudan to the Kenyan port of Lamu and according to EJ Hogendoorn deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an engine of development for many parts of East Africa Unfortunately of course thats on hold because of the war he saidWhile Obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in Africa he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with Ethiopia whose alliance with the United States dates back more than a century But the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalistsObama is the first sitting US president to visit EthiopiaIn a news conference Monday afternoon

considered Ethiopia a democracy replied with irony One hundred percentBut during the news conference Obama twice referred to the Ethiopian government as democratically electedI dont bite my tongue Obama said of raising concerns on these issues with Ethiopia But I do so from a position of respectHailemariam for his part said Our commitment to democracy is real not skin deepBut he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago Something has to be understood This is a fledgling democracyThe two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism an area in which Ethiopia has been an active leader The White House announced Monday it will work with Congress to provide approximately 465 million this year in new training equipment and capacitybuilding aid to its African alliesThe administration also said it would provide at least 40 million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in East Africa The money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces law enforcement government officials community leaders and members of civil society officials saidObama

indicates while they may oppose the government they have not tipped into terrorism he saidThe United States provides more than 600 million inassistance to Ethiopia annually The vast bulk of that  490 million  comes from the US Agency for International Development while the rest is largely securityrelated Last fiscal year nearly 200 million went to health programs while 163 million went to
