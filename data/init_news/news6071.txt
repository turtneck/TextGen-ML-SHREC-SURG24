Running mates Its not even May and already were talking running mates Then let me toss Elizabeth Warrens name into the mixIm making several assumptions here  in a year when assuming anything is dangerous First I believe Ted Cruzs desperate gamble of adding Carly Fiorina to his ticket will fail He was right to throw some kind of Hail Mary but I dont see how Fiorina attracts enough new support for Cruz to win the Indiana primary on Tuesday And if he loses there hes pretty much toastDonald Trumps landslide wins this week in the Northeast gave him a bigger haul of convention delegates than even his most optimistic boosters had expected If momentum still counts for anything in politics Trump has it And if he wins Indiana  polls show him with about a sixpoint lead  his path to the Republican nomination looks wide enough to taxi the rest of the way in his Boeing757Im also assuming that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee The delegate math is just brutal There is simply no viable way now for Bernie Sanders to catch up Sanders appeared to acknowledge reality this week when he announced that his campaign would lay off hundreds of paid staff members He will use his clout at the convention he said to put together the strongest progressive agenda that any political party has ever seenWhich is where Warren comes inIt is absurd to claim that Clinton does not merit the progressive label she has the scars from decades of attacks by the vast rightwing conspiracy to prove her bona fides But on most issues  gun control being a glaring exception  Sanders is well to her left And as his surprising campaign has shown thats where the energy and excitement in the Democratic Party happen to be this yearIf there is a specific issue on which Clinton is weak with the Democratic left it is not the FBI investigation of her emails It is her perceived coziness with Wall Street highlighted by the sixfigure speaking fees she was paid by investment bank Goldman SachsSanderss central theme is that the rich and powerful have distorted our political and economic systems to favor their own selfish interests He blasts Clinton not only for the Goldman speeches but also for mining Wall Street for campaign cash My assumption is that Sanders should he fall short of the nomination will give Clinton his fullthroated support But will his most ardent supporters followAs Clintons running mate Warren could erase this potential weakness with the Democratic base She has spent her Senate career becoming known as the scourge of Wall Street No political figure is more closely identified with efforts to curb the excesses of the financial systemWarren would also help address another potential vulnerability If the generalelection matchup is Trump vs Clinton  and that seems increasingly likely  it is becoming clear that on the question of US military involvement around the world Trump will position himself to the left of ClintonThe foreign policy speech that Trump delivered Wednesday was for the most part vague and anodyne His overarching theme is America first he said To the extent the phrase means anything it seems to promise that a President Trump would be extremely reluctant to deploy US combat forces in any sort of worlds policeman role Trump has even questioned the viability of NATO in its present formClinton is a foreign policy traditionalist As secretary of state she was more hawkish than President Obama  she pushed for more vigorous intervention in Syria for example She has long since apologized for her vote to authorize the Iraq War but Sanders continues to attack her for it Trump would surely do the sameWarren wasnt in Congress when the Iraq War began and national security isnt the issue with which she is identified But her views fit squarely with those of the partys progressive wingWarren also has a compelling personal story of having risen from modest beginnings to become a Harvard professor and then a US senator The fact that she and Clinton would be the first allfemale major party ticket should be irrelevant but isnt To many voters it would be thrillingI can think of several other potential running mates for Clinton Funny but I draw a blank when trying to come up with a suitable partner for Trump Maybe hell just go it aloneRead more from Eugene Robinsons archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook You can also join him Tuesdays at 1 pm for a live QA
