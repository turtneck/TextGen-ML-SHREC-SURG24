By Claire Bernish at theantimediaorgThanks to Wikileaks we now have the smoking gun email irrefutably proving not only did President Barack Obama know about Hillary Clintons nongovernmentissued email account he used it in correspondence with herEven more damning to the presidents credibility it appears the lie was a purposeful attempt to protect Clintons upcoming bid for the presidencyShortly after the New York Times broke the story on March 2 2015 of Clintons use of a personal server to supplant the government system  and as has been revealed to thwart transparency  Obama announced publicly his lack of prior knowledgeThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports the president told CBS News White House correspondent Bill Plante as Zero Hedge reported  The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency which is why my emails the BlackBerry I carry around all those records are available and archivedIm glad that Hillarys instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosedIt wouldnt be a stretch to imagine however Obamas placid public appearance guarded secret internal panic  a panic echoed behind the scenes at the burgeoning Clinton campaignAn email penned by Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin to Director of Communications Jennifer Palmieri and a few others calling immediate attention to a tweet by journalist Katherine Miller paints an entirely different pictureMiller tweeted a snippet of the aforementioned interview in which Plante asked Obama Mr President When did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US Government for official business while she was Secretary of StateThe same time everybody else learned it he responded through news reportsI have some questions here pictwittercomufkeoZCx2m
