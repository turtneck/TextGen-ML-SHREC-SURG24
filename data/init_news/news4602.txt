Michael DAntonio is the author of the new book  The Truth About Trump The opinions expressed in this commentary are hisCNN Like a football team that must shake off defeat in order to prepare for the next game Donald Trump has a short time to get over his drubbing in the first presidential debate and get ready for the next He has instead been whining like a kitchen blender about the moderator the microphone and his opponent while continuing to draw attention to the worst parts of his performanceAdvisors who want Trump to win the next debate on October 9 must get him to change But to do this they must overcome the candidates 40plus years of doing things his way To appreciate the daunting nature of this task consider just 10 things Trump could do to prepare for the next debate and why its likely he wont be able to do any of them1 Accept your defeat in the first debateTrump likes to say Im a winner and is not accustomed to losing which may explain the poor sportsmanship he has shown since Hillary Clinton defeated him  Ignoring real poll results that show he was swamped Trump has ordered aides to stop saying he lost Of course this kind of denial means that no one can ask the emperor to put on some clothes He wont look down to see his own nakednessWhen he was asked in the first debate what he would say to AfricanAmericans about his scandalous role in the birther controversy that questioned President Obamas citizenship Trump replied  I say nothing You will search in vain for an example of Trump ever taking responsibility for the damage he has done to any individual community or nation though examples abound He is not going to learn how to do it nowManners may not count when you fire people on reality TV but they matter in a twoway presidential debate Trump looked like a 6yearold as he interrupted with witticisms such as Wrong as Clinton spoke during the first debate But as Trump told me he believes he is the same person he was in first grade His advisers are not going to get him to mature into an adult now4 Act like you want the jobOne of the oddest moments in the first debate saw Trump say that if he loses the election hell still get to Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington because he has a new hotel there Someone who wants to occupy the White House shouldnt suggest hed be satisfied with a hotel down the street But Trump is first and always a salesman  not a statesman  and he will never pass up an opportunity to get free advertising for his businessDuring the first debate Trumps cringeworthy moments included bragging about not paying any federal taxes and about betting on a housing crisis As he crowed about his wealth he added that he was speaking not in a braggadocious way But of course he was bragging Boasting and bragging are offputting to debate watchers but they are essential elements of Trumps personality and he will not stopOn the day after the first debate body language experts noted Trumps negative body language and timid facial expression These signals were enough for one reporter to call Trump the loser after viewing the contest with the sound turned off Advisers may want Trump to control his exaggerated nonverbals but this is not something this rubberfaced man can doAlways ready to use a little gamesmanship Trump allowed his campaign staff to broadcast the fact that he was taking a confidently casual approach to the first debate He said himself I believe you can prep too much for these things The result was obvious as Trump seemed illequipped with either arguments or rhetorical parries to use against his opponent Could he do differently Trump told me that he doesnt like to read and prefers to depend on instinct which makes its hard to imagine he will suddenly become open to training Another person might turn a debate defeat as a moment to learn This is not Trumps wayIn the first debate Trump referenced Gen Douglas MacArthur who died in 1964 to make a point about Americas pursuit of the ISIS terror organization Those who got As in history know of MacArthur but the reference surely bypassed millions who watched the debate Trump must have heard a lot about the general when he attended a military school in the 1960s but he needs to update himself Given the evidence that he doesnt understand the workings of our most vital technology the internet modernizing his knowledge base would be a big challengeDespite the evidence showing that recent cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and others emanated from Russia Trump told the first debate audience Shes Clinton saying Russia Russia Russia but I dont This stand is consistent with Trumps earlier sloughing off of Russias invasion of the Ukraine and his expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin Because everything is personal for him Trump likes Putin in part because Putin has said he likes him Dont expect him to change his mind about the Russians on the basis of geopolitics They are going to have to insult him personally before he does thatIn the first debate Clinton pointed out his penchant for insulting people and Trump talked about somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds After the debate Trump decided to make veiled threats about using President Bill Clintons sex scandal against her Nastiness doesnt play well in a general election when a candidate must appeal to those beyond his or her base However being nasty has always been a key element of Trumps repertoire as shown by his feuds with Cher Bette Midler Rosie ODonnell and others Trump once told me that he doesnt respect most people because they dont deserve it He is not likely to become respectful overnightAmong Trumps advisers there is one former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani who shares much in common with him Like Trump he poses as a tough man and wants the world to believe that his meanness is a virtue He is also like his candidate a thricemarried man who feels entitled to criticize Hillary Clintons lifelong marriageConsider Giulianis persona and you see someone who understands Trump on a gut level
