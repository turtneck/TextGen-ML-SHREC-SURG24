An already ugly presidential campaign has descended to a new level  one where the question is no longer whether Donald Trump can be stopped on his march to the Republican presidential nomination but whether it is possible to contain what he has unleashed across the countryViolence at Trumps rallies has escalated sharply and the realityshow quality of his campaign has taken a more ominous turn in the past few days On Saturday a man charged the stage in Dayton Ohio and a swarm of Secret Service agents surrounded the GOP frontrunnerLater Saturday at a Trump rally in Kansas City the candidate was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who were then removed from the venue Outside the rally police said they used pepper spray to control crowds Kansas City police said that two protesters were arrestedThe racially tinged anger that has both fueled Trumps political rise and stoked the opposition to it has turned into a force unto itself It has also brought a reckoning from his three remaining rivals for the Republican nomination who are shedding their fear of provoking Trump and of alienating the raging slice of their partys base that has claimed him as its leaderBut Trump should not be viewed in isolation or as the product of a single election President Obama said Saturday at a fundraiser in DallasObama said those who feed suspicion about immigrants and Muslims and poor people and people who arent like us and say that the reason that America is in decline is because of those people That didnt just happen last week That narrative has been promoted now for yearsThis years presidential campaign however seems to have fallen into a bottomless spiralA low point came Friday night Where Trump has delighted in mocking hecklers  and condoning attacks on them by his supporters  he was forced to cancel a rally at the last minute after protesters turned up by the thousands That set off a chaotic scene in the arena at the University of Illinois at Chicago that left a handful injured and thousands agitatedCampaign 2016 is on a dangerous descentTrumps continued domination of the GOP race suggests that there are no guardrails left in politics Party elders and his opponents assumed that at some point he would selfdestruct But he has defied just about every norm and it has redounded to his benefitHis candidacy and the sentiment it provokes have also stirred disturbing historical comparisonsGOP political consultant Stuart Stevens who was a top strategist for 2012 nominee Mitt Romney said Trumps rhetoric is almost verbatim what segregationist George Wallace was saying in his thirdparty 1968 presidential campaignI dont know whats in Trumps heart but I dont care What hes saying is really hateful Stevens said What did the Democratic Party do with Wallace They rejected himSome on the right accused the antiTrump forces who shut down the rally in Chicago of being the true culprits who denied the GOP frontrunner an opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to free speechIts sad number one that you have protesters that resort to violence that resort to threats of violence that resort to yelling and screaming and disruption to silence speech that they dont like said Sen Ted Cruz of Texas who is running a distant second to Trump in the GOP primariesBut Trumps Republican opponents  all of whom have pledged to support Trump if he gets the nomination  said that the New York billionaire cannot be held blamelessI think it is also true that any campaign responsibility begins and ends at the top Cruz saidLook at the rhetoric of the frontrunner in the presidential campaign Sen Marco Rubio of Florida said Saturday This is a man who at rallies has told his supporters to basically beat up the people who are in the crowd and hell pay their legal fees Someone whos basically encouraged the people in the audience to rough up anyone who stands up and says something he doesnt likeI still at this moment continue to intend to support the Republican nominee but its getting harder every dayOhio Gov John Kasich condemned Trump for creating a toxic environment that has led supporters and protesters to come together in violence but he too stopped short of saying he would not support his Republican rival if Trump secures the partys presidential nominationTheir increasingly pointed criticism of Trump comes at a crucial moment in the GOP race with primaries being held Tuesday in five states that could either propel Trump to the nomination or give life to the effort to stop himMost closely watched will be Florida and Ohio which are considered mustwins for homestate candidates Rubio and Kasich And for the first time in this electoral season delegates will be awarded on a winnertakeall basis which means that victories by Trump would accelerate his efforts to secure the nominationTrump has won GOP contests in 15 states accumulating an estimated 458 Republican delegates of the 1237 he needsOn Thursday the candidates held their final debate before the next round of primaries and they managed to remain civil to one another and focused on their substantive differencesDuring the debate Trump was asked about an incident in which a supporter at a rally in Fayetteville NC punched a protesterThere is some anger Theres also great love for the country Its a beautiful thing in many respects But I certainly do not condone that at all Trump saidNow the outbreak of violence in Chicago had again drawn focus to Trumps temperament and character as well as whether he has played a role in inciting his supportersAfter months of playing protesters to his advantage Donald Trump is overpowered in ChicagoFor months Trump has been able to control  and even employ as foils  the hundreds of protesters who show up to his rallies to oppose what they consider divisive and racistTrump often says that he loves having protesters at his rallies that they make his rallies fun Plus the interruptions are an opportunity to show him bossing around and mocking liberals often bellowing Get em outIn the past two weeks however these interruptions have increasingly eaten into Trumps speaking time and become more violent The Trump supporter who punched the protester in North Carolina was charged with assaultAsked about the criticism from other Republican candidates following the Chicago cancellation Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski mocked them Do they have protesters at their events Do they have any people at their eventsLewandowski  who has been accused of and denies manhandling a female reporter at a Trump event  also said his candidate does not plan to do anything to calm his supportersThe American people are angry Lewandowski said Theyre upset at the way this country has been run Theyre upset that this country is being taken advantage of by every other country in the world And theyre tired of not being proud to be AmericansAs for Trump he insisted that his supporters had been blameless in Chicago He accused backers of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders a Vermont senator and democratic socialist of inciting the violenceMy people are nice Trump said at his rally in Dayton Thousands and thousands of people they caused no problem They were taunted they were harassed by these other people These other people by the way some represent Bernie our communist  He should really get up and say to his people Stop Stop Sanders retorted in a statement issued by his campaign As is the case virtually every day Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar Obviously while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trumps rally in Chicago our campaign did not organize the protestsWhat caused the protests at Trumps rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against Latinos Muslims women and people with disabilities and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of President Obama Sanders added referring to Trumps false assertions that Obama was born in Africa and was therefore disqualified to be presidentDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton also jumped into the frayThe ugly divisive rhetoric we are hearing from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong and its dangerous she said at an appearance in St Louis If you play with matches youre going to start a fire you cant controlThe decision to cancel the rally on Friday was made by the Trump campaign not the agencies charged with keeping him safeTrump requested Secret Service protection in October and was granted a detail of agents in early NovemberGovernment officials have said their role is only to protect Trump and that any decisions to throw out the hecklers and protesters at Trump rallies are made by the campaign or groups hosting the events Secret Service agents intervene only officials have said if someone verbally or physically threatens the candidateAfter the man tried to breach the barricades around Trump on Saturday he was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic by the Dayton police according to an official familiar with the matter Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer identified the man as Thomas Dimassimo of Fairborn Ohio the Associated Press reportedI was ready for him but its much easier if the cops do it dont we agree Trump said after the man was hauled away And to think I had such an easy life What do I need this for rightTumulty reported from Washington Johnson reported from Chicago and DelReal from Dayton Also contributing to this story were Ed OKeefe in Largo Fla Abby Phillip in St
