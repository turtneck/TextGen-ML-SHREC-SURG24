  Without a shred of evidence and against the expressed wishes of his superiors at the Department of Justice the head of the nations most prestigious law enforcement agency announced the reopening of an investigation into the mishandling of classified material by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton The surprise announcement was delivered last Friday by FBI Director James Comey who knew that the action would create a cloud of suspicion around Clinton that could directly effect the outcome of the election Recent surveys suggest that that indeed has been the case and that Hillary is now neck in neck with GOP contender Donald Trump going into the homestretch of the bitterly contested campaign By inserting himself into the democratic process Comey has ignored traditional protocols for postponing such announcements 60days prior to an election shrugged off the counsel of his bosses at the DOJ and tilted the election in Trumps favor His action is as close to a coup dtat as anything weve seen in the US since the Supreme Court stopped the counting of ballots in Florida in 2000 handing the election to George W Bush It is not the job of the FBI to inform Congress about ongoing investigations Comeys job is to gather information and evidence that is pertinent to the case and present it to the DOJ where the decision to convene a grand jury is ultimately made Comey is a renegade a lone wolf who arbitrarily decided to abandon normal bureaucratic procedures in order to torpedo Clintons prospects for election The widespread belief that Comey is a good man who made a bad decision is nonsense He is an extremely intelligent and competent attorney with a keen grasp of Beltway politics He knew what he was doing and he did it anyway Its absurd to make excuses for him In a carefullycrafted statement designed to deflect attention from his flagrant election tampering Comey said this to his fellow agents We dont ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed Comey said I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record  CNN  Lets take a minute and parse this statement First We dont ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations True because it is not the FBIs job to do so The FBIs job is to dig up evidence and refer it to the Justice Department Comey is not the Attorney General although he has arbitrarily assumed her duties and authority Second I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record Supplement the record Thats a pretty suggestive statement dont you think When someone says theyre going to supplement the record you naturally assume that theyre going to add important details to what the public already knows Obviously those details are not going to be flattering to Hillary or thered be no reason to reopen the case So the public is left with the impression Comey is going to produce damning information that could lead to an indictment of Hillary sometime in the future This is precisely why normal protocols require that no new investigations be announced 60 days before an election Why Because the public invariably assumes that investigation equals guilt In other words The FBI wouldnt be investigating Hillary unless they had some dirt on her Therefore Id better not waste my vote on Hillary This is the logic upon which Comeys dirty trick rests He knows the effect his announcement will have because he is law enforcements version of Karl Rove a bone fide partisan whos mastered the dark art of political sabotage And just in case Comeys announcement didnt produce the desired effect by destroying Hillarys chances for victory a former assistant director at the FBI Tom Fuentes appeared on CNN shortly after the announcement was made with more explicit information Heres a clip from the interview The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation Fuentes said Saturday citing current and former senior FBI officials as sources According to the CNN report officials with the FBI and Justice Department met in Washington earlier this year to discuss opening an investigation into possible conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton State Department  Former FBI Official FBI Has An Intensive Investigation Ongoing Into Clinton Foundation  Daily Caller Okay So were no longer dealing with just classified emails The FBI expanded its investigation and is now wading through the real sewage the paytoplay corruption scandal that surrounds that vast reservoir of illicit contributions known as the Clinton Foundation In other words the FBI is on to something big really BIG I can almost see them dragging poor Hillary off to the hoosegow in leg irons and shackles Isnt that the impression the above quote is supposed to produce Heres more from Fuentes ORDER IT NOW Several FBI field offices and US attorneys offices pushed for the investigation after receiving a tip from a bank about suspicious donations to the Clinton Foundation from a foreign donor according to the report Daily Caller Foreign donors suspicious donations smoky rooms bundles of money It all fits doesnt it Its all designed to increase suspicion and make Hillary look like a crook which coincidentally is the relentless mantra of the Trump campaign Funny how the FBI and Trump appear to be reading from the same script isnt it Its almost like it was planned that way But what about the timing of all this Is it really a coincidence or are Comey and Fuentes part of a onetwo punch from the Trump campaign And more important what does the FBI actually have on Hillary According to Fuentes When the team looking at the Weiner computers went to the team of investigators who worked on the Clinton email case and showed the emails to them earlier in the week they said This is really significant We need to take this to the Director  205 to 223 video  Repeat This is significant Whats significant Neither Comey nor Fuentes nor the more than yearlong investigation has uncovered anything unless you think the ridiculous rehash of the 15year old Marc Rich investigation which popped up on the FBI website this week is new news that should alter the course of the election This is pathetic If they have something show us Otherwise Ferme ta bouche Check this out from Thursdays Wall Street Journal As 2015 came to a close the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first  The publicintegrity prosecutors werent impressed with the FBI presentation people familiar with the discussion said The message was Were done here  a person familiar with the matter said Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions Following the February meeting officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly In subsequent conversations with the Justice Department Mr Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case wont let it go these people said  Wall Street Journal  Can you see whats going on here Theres a nest of rogue agents running wild at the FBI whove been giving the DOJ the finger while they conduct their witch hunt on Hillary And what have they achieved Nothing So far they have nothing Now Im not a fan of Madame Clinton either in fact I wouldnt vote for her if they rubbed me down with bacon grease and stuck me in a bear cage but cmon now do we really want rogue cops and self righteous bureaucrats inserting themselves into our elections and picking the winners Thats bullshit If the FBI has some solid proof of wrongdoing that will put Hillary behind bars for good than I say Bravo But until then they should keep their damn hands off our elections MIKE WHITNEY lives
