Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed fiercely Sunday over jobs trade and Wall Street while agreeing that much more must be done to address a twoyearold watercontamination crisis that has paralyzed this majorityblack cityThe session included the sharpest exchange yet between the Democratic presidential candidates over their economic plans and records It included a heated argument over the auto industry bailout which is of keen interest in Michigan where both Democrats and Republicans will hold presidential primaries TuesdayClinton emphasized the hard choices that lawmakers and President Obama made in 2009 facing the prospect of a collapse in the auto industry and she noted that Sanders a senator from Vermont voted against a bailout measureSanders said he voted against forcing hardworking Americans to bail out the crooks of Wall StreetIf everybody had voted the way he did I believe the auto industry would have collapsed Clinton saidSanders angrily hushed Clinton as she sought to interject Excuse me Im talking he said drawing gasps from the audienceIf youre going to talk tell the whole story Clinton repliedYoull get your turn he snappedThe debate which aired on CNN was added to the Democrats schedule after Sanders emerged as a strongerthanexpected challenger Flint was chosen as the site to highlight the water crisis which has become a focus of liberal angerThe episode began two years ago when state overseers who had taken over the city switched its water supply to the Flint River without treating the water to avoid corrosion of lead pipes Lead leached into the water supply and although residents began complaining immediately the problems did not fully come to light until January amid revelations that state officials had spent much of 2014 and 2015 dismissing those complaintsBoth Clinton and Sanders have said that the crisis would never have happened in a richer whiter city The debate featured heartbreaking and harrowing stories about children who stopped growing lost their hair or were intellectually stunted by poisoned waterSanders used his opening statement to repeat his call for the states Republican governor to resign over what he called a dereliction of duty before shifting to his core message about economic inequalityFor the first time Clinton agreed that Gov Rick Snyder should resign or be recalled Previously she had said that her approach was to try to solve the problem and that assigning blame could waitThe state should also be sending money immediately to help this city I know the state of Michigan has a rainyday fund for emergencies Clinton said Its raining lead in FlintSundays debate opened with a moment of silence in honor of former first lady Nancy Reagan who died Sunday at 94 The session was the first Democratic debate since the Super Tuesday contests when Clinton emerged with a lead of nearly 200 pledged delegates over SandersShe slightly expanded her delegate lead after a win in Louisiana on Saturday while Sanders claimed victories in Nebraska and Kansas The debate had been underway for only a few minutes Sunday when Sanderss victory in the Maine caucuses was announcedSanderss successes and his vow to remain in the race through the Democratic convention lent a new tension to the debate Gone were the magnanimous and polite gestures each had offered the other in previous debatesLets have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change Clinton said testilyLet me tell my story you tell yours Sanders said at another point Your story is voting for every disastrous trade amendment and voting for corporate AmericaSanders mocked Clintons defense of the ExportImport Bank as helpful to small businesses He would shutter the institution he called the Bank of Boeing for its efforts on behalf of the aircraft maker as it competes with rival AirbusSanderss opposition to the ExIm Bank put him at odds with the Democratic caucus in Congress  a fact that he embracedI dont want to break the bad news Sanders said sarcastically Democrats are not always right Democrats have often supported corporate welfare Democrats have supported disastrous trade agreementsBoth candidates have campaigned hard in Michigan Tuesdays vote here will serve as a test of Clintons institutional support from unions and of Sanderss appeal with the working classIt could also set the stage for a contentious fall election Clinton has already begun shifting her focus on the campaign trail to a potential generalelection matchup against the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump although neither he nor the rest of the Republican field got much mention SundayDonald Trumps bigotry his bullying his bluster are not going to wear well with the American people Clinton saidLabeling Sanders a communist was one of the nice things he said about me Sanders jokedMichigan is a swing state that both Republicans and Democrats see as a potential victory in November Trump is favored to win here Tuesday and his toughguy message on international trade has found an audience hereOver several days of campaigning here Sanders has focused squarely on jobs and trade accusing Clinton of backing international trade deals that stripped Michigan of goodpaying jobsHe also stressed his long opposition to trade pacts such as the pending TransPacific Partnership with Pacific Rim nations Clinton had backed the TPP deal a signature initiative of President Obama when she was secretary of state She announced last year that she opposes it which Sanders allies call an electionseason conversion that she could reverse if electedI am very glad Anderson that Secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue Sanders said to moderator Anderson Cooper But its a little bit too lateThe Sanders campaign thinks that the primary map becomes more favorable to him as the race shifts out of the South but his window to overtake Clinton is narrowingBut with momentum from other primaries that featured large numbers of African American voters Clinton holds a comfortable lead in Michigan She has focused her campaign here on black voters who were about a quarter of the primary electorate in 2008 and on the Flint crisisA Detroit Free PressWXYZ poll released late Saturday shows her leading Sanders by 56 percent to 31 percent a gap that suggests it may be too late for him to battle back to a victory here despite a strong effort in recent days the newspaper wroteThe poll had her in a statistical tie with Sanders on the question of trustworthiness and up three points on the question of who would be the more progressive president Only 17 percent of those polled felt Sanders had the best chance of winning in NovemberAt a news conference before the debate Sanders acknowledged that he trails Clinton in Michigan in part because he has continued to struggle to reach African American voters who represented about 23 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in 2008During the debate he fumbled a question about what racial blind spots he has by suggesting that only black people live in ghettosWhen youre white you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto you dont know what its like to be poor you dont know what its like to be hassled when you walk down the street or when you get dragged out of a car he saidFor her part Clinton misstated her own position on gun control a central issue in her campaignI think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the number of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms she saidThat goes further than her official position that loopholes in existing guncontrol laws should be narrowed and that people on the federal terrorist nofly list should be prevented from buying gunsDespite predicting a continued strong challenge from Sanders Clintons advisers hope that by April her delegate advantage will make it virtually impossible for Sanders to claim the nominationThe catastrophic failure represented by the Flint water crisis set the tone for the feisty debate with both candidates expressing outrage and promising actionPresident Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately Sanders saidSanders also demanded a rebate for Flint residents who paid their water bills throughout the crisis something that has already been done Snyder has obtained a 30 million appropriation to pay Flint water bills and give residents money backYou are paying three times more than poisoned water than I pay in Burlington Vermont for clean water Sanders saidClinton pledged to get rid of lead everywhere within five years if she is electedElahe Izadi in Washington and Steve Friess in Flint contributed to this report
