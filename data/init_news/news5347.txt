On Tuesday a federal judge ruled that several top aides to Hillary Clinton during her time at the State Department were required to testify under oath about whether exclusively using a private email server while serving as secretary of state amounted to a deliberate attempt to shield information from the publicThis is the latest in a series of developments regarding Clintons email server  and her decision to exclusively use it during her time as the nations top diplomat Clinton is the first and only secretary of state to only use a private server for her correspondence Almost weekly now there is some news in one of the three ongoing investigations  two at State one by the FBI  into Clinton And the drip drip drip effect of these nowregular revelations continues to have a major impact on how Clinton is viewed by the voting publicGallup released a fascinating bit of data Tuesday that speaks to Clintons trust problem They asked people to offer up the first word or phrase that came to mind when the name Hillary Clinton was mentioned Heres what the results of that openended question looked likeOne in five people  unprompted by the poll taker  offered up some version of Clinton as dishonest or a liar Thats somewhat remarkable given that these openended questions typically produce a gigantic muddle of something like 25 words or phrases  all of which garner somewhere between 5 and 8 percent supportThat 21 percent of people unaided said something about the trust thing in regards to Clinton tells you how deeply the impression that she is not fundamentally honest has sunk into the electorate Now some of this can be directly attributed to the fact that Republicans do not like and do not trust the Clintons Never have never will Overall 77 percent of Republicans topofmind impressions of Clinton are negative with their most frequent responses focusing on views of her as dishonest and crooked write Gallups Frank Newport and Lydia SaadBut thats not it Sure Republicans view Clinton negatively But as Ive noted time and again Clintons seeming belief that this whole trust issue surrounding her is simply the result of a rightwing smear job is inaccurate Again the Gallup data A bare majority  52 percent  of Democrats have some sort of positive first impression of Clinton one in four 27 percent have a negative oneThe Gallup duo are right that impressions about Clinton are deeply held  particularly among partisans But that doesnt make the email story immaterial Rather it reminds many people  Republicans yes but also independents and some Democrats  of what they dont like or trust about the Clintons The longer the email story stays in the news the more chances to affirm peoplesfundamentally negative perception of Clinton that she is just not great at telling the whole truth and nothing but the truthFor Clinton to escape that negative spiral she needs some form of complete exoneration in the matter Worth noting Clinton herself has not been named as a target in any of the trio of investigations Short of that  and if this pattern of drips and drabs of the story coming out continues  the trust problem is going to continue to dog Clinton all the way through the November general election
