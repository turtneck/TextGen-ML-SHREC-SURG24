Keeping an eye on your own energy use is the duh approach to a smorgasbord of environmental problems up to and including climate changeAs a reporter I can obsess over research funding for renewable technology or streamlined permitting for solar installations or more public transit or better roads for cyclists and pedestrians or how much fuel is burned in schlepping and refrigerating my food before it gets to me But if I actually want to feel like I have control over one small corner of the world I turn off the lights when I leave the roomWhen the downstairs neighbors in my apartment building turn on all the lights in the basement because they are little weenies who are afraid of the dark I go downstairs turn them off myself and generally think uncharitable thoughts about them and their various lifestyle choicesIn all this lightswitch obsessing I am a textbook illustration of a phenomenon explored recently by the Journal of Environmental Psychology Chris Mooney over atthe Washington Post does a good job of summarizing the studyYou know what this means I have been judging my neighbors for all the wrong reasons This is pure tragedyThe lead author of the study Ohio State University psychology doctoral student Dan Schley hypothesizes that people tend to focus on switches because theyre always touching the damn things As he told the PostAs a consequence we tend to relatively underestimate just how much energy it takes to keep the air and water in our homes at a temperature we likeIn general people estimate that the appliances they interact with the most computers light switches televisions stoves use the most energy and that the ones that they just leave running in the background like the furnace and the hot water heater use less In fact home heating is one of the biggest energy sucks out there  about 20 percent of home energy use on average instead of the 7 percent that the participants in one study estimated on averageHome heating is one of the biggest energy sucks out thereThe only highly interactive household appliance for which the studys participants tended to underestimate energy consumption was the car On average Americans use even more energy driving around than they do heating their homes But then most people dont think of driving as household energy consumption  possibly because most cars live outside houses and dont show up on the monthly utility bill unless theyre plugin electrical carsWhat is the smartest use of this information about our own psychology Can we make appliances of the future nag us more Will energysucking appliances flamboyantly display their habits instead of being tucked away in utility closets Schley suggests having a light somewhere visible in the house that switches on every time the water heater doesMost importantly if blinking lights are such an attentiongetter can I program my household appliances to throw me a disco party if I meet energy conservation goals Because thats the kind of future I can totally get behindGrist is a nonprofit news site that uses humor to shine a light on big green issues Get their email newsletter here and follow them on Facebook and Twitter
