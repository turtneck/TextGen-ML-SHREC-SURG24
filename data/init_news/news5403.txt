I recently had a pleasant encounter with a great and outspoken American who despite his libertarian leanings supports Hillary Clinton for president I congratulated him on making a tough call but allowed as how I was looking forward to casting my ballot for the Libertarian Partys flag bearers Gary Johnson and William Weld It will be unadulterated pleasure I offered as there is no opportunity costMy correspondent fired back Opportunity cost is Trump gets electedHeres where the curious nature of the American Electoral College comes in handy Even where my voteor the votes of my 100 closest most easily influenced inner circlemight swing an election there is simply no real chance that pushing either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton over the top in South Carolina where I live will determine the outcome of the presidential race If Hillary wobbles to victory in my current state of residence she would have already demolished The Donald in the Electoral College Similarly in Maryland where our family lived until 2014 a squeaker for Mr Trump would indicate that Ms Clinton had been vanquished in a yuuuuuge landslide elsewhereNow it is extremely unlikely that any one persons vote will rock even one states electoral outcome In the closest state presidential election of the last halfcenturyNew Mexico no not Florida in 2000the final margin for Al Gore came to 366 And even that did not swing the national prizeBut set those slim odds of individual influence at the state level off to one longshot side Assuming that you live in a red or blue and not a purple state you swing completely out of the loop In its most recent election forecast the prediction site FiveThirtyEight estimates that there is a 179 percent chance that Florida will decide the election putting one of the candidates over the top Next in line are Ohio and Pennsylvania where the chances are 115 percent each followed by Michigan at 87 percent and Wisconsin at 62 percent When you account for North Carolina Virginia Colorado Minnesota Georgia Nevada and Iowa youve eliminated all the states with as much as an estimated 2 percent chance to determine the outcome Multiply that by the probability that ones own vote can throw ones state from Hillary to Donald or back and the prospect that your vote will crown the next chief of state is neatly forecast as equal to 00This safe harbor protects 67 percent of US population that portion living beyond the aforementioned swing states This logic is not lost on the general public which tends to vote for third parties more often in oneparty statesCitizens realize that they are not trekking to the polls to cast the deciding national vote but to do their patriotic duty taking pride in affixing an I Voted sticker to their lapels and relishing the thought of canceling out some barbarians vote or their spouses But why not go commando and check the ballot for a person youd actually prefer to see as president In most states the Electoral College makes this a guiltfree optionConsequential outcomes from individual presidential votes are so unlikely that Americans cast their chief of state endorsements while investing far less in research about their choice than the investigative effort they sink to select a smartphone data plan or their next Pokemon Go venue This is straightforward Decisions that affect actual results generally invite more attention than those that do not It is called rational ignoranceIn another sense its liberating Because your one tally will not change the nations fate you can afford to exercise your judgment worryfree You are not at fault if Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton should win Meanwhile you will have indulged your conscienceIt is often said that voting third party is throwing your vote away It would be more accurate to say that living in a nonswing state is throwing your vote away One tactic to recapture some modicum of vote value is to pad the total for an upstart candidate Moreover you might help if modestly to put the system on notice that the Big Two political party choices are being rejected Even when the minor parties do not elect a president they can thus wield power The classic example is the Socialist Party which garnered a paltry 880000 votes in the 1932 election barely 2 percent of the total cast but over the course of the decade saw significant pieces of its platform coopted by the New Deal Within years versions of the partys proposals for Social Security a minimum wage and largescale public works were lawIn this years campaign I am insulated from liability by the Electoral College And the presidential festivities in my view feature two highly undesirable major party candidates The Founders have spared me from having to precisely calibrate my coefficient of disgust Voting for Libertarians who have an exceedingly slim chance of victory will be the least complicated choice I will makeuntil Saturdays Pokemon Go selections are available
