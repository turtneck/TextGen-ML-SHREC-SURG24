Editors note We alsoannotatedtheState of the Unionon MediumFollow uson Medium to see our commetaryPresident Barack Obama went after his doubters in his final State of the Union address dismissing their warnings about the countrys economy and military preparedness under his watch as political hot airLet me tell you something The United States of America is the most powerful nation on earth Period Its not even close Its not even closeYet even as he defended his seven years as commander in chief Obama acknowledged he didnt deliver on his to bring a more civil tone to a sharply divided Capitol HillIts one of the few regrets of my presidency  that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better Obama said Theres no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide and I guarantee Ill keep trying to be better so long as I hold this officePolitiFact is factchecking several statements from Obamas speech as well as the Republican response from South Carolina Gov Nikki HaleyA year ago Obama used the same setting to claim the United States has seen our deficits cut by twothirds during his tenure We rated that claim During his 2016 State of the Union address Obama raised the bar saying Weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost threequartersWhen we checked Obamas assertion a year ago he compared his first budget year in office 2009 with 2014 using the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product or GDP Economists consider this a valid way to measure the size of the deficit In fact for most purposes its the best way since it factors in the economys change over timeAccording to this data the deficit as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 76 percent  almost exactly what Obama saidIf you use dollars rather than percentage of GDP the decline is a bit smaller but still pretty close  70 percentThat said experts have told us that while Obamas math may be correct its missing some important caveats Its important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy Also experts have said the more important question is whether Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stableAnd the answer is no said Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen because entitlement programs such as Medicare Medicaid and Social Security have not had substantial reformTheres no way Obamas final State of the Union wouldnt mention his most significant legislation In spite of its controversy Obama said the Affordable Care Act has led to nearly 18 million more people gaining health insurance and has helped to slow health care cost inflation He added that the law didnt destroy the job market despite pessimistic predictions from criticsOur businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law he saidBecause Obama referred specifically to our businesses we looked at privatesector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010 when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act Of the 70 months since Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growthTheres room for argument over what the growth would have looked like absent the health care law but Obamas statistic is on targetObama cited education as an area of bipartisan agreement but he brought up a shaky statistic in the processWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a goodpaying job he said The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start and together weve increased early childhood education lifted high school graduation rates to new highs and boosted graduates in fields like engineeringAt first glance he appears to be correct about high school graduation rates But theres an important caveat So we rate the claim In December the that the rate had reached 823 percent and the department billed it as a new record highHowever the department acknowledged it was the highest level since states adopted a new uniform way of calculating graduation rates five years agoIts a key distinction because high school graduation rates can be a slippery topic and difficult to track Different states and different school districts have used different measures over the years For example some states included private school students who received public fundingThe last time the rates were close to being this high was for the class that graduated in 1970 when the Education Department pegged the rate at 787 percentYet because the current method for calculating rates is only five years old its not clear that the 1970 rate or even the subsequent ones are comparable to current ratesObama defended American might in the face of attacks from critics who say the United States has become a weak player on the national stageWe spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined Obama saidWe found Obamas claim is in the ballpark So it rates Mostly TrueOne set of international military spending figures comes from the SIPRI which maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for more than 170 countries By their calculation the United States spends more than the nextsevencountries combinedIn 2014 the most recent year available the United States led the world in military spending at 610 billion marking 34 percent of the world total  US expenditures were nearly three times higher than China the secondhighest nation with an estimated 216 billion in military spending Russia was in third place at 845 billionBut counting together military spending from the eight countries after the United States comes out to 6464 billion surpassing the United States 610 Omitting No 9 on the list Japan the calculation comes out to about 601 billion put together by the fiscal policyfocused Peter G Peterson Foundation shows the United States spending in stark contrast to the next seven highest spendersAnother data set matches Obamas claim exactly The United States does spend more than eight countries combined according to the IISS a Londonbased think tank that also tracks military spending The United States spent 581 billion on the military in 2014 according to IISS while the eight nexthighest spenders combined spent about 5319 billionCalculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging in part because there is no common definition of what constitutes military spending Further a countrys expenditures does not necessarily correlate perfectly with its military capabilitiesIn the Republican response proceeding Obamas speech South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley praised Obamas speechgiving but criticized his ability to deliver on the goodsThe presidents record has often fallen far short of his soaring words Haley said As he enters his final year in office many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levelsSix years into the economic recovery are income levels really still in the doldrumsFor the most part yes Haleys statement ratesHaley is basically correct if you look at Census Bureau data for median household income adjusted for inflation Inflationadjusted median household income has fallen from 57357 in 2009 to 53657 in 2014 the most recent full year availableThats a decline of 64 percent over a fiveyear period once inflation is taken into account Obama himself seemed to acknowledge this trend when he spoke about more and more wealth and income concentrated at the top and squeezed workersMedian income is lower now compared to 2009 It is however slightly up from its low point in 2012Haleys claim is generally accurate but somewhat depends on your time frame and what you would consider a rise in income levelsObama repeated his longstanding request to Congress that they work with him to close the detention center for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay Cuba Obama campaigned on this pledge and weve been on our ObameterDuring the State of the Union Obama spoke of American leadership as encompassing a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are rightThat is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Its expensive its unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies he saidBecause Obama is still asking for this at the end of his presidency weve rated his campaign pledge as As for Obamas statement that Guantanamo only serves as a recruitment brochure for terrorists this doesnt square with reporting by PunditFact which found that the facility has never really beena key component of ISIS or alQaidapropoganda More often they focus on airstrikes and the American military occupation of Iraq and AfghanistanObama also seemed to be responding to Republican attacks that he didnt take seriously enough the fight against Islamic State also called ISIS or ISILAs we focus on destroying ISIL overthetop claims that this is World War III just play into their hands Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped But they do not threaten our national existence Thats the story ISIL wants to tell thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruitWe explored this claim in a story without rating it on our TruthOMeter We found general agreement among experts that ISIS aspires to become an existential threat to the United States But thats not the same thing as actually being oneObama presented a range of statistics designed to show his economic record in a positive light during his 2016 State of the Union address He kicked it off with this assertion The United States of America right now has the strongest most durable economy in the worldWe should note up front that many of the experts we checked with considered Obamas claim to be vague and difficult to proveThis is the type of braggadocio statement that is hard to interpret in a rigorous way said Barry Bosworth an economist at the Brookings InstitutionHowever many of the same experts agreed that if you had to choose one country for the title of strongest most durable economy in the world it would be the United StatesWe turned to projections for GDP growth over the next two years released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development a group of economically advanced countries The group looked at 43 countries ranging from large advanced economies to smaller advanced economies to large emerging economiesThe United States ranked almost exactly in the middle of the OECDs list  No 21 Experts told us however that a middling ranking on this list doesnt necessarily mean the United States economic outlook is weak The full chart is at the end of this article ranked in descending order by projected GDP growth in 2016For starters many of the countries with higher projected growth rates have significantly smaller economies making a comparison with the United States applestooranges These countries include Ireland Iceland the Slovak Republic Poland Israel Latvia Luxembourg Lithuania and EstoniaIn addition a few countries have much higher projected growth rates but they are generally considered emerging economies making for a different but equally questionable type of applestooranges comparison These include the top three countries on the projectedgrowth list India China and IndonesiaThe most direct comparisons to the United States are probably the other six members of the elite Group of 7 economies  the United Kingdom France Germany Italy Canada and Japan And all of them rank below the United States when measured by projected growth for 2016 and 2017As for employment the United States scores well among its closest competitors Hoddenbagh pointed to data showing only one of the Group of 7 with a lower unemployment rate than the United States current 5 percent Japans unemployment rate is 33 percentWe rated the claim Mostly TrueThis story is updated as new factchecks are published
