That in itself was a sign that the punch landed normally OReilly doesnt descend from his perch in the nospin zone to debate mere mortals on platforms besides Fox The Mother Jones story is embarrassing but its probably not fatal Most of the reporting on Fox has roughly the same relationship with the truth as OReillys claim to combat zone action I cant see him facing censure for this but I hope Im wrongIf you missed the action Corn and Daniel Schulman reported that despite OReillys claims of having survived a combat operation during the Falklands War the Fox host then with CBS only got as close as Buenos Aires roughly 1400 miles away from the fighting Nobody from CBS got to the Falklands CBSs Bob Schieffer told Mother Jones I came close Wed been trying to get somebody down there It was impossibleThere was of course no combat in the Argentinian capital but there was a raucous protest and thats apparently what OReilly refers to as a combat operation He also claimed he was the only CBS reporter covering the demonstration which Schieffer likewise denies We were all out with our camera crews that day to cover the protest Schieffer says Id been out there with a crew tooLikewise his claim of having seen combat danger in El Salvador is undermined by reporting  the reporting of Bill OReilly himself on the ground in real time In his book The NoSpin Zone OReilly tells of visiting a dangerous guerrilla controlled area with a camera crew where I quickly did a standup amid the rubble and we got the hell out of thereHis realtime dispatch for CBS was different He described touring a scene by helicopters with the Salvadoran military and reported these days Salvadoran soldiers appear to be doing more singing than fighting having succeeded in scattering the rebel forces leaving government troops in control of most of the country There was no mention of having to get the hell out of there The problem for people who care about the truth is that OReilly is not likely to be punished for shading it Hes a serial exaggerator  remember his claim to be the product of middleclass Levittown when he grew up in tonier Westbury Much of the reporting on Fox is similarly distorted the ratio of truth to fiction is often worse than in OReillys combat zone mythology The madeup Fox bogeymen of the New Black Panther Party were actually less dangerous to democracy than Buenos Aires was to OReilly More recently the networks claim of Muslimonly nogo zones in London was based on even skimpier evidence I personally got a big story wrong last year I predicted Foxs Sean Hannity would pay a price for hyping the cause of racist grifter Cliven Bundy especially after Stephen Colbert flayed himfor it But he didnt So while I hope to be wrong this time  by underestimating Roger Ailess conscience rather than exaggerating it  I dont expect to be The good news is Ive covered a lot of unruly protests in my time Im glad to know I can now claim to have survived a combat operation Thanks Bill
