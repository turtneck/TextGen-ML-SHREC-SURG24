By Francis Carr Begbie ERIC CANTOR  Republican politician and LISSA MUSCATINE Hillary Clintons former speech writer were two of the many Jews given free rein to reflect on Donald Trump a few days ago before millions of BBC viewers In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight The editor two out of three of the main presenters and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were JEWISH Not bad for a group said to represent less than 04 of the British population  Francis Carr Begbie You might think that after a disaster as humiliating as the election of Donald Trump that our anointed elites would take this opportunity for a bit of humility  that this would be an opportunity for introspection and some soulsearching selfreflection Well the good news is that you would be wrong For this would involve a level of selfawareness far beyond our narcissistic elites All around they are demonstrating a complete inability to understand the forces behind their humiliation at the hands of a man they dismissed as a joke from day one and whose demise they predicted every inch of the way This selfdeception was wonderfully on display in an immediate postelection edition of the BBCs flagship current affairs programme Newsnight  broadcast to the nation the day after and including a number of American interviewees In a specially extended version of the show programme editor Ian Katz dispatched Emily Maitlis  Mark Urban and David Grossman to find answers on the day after the result In both London and Washington a stellar line up of the finest brains from the media and the academy were assembled to help them chew it over Entertainingly the vanity narcissism and entitlement of the BBC presenterocracy was fully on view proud and undented To the accompaniment of the Beatles tune Fool on the Hill anchor Emily Maitlis could barely contain her rage and sputtered about how a game show host and someone who owned a beauty pageant could become president Populism uprising nationalism versus globalism as with former President Bushs puzzlement over the vision thing they seemed to be able to mouth the words but comprehension was lacking With every guest Emily Maitlis showed that old habits die hard or not at all She dripped condescension from the outset snapping at immigration traitor  proIsrael fanatic former US Congressman Eric Cantor who was perhaps trying to redeem himself given the new winds in the Republican Party We talked about the vulgarity of this man  This is a man who talked of grabbing women by the pussy Is that a man you are proud of An angry school teacher furious with the behaviour of her immature irresponsible charges Easily the funniest moment in the programme came during a virtuoso splenetic performance from historian Simon Schama who seemed to think it was Germany in 1933 all over again Race he said was more important factor in the election than the economic arguments SIMON SCHAMA ASHKENAZI JEW Wriggling in his seat as if it was subjected to regular electric shocks he said It is really weird to me how we pussyfoot around the toxic malodorous element of race which has played an important part of this Antisemitism has long been part of populism beginning in the early twentieth century Even today there were sinister references by the likes of senator Jeff Sessions to George Soros who was singled out as a particularly odious figure in this international banking conspiracy To which many people in the Alt Right might have replied couldnt have put it better myself Schama almost lost it completely when cointerviewee and neocon stalwart Melanie Phillips told him to calm down a bit It is not a moment for calm it is not a moment for calm he screeched MELANIE PHILLIPS ASHKENZI JEW AND VIRULENT ZIONIST Melanie knows very well what these antisemitic dog whistles are like This too is part of populism We are facing a cataclysmic moment Melanie is right to say it is a populist revolt It is nothing to do with conservative republican politics It amuses me to hear that Eric Cantor imagines that things are going to go on as they always did in the Republican party  that they will restrain Donald Trump They wont George Washington warned about despotism and that is what we are facing Melanie Phillips for her part agreed the most important problem was antiSemitism but she saw it coming from a completely different quarter There are noxious elements around  Clearly some of the people supporting Trump are antisemitic and racists but that is also true of people on the left There is no sign that he Trump personally is antisemitic or racist People call people racist when they want to restrict as he does legal immigration Antisemitism is now at record levels at liberal universities overseen by liberal professors and liberal vice chancellors Studio presenter Evan Davies muttered about how they had to give up something to people worried about the loss of their traditional societies and really act on illegal immigration But Schama wasnt listening He was worried about David Duke Donald Trump retweeted a neoNazi tweet It is not a coincidence that David Duke KKK Imperial Wizard is exhilarated and rejoicing with the advent of Trump who is his man We will see race crimes hate crimes explode now We will have a farright supreme court which will reverse Roe v Wade As a glimpse into the fevered imagination of at least one strongly identifying Jew it could not have been more revealing Before Schama actually selfdetonated on air the programme moved on to more heavyweights Neoconservative think tanker Danielle Pletka  senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute complained she had no idea what Trumps policies were Which was not very helpful Mary Kaldor  professor of global governance at the London School of Economics complained that Trump was wildly unpredictable in his stated foreign policies He says I love Israel then he says he wants to be neutral between Israel and Palestine For her the real danger seemed to be peace Or as she framed it Trump getting friendly with Putin to create an alliance of authoritarian right wing leaders But it was the Pulitzer prizewinning historian of communism Anne Applebaum who painted the most apocalyptic scenario Applebaum who has never seen a Deep State she didnt like said that Trump had been disdainful for NATO and cannot understand why America needs to be in Europe His admiration for Vladimir Putin as an ideal was very worrying ANNE APPLEBAUM    ANOTHER ASHKENAZI JEW Europeans need to start from the assumption that United States is not a reliable partner We need to keep repeating that until it sinks into peoples brains She really said that Applebaum said Trump sees no need for a relationship with the UK He said that Trump who has spent millions developing his two golf courses which include Turnberry is apparently not an anglophile and has no interest in Britain Hillary Clinton does Surely asked presenter Grossman the Brexit referendum puts Britain and the USA on the same page Applebaum No no no Both these women think it makes the election of Marie le pen more likely Likely correct and thank god for that Alan Greenspan  former chairman of the Fed was wheeled on to say that he a lifelong Republican had not voted He also explained that Trump would not be able to get rid of the current Federal Reserve Bank chair Janet Yellen without a complicated impeachment process Earlier in the show Maitlis tried to get Republican Eric Cantor to condemn Trump but got no change Cantor responded lamely about Trumps promise to build a border wall Im not so sure that is going to happen  showing not surprisingly that he remains an immigration traitor at heart And he continues to show his allegiance to Israel Cantor said he was less interested in Trumps immigration policies than his Middle East policies including his intention to get rid of ISIS Lissa Muscatine  Hillarys former speech writer assured Maitlis that her old college friend had bounced back as strong as ever Elsewhere David Grossman did a breakdown of the vote to show that women and Hispanics had leaned to Trump in far greater numbers that anyone thought possible In fact a solid majority of White women voted for Trump proving Schama right Trump voters are racists In the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of BBC Newsnight  The editor two out of three of the main presenters and all seven of the main interviewees in Washington and London were Jewish Not bad for a group said to represent less than 04 of the British population I should note however that there were a smattering of Vox pop style threesecond soundbite interviewees of men in baseball hats celebrating in bars and so on There was also an abortive panel of a Hispanic man black woman and Jewish New York Times reporter and there was a Latvian politician down the line But otherwise it was an extremely Kosher programme The BBC operates one of the most aggressive affirmative action policies in the Western world In keeping with its position as the Vatican of political correctness a finger is kept on the scales of employment opportunity to ensure that jobs are skewed heavily for favoured groups But given that selfawareness is one area where the elites are notably deficient it might be s good idea to remind them of the massive Jewish overrepresentation on display here This is one very privileged group indeed Overrepresented and overprivileged one might say Like this Share it now
