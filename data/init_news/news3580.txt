Fights Over Religious Freedom And Gay Rights Are Costing RepublicansFollowing a firestorm of criticism Republican governors in Indiana and Arkansas signed revised versions of their states Religious Freedom Restoration bills Thursday night In Indiana the language was adjusted and in Arkansas it was significantly scaled back to more closely align with the federal lawNational Republicans especially the ones running for president have to hope its enough to get them out of the hole they dug themselves on religious freedom and gay rights Its worth taking a look at what the whole brouhaha has cost the GOPIn the spirit of Passover here are four questions about what this issue means for the GOPIts possible that Republicans big electoral victories in November blinded them to just how controversial this would be Gov Asa Hutchison RArk and Gov Mike Pence RInd seemed genuinely taken aback by the demand for boycotts and the backlash from big corporations like Eli Lilly WalMart and Apple as well as the NCAAIts as if Republicans  particularly in the deepred states of Arkansas and Indiana  operate according to a different political calculus insulated from the divide between their own conservative constituents and changing national opinion Because of redistricting and the phenomenon of a midterm electorate that leans a lot more Republican than a presidentialyear electorate there are now many more GOP governors and many more conservative majorities in state legislatures And those majorities are moving forward with an agenda that satisfies their base of social conservatives but is seen as intolerant and divisive by the business community and a growing majority of voters in the country This week those two opposing dynamics reignited the culture war with Republican politicians as the first casualties2 Is this about more than just religious freedomYes Its about a much bigger much more fundamental problem for the GOP A new Pew poll showed that 61 percent of young Republicans favor gay marriage Hutchinson said his own son signed a petition asking him to veto the bill that he instead sent back to the Legislature for revisionThe Republicans cant appeal to young voters if theyre on the wrong side of gay marriage because gay rights is a symbol of tolerance for so many young voters  not to mention suburban women The same is true for one of the fastestgrowing parts of the electorate  Hispanics How do Republicans show Hispanics that they are welcoming and inclusive if they oppose a path to legalization for hardworking immigrants here illegallyThe views of the GOPs white older conservative primary electorate are farther away from the center of American public opinion than the Democratic base is right now Thats the challenge for the GOP  it needs to project an image of tolerance in order to win the White House while at the same time satisfying its conservative base which in this case wants Christian florists bakers and photographers to have the right to refuse services to gay weddings It will take a very talented candidate to square that circle3 OK so how will Republican candidates resolve this larger tensionGood question The debates during the primaries will presumably reveal the answerOf all the GOP presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush has given this the most thought He seems determined not to fall into the trap that Mitt Romney did in 2012  moving so far to the right during the GOP primaries remember self deportation that he couldnt make it back to the center to win the general electionBush has said his strategy is to run as if hes willing to lose the primary in order to win the general4 Hows that working out for Jeb Bush so farNot so great All the leading Republican presidential hopefuls including Bush came out in favor of the Arkansas and Indiana bills By Wednesday though Bush was backtracking insisting that religious freedom is a core value but that we also shouldnt discriminate based on sexual orientationBush didnt explain how he would balance those two values only that he was sure Indiana would get to that placeSo for Bush the lose the primary strategy sometimes means sticking to his principles in opposition to the GOP base as he has on immigration reform and Common Core education standards but sometimes on issues like religious freedom he seems to fuzz it upMeanwhile Sen Ted Cruz RTexas has no doubts about what side hes on In Iowa on Wednesday Cruz blasted the big business wing of the GOP saying they are running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay marriage agenda over religious liberty
