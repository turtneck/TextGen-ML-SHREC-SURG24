As far as Lee Bebout was concerned his Arizona State University course US Race Theory and the Problem of Whiteness was off to a good start A multiracial politically diverse group of undergraduates was enrolled Hed prepared a syllabus and was ready to lead them in seminarstyle discussions assigning basic readings and weekly papers on the history ofrace in America and other topicsBut the class had met exactly once in the beginning of the 2015 spring semester when news of it  or its title at least  spread past campus Bebout was at lunch with his wife in January when a producer for a conservative radio show reached out to book an interview about the course Next Fox News wanted to talkI thought Oh god this might not be a good thing Bebout who tends to talk about the controversy in bemused understatements remembersThen came the hate mail Lots of it More than one message commanded the 38yearold professor who is white to go live in Africa The outrage reached a fever pitch that transcended the everyday internet trolling that goes hand in hand with just about any news that relates to raceThings got obviously weird he says when white supremacist groups came to my neighborhoodIt was more than weird  it was scary Hereceived death threats All for daring to talk about whitenessThe people campaigning against the course were incensed at what they understood to be an entire semester dedicated to slamming white people But the Problem of Whiteness wasnt designed to convince students that white people are a problem The negative language in the courses title was simply a nod to how tough it can be to talk or even think about what it means to be white when white is so deeply etched in the minds of many Americans as a synonym for raceless or neutral The reaction to the course seemed to prove this thesisBebout then an assistant professor of English the school stood behind him and hes since received tenure and is a full professor had previously taught courses like Transborder Chicano Literature and American Ethnic Literature He says he created the Problem of Whiteness for practical reasons I can study Chicano studies I can do critical race theory to some degree but without understandingwhiteness it felt like there was this big gap that I wasnt able to understand in the fieldIn other words you really have to understand the idea of whiteness to even begin to talk about race in America As Columbia University historian Barbara J Fieldstold the producers of PBSs seriesRace The Power of An Illusion it was selfidentified white Americans of European descent whoinvented race during the era of the American Revolution as a way of resolving the contradiction between a natural right to freedom and the fact of slavery Slavery is over but whiteness remains the identity against which ethnic groups are compared and the identity that racism protectsYou really have to understand the idea of whiteness to even begin to talk about race in AmericaOne white teenager profiled in the new MTV documentary White People put it in plain language White is the default Its the default race That film which premiered July 22 is a highprofile exploration how young white people perceive their racial identity in a country thats more ethnically diverse by the year and where they stand to be outnumbered by people who identify as something other than white by 2042Its not the first recent effort of its kind Last year an interactive film projectThe Whiteness Project gave a platform to the unfiltered views of white Americans who answered questions like Can you describe any benefits your receive from being whiteIn June after NAACP official Rachel Dolezal was exposed for going to incredible lengths to distance herself from the white identity she was born with and pass as black and white supremacist Dylann Roof was arrested for a deadly attack on a predominately black Charleston South Carolina church theNew York Times Sunday Review asked What Is WhitenessThe idea that whiteness is deserving of scrutiny is unfailingly and uniquely controversial Many fret that contemplating what it means to be white is no more than a setup to make white Americans feel ashamed as one disgruntled father of a teen featured inWhite People complains Others worry that this focus distracts from the plight of members of racial minority groups or that it irresponsibly offers a new platform to old racist views without providing sufficient context or correctionBut whats clear is that the days of pretending that whiteness is invisible are over The turmoil surrounding it is just one of the growing pains of a country thats rapidly changing and struggling to rethink old ways of talking about and analyzing raceOne reason Bebout didnt fully anticipate the intense backlash against his course is that the topic wasnt revolutionary Examining what whiteness is  analyzing it as a race a culture and a concept that has fueled racism  isnt new particularly in academiaBebouts assigned reading list included books that had been around for years The Possessive Investment inWhiteness 1998Critical Race Theory 1996The Everyday Language of White Racism 2008Playing in the Dark Whiteness and the Literary Imagination 1993 and more Bebout points to James Baldwins introduction toThe Price of the Ticketwritten in 1985 Tim Wise wroteWhite Like Me Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son in 2005And contemplating what it means to be white goes back even further than these contemporary texts to the late 19th century and early 20th century writing of thinkers like WEB Du Bois Attention to whiteness has had more practical moments too like in the curricula of the freedom schools of the civil rights movement in the 1960s when as Bebout puts it a lot of black activists were saying Okay we need to understand social conditioning of white peopleIn 1988 came Peggy McIntoshs essayWhite Privilege Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack anchored by a 50item list of small benefits that white Americans enjoy every day  like I can be sure that my children will be given curricular materials that testify to the existence of their race I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented into a supermarket and find the staple foods which fit with my cultural traditions into a hairdressers shop and find someone who can cut my hair and I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me Still widely considered the simplest goto explanation of white privilege  which is fast becoming a household term  it set off a surge of interest in whitenessstudies scholarship in the 1990s thats since ebbed and flowed but has never been a secretIn recent years though something has changed Energy around the idea that white people have a race and a stake in conversations about race and racism has very clumsily begun to go mainstreamControversy about this spikes every five or 10 years The difference is now we have the internet Bebout saysThis development means the topic has emerged from its cozy nuancefriendly place in academic and progressive circles In the hands of the public  sharing articles offering reactions on Twitter and typing paragraphs in comment sections  its simultaneously been treated with skepticism infused with new life and violently garbledIn MTVsWhite People Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas travels the country to interview a crosssection of young white Americans teachers at a predominantly Native American elementary school a kid from an allwhite town who attends a historically black college a recent high school graduate who frets that shes missed out on scholarships because of her race and the leader of a workshop on white privilege Their narratives are supplemented by interviews with experts and statistics and charts about demographics and attitudes that flash across the screenThe point We cannot have an honest and real conversation about race in America if we cant talk about what being white means in America Vargas told theLA Times in a prepremiere interviewThat concept sounds straightforward enough but it hasnt been easy to digestIn part due to the provocative language of an initial casting call that asked potential subjects Are you being discriminated against for being white and Are you being made to feel guilty because youre white in addition to Is something making you question the advantages youve had as a white person and the release of a trailer that featured white subjects unfiltered musings You say the wrong thing and suddenly youre a racist the film was met with dreadAnticipatory critiques rolled in There was kneejerk negativity from the usual  often conservative  suspects who resist most any conversation about race and who seem to sniff out that scrutiny of whiteness might lead to thinking critically about racism in America in a way that clashes with their ideology Theyre right It often doesRush Limbaugh for example dismissed Vargas as a a renowned illegal immigrant and then honing in on the use of the term white privilege in the trailer offered his conservative listeners anominous description of the film whose potential damage he seemed to argue had been underdiscussedBut the disapproval runs deeper and is more complicated than that Mention whiteness as an area of study and some will recoil at the assumption that its code for white supremacy as in the antagonistic White History Month campaigns that tend to crop up as pushback against African American History Month and what critics see as outofcontrol multiculturalism From others it will elicit eye rolls in anticipation of petty complaints about imagined hardships and reverse racismI cant tell if this is actually supposed to be funny or serious but its kinda hard not to laugh when a white dude exclaims You say the wrong thing and suddenly you are racist before the words WHITE FRUSTRATIONwrote Kristen Yoonsoo Kim forComplexThe white people featured in the documentary come from all walks of life but they have one thing in common They all seem like a bunch of whiny white people wrote Yesha Callahan of the AfricanAmerican news sitethe RootThe film has also been criticized by those who saw it in its entirety and thought its aims were worthy but worried that it fell short at times presenting some white subjects unsophisticated attitudes and statements without sufficiently challenging their premises In a conversation betweenSlate TV critic Willa Paskin and staff writer Aisha Harris the two agreed that it would make an insufficient teaching tool Paskin dubbed it a pretty great idea for a documentary that was a little too remedial with and gentle on well white people Harris agreed noting But we spend so little time with each of them and the conversations are edited so heavily that it always felt rushedIts trueWhite People is short  under an hour long  and it was heavier on feelings than on history or scholarship of American racism But it was after all made for MTV And despite the short viewer attention span that it seemed to anticipate it managed to offer some instruction dispelling the myth that white students are at a disadvantage when it comes to college scholarships criticizing colorblindness as a tool for combating racism and even giving viewers a peek into an actual classroom lesson on white privilegeAnd with this topic even a flawless production would have had to contend with a different issue not hostility to the message but disinterest Some members of the main group that must buy into analysis of whiteness for it to work  white Americans themselves  simply dont see the appeal of scrutinizing their own racial identity And its fair to ask If they dont have an academic interest like Bebouts whats in it for them As Nell Irvin Painter a professor of history at Princeton University and the author ofThe History of White People wrote for theNew York Times whiteness is often perceived as being on toggle switch between bland nothingness and racist hatred neither of which is particularly appealingWhenever the words whiteness or white privilege get uttered by nonwhite people peoples reflexes go all the way up Vargas toldBuzzFeed News in November 2014 anticipating reactions to the documentaryWhite people think race is something outside themselves and they dont consider themselves a racePerhaps he was primed after the response toThe WhitenessProjectthe interactive investigation designed to explore how Americans who identify as white think about and experience their ethnicity The project elicited similar reactions the moment the series of video interviews in which residents of Buffalo New York responded to questions like What does it mean to be white hit the internetWhite people think race is something outside themselves and they dont consider themselves a race Whitney Dow the 53yearold filmmaker behind the project said echoing a common talking point among people campaigning for attention to whitenessIn many cases his interviews made his point for him with subjects seemingly wanting to weigh in on anything but whiteness railing against diversity or affirmative action in responses like I just dont buy into the nonsense about discrimination and Because slavery happened does that mean we owe black people somethingDow said the people who initially criticized the concept made up two main groups One is from the right on the conservative side who say Why are you stirring something up Everybody needs to forget about race and stop talking about it We just need to move on The other side is from the left who are saying Youre just another white guy who wont let go of the microphone Youre putting all this stuff out here thats incredibly wounding for us to hear and its really really outrageous what youre up toDow ultimately got to explain the projects intended message  mostly that white people do have a racial identity and that it almost never gets any serious attention  in a series of interviews includingthis one with Vox He said plenty of others looked past the often abrasive  and yes racist  statements of the interviewees to glean larger lesson of the project While he says the intended audience of the project was his fellow white people one of his favorite examples of a positive response is from a black woman who he said told him It was incredibly cathartic and relieving to see that white people are grappling with the same thing that they feel like their whiteness is somehow defined in opposition of blackness Seeing that were grappling with the same things gave me some sort of inner peaceBut the whiteness trend is not just fodder for films and internet debates Its gaining a foothold in American culture  the reallife inperson kindNew York Citys private Fieldston Lower School made headlines in May fora new program that splits up kids starting in third grade into racial affinity groups where they are encouraged to have frank conversations about their identities and experiences and then reunite for a curriculum designed to foster interracial empathyWhat makes the program unique is that it isnt just for the black Latino and Asian students White students have their own group too  and participation is mandatory Mariama Richards the school administrator behind the program toldNew York magazines Lisa Miller that when other schools have affinity groups they send the white kids to recess But true integration she said doesnt happen if only half the people are talking about itWhat I am suggesting is that we all have skin in the game Im suggesting that we all need to be involved in this conversation Richards saidThat idea  that white people have an identity worth thinking about and a natural stake in tackling racism  is taking holdWhile the Fieldston kids dont have any more of a choice in participating in their groundbreaking mandatory program than they do in studying math or English the adults in one Boston organization do and theyre coming in drovesThis is the description for potential members of MeetupcomsBoston Knapsack AntiRacism Group just one ofthe many groups around the country for and by white people who are committed to racial justiceTypical events include Book group Reproducing Racism  How Everyday Choices Lock in White Advantage and Strategies for Moving White People Into Racial Justice The groups name is a nod to Mcintoshs Invisible Knapsack essay on white privilegeAccording to Michael Martin a black 28yearold software engineer from Springfield Massachusetts who is one of the largely white he guesses about 60 to 70 percent groups seven organizers membership has exploded in the months since Michael Browns death in Ferguson Missouri drew national attention to racially biased policing and larger issues of racial inequality A lot of white Bostonians wanted to know where they fit into the solutionsOnce everything happened there was an immediate response he saidThe group now reports about 100 active members Martin says they show up with varying degrees of literacy about racism but with an earnest interest in combating it  and not in a kumbaya colorblind I dont see race sense at least if he has anything to say about it He considers it his responsibility as one of the leaders and one of a handful of black members to keep conversations on track by reminding members that American racism and white supremacy are bigger than oneonone interactions We never let anyone get out of any of our space thinking that there isnt systemic racism thats happening he saidMartin is not surprised by the recent surge of interest in the group I definitely think there is a cultural moment surrounding whiteness and white Americans role in fighting racism he said I think it needs to be pulled more and more out of academia This is something thats affecting people whether they have a chance to go to a fouryear university or not and we need to have a conversation about itScrutinizing what it means to be white in America is new and its hard Theres the fact that so many people have solidified the view that talking about race is bad or that ignoring the labels we all use is the best way to address it But even once you get past that theres a cognitive struggle even among people with the best intentions and most enthusiasm to grasp that whiteness is not the planet all the other planets revolve aroundI didnt see the value in thinking about whiteness and why that would be important  I wanted to talk to people who were different than I wasThats how Drew Philp the 29yearold author ofa forthcoming book expanding on an BuzzFeedessay that grappled with his role as a white man moving into Detroit describes the conceptBut he remembers when he didnt get it As a student at the University of Michigan in 2007 he was selected to participate in the schools Program for Intergroup Relations  and part of his role was to facilitate a class for his peersHe was not excited Initially I was very resistant to it personally he said It was an idea Id never been exposed to in any manner I felt maybe that I was being cheated of some experience and I didnt see the value in thinking about whiteness and why that would be important  I wanted to talk to people who were different than I wasHes now come all the way around to appreciate whiteness studies but the memory of his college experience means he understands people who dontA new idea making its way through the culture is difficult in general and people myself in included are trained in a lot of ways when it comes to race Millennials are the first generation when its been unacceptable to be an overt racist in all public spheres So talking about whiteness triggers folks They worry Maybe were going to make a wrong stepHe hasnt held back when it comes to publicly criticizing these missteps though In 2014 as a film critic for the Detroit Metro Times he penneda scathing review of aWhite People a stage production by Brooklyn playwright J T Roger arguing that while the conversation around whiteness is sorely needed this particular piece of art went awry with characters who are all defined not by their whiteness as something specific and definable but by their descriptions of people of color and violent interactions with other racesHe slammed the show with an astronomy metaphor White People looks at the gravity and the satellite moons forgetting the star Everything but white peopleIts a common sentiment Matt Johnson who pennedLoving Day a novel in which a biracial protagonist navigates questions or race color and identity  and whos written about his own biracial identity  recently tweeted a concise take on this dilemma Whiteness cant take being focused on Whiteness only accepts being the lens that focusesThat could partly explain why Bebout is used to people recoiling and resisting the concept of his course His tactic is to diffuse their anxiety with a joke Yes I teach about how white people are awful and then once theyre disarmed deliver a wellhoned elevator pitch that tells a more accurate story Look what Im interested in is how white people have experienced race in the United States and they have not necessarily experienced it the same ways as people of color They experience it by not talking about it or not seeing it or talking about race in a very coded way Or talking about race in one way at home and another way in public Im interested in how white folks experience race and how that experiencing of race is informed by and also reinforces racial inequalityHe makes the topic which has proven to be so complicated sound simpleAnd hell be teaching it again next semester
