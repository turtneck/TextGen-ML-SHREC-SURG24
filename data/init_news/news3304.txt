A public service announcement from your friends here at Vox There will be an enormous amount of false information on Facebook the internet and TV this Election Day Do yourself and the country a favor and ignore itPoliticians have always played fast and loose with the truth cable news networks have always gotten stories wrong and the internet has always been a place for conspiracy theories and misleading stories and photosBut the 2016 campaign has seen an unprecedented increase in the sheer number of false news stories being shared on Facebook or posted to genuinelooking but entirely fake news sites run by techsavvy young people looking to make some money off this long and bitter electionTake the Denver Guardian which earlier this month ran a story with the attentiongrabbing headline FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDERSUICIDE The article ricocheted across Facebook and gained tens of thousands of shares despite the fact that there is no such thing as the Denver Guardian and that the story in question is a complete fabricationIts a dynamic that deeply concerns President Barack Obama arguably the savviest user of social media in American political history  and the politician who has been targeted in the majority of Facebooks most paranoid conspiracyminded and outright racist viral postsAs long as its on Facebookpeople start believing it he said during a campaign stop in Ann Arbor Michigan on Monday It creates this dust cloud of nonsenseTo make matters even dicier many current and former US officials believe that Russia may try to deliberately spread false information on Election Day to make wouldbe Hillary Clinton voters stay home or simply to shake overall confidence in the American political systemAll of which means that if you see or read something on Election Day that appears too dramatic to be true theres probably a good and simple reason It isntIn November 2012 Fox News aired a video clip showing a member of the Black Panthers standing outside a polling station in Philadelphia It was a single person at a single polling station in a heavily black heavily Democratic area but Fox anchors strongly suggested that it was part of a broader pattern of voter intimidation by militants determined to stop thenGOP nominee Mitt Romney The segment was rebroadcast frequently throughout the dayFlashforward four years Its certainly possible that Fox News  or a leftleaning station like MSNBC  will find a similar type of clip and present it in a way that is deliberately misleadingAmazingly though that could literally be the least of our problems A much bigger concern is the proliferation of entirely fake news sites with entirely fake stories often operated by techsavvy entrepreneurs living overseasA BuzzFeed article earlier this month found that young people in the Macedonian town of Veles population 45000 had created more than 140 proTrump news sites running posts every day that are aggregated or completely plagiarized from fringe and rightwing sites in the USTo take one example from the story a website called ConservativeState posted an article with the headline Hillary Clinton In 2013 I Would Like to See People Like Donald Trump Run for Office Theyre Honest and Cant Be BoughtThe story was a complete fabrication but it immediately went viral racking up more than 480000 shares reactions and comments on Facebook in less than a week By contrast BuzzFeed noted that the New York Times bombshell revealing that Trump had declared a 916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns drew a comparatively small 175000 Facebook interactions over an entire monthThat kind of traffic is lucrative business for the Macedonians some of whom told BuzzFeed that they made up to 5000 per month pushing information they knew to be untrueYes the info in the blogs is bad false and misleading one of these youngsters told BuzzFeed But the rationale is that if it gets the people to click on it and engage then use itTrump is also getting a boost from paid trolls in Russia who pretend to be American on multiple social media accounts that they use to make proTrump comments on traditional publications like the New York Times as well as on Facebook and Twitter The lies and false information often gets parroted by both conservative news outlets like Fox News and Trump himselfAre Russian trolls to blame for that a female troll asked comedian Samantha Bee Maybe people are to blame too Theyre lazy and believe everything they readThe bitter race between Clinton and Trump may end up being the kind of excruciatingly close race where small pockets of voters in key states ultimately decide our next president That makes dirty tricks like recent ads wrongly telling Clinton supporters that they could vote by text all the more dangerousAs the Washington Post reported the fake ads circulated on Twitter with the exact fonts and imagery used in real Clinton campaign materials They told Clinton backers that they could save time and vote from home by texting her name to a fivedigit phone number One Englishlanguage ad read Vote early Text Hillary to 59925 Another was written entirely in SpanishThey were lies of course You can vote by mail or in person but you most definitely cannot do it by texting Clintons first name to a random phone number Its unclear how many wouldbe Clinton voters fell into the trap or who specifically was responsible for setting it But in a race where every vote matters the fake ads could easily have real impactAnd thats the biggest thing to keep in mind on Election Day Facebooks enormous reach means that lies and distortions  regardless of whether they come from GOP dirty tricksters partisan journalists paid trolls in Russia or moneyseeking entrepreneurs in Macedonia  can genuinely impact the outcome of the campaign Be careful with what you read be careful with what you retweet and be careful with what you share on Facebook There are bad actors out there hoping to mess with our election Dont make it easier for them
