2014 was the planets warmest year on record Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century Obama said Yes this winter was cold in parts of our country including Washington Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact But around the world in the aggregate it was the warmest winter ever recordedIts of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they cant even use the words climate changeClimate change can no longer be denied Obama said It cant be edited out It cant be omitted from the conversation And action can no longer be delayed   Ahead of the visit White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change And the president picked Florida Earnest said because its a place where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisanEarnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov Jeb Bush and Sen Marco Rubio two likely Republican presidential contenders who havent been as enthusiastic about climate action Bush has said hes a skeptic when it comes to climate change while Rubio says he doesnt believe human activity is causing the planet to heat upThe president Earnest said on the call hopes the visit will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority However he added the trip is not an effort to go to anyones home state but to raise the debateEarnest maintained that Obamas visit isnt about campaigns this is about making progress on a priority But he also noted that the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change they do that to the detriment of the people theyre elected to representFlorida Gov Rick Scott R also no big fan of the concept of climate change has taken to Twitter to criticize Obamas Everglades visit Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration because he said Our environment is too important to neglectEarnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday Its a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words climate change for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change he said referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms global warming and climate change in official communications Thats a tough case to make but it sounds like that didnt stop himThe White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year A new report from the NPS released Wednesday finds that every dollar invested in the parks returns 10 to the US economy through tourism and other related industries The NPS reported a record 293 million visitors in 2014
