Its no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump Positive Trump polls are coming all the time so its all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to HillaryObamas latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and hes spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing itFrom Judicial Watch Months after the Obama administration spent 19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November its dedicating an additional 10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches The money is distributed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction English US history and civics courses Officially theyre known as citizenship integration grantsJudicial Watch went on to say The Department of Homeland Security DHS has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens Clearly the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats We intend to award about 1 million to firsttime recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016 the agencys grant announcement states If you represent one of these organizations or know of an interested organization we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying Additionally another 9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services Some might consider this a cash giveawayPractically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants For example the Department of Labor DOL is implementing new workforce programs for the new Americans and the Department of Education is promoting funding opportunities to assure that the immigrants are provided the tools they need to succeed The Department of Health and Human Services HHS is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on immigrantfocused careerpathways programs The Department of Justice DOJ and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD is launching a twoyear pilot to assure that non English speakers have meaningful access to housing programs subsidized by American taxpayersObama likes to pretend that hes doing this for the greater good of America but the truth is its just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the groundSource End the Fed More from Breitbart Schweizer Obamas DOJ Transferring Money to Leftwing Groups to Influence This Election By John HaywardOn Wednesdays edition of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM  Clinton Cash author and Government Accountability Institute GAI President Peter Schweizer discussed the latest GAI report about the Obama Justice Departments funneling of money to leftwing groups using fines levied against financial institutions Breitbart EditorinChief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described the report as exposing the Justice Department of quite literally extorting companies to fund leftwing activistsWhen I first joined Breitbart Schweizer recalled There was a scandal called Pigford where the federal government was basically taking taxpayer money and giving it to people who were claiming to be victims who were not victims and giving them billions of dollars This is in that traditionHe explainedWhats really happening here is simple Youve got large financial institutions on Wall Street youve got banks like Bank of America who have in some cases committed financial crimes I think some of them are real some of them may not be but set that aside for a minute The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said You committed these offenses youve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars Okay they committed the crime they ought to pay thatNow ostensibly that money those billions of dollars are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes If your Wall Street broker committed fraud youre supposed to be made whole with this money and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayersThe problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than 650 million to leftwing groups They do it under the guise of Well you know if this bank discriminated against lenders racially were going to give this money to these leftwing quoteunquote housing groups to help deal with the problemBut thats not whats going on These housing groups are advocacy groups Theyre leftwing organizations They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth And they specifically target what they call quoteunquote progressive votersSo this is taking the Department of Justice which weve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to leftwing groups  in an effort frankly I think to influence this electionBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 600 am to 900 am
