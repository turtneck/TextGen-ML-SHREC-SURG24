If Donald Trump secures the Republican presidential nomination he would start the general election campaign as the leastpopular candidate to represent either party in modern timesThreequarters of women view him unfavorably So do nearly twothirds of independents 80 percent of young adults 85 percent of Hispanics and nearly half of Republicans and Republicanleaning independentsThose findings tallied from Washington PostABC News polling fuel Trumps overall 67 percent unfavorable rating  making Trump more disliked than any majorparty nominee in the 32 years the survey has been tracking candidatesHeadtohead matchups show Hillary Clinton as well as her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders leading Trump often by double digits Even his two remaining fellow GOP contenders this week backed away from earlier promises to support the eventual nomineeAnd with each passing day Trump makes moves that add further uncertainty to his ability to pivot to the general election His defiant defense this week of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski who was charged with battery for yanking the arm of a female reporter as well as Trumps remarks Wednesday that women who get illegal abortions should be punished might play well with his followers but could further alienate the broader electorateNormally when youre in a hole the best advice is to stop digging That doesnt appear to be his inclination GOP strategist David Carney said Its like taking a wagon full of nitroglycerine across the prairie Its great if you get to the mountains and blow them up for gold But its pretty unpredictablePeter Hart a veteran Democratic pollster who has studied public impressions of Trump said voters views of him are exceptionally rancidIn terms of any domestic personality that we have measured weve never seen an individual with a higher negative Hart saidTrump has drawn huge crowds and built a passionate base of supporters who have helped him amass a big delegate lead in the battle for the nominationBut his success among a segment of the Republican electorate stands in contrast to his weaknesses in a general election decided by all votersIn that broader context his dismal standing by all traditional measures points to a big question underlying his nontraditional candidacy whether Trump as the GOP nominee could leverage his celebrity persona and unusual appeal among disaffected voters in both parties to overcome his glaring disadvantagesTrumps unpopularity in the PostABC poll was driven in part by sharply negative ratings from Democrats and lukewarm Republicans The greatest risk for his general election viability stems from the unusually poor ratings he gets from swingvoting independents and white college graduatesA silver lining for Trump is that voters overall also feel antipathy for Clinton the Democratic frontrunner The distaste for Clinton is not as strong as it is for Trump  52 percent of voters see her unfavorably  but Clintons vulnerabilities combined with Trumps unpredictability haunt many DemocratsGuy Cecil chief strategist for the proClinton super PAC Priorities USA urged Democrats to postpone the tickertape parade warning that Trump is not as weak a general election candidate as the current atmosphere would suggestI am skeptical of the polls showing such large leads and its incumbent upon us to view this as a close race Cecil said Hes going to attempt to throw everything including the kitchen sink and maybe the refrigerator and stove at Hillary And I would not be surprised if he changes his views on policy issuesOvercoming his hurdles likely would require either a massive influx of workingclass white male voters  Trumps base  or dramatic changes in his policies and presentation that might reverse the strongly negative views of him held by women and minoritiesTrump and his advisers say they have plans to accomplish both objectives They say he can reverse his favorability ratings over time by framing the fall contest around issues on which they think Trumps positions resonate powerfully across traditional demographics the economy trade and national securitySince Trump is not tethered to any particular ideology his test may be convincing voters that he is not a hostile force and is fit to be president rather than persuading them to buy into a sweeping conservative ideological projectThe Trump team insists that the power of his personality and the potency of his planned attacks on Clinton would win him converts And it is wagering that millions of workingclass voters who for a generation have been politically dormant will rush to the polls and offset Trumps sizable deficit with the ascendant electorate of women minority and young votersWhat youll find is across the board in states like Pennsylvania or New York or New Jersey or Michigan youre going to have a bunch of bluecollar workers who have supported Trump in the past and will continue to do so Lewandowski said That broad appeal allows him to expand the electoral mapConcerned about his standing in the polls Trumps allies are offering advice about how to make up ground with important demographic groupsNewt Gingrich a former Republican House speaker who is unaffiliated but has informally counseled Trump on several occasions suggested he campaign in black neighborhoods send targeted messages on social media and embrace his outsider approach to governmentImagine Trump on the South Side of Chicago saying People shouldnt be killed schools ought to actually work you ought to have jobs in your neighborhood and you know that Hillary cant deliver any of those because she is the system Gingrich saidThe shift from a primary fight to the general campaign would be Trumps crucible requiring him to communicate persuasively with an entirely different electorate than the primary voters he has courted for the past yearBen Carson the retired neurosurgeon who endorsed Trump after dropping out of the Republican presidential race said he has advised Trump to turn his attention to education reform and charter schools as a means of supplementing his core pitch on trade and immigration to grow his support with young and minority votersCreating ladders of opportunity such as school choice is one way to do that Carson said Hes been very enthusiastic about that suggestion Hell have to follow through and get through to those kids and families who dont feel like theyre getting the best possible educationThere are stylistic changes Trump can make as well Carson said A little humility would go a tremendous distance no question about it he said Hopefully he will find that on his ownFrank Luntz an unaligned GOP pollster said Trump could erase at least some his deficit if he capitalizes on the fall debates and other events noting that history is littered with examples of candidates doing just thatThe big moments cause people to change Luntz said And lets face it we may have a moment outside of conventions and debates thats even bigger If you have a Paris or a Brussels on American soil that can completely change the dynamicIt is a tall order however for Trump to undo the damage his rhetoric has already done to his image with the rising national electorate that includes Latinos single mothers and millennialsDonald Trumps whole message is somewhat backward looking said Kristen Soltis Anderson a Republican pollster who wrote a book The Selfie Vote about these votersReferring to Trumps slogan she added Make America Great Again sounds like an attempt to turn back the clock to a time most young voters dont rememberPennsylvania a Democratleaning battleground that Trump hopes to target is a case study of Trumps upside and downside While he has picked up endorsements and bluecollar support in the states industrial regions centrist Republicans from Philadelphia and its voterich suburbs have kept their distance Trump needs to make inroads to win a state Republicans last carried in 1988Ticketsplitting Republicans in the Philadelphia suburbs went for President Obama  and if they dont feel comfortable with Trump they could go for Clinton said G Terry Madonna a professor at Franklin  Marshall College which conducts polling in PennsylvaniaMadonna said that more than 120000 voters statewide mostly Democrats and independents have switched their registration to Republican since January But he cautioned against interpreting the moves as a Rust Belt tilt toward TrumpEven if these children of Reagan Democrats love his talk about manufacturing and American pride hes going to have to make sure hes not losing the Republicans who are the heart of the party said John Brabender a GOP strategist who has guided the political career of former senator Rick Santorum RPa That will require a campaign of surgical precision
