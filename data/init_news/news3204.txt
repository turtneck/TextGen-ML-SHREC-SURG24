On the evening of Oct 7 after the grabthembythepussy tape had been reverberating for a few hours I tweeted that The next polls from Utah should be interesting And holy mother of God are theyA Y2 Analytics poll of 500 likely Utah voters from Oct 1011 was published this morning and the results are the craziest numbers Ive seen in an already unfathomable election year Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied at 26 percent independent conservative Evan McMullin is closing fast at 22 percent Gary Johnson is at 14 and Jill Steins at 1 This in a state where Mitt Romney received 73 percent of the vote in 2012 and which Republicans have won since 1976 by an average of 36 percentage pointsThis is Y2 Analytics first Utah poll this year so we dont have a clean beforeandafter comparison yet As I mentioned in the bottom of this Saturday post about the Mormonled Republican defection from Trump two of only three previous Utah polls that included McMullin looked like thisSo as I pointed out in August Trump was already in an unprecedentedly weak position in the Beehive State before this latest evidence of his moral vulgarity surfaced Now Mormons who make up an estimated 55 percent of Utahs population look poised to run screaming from the Republican Partys standardbearer The Y2 survey found that a whopping 94 percent of respondents were aware of Trumps sexbragging tape and that McMullina Utah native Brigham Young University grad and Mormonwas competitive despite only 52 percent being aware enough of him to form an opinion In addition according to the Deseret News writeup McMullin soundly beats Trump among those in the poll who identified themselves members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday SaintsThe campaigns of both McMullin and Johnson are based in Utah so this poll will intensify what was already a top regional priority for both The JohnsonBill Weld shop started its latest fundraising pitch yesterday like so A realistic analysis of polling data across the country shows that Governors Johnson and Weld can win 5 or more states by focusing resources in these key purple statesJohnson is on the ballot in all 50 states plus Washington DC McMullin is on just 11 compared to Darrell Castles 24 and Rocky De La Feuntes 20 In most of those states McMullin isnt making much of a measurable dentin Virginia this week for example he recently registered at 1 percent compared to Johnsons 7 But its also true that his name doesnt always appear on polls and that many of his states are underpolled to begin with I would expect him to pull some votes in Idaho a safely Republican state with the secondlargest concentration of Mormons plus Colorado and New Mexico each of which feature 2 percent Mormon populations and are easily reachable from the Salt Lake media marketGary Johnson meanwhile looks to be most competitive in his home base of New Mexico where a recent poll had him at 24 percent plus thirdpartyfriendly Alaska where a recent preTrumptape poll had him at 18 percent He was also beating the spread between Clinton and Trump in 18 states last time I ran the numbersIf either Johnson or McMullin win a state outright it would mark the first such success by a thirdparty presidential candidate since George Wallace won five in 1968 With Clintons lead widening over Trump of late the drama of such a milestone would lessen But it would be a huge deal either for a Libertarian Party attempting to cement its status as the third alternative in American politics or for NeverTrump conservatives looking to build from the wreckage of a selfdamaging election There is no doubt that the LP will win the overall bronze in the popular vote but will the conservative alternative sneak past in the Electoral College The answer to that question will give us some interesting clues about what postTrump politics will look like in America
