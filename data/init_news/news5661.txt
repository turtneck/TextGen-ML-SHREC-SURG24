By Dr MercolaAs noted at the very beginning of this 26minute health documentary by juicing expert Jason Vale More people die from chronic diseases than all other causes put togetherThis is a remarkable state of affairs when you consider that the human body is actually designed to maintain healthy homeostasis given half a chanceWhats worse chronic diseases strike the very young as well as the very old Children are now developing diseases previously relegated to seniors such as type 2 diabetes  fatty liver heart disease and even cancerToxicity appears to be a major factor driving this burgeoning wave of chronic disease Toxins are in our food in our water and air in the medications we take in the products we use each day to clean ourselves and our homes theyre in beauty products and our furnishings and building materialsAll chronic diseases are caused by two and only two major problems Charlotte Gerson founder of the Gerson Institute says  Toxicity and deficiency TOXICITY AND DEFICIENCY ARE CORE PROBLEMS According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS PREVENTABLE chronic diseases are now the worlds biggest killers And the combination of eating nutrientdeficient foods and being overexposed to toxins is at the core of our current health crisisThe answer to this dilemma is certainly not to take medication to mask the symptoms of toxicity and deficiency The solution is to remove toxins clean up your system and increase the nutrient density of your healthy foodPlants  fruits berries and vegetables  are live foods Provided theyve not been severely processed or are eaten in excess and out of season Ideally the best time to eat fruit is in the summer when you have plenty of exposure to sunshine and can tolerate higher net carbsThey contain many phytochemicals your body can use to heal and nourish your cells The appeal of juicing is that you can consume more nutrientdense vegetables than when you eat them whole or Vita Mix them in a blenderThis allows you to consume far greater amounts of vegetable nutrients than you would normally be able to eat whole or blended with the fiberJUICING IS A GREAT WAY TO BOOST NUTRIENT INTAKE Some will argue that consuming more veggies than you could normally chew through is unnecessary but when you consider how nutrient levels in most foods have dramatically decreased since the introduction of mechanized farming in 1925 juicing really makes senseHealthy soils contain a huge diversity of microorganisms and it is these organisms that are responsible for the plants nutrient uptake health and the stability of the entire ecosystemThe widescale adoption of industrial farming practices has decimated soil microbes responsible for transferring these minerals to the plants and synthetic chemicals sprayed on the crops have further destroyed overall soil qualityFor example as explained by research scientist August Dunning  chief science officer and coowner of Eco Organics in order to receive the same amount of iron you used to get from one apple in 1950 today youd have to eat 36 applesHow could you possibly get 36 apples into you Even with juicing that would be a remarkable feat and would likely overload you with natural sugars as well so I wouldnt recommend itMy point is that even when juicing you may not get the same amount of nutrients our ancestors used to get from even a fraction of the foods they ate so youre unlikely to get superfluous amounts of nutrients by regularly drinking fresh vegetable juicesWhen you drink fresh live juice its almost like receiving an intravenous infusion of vitamins minerals and enzymes because they go straight into your body without needing to be broken down Since juicing is essentially mainlining live nutrients its no surprise it can produce rapid and profound health benefitsFOOD ADDICTION IS A PROFIT CENTER Theres a conscious effort on behalf of food manufacturers to get you addicted to foods that are convenient and inexpensive to make This system is detailed in investigative reporter Michael Moss book  Salt Sugar Fat   the top three substances that make processed foods so addictiveOne of the guiding principles for the processed food industry is known as sensoryspecific satiety Moss describes this as the tendency for big distinct flavors to overwhelm your brain which responds by depressing your desire to have moreThe greatest successes whether beverages or foods owe their craveability to complex formulas that pique your taste buds just enough without overwhelming them thereby overriding your brains inclination to say enoughVanishing calorie density is another term used to describe foods that melt in your mouth which has the effect of making your brain think it doesnt contain any calories As a result you keep eatingIn short as noted in the film the big food companies are manipulating our food so that we keep eating more and more and more And as stated by Cherie Calbom also known as The Juice Lady Its corn and soy and wheat and sugar and salt and chemicals  thats primarily what people are eatingSo is it really any wonder that so many are so sick and overweight Many health authorities make it seem as the obesity epidemic is a great mystery and largely blame it on laziness If only people exercised more theyd be fine the reasoning goesBut this simply isnt true and by sweeping the proverbial elephant under the rug and ignoring the fact that our food supply is the problem these authorities have done us all a shameful disserviceRemember it really isnt about calories it is about insulin resistance And processed foods sugars and high net carb foods will make it virtually impossible to normalize your metabolism and get leanMODERN MEDICINE IS ANOTHER PROFIT CENTER Many times even severe health problems have simple fixes For example in the film Vale whos also the author of The Juice Detox Diet explains that what prompted him to try juicing in the first place was a severe case of psoriasis  an autoimmune disease that causes cells to build up on the surface of your skin leading to thick unsightly scaly patches that are very itchy and often painfulHe also had eczema and severe hay fever and asthma For years he used steroid tablets and various inhalers to manage his symptoms but he wasnt getting any better Not once did anyone look at what might be causing the problems they only wanted to treat the symptoms he saidThe turning point came when one of his doctors suggested a coaltar treatment for his psoriasis Hed be slathered in coaltar the same gooey tar placed on roadways and covered in bandages for six weeks The idea of resorting to such a bizarre and clearly toxic intervention was the final straw Theres GOT to be another way he thoughtIndeed toxicity and a narrow focus on managing symptoms  not actually addressing the root problem which might result in a full remission or cure  are hallmarks of modern medicine This mode of operation has turned healthcare into a massive forprofit business that has become increasingly reluctant to embrace strategies that might actually remove an individual from the paying patient poolThis is tragic since research exists showing that raising your vitamin D level for example can help heal psoriasis especially if youre vitamin D deficient Vitamin D supplements are very inexpensive and if you optimize your level by getting regular and sensible sun exposure which is the preferred and ideal way its free provided you live in a sunny area and dont use a therapeutic sunbedIn Vales case juicing was the answer and he no longer suffers from any of his previous problems His asthma completely vanished within a month and his skin gradually cleared up until there was not a trace of psoriasis or eczema left His weight also dropped at a rate I didnt think was humanly possible he says As noted by Dr Dwight Lundell author of The Cure for Heart Disease who is featured in the filmNot one single person will be cured of heart disease pulmonary disease stroke arthritis obesity and of course diabetes with our current medical approach INFLAMMATION IS THE DRIVING MECHANISM BEHIND MOST CHRONIC DISEASE Toxicity nutrient deficiencies  processed foods sugar and excess net carbs promote inflammation and chronic inflammation is a hallmark of virtually every chronic disease there is When your inflammation levels are low its very difficult for disease to take root When healthy your body is simply too wellequipped to address foreign invaders and can easily clean out minor toxic exposuresAs noted by Lundell when we investigate what were doing differently today when inflammation levels are high compared to decades past when chronic disease rates were much lower the main difference we find is the foods we eatWeve gotten away from eating fresh whole foods most of which come from the plant kingdom and most of what we eat are processed foods laced with a myriad of chemicals that were never in our food supply before In my opinion this dietary change is the cause of most chronic diseases he saysIt may appear as though all these different chronic diseases are very different and therefore would have different causes But these variations are deceiving In the vast majority of cases the root problem can be narrowed down to inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by toxicity and insufficient amounts of building blocks nutrients to maintain optimal biological function The differences in manifestation primarily relate to individual weaknessesIt just stands to reason and common sense that if the vast majority of those diseases are caused by diet and lifestyle then the simple answer surely is to change the diet and lifestyle and theyll just get better Vale saysCalbom adds We should be juicing because so many people have impaired digestive tracts and digestion is impaired because of the diet weve been on Along come your beautiful juices they go right into your intestinal tract and those nutrients get absorbed into your system Theyre going right to work within about 20 or 30 minutes Theyre there feeding your body rejuvenating giving you energy giving your body life This is why you should juice  Juice every day this has got to be a way of life because thats when youre going to notice your life changing EAT LOW HUMAN INTERVENTION FOODS Vale wisely suggests that if a food has a label it probably shouldnt be in your diet What youre really looking for is real food or what he calls low human intervention foods meaning foods that has passed through as few human hands and processes as possible Ideally you would be growing your own food and eating out of your gardenIn the summer the majority of my main meal comes from my garden sunflower spouts red bell peppers oregano rosemary turmeric and spinach If you are unable to grow your own your next best bet would be to get locally grown organic produce that has not been waxed cut up or processed in any wayWhen you look at the fact that the food you eat really creates the life that you live everything starts to change Philip McCluskey author of Weight Loss Blueprint saysSUPERJUICING FOR 28 DAYS CURED DIABETES AND CHRONIC PAIN In a previous documentary Vale recruited eight people who collectively suffered from 22 different chronic diseases and put them on a juiceonly diet for 28 days plus exercise in order to explore juicings potential benefits for reversing chronic disease He filmed their experience which resulted in the documentary Super Juice Me which Ive included above for your convenienceThe health improvements seen by those eight individuals are nothing short of astounding Every participant felt energized and lost weight and most reported a drastic reduction in their symptoms and the number of medications they needed to use One man completely resolved his diabetes in those 28 days A woman went from years of chronic pain to being completely painfree and others suffering from asthma colitis and sleep apnea enjoyed a profound reduction in symptomsIt was not an easy journey as several experienced detoxification reactions food cravings and for some a temporary increase in symptoms as their bodies began to purge toxins theyd accumulated but those reactions were relatively shortlived and they felt immensely better on the other side  better than theyd felt in yearsTHE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS OF JUICING There are many reasons to consider incorporating vegetable juicing into your health plan Whether you use it as an occasional cleanse or as the start of every morning juicingHelps you absorb all the nutrients from your vegetables This is important because most people have impaired digestion as a result of making lessthanoptimal food choices over many years which limits your bodys ability to absorb all of the nutrients in whole raw vegetables Juicing helps predigest them so you wont lose any of this valuable nutrition Makes it easier to consume a large quantity of vegetables Virtually every health authority recommends that you get six to eight servings of vegetables and fruits per day but very few actually get that Juicing virtually guarantees youll reach your daily target Makes it easier to get a wider variety of vegetables into your diet Juicing greatly expands the number of different phytochemicals you receive as each vegetable offers unique benefits Juicing also allows you to consume vegetables that you may not normally enjoy eating whole Boosts your immune system Raw juice supercharges your immune system with concentrated phytochemicals and biophotonic light energy which can revitalize your body The nutrients in fresh juice also feed your bodys good bacteria and help suppress potentially pathogenic ones Increases your energy When your blood is flooded with nutrients and your bodys pH is optimized youll feel energized Since juice is absorbed and utilized by your body very rapidly juicers report feeling an almost instantaneous kick of energy Supports your brain In the Kame Project 1 people who consumed juice more than three times per week were 76 percent less likely to develop Alzheimers disease than those who consumed juice less than once a week Provides structured water Vegetable juice is one of the purest sources of water and actually qualifies as water Vegetable water is structured water living water which is different from regular water  H3O2 rather than H2O Water from vegetables is the best quality water you can drinkOn a side note sun exposure is also important for structuring the water in your cells Part of the energy your body requires can actually be obtained from sunlight but you must expose your skin directly to it The ultraviolet UV radiation increases nitric oxide NO release which can direct more than half your blood flow to your skin Once your blood is exposed to the sun it can absorb UV and infrared radiation which help to structure the water in your cells and energize your mitochondria  Download Interview Transcript Keep in mind your juices should consist mostly of green vegetables Youll want to minimize fruits in order to keep the fructose and net carb content low The bulk of your juice should come from organic green veggies Spinach celery kale and Swiss chard are common juicing staplesIf youre new to juicing you can start with more mildtasting veggies like celery and cucumbers From there you can work your way up to red leaf lettuce romaine spinach and escarole along with parsley and cilantro Kale collard dandelion mustard and other greens can be bitter so youll want to start slowly and add just a few leaves at a timeSome of the most nutrientdense veggies are the strongest tasting but dont avoid them Just use a lesser quantity in your juice until your taste buds acclimate Selecting organic nonGMO produce is very important when juicing but the price can be a challenge for some One alternative is to grow your own making sure to avoid toxic garden chemicals synthetic herbicides pesticides and fertilizersIf youre using nonorganic vegetables your best bet is to peel them to avoid juicing pesticide residues This is particularly important for fruits and vegetables that have been waxed as this seals in the chemicals It can be difficult to discern if a vegetable has been waxed or not because the wax can be applied in a very thin transparent layerBeware that even organic produce sold in grocery chain stores will typically be waxed For unwaxed fruit and vegetables you typically have to get them from a local sourceTIPS THAT CAN MAKE YOUR VEGGIE JUICE MORE PALATABLE If youre not used to eating a lot of vegetables the taste may take a little while to get used to A great trick to make your juice more palatable especially in the beginning is to add one or more of these elementsLimes and lemons You can add one half to a whole lime or lemon for every quart of juice Limes are my favorite for cutting bitter flavors Cranberries You can also add some cranberries if you enjoy them Limit the cranberries to about 4 ounces per pint of juice Fresh ginger  This is an excellent addition if you enjoy the taste It gives your juice a spicy kick Limited amounts of apple and carrot just be mindful of your overall sugar content HOW TO MANAGE CRAVINGS AND DETOX SYMPTOMS Changing your diet or any other aspect of your lifestyle is sometimes stressful and stress can sabotage your success As some of the people in Vales superjuicing experiment discovered you might feel a little worse before you feel better as detox symptoms and food cravings can arise Addressing your emotional and mental health is a very important aspect of total body health so please do not ignore stressThe Emotional Freedom Techniques EFT can be helpful when anxieties strike including emotional struggles surrounding dietary changes In fact its one of the most powerful tools for reducing stress and anxiety that I know of In 2012 a triple blind study 2 found that EFT reduced cortisol levels and symptoms of psychological distress by 24 percent more than any other intervention testedIf you worry that you wont be able to get the juice down or you wont take the time to do it or your food cravings will be unbearable EFT may be able to help The first couple weeks of a new eating routine are typically the most challenging while your body is making the necessary biochemical adjustments Tapping can be extraordinarily beneficial for reducing anxiety cravings and detox symptoms during this timeEFT is easy to learn and once you do its always at your fingertips whenever and wherever you need it You can even adapt this intermittent fasting EFT video by Julie Schiffman for juice fasting Just as juicing helps reduce your bodys toxic burden you can think of EFT as detoxification for your mind By combining the two your healing will have the greatest chance of successSource Mercola
