Monica CamachoPerez came to the United States from Mexico as a child crossing into Arizona with her mother in the same spot where her father made the trip before them Nobody stopped us CamachoPerez now 20 said of her 2002 journeyThree years ago her uncle tried to cross the border and join the family in Baltimore where they remain illegal immigrants He was stopped three times by the US Border Patrol and jailed for 50daysHe doesnt want to try anymore said CamachoPerez Now its really hardAs the Department of Homeland Security continues to pour money into border security evidence is emerging that illegal immigration flows have fallen to their lowest level in at least two decades The nations population of illegal immigrants which more than tripled to 122million between 1990 and 2007 has dropped by about 1million according to demographers at the Pew Research CenterA key  but largely overlooked  sign of these ebbing flows is the changing makeup of the undocumented population Until recent years illegal immigrants tended to be young men streaming across the Southern border in pursuit of work But demographic data show that the typical illegal immigrant now is much more likely someone who is 35 or older and has lived in the United States for a decade or moreHomeland security officials in the Obama and George W Bush administrations  who have more than doubled the Border Patrols size and spent billions on drones sensors and other technology at the border  say enhanced security is driving the new trendsWe have seen tremendous progress said R Gil Kerlikowske commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection which is part of the Department of Homeland Security The border is much more secure than in times pastThe issue of border security is central to the broader debate over immigration reform that has roiled Washington in recent years and is emerging as a flash point in the 2016 presidential campaign Congressional Republicans have insisted on greater border security before they consider legalizing any immigrants who came to this country without proper documentsPresident Obama says the border has never been more secure and is urging a series of legislative steps to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants streamline the visa system and further fortify the border He has already moved to protect certain undocumented immigrants from deportation through executive actions But these actions have faced resistance in the courts including the decision Tuesday by a federal appeals court to keep one of the presidents signature immigration efforts from moving aheadWhats increasingly clear is that the shifting fortunes of the US economy account for less of the ebb and flow of illegal immigration Even as the economy bounces back from recession illegal immigration flows especially from Mexico have kept declining according to researchers and government data Since the 1990s the opposite was true The better the economy the more people tried to comeEvery month or quarter that the economy continues to improve and unauthorized immigration doesnt pick up supports the theory that border security is a bigger factor and its less about the economy and we have moved into a new era said Marc Rosenblum deputy director of the US immigration program at the Migration Policy InstituteSome researchers say factors other than security are playing a role and might even account for much of the reduced flow of illegal immigrants These researchers point for instance to changes in Latin America that could be pushing fewer people to seek a better life in the United StatesAt odds with the governments claims of success a series of academic studies in recent years have found little linkage between border security and illegal migrationDouglas S Massey a Princeton University sociologist said the falling numbers of immigrants have nothing to do with border enforcement Massey who helps run a project that has interviewed thousands of illegal Mexican migrants over the past three decades attributed the trend to demographic changes in Mexico such as women having fewer childrenBut even some researchers who are skeptical about the overall effectiveness of enhanced border security acknowledge indirect effects of these measures For potential migrants who are calculating the pros and cons of trying to cross the border stiffer US security measures are making the trip much more expensive in particular the exploding cost of hiring a guide The journey has also become more arduous and dangerous in part because the DHS has plugged traditional crossing points and driven migrants deeper into the desertSince the Bush administration the DHS has dramatically increased its efforts to lock down the southwest border The budget for Customs and Border Protection has grown to 107billion in the past decade a 75percent increase The number of Border Patrol agents at the border has nearly doubled over the past decade to more than 18000 todayMuch of the rampup occurred during the Bush administration but the Obama administration has marshaled more forces as well Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has recently set up three task forces to increase coordination within the DHSCurrent and former DHS officials acknowledge that a confluence of factors explains the decline in illegal migration including demographic changes in Mexico improvements in its economy and Mexicos crackdown on Central American migrants headed to the United States But these officials insist that the massive investment to secure the border has been the key factorIt used to be that you could literally sit at a bar in Tijuana Mexico look across the border into San Diego wait for the Border Patrol to drive in the other direction and make a run for it said Steve Atkiss a former CBP chief of staff and now a partner at Command Consulting Group Its much more difficult and expensive nowMadai Ledezma crossed the Mexican border into Texas a decade ago at age 23 and remains in the United States as an illegal immigrant She said her uncle and brother had recently wanted to join her But she said theyre staying put after her uncle was caught by the Border Patrol a year ago and locked up for a month before being sent back to MexicoThe risk of crossing again is that he will be locked up again Ledezma said She added I just heard recently that the Border Patrol now has the ability to fire their weaponsLedezmas uncle was one of a shrinking number of undocumented immigrants stopped by the Border Patrol Government officials widely cite that trend as evidence that the overall flow is also downIn 2000 considered the peak of the flood of illegal Mexican migration more than 16million people were apprehended according to DHS data Those numbers have plunged to around 400000 per year since 2012 and are down 28percent in the first part of fiscal 2015 compared with last year Even last years widely publicized spike in unaccompanied minors crossing the border from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras has receded dramatically the data showWhile the declining number of apprehensions is not conclusive proof that illegal immigration is down other less publicized research strongly suggests this is the caseWayne Cornelius director of the Mexican migration field research program at the University of California at San Diego interviews hundreds of people each year in the Mexican state of Yucatan and asks them whether they are planning to come to the United States in the next 12monthsIn 2006 24percent said yes By 2009 as the US economy was cratering 8percent said yes This year 25percent answered in the affirmativeA recent study by the Pew Research Center meanwhile found that the median length of stay for illegal immigrants in the United States jumped from less than eight years in 2003 to nearly 13 years by 2013 Their median age has increased from 28 during the 1990s to nearly 36 todayThose figures wouldnt be possible if young men were still coming across the border in huge numbers and it was those young men who accounted for most of the illegal trafficBut Massey the Princeton researcher highlighted an unintended consequence of the security crackdown on the border He said immigrants who are already in the United States are afraid to go back and forth to Mexico as they traditionally did and are aging in place in the United StatesLedezmas tale is a common one Over the past decade she and her husband Jose Pina a landscaper have become involved in their community in New Carrollton Their daughter Heather 6 is a US citizen Ledezma volunteers at Heathers school reads with her at the public library and attends a local churchAfter so many years of living here I of course consider this my home she saidAccording to estimates by the Migration Policy Institute about a third of illegal immigrants own a home and have children who are US citizensWe have this population here and they havent left and they dont appear to be going back and forth to Mexico anymore said George Escobar senior director of human services for CASA a Marylandbased immigrant advocacy group These trends have reshaped the immigration debate right before our eyes
