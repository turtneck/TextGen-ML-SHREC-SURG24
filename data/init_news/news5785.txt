The popular conservative argument that George W Bush kept us safe from terrorism has always been somewhat undermined by the fact that the vast majority of domestic terrorism deaths in American history occurred while Bush was in office But it turns out that it took Donald Trump to offer an argument that Democratshave always shied away fromtelling Bloomberg TVWhen you talk about George Bush I mean say what you want the World Trade Center came down during his timeAs phrased by Trump the argument is provocative to the point of poor taste but in attempting to rebut it Jeb Bush went and made exactly the explicit claim that the doctrine of Bush kept us safe has always avoided  that the period of time during which Bush kept us safe includes 911 itselfPreJeb nobody made the argument in that way because its obviously ridiculousInstead keptussafeism has tended to indulge in the fantasy that Bush was inaugurated in midSeptember 2001 rather than early late January Through this metaphysical sleight of hand the events of 911 themselves neither refute nor bolster the notion that the Bush years were a time of safety With his clumsy effort to parry Trump however Jeb has given away the whole gameAfter all we clearly were not safe on 911
