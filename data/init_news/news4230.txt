Less than a month from Election Day Donald Trump is behind by double digits in the polls Its clear his campaign needs to do everything it can to get out the voteIts also clear that Trump does not have a normal campaign it is small apparently disorganized and compared with Hillary Clintons operation woefully behind in conventional campaign tactics Trump is notably laggingIn September his then newly appointed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said it was her intention to overhaul the campaigns ground game tactics Mr Trump is an unconventional candidate but I have an appreciation for  conventional tactics Conway said according to CNN Weve got to invest in the fundamentals  Do I wish these things had been done before Sure But were trying to accelerate it and not abandon itBut is it too late Even if the Trump campaign has been building up his operation since September it is irrefutable that Clintons campaign has invested more resources for much longerTo ask I called up Rasmus Kleis Nielsen the director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and the author of Ground Wars Personalized Communication in Political Campaigns a study of the resurgence of ground game in American politics As the forms of political communication popular in the 1990s  like dominating the mainstream media and using political advertising  have become diluted Nielsen makes the case that personalized political communication with staffers and volunteers talking to voters on the ground is an increasingly impactful arm of competitive political campaignsHis insight on the 2016 election Trump certainly didnt do himself any favors by deprioritizing his ground game and that could have adverse effects on the Republican Party in the futureA lightly edited transcript of our conversation followsWe have one candidate Hillary Clinton who is running close to a textbook campaign Then you have Trump who is only now with his most recent hires in Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Bannon building some ground game Its not nothing but its still minuscule compared to Clintons operation How unprecedented is this imbalanceWe have probably not seen this kind of imbalance since the 70s The closest historical analogy is the George McGovernNixon race  where you have one candidate who is clearly in the mainstream of his party and has the support of the conventional funders activists and the party organization and you have another candidate who is a very polarizing figure with strong support from a subset of the party but whom many from the mainstream of the party regard with great skepticismI live in Europe now and we have more experience in Europe than Americans with political candidates that are seen as extreme by much of the establishment but actually do much better with the electorate than worthy observers expect them to do I think we have seen many of the same tendencies  that if people do not expect you to be very measured and controlled and on message all the time they never expect that of you Donald Trumps campaign has understood that he is not held to those campaign standards and that gives him room to maneuver That is very very different for Hillary ClintonIn your writings about the history of ground game you call this era the resurgence of the ground war Does Donald Trumps approach  focusing on media messaging  shift that trend backI dont think the resurgence is shifting at all If Hillary Clintons campaign were prioritizing other forms of campaign communication that would really signify a large structural and pragmatic shift of how campaigns think about strategic communication But Donald Trumps campaign is as unusual as he is as a candidate I think we know for sure that had the candidate from the Republican Party been Scott Walker or Jeb Bush then the Republican Party would try to operate in the same way that the Hillary Clinton campaign is operatingFair enough Does this punch any holes in how we think about how effective or imperative having a ground game is There have been times this election cycle where you could argue Clinton wasnt doing as well as she would like even having such a robust ground operationWell I would push back against that in two ways A lot of political science work that would try to estimate the likely outcome of this presidential election on the basis of fundamentals  economic fundamentals and what we know from history on the relative advantage of incumbency versus being a challenger  would actually suggest that this very well could be a Republican year Compared to that baseline Mr Trump is not doing as wellWhat is important to realize is that one can be competitive in many different ways One way to be competitive is to do things by the book Another way to be competitive is to offer something completely new that some people find attractive and seems to be the approach of Mr TrumpSo is the point here that for Clinton ground game is important but Donald Trump doesnt seem to need itI think there is no question that Donald Trump would be more competitive if they had a better ground gameLet me frame this in another way Past research says ground game can improve a candidates odds by 1 to 5 percentage points Given the truly abnormal nature of this campaign how would you go about studying the effects of ground game in this electionThe disadvantage of the Trump campaign is in its ability to turn out voters  we will only know after Election Day how significant that advantage is when we see the difference between the polls and the actual outcomeYou can think of turning out voters in two different ways One is to say that you turn them out by making sure they do not forget they are registered to vote they send in their early ballots when possible and on and on All the things that ground operations are mostly focused on the nuts and bolts of turning out the voteAnother way to turn out your supporters is to ratchet up the intensity of the choice they face If you can convince large parts of the public that this is a defining moment in political history and if you dont get out and vote for your candidate things will go very badly thats another way to turn out the vote That doesnt rely on a ground game and it is relatively clear that the Trump campaign relied on the second version It was messagedriven and not driven by a ground gamePersonally I think it is very unlikely that that alone will let the campaign realize its full potential They are at a significant disadvantage  but we will only know in NovemberExplain the case for investing in a ground gameOne thing that is a little bit overlooked is the extent to which building a good ground game relies on years of investment in staff but also in technology building voter databases and interfaces and making them useful in the field Its just clear not only that the Democratic Party was ahead of the Republican Party in 2012 but also that the ability of the Republican Party to narrow that gap or to overcome that gap has been significantly undermined by the fact that the party nominee has not prioritized investing and catching up hereOne side of this question of campaigning is Where do you place your bets where do you invest your money what is your messaging in terms of strategy and organizationBut you cant buy this off the shelf You cant order a good database even if you have all the money in the world You cant just go to Amazon and buy a perfect voter file and the technology to put it to use There is an important question of whether the Republican Party is falling even further behind in having an effective infrastructure for an effective ground game and a competitive ground gameSo when Kellyanne Conway admitted that the Trump campaign was behind in building a ground game but that they werent going to give up youre saying the damage has been doneThe damage is done You cant unfurl a cuttingedge ground operation in such a short period of time There is no question about that That is simply impossible You can always invest and always improve but you cant possibly put together the kind of operation or the kind of infrastructure that it would require to have a fully competitive organizationThe fundamental issue here is that when you think about American political parties there is no centralized decisionmaking The only time you have that is when you have an incumbent president who will run for reelectionWe saw this very clearly in the 2000s George W Bushs presidential campaign in 2004 was the most sophisticated wellorganized and professional campaign in a long time It was an extraordinarily wellrun and wellthoughtthrough campaign in part because they knew who the candidate was going to be They could fundraise They could invest They could collaborate with the state parties and other actors Again the 2012 Barack Obama campaign was a similar story It was a very wellrun and professionally organized and wellthoughtthrough campaign in part because of the fact that they knew who was running and they could build the organization around thatBut if you are out of power and you dont have a presumptive nominee and then you have a primary process that leads to a candidate that then is regarded with some skepticism by many of the players you need to line up  but also if that candidate in particular himself does not chose to catch up  then it becomes very difficultYou write that there is no evidence that supports the idea of a consistent decline of facetoface communication in politics That campaigns cannot rely on the media alone to do it Donald Trump is relying on the media How does that change the impact of ground game for ClintonThat only increases the importance of a good ground game for the candidates that want to run a conventional campaignMy fundamental argument in Ground Wars is that the modes of political communication that dominated in the 1990s were a heavy emphasis in controlling the mainstream media through spin and PR and heavy emphasis in television advertising focusing on voters who were unlikely to pay much attention to newspapers and television news Those dominant forms of campaign communication became weaker because fewer and fewer voters who could be persuaded could be reached through television advertisingOn one end there is a sort of engagement strategy of using social media and digital media where you engage with your core supporters in a much closer and more direct way than in the pastBut most importantly there is this investment in the much larger ground operation putting many more people  volunteers but also paid staffers  to work and relying on much much more sophisticated technology in terms of targeting those contactsCampaign advertising experts will say it is very hard to measure impact Is it the same with ground gameThere is no question that longerterm persuasion is really difficult to actually measure We know that any effect present at one point in time is very likely to decay over time People will be cultivated through a lifetime of exposure In many ways it is very artificial too  each one of us is touched by hundreds of different messages every day of a political nature Trying to isolate the effect of one individual message is almost too artificial to help us understand how any political communication worksBut ultimately in some ways ground game is a much simpler thing to understand because it is less about persuasion and more about turnout You have a very clear measure of whether people turn out or not and you have direct dataPersuasion is very hard to accomplish Motivation and activation are demonstrably doable  in particular if you have personal contacts and in particular if you have motivated volunteers going door to door
