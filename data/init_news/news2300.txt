By midmorning the line of taxpayers outside the IRS office stretched along the marble wall past the elevators and water fountain back to the metal detectors near the entrance of the Earle Cabell Federal BuildingAndrew Concha came out into the hall holding a purple sign He checked his watch  1104 am  then calculated how many people could be seen before the Taxpayer Assistance Center closed at 430 pm He placed the sign behind the 17th customer signaling to the other 30 or so in line that their chance of seeing a specialist that day was slimIm not technically turning them away yet Concha explained Im letting them know it may not be in their interest to wait three to four hours to see someoneWith Tax Day approaching it was the best the IRS could offerFive years of budget cuts by Congress have left the agency so cashstrapped that Commissioner John Koskinen doesnt bother sugarcoating the state of customer service Its abysmal he saidNationwide only 4 in 10 callers to the agencys tollfree help line are getting through to a real person The number of courtesy disconnects  a euphemism for an overloaded system hanging up on the customer  has reached 5million so far this year the agency reportedWhen callers do get a real person they can forget about asking questions that require expertise These are now considered out of scope The customerservice agents have been instructed to only tell callers what tax forms they need where to get them and where to look for online information Staff can no longer offer linebyline assistance provide guidance on tax planning or tax law or help make payment arrangementsAnd with 5000 fewer agents than four years ago to go after tax cheats officials estimate that 2 billion in revenue will go uncollectedAt the Dallas tax assistance center theres an empty space where the office printer sat before it was yanked out The maintenance contract was too expensive The shelves in the Forms Room are mostly bare The 40page P17 the bible of taxreturn preparation now costs 23 and must be ordered onlineOvercrowding at the Dallas center came to a head in February when the fire marshal showed up and notified its manager Johnny Holiday that he couldnt have customers sitting on the floor and blocking exits and walking space So now no one gets in the door unless the person has a seat in one of the 40 chairs in the waiting areaLate last month Holiday called security officers when a man lunged at an employee cursing after waiting two hours to drop off documents for an auditHoliday spends his time devising strategies to bring order to an office that this being the IRS should thrive on order Twenty minutes before the doors open at 830 am on a recent morning hes making sure that the Line Elimination Team is in place Its job is do triage on the line pulling customers out of the queue who have straightforward requests such as asking to make a payment or to get a copy of an old return Employees move along the line handing out paper tickets as at the deli counter asking customers in Spanish and in English why they are hereThis task takes three of his specialists That leaves only eight others to meet with taxpayers and answer their questionsAs money has gotten tighter the demands have grown Two years ago another walkin center in DeSoto 16 miles south of Dallas closed leaving the IRS office in the Earle Cabell building to absorb the businessWith its gray carpets dropped ceilings with fluorescent lights and keypadcoded doors five blocks from where John F Kennedy was shot the 16story building in downtown Dallas built in 1968 is a monument to a time when there was more optimism about the federal governmentSince 2010 Republicans on Capitol Hill have slashed the IRS budget by 12 billion or about 17 percent adjusting for inflation Just this fiscal year 346 million was cutBy contrast cuts across the rest of the government have been far more modest and concentrated Between 2012 and 2014 automatic spending reductions shrank nondefense spending as adjusted for inflation by 13 percent while IRS spending was chopped 56 percent according to Scott Lilly a budget expert at the Center for American ProgressEven in an era of shrinking government conservatives antipathy toward the taxcollection agency stands out It is punishment for a string of missteps an extravagant conference for employees in Anaheim Calif the targeting of conservative groups seeking tax exemptions 1 million in bonuses given to agency employees who didnt pay their federal taxesWe deliberately lowered IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what youre doing and why youre doing it Rep Ander Crenshaw RFla who chairs the House panel that sets the agencys budget said at a hearing last month The IRS he said should focus on core missions providing taxpayer servicesLeslie Paige vice president for policy and communications at Citizens Against Government Waste said every government agency could sustain deep cuts and in particular the IRSI think taxpayers and their representatives need to think long and hard about throwing more money at an agency that has proven that it persistently mismanages and wastes the money they have gotten in the past she saidAs funding has declined the agencys workload has grown The IRS is helping to administer subsidies and compliance under President Obamas healthcare law and dealing with other new wrinkles in the tax code It is also battling an epidemic of identity theft and new sophisticated cheating schemes Since the budget cuts employees have processed 11 percent more returns the IRS saidKoskinen hired to restore trust in the IRS is also looking for money to upgrade a system that still runs on COBOL the computer language that debuted half a century ago He needs more revenue agents In Dallas they only go after people whove cheated the government out of 1 million or moreAt this point it is a little frustrating when people say We keep cutting your budget so youll be more efficient Koskinen saidWhen Jerry Reed finally made it to a cubicle inside the Dallas center Andrew Concha apologized for the long wait Reed just shrugged his shouldersReeds tax return had been flagged because it reflected a refund of more than 10000 The IRS suspected that Reed was a victim of identity theft In reality Reed was due the refund because he had taken a large business loss when his consulting business failedHe tried to resolve the confusion online but couldnt figure how to proceed He called the tollfree line waited on hold for 90 minutes and hung up Then he drove to the federal building one day after work but he was too late to get a ticket In the past IRS employees would work as late as midnight during tax season but now with the elimination of overtime pay they go home at 430 pmBecause of the cuts people have really lost patience with us Concha saidIn the highrise building next door money ran out for 200 seasonal employees a full month before the April 15 deadline and they are being sent home agency officials saidThey know the minute we say Im going to have to transfer you to someone who can answer your question theyre going to be on hold for a number of hours said Donna Miller an agent working for the local chapter of the National Treasury Employees UnionJust then an announcement came over the loudspeaker inviting all employees to Room 212 at 1 pm for a retirement party for a woman named Peg Peg was not being replaced because of an IRS hiring freezeNo choice but to waitIt has fallen to Chris Caroll the operations manager to buck up his beleaguered staff Bald with a goatee he walks the seven floors of cubicles every day urging employees to email call and knock on his door if they need to talkWe knew we had to be empathetic versus the typical management style he said Yet he cannot even order them calendars calculators or rulersBack downstairs Laurence Zeigler had figured out that he wouldnt get to see anyone at the IRS on this day All he needed he said was to give them his correct address Near the exit his credentials in a faded gray folder that long ago carried his votech diploma he vented to a friendly security guardMan I just got laid off he said Its like I really need that money His 400 refund had been held up by an incomplete returnI would just call them the guard offered Waiting on hold did not sound like a great idea to ZeiglerConcha had come back out to check on the lineIf you get in this line the wait will be two hours he told an anxious woman who wanted to make sure her automated tax payment went through after her bank changed If you get inside it will be another two hoursDid you say another two hours someone called out It was Kim Garrett on her fifth visit to clear up the matter of her Social Security number which she said the IRS didnt haveYou cant call Garrett said to anyone who would listen You cant get online and you cant see anybody What are your optionsThe others in line nodded in agreement
