Leave a reply Kate Bartolotta  In this day and age where the constant use of social media demands that we label and define ourselves to others in every way possible its important to understand the true meaning and use of the word introvert A lot of people use the words introverted and shy interchangeably they dont mean the same thing As someone who works with people all the time youd think Id be an extrovert Im friendly Im not shy But when I get close to my people time limit its time to shut down be quiet and hole up with a good book I love helping people but theres a huge reason that I balance that type of work with work where I get to be quiet and dive in to working with words instead of being bombarded with interaction Its becausealthough I dont fall into some of the old stereotypesIm an introvert I spent years feeling guilty if I wanted to spend time alone instead of doing things with friends I learned to make the best of it and often pushed myself to be socialeven when it felt exhausting Many people do this as extroversion tends to be prized in our society while introversion is seen as a secondclass personality trait somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology It is none of those things Its the way an estimated twothirds to onehalf of us are wired and it can be our greatest asset As I mentioned being introverted isnt the same thing as being shy though theres nothing wrong with being shy either  Many shy people are also introverted but one doesnt really have much to do with the other The best explanation I was ever given and maybe one of the biggest aha moments of my adult life was that while extroverts are energized by connecting and spending time with others introverts need inwardfocused alone time to recharge Being introverted has nothing to do with lack of confidence Many confident people are introverted and gather their strength from the time they spend alone rather than from the input of others In some ways I believe that the ability to enjoy being by yourself says a great deal about your confidence It isnt that introverts dont like social timeits that for us social time is giving out energy rather than receiving energy A lot of us fall somewhere in the middle between the two and some interactions take more out of people than others A few things to consider if someone you care about falls more on the introverted end of the spectrum 1 Think of each of us as having a cup of energy available For introverts most social interactions take a little out of that cup instead of filling it the way it does for extroverts Most of us like it Were happy to give and love to see you When the cup is empty though we need some time to refuel We arent mad We dont stop caring about you Well be so happy to see you and talk to you again when weve had some time to decompress 2 Silence isnt a bad thing Really Its not an insult Its the introverts way of conserving energy and restoring him or herself If we can be quiet with you and you can be content being quiet with us its a huge compliment and a huge relief Other times the quiet really does need to be spent alone We come back when were ready Its worth the wait 3 Just because someone is friendly she isnt necessarily an extrovert just because someone is quiet doesnt mean hes an introvert If you pay attention to people you care about often you can see what energizes them and what drains them If you arent sure ask If you notice a friend seems wiped out ask if spending time together sounds like fun or if theyd like some down time I cant tell you how many times Ive become almost giddy because plans were cancelledeven with people I love When you know someone needs some space in order to reenergize be respectful and give it to them It isnt rejection 4 Text Write letters Email We love it There are times that you cant beat a face to face conversation Id agree 100 But for introverts sometimes being able to stay connected and stay in touch in a less intense and less draining way is a huge help Being in crowds is tough Even long conversations can be tough if were already peopled out Having the freedom to respond when we are ready is a great feeling Sometimes its right away If its not dont be offended Its not youits me Really 5 All of this really comes down to respect Each of us has our own set of boundaries our own way of communicating and our own needs When you care about someone you choose to communicate with him or her in ways that show you love and respect them If your cup is filled by lots of interaction with others go for it Be in tune with your own needs and enjoy the way that time with others energizes you If someone you love is an introvert and needs time to him or herself tune into and respect that as well We dont do activities alone because we are sad or negative or depressed we do it because thats what fills our cup back up Well be even happier to see you when we come back Kate Bartolotta One of the best things Ive read on the subject was the book Quiet The Power of Introverts by Susan Cain The shorter 12question quiz on her site can give you some good insights into your own personal introversion or extroversion that bypasses some of those long held stereotypes PS Im 12 for 12 SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality
