Libyan fighters are celebrating a major victory on Tuesday Theyve driven ISIS out of parts of Benghazi eastern Libyas largest city building on advances in and around the city on SundayISIS isnt just losing in Benghazi In its home base in Syria and Iraq its lost up to 30 percent of its territory from its peak in August 2014 And its tried expanding abroad officially declaring a wilayat  which literally means province and refers to ISISs foreign franchises  in roughly a dozen countriesThese ISIS franchises showed some initial successes for example in Libya but since mid2015 they have been struggling Many of ISISs wilayat have stopped growing and begun shrinking Some ISIS affiliates have been wiped out altogetherThe Islamic State has encountered one serious obstacle after another as it has tried to expand its presence beyond Syria and Iraq Daveed GartensteinRoss a fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and CEO of the consulting firm Valens Global writes with threat analyst Nathaniel Barr in War on the Rocks on Tuesday These stumbles have gone largely unnoticed by the international mediaGartensteinRoss and Barr examined seven ISIS expansion attempts and found that each had serious problems In every case the ISIS franchise they looked at has either suffered a major battlefield defeat had members targeted and killed in significant numbers by rival jihadist groups or was defeated outrightOverall ISIS is having significant troubles expanding Joining ISIL can be a fatal decision GartensteinRoss told me using another name for ISISThe first example he pointed to was a group called the Islamic Movement in Uzbekistan IMU IMU is a decadesold jihadist group with ties to the Taliban and alQaeda In August it formally pledged itself to ISIS working with the alreadyestablished Afghanistanbased ISIS franchiseOver the course of the next several months the Taliban once IMUs ally sought out and killed IMU fighters in a targeted campaign aimed at destroying the group This culminated in a November purge wherein the Taliban killed 100 IMU fighters and allegedly captured its leader wiping out the group entirelyWhat America and its agents could not do in 14 years the Taliban did in 24 hours one IMU supporter tweeted at the timeISISs troubles in Algeria are if anything more dramatic The group officially recognized a wilayat there largely made up of former alQaeda fighters in 2014 In October 2014 ISISs Algerian branch captured a French mountain climber and beheaded him on tapeThe beheading attracted the attention of Algerian security forces which shortly thereafter killed the groups leader Later in May 2015 Algerian forces killed five ISIS commanders and the overwhelming majority of its ground fighters in two days of fighting Today GartensteinRoss says ISIS in Algeria is a paper wilayat with only six or seven fighters to its nameISISs Yemen wilayat is in even worse shapeYoud think Yemen would be the perfect opportunity for ISIS It has no functional government and is in the midst of a civil war with major sectarian overtones But the group has been riven by public infighting GartensteinRoss and Barr documented roughly 100 defections in the past several months  out of a force estimated to be at most 1000 and possibly much lessThis outfit in Yemen is not very strong Will McCants director of the Project on US Relations With the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution tells me Theyre at the moment a pretty bit player in that conflictEven relatively powerful ISIS franchises are having problems The Libya branch lost its hold on the Libyan city of Derna in December pushed out by a coalition of rival militant groups Today it controls only one major population center  the town of Sirte  and about 173 miles of coastal territoryIn Libya where theyre strongest they only control a thin strip along the coast McCants says Its not nothing but its not nearly as impressive as what they control in Syrian and IraqThese cases according to GartensteinRoss and Barr are representative of ISISs struggles to expand beyond Iraq and SyriaThe group has stumbled or even fallen flat in almost every country where it has tried to establish a new wilayat GartensteinRoss and Barr write The groups failures as it tries to expand beyond Syria and Iraq could cast doubt on its entire global caliphate projectISISs struggles to expand reveal some major weaknesses inherent in the groups DNA as GartensteinRoss puts it that limit its efforts to expandFirst the group makes enemies out of other jihadist groups Its ideological and strategic model depends on its claim to be the prophesied Islamic caliphate and its ability to prove that claim by holding territory Other militant groups in ISISs mind must submit to ISIS and hand over their territory  or be destroyedThats a constant  they dont play well with others McCants says This leads to conflict with other jihadist groups such as alQaeda and the Taliban which perceive ISIS as a threat and so move to crush new franchises as theyre formingThis is particularly problematic for ISIS because it thrives most in civil wars with sectarian elements  places where other jihadist groups already operateDerna was always gonna be a tough nut to crack because thats jihadist central in Libya McCants says AQAP alQaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has long roots in Yemen and has been more successful in exploiting the chaosSecond ISISs showiness  the penchant for ghoulish murders and slick social media  can attract the attention of enemies before ISIS is really ready to take them onThats one of the things that got them into trouble in Algeria GartensteinRoss says The ostentatious beheading of the French mountain climber drew counterinsurgent resources down on them in a way that they werent ready forFinally ISIS is weirdly enough too topdown and bureaucratic It isnt very good at selecting leaders who work well with locals or mediating internal local disputes in its franchisesDespite their rebellious nature theyre a very rigid organization internally GartensteinRoss explains In Yemen the central leadership ended up contributing to that branch falling apart under the weight of a leader that the ISIL members dont agree withDespite ISISs defeats in the Libyan cities of Benghazi and Derna the group is still deeply entrenched in Sirte  and getting a number of new recruits Its Egypt branch has withstood repeated assaults from the Egyptian government and has managed to pull off a number of highprofile terrorist attacks And thats to say nothing of Boko Haram which pledged itself to ISIS last year and is now recognized as Wilayat NigeriaAround January 2015 when I finished the first draft of my ISIS book it was laughable McCants says of the franchises Then when I had to go back and revise four months later I had to completely change the section In that short time they had made such a rapid advance Theyve gotten stronger since thenSo the point is not to dismiss the franchises entirely Rather its to recognize that they are not as is often portrayed in the media a sign of ISIS sweeping across the globe Its an attempt by a terrorist group with very serious problems to try to create some breathing room outside of its troubled core holdingsISIS thrives on a narrative of victory Now that the groups defeats in Iraq and Syria are too numerous and prominent for anyone to reasonably deny the group has increasingly turned to the franchises to continue selling its narrative of constant territorial growthThey have this narrative of momentum its clearly very important to drawing people to the group drawing organizations to ISIS GartensteinRoss says This is an area of great vulnerability if the truth were widely knownISISs affiliates help maintain the fiction that this is an empire on the march McCants saysNo matter how you judge the success of the franchises  and here McCants is less optimistic than GartensteinRoss  both agree that any victories abroad dont come close to outweighing the losses the group has taken in Iraq and Syria
