Right now the oil market is totally focused on finding a bottom for oil prices However according to OPECs SecretaryGeneral Abdulla alBadri weve already hit bottom Not only that but he sees a real possibility that oil prices could explode higher to upwards of 200 per barrel in the future Hes far from the only one that sees a return of tripledigit oil pricesAccording to the SecretaryGeneral speaking in London on Jan 26 the oil market doesnt need to look for oil prices to bottom as the market has already bottomed Instead he offered quite bullish comments by saying Now the prices are around 4555 and I think maybe they have reached the bottom and we will see some rebound very soon Now normally that type of remark would be just another layer of noise but this is coming from OPECs SecretaryGeneral so it comes with a lot of weight behind itThat said hes not saying that OPEC will come in and rescue the oil market by reversing its previous decision to hold steady on production Instead he sees the signs that the oil market is selfcorrecting as oil companies have made deep cuts to spending which will eventually lead to lower production growth Further the rig count in the US is plunging which is usually a key to a bottom in oil prices However in the midst of cutting back as the industry works through the current oversupply the SecretaryGeneral is now warning that the industry is putting future oil supplies at risk by under investing todayThe SecretaryGeneral said that if you dont invest in oil and gas you will see more than 200 when it comes to future oil prices While he didnt give a timeframe he did note the correlation between investment and future production This is because oil production naturally declines and oil companies need to invest in new production to not only replace this decline in production from legacy oil fields but to add new production to meet growing demand However oil companies are reluctant to invest in new production as their cash flows declineOver time this could become a problem as oil fields around the world naturally decline by an average of about 5 per year In order to overcome this decline oil companies need to develop about 200 billion barrels of oil supplies over the next decade and a half just to meet demandThese supplies will require the industry to invest 710 trillion However with the big capital budget reductions oil companies have announced this year it could make it harder for the industry to meet future supply needs In fact the industry might defer up to 150 billion oil projects this year due to the collapse in crude prices Many of these investments however wouldnt have yielded actual production for a couple of years due to the long lead time of major projectsAs an example Chevron delivered first oil on two of its Gulf of Mexico projects late last year after beginning construction on the fields in 2011 Meanwhile another 6 billion project it just sanctioned at the end of last year wont produce any oil until 2018 Its these long lead time projects that are being delayed which is setting the world up for higher oil prices in the future as an under investment today has the potential to lead to a constriction in future suppliesOPECs SecretaryGeneral is calling the bottom in oil prices While hes not the first to call a bottom he does lead the organization that currently controls the oil market so his comments do have a lot of weight Further hes also suggesting that the cuts that oil companies are making could have a dramatic impact on future oil prices as the under investment has the potential to cause oil prices to rocket higher if demand grows faster than future supplies That however would all be part of OPECs plan as it purposely pushed for lower oil prices now so it could control market share once oil prices surged in the future Its willing to endure shortterm pain for the potential of a big longterm gainThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY
