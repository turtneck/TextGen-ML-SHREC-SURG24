Jeb Bush has said his decision to run for the Republican nomination will be based on two things his family and whether he can lift Americas spirit His father and brother are former PresidentsThe closer we get to 2016 the more the electorate pays attention which were now seeing with foreign contributions to the Clinton Foundation and in Hillarys undisclosed emails said Boyd Brown a Democratic National Committee member and former state legislator from South Carolina These are problems that raise real leadership and transparency concerns concerns that can be addressed in caucuses and primaries but would go ignored in a coronation processIn conversations with grassroots Democrats around the country and in key nominating states there is renewed concern that Clinton is saddled with too much baggage and dubious political instincts that could sink her against the GOP nominee if the kinks are not worked out in a contested primaryThe Democratic base that isnt wedded to her is nervous about it said Deborah Arnie Arnesen a progressive radio host in Concord New Hampshire It makes her more vulnerable What is this anointed candidate getting us A much more flawed candidate than we thought And Republicans now have material they never thought they would haveWe need to litigate this in a primary so that she will better at it or it will be the Republicans who will be doing it for her she addedThe latest round of bad press began last week when the Washington Post reported on foreign government contributions made to the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation while she was serving as Secretary of State including one donation from the Algerian government that may have violated the Obama administrations ethics policyThis week the New York Times broke the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account to do business at the State Department allowing her to skirt federal recordkeeping practices The revelation also raised security concerns though State Department officials said nothing classified passed through her accountAnd late Wednesday Clinton sought to realign herself on the side of transparency tweeting that she wants the public to see my emailBut that doesnt mean theyll be released anytime soon State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement Thursday that the review process will take some time because of the volume of emails to sift throughClinton supporters have pushed back against the media and Republicans waving off the stories as yet another Twitterfueled muchadoaboutnothing that has little resonance with the typical voter beyond WashingtonVoters do not give a sht about what email Hillary used said Democratic strategist Paul Begala a longtime Clinton ally and CNN contributor They dont even give a fartBut if regular voters arent paying attention the Democratic power brokers who hold sway over the nomination process in key states  the legislators local party chairmen and pluggedin activists  most definitely are The questions some of them are raising are less about the specifics of the stories and more about the longestablished narratives they feed That the secretive Clintons enabled by unquestioning loyalists play by their own rulesThe questions relating to Hillary are more about are we tired of the same old thing asked one prominent Democratic state Senator in South Carolina who wished to remain anonymous Its time to turn the page and find something that will appeal to voters in South Carolina People just dont relate to these national stars like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Nancy Pelosi or whateverThe critical voices in the Democratic Party should not be confused for the majority view Many Democrats are siding with Clinton through the email flap underscoring her broad popularity within the party and her undisputed frontrunner status Recent polls of Iowa Democrats have put Clintons lead over her closest potential rival Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren at anywhere from 40 to 56 pointsThis stuff feels kind of petty to me said Cindy Pollard a Clinton backer and vicechairman of the Jasper County Democrats in Iowa Like this is all they gotBut the stories have given new fuel to stalwart Clinton skeptics who anxious about the prospect of a nominee who hasnt been challenged seriously in the national political arena since her illfated 2008 campaign have been demanding other prominent Democrats to join the 2016 race and not give Clinton a free rideSome of her critics are unabashed antiWall Street progressives who have urged Warren to join the fray Some are younger Democrats who see the Clintons as emblems of the past and others are simply skeptical of Clintons ability to stir the passions of the Democratic baseWhatever their motivations the AnybodyButHillary voices have been happy over the last several years to prop up potential rivals and feed reporters quotes about the importance of a Democratic nomination fight instead of a free walk to the nomination for ClintonBut in recent months with Warren looking unlikely to run and Clinton lining up blue chip talent for her nascent campaign staff the critics have lowered their voices and braced for the coming reality of Clintonasnominee even if potential contenders like Maryland Gov Martin OMalley former Virginia Sen Jim Webb and Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders make a runWhile many Democrats are still reluctant to publicly criticize the Clintons  Everybody is kind of afraid right now to say anything one of Iowas most wellconnected Democratic organizers told CNN when asked about the new controversies  others are less likely to pull punchesIn New York Zephyr Teachout who challenged New York Gov Andrew Cuomo from the left in last years Democratic Primary chided Clinton in the New York Daily News over the email flapShe shouldnt have done it Teachout said She should come forward and give a press availability on it Just as a matter of leadership she should address it directly  This is why we need a primary to force debate both about policy and leadership styleDick Harpootlian a former South Carolina party chairman and supporter of Vice President Joe Biden said the email story is yet another Clinton scandal to throw on the pileAlways another shoe to dropTheres always another shoe to drop with Hillary Harpootlian told the Washington Post Do we nominate her not knowing whats in those emails If the emails were just her and her family and friends canoodling about fashion and what theyre going to do next week thats one thing But the fact that shes already turned emails to the Benghazi committee because she was doing official business on it means shes going to die by 1000 cuts on this oneBrown the DNC member said that party leaders in his state are feeling shaky about ClintonFolks are remembering why they pushed back in 2008 and a candidate with the right message and retail politics could pick the lock Clinton thinks she has on the party faithful Brown said
