Most people can agree that a solution to bullying must be found This Wisconsin town believes it may have the answer In recent years bullyingrelated suicides account for over 6000 deaths per year for people ages 15 through 24 This Wisconsin town passed a law that forces parents to pay a fine if their child is a bully As the connection between bullying and suicide becomes undeniable parents teachers and students alike are trying to find a solution to this very important issue Yet there are too many adults who still see bullying as just another aspect of growing up It has been proven that bullying is a prevalent problem that leads to many negative effects for its victims Some of these negative effects include depression fear lack of motivation to attend school and suicide Police in Shawano Wisconsin are trying to curb bullying by holding parents accountable if their child is involved in bullying The city council of Shawano just passed an ordinance that allows police to intervene when aggression happens The law applies to anyone under the age of 18 and covers various forms of harassment ranging from taking lunch money to cyberbullying on social media Shawano parents will be warned after the first incident but if the childs behavior doesnt change within 90 days parents will be fined 366 A repeat offender will be fined 681 While the majority of parents agree that bullying needs to stop the new ordinance has raised a lot of controversy Some critics believe that there could be difficulty distinguishing between playful banter and harassment But police Chief Mark Kohl assures the public that the ordinance is not generated towards kids being kids and playground banter but instead towards kids who are meticulously using social media or their words to purposefully hurt others While some parents embrace the fining idea others disagree believing it will not solve the issue only burning a hole in the pockets of already stressed out parents It is an interesting solution and only time will tell if it works Feel free to share you own thoughts on the subject Share this to start a dialogue about the issue of bullying in your community Ariana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacycom She is an avid nature enthusiast gardener photographer writer hiker dreamer and lover of all things sustainable wild and free Ariana strives to bring people closer to their true source Mother Nature She graduated The Evergreen State College with an undergraduate degree focusing on Sustainable Design and Environmental Science Follow her adventures on Instagram
