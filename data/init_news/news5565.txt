Is The Republican Party On The Verge Of A Historic CrackupSomething is happening in the Republican Party that has not happened in living memoryThe party of unity tradition order and hierarchy is breaking apart over one man who personifies the concept of disruptionDonald Trumps sofar inexorable advance toward the Republican presidential nomination has divided the party This divide is not like the garden variety primary fights of recent cycles It goes beyond the familiar squabbles of the partys postwar era center versus right moderate versus conservative eastern versus westernWhat is coming looks more like the historic schism of 1912 when former President Theodore Roosevelt came back to challenge the reelection of his successor and fellow Republican William H Taft That schism was exploited by Woodrow Wilson the only Democrat elected between 1896 and 1932On Thursday the Grand Old Partys most recent presidential nominee Mitt Romney delivered a stunning denunciation of its current presidential frontrunner Donald Trump calling him a fraud and a phony who was playing the American people for suckers and who would be a disaster in the White House John McCain the Arizona senator who had the partys nomination in 2008 immediately signaled his support of his friend RomneyTrump responded with a rambling takedown of Romneys 2012 campaign Major figures from the partys officialdom and from the conservative media space lined up on one side or the other to be interviewed by journalists Some thought Romneys move would finally break the dam on Trump criticism within the party Others thought it would ultimately harden Trumps voter base all the moreA few hours later a televised debate pitting Trump with his last three rivals turned so raucous and unruly that observers all across the political spectrum had cause to avert their eyesThe 11th meeting of the GOP candidates may have been the most bruising to date for Trump the firsttime candidate whose message and persona have dominated media coverage of the campaign since summer Rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz largely ignored each other to concentrate on the man standing between them offering a target for their crossfireAmong other low points was Trumps reaction to Rubio joking about his anatomy He referred to my hands said Trump If they are small something else must be small I guarantee you there is no problem I guaranteeAt one juncture with Cruz and Trump talking over each other Cruz tried to break the tensionDonald learn not to interrupt he said Its not complicated Count to 10 Breathe Donald breatheThat prompted Rubio to ask when the yoga would be over and then to needle Trump for being very flexible  a reference to Trumps earlier explanations for his shifting positions on issuesThe exuberant and unrestrained crowd in Detroit hooted and jeered throughout the evening as Trump gave as good as he got with Rubio Little Marco and Cruz Lying Ted But Trump was often at a loss under questioning by the three Fox News moderators The Fox team came loaded for bear and Trump had more trouble with their inquiries than anyone else onstageJohn Kasich the Ohio governor and fourth wheel in the debate received far less attention from the moderators and got almost no rebuttal time because the other candidates never attacked himThat flaw in the format much decried by Kasich and a raft of other prospects who have already left the field may have been the one failing of the Fox production Moderators Megyn Kelly Bret Baier and Chris Wallace drilled in with challenging questions backed up with copious facts and at times illustrated with video clipsKelly who has crossed swords with Trump before stuck with one line of questioning about former students who sued Trumps online business college Trump University Rubio had raised the issue a week earlier in another debate and Romney had returned to it in his summary of Trumps failed ventures which also included Trump Airlines Trump Steaks Trump Mortgage and Trump VodkaStill the most memorable moment in the twohour debate in Detroits historic Fox Theatre came near the end when the candidates were asked if they would commit to supporting the partys nominee in NovemberThe question might have seemed unnecessary in previous election cycles but nothing has been ordinary about this one In fact on this occasion the question of party unity was not only relevant but painfully salientEach of the four used the moment to get in a final pitch for himself but all four also wound up saying yes they would support the nominee even if the party chose someone elseThat was the right answer of course in the traditional world of politics But little about this debate followed tradition And one had to wonder how committed all four really were to the pledge  and whether protestations of party loyalty would hold up under the strains now showing in the partys coalitionAfter the debate lively media commentary continued well into the wee hours of the new day with conservatives as divided as the candidates Trump had his defenders as did Rubio who has been a magnet for endorsements from elected officials and Cruz who has the backing of many movement conservatives and Tea Party activistsThere was no winner at the debate wrote Matthew Continetti editorinchief of the staunchly conservative Washington Free Beacon But there was certainly a loser The GOP It started this election cycle in a strong position and is now on the precipice of nominating a political neophyte  whose unfavorable ratings are skyhigh and who loses to Hillary Clinton in practically every pollThe possibility of Trump winning enough delegates to assure his nomination for president on the first ballot in Cleveland in July has caused many GOP and conservative leaders to scramble in search of any means to stop him Suddenly there has been open talk of an open convention with strategies that might thwart the wishes of proTrump primary voters and force the convention to consider alternativesRandy Barnett a professor at Georgetown Universitys law school has proposed that Cruz and Rubio form a partnership with each pledging to support the other at the convention They would then become a team and a prospective ticket with the one who gets the most primary votes running for president and the other being guaranteed the vice presidential slot Not a bad deal given that both men are still in their mid40sOthers including Romney are suggesting that the three remaining rivals to Trump should defer to each other in states where one has a natural advantage such as Kasichs Ohio and Rubios Florida That would not secure the nomination for any of them but it would prevent Trump from amassing the 1237 delegates he needs for a firstballot nomination After that delegates are no longer committed to vote for their candidate and anything could happenFor many veteran politicos all this seems not just tall talk but crazy talk No convention of either party has needed even a second ballot for the nomination since 1952 and Republicans have not needed multiple ballots since 1948 The last time a Republican convention had any semblance of suspense was in 1976 and on that occasion the shadow of doubt was dispelled shortly after the opening gavelSince then conventions have become duller with each quadrennial renewal offering no suspense other than the choosing of a vice president or the debate over a plank in the platform Even these elements have usually been drained of potential controversyFew thought 2016 would be any differentBut when things happen that cannot happen it is time to reassess what is possibleOr as Hunter S Thompson once wrote of another presidential campaign When the going gets weird the weird turn professional
