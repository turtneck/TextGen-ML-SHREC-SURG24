In new interim guidance  published today in the journal Obstetrics  Gynecology  experts from influential medical groups such as the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology argue that doctors should consider replacing the Pap smear with the HPV human papillomavirus test in women ages 25 to 65The Pap smear would still be the primary screening method in women under 25 and would be used to look for irregular cells in some older women who get a positive result from the HPV testThis is a change from the current guidelines which recommend Pap smears alone at three year intervals for women under 30 or the additional option of cotesting with both the Pap and HPV test at five year intervals for women ages 30 to 65The rationale is that we now know most all cervical cancers between 90 and 99 percent are caused by HPV This more sensitive test will detect more cancer in women and potentially save livesOur concern is that theres a lot of cervical cancer thats being missed on the Pap test In women who have a negative HPV test result said lead author on the interim guidance Dr Warner Huh their risk of developing cancer is extraordinarily small over a three year window You cant make that same claim with a Pap test We know the falsenegative rate for a Pap test is about 50 percent Its a coin tossOur concern is that theres a lot of cervical cancer and precancer thats being missed on the Pap testBut not everybody agrees with the new approach The main point of contention is this not all HPV actually leads to cancer  a lot of it is benign and clears up without any treatment at all  so expanded use of the HPV test could lead more false positives or women being treated for cancers that would have never harmed themSo many women get HPV who will never ever get cancer Diana Zuckerman head of the National Center for Health Research told NPRThe new interim guidance also drops the age for HPV testing from 30 to 25 which could theoretically lead to more unnecessary testing and treatment among young womenDr Huhs group believes the benefitharms ratio lies in favor of earlier and more aggressive HPV screeningWe fully recognize that detecting more HPV substantially increases the number of procedures that will be required like colposcopies he said But we felt that increased disease protection would be meaningfully important to women and healthcare providersHe explained that the group convened to come up with the new advice after a Food and Drug Administration panel suggested last year that a new HPV test become the standard of care for women For now the interim guidance is meant to guide doctors and patients decisionmaking until new official guidelines arrive in the next few yearsUntil then here is what you should know about Pap tests and HPV testsPap smears have been the primary cervicalcancer test for women for decades The test was invented in the US in 1941 by none other than George Papanicolaou Weird fact He actually established the technique by examining vaginal debris from guinea pigs and then translated that knowledge to humans At the time it was a game changer and model for cancer screening it was the first effort to detect early cancer and it turned cervical cancer into a largely curable diseaseBut the test isnt perfect It involves scraping the walls of the cervix and vagina for cells which are placed on a slide and sent off to cytologists who look for abnormalities under microscopes Sometimes the doctor doesnt scrape the area of the cervix where bad cells are harbored sometimes she doesnt transfer them to the slide properlyThats why the doctors who drafted the interim guidance about the HPV test and the FDA panel last year are pushing for expanded use of the new testWe know the Pap test is not very reproducible If you get a Pap test three different pathologists will give you three different interpretations of the results said Dr Huh The HPV test is either positive or negative like a pregnancy testAccording to the current guidelines women ages 30 and above or 25 according to the interim guidance should consider another option the HPV testThe HPV test works like a Pap test Doctors use a speculum to open the vaginal canal and reach the cervix and then they gently scrape the cervical canal to collect a cell sampleThe difference however is how the sample is screened The HPV tests looks for the presence of the virus not abnormal cells And the bottom line about the HPV test is this its more sensitive than Pap smears at catching cancercausing HPV meaning it can more accurately detect the virusThe authors of the interim guidance want to see this test used first in women ages 25 to 65 Then for women who test positive for some strains of HPV they want the Pap test used second to detect whether the HPV is associated with cell abnormalities in the cervixBut again there is a risk here and one that the medical community will be debating whether 25 is too young to start routinely screening women for HPV Thats because HPV is not always deadly and in most women clears within a year or two Running this ultra sensitive test at an earlier age could mean sending patients into tests and treatments that will have no positive impact on their lives or health outcomes For this reason until now doctors have said this test has a low predictive value for cervical cancer in women under 30Until more consensus emerges in the medical community about a new age cut off if youre between 25 and 30 you might want to talk to your doctor about getting an HPV testIf youre over 30 the current guidelines already recommend cotesting or getting both the HPV and Pap test at the same time Thats because HPV in older women is more likely to be related to cell abnormalities that could become cancerous So having a sensitive test is a good thingWhatever approach you chose with your doctor remember that getting any sort of screening is the most important first stepAt least half of the cases of cervical cancer in the US occur because women have not had appropriate screening or followup said Dr Michael LeFevre who chairs the US Preventive Services Task Force
