Researcher at CEGE and IAI University of Goettingen Originally published at VoxEU The euro as a common currency has recently been the subject of harsh criticism by economists from both sides of the Atlantic including claims that citizens in some Eurozone countries are turning against the it This column argues that in fact the euro currently enjoys comfortable popular support in each of the 12 original member states of the Eurozone and that potential upcoming referenda in any of these countries do not appear to pose a threat to the currency In contrast popular support for the euro has declined sharply in nonEurozone EU member states since the recent crisis with the UK standing out as the country with the most negative view Recently the euro as a common currency has been the subject of strong criticism by economists from both sides of the Atlantic eg Stiglitz 2016 Sinn 2014 This criticism has been inspired by the financial and economic crisis in some Eurozone countries and by the slow recovery in the region after the Global Crisis of 2008 Scholars claim that a majority of citizens have turned against the euro in large member states of the Eurozone such as Germany Stiglitz 2016 314 and Italy Guiso et al 2016 292 Sinn in Kaiser 2016a In the wake of the vote for Brexit in the UK referendum in June this year it is argued that knockon effects in the form of potential upcoming referenda on the euro in the Eurozone eg in Italy might lead to its breakup Feldstein 2016 Stiglitz in Martin 2016 Stiglitz in Kaiser 2016b In addition it has been postulated that animosity amongst EU member states is at a high Alesina 2015 78 This suggests a rising threat to the European project including the common currency These claims concerning the standing of the euro raise the question How does the public in EU member states actually look upon the common currency at this stage We are able to provide an answer based on survey data on the popularity of the single currency which are available from its creation as polled by TNSopinion European Commission 2016 These data are provided through the Eurobarometer EB The euro is a unique currency in the sense that similar time series evidence does not exist for any other currency Our answer draws upon our previous contribution to this site Roth et al 2012 where we explored Eurobarometer survey data on public support for the common currency from 1990 to 2012 There we concluded that in the first four years of the crisis 20082012 public support for the euro declined only marginally Now the question is What has happened in the most recent years regarding public support for the euro Support for the Common Currency Within the Original Eurozone We present an uptodate picture of the evolution of public support for the euro until May 2016 adopting our approach in Roth et al 2016 First we focus on the original 12 Eurozone member states Austria Belgium Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal and Spain  the EZ12 that adopted the euro as a physical entity in January 2002 Figure 1 shows average net support in per cent for the single currency in the EZ12 countries over a 27year period from 1990 to 2016 Figure 1 Average net support in  for the single currency in the EZ12 countries 19902016 Note  The yaxis displays net support in percent Since the figure depicts netsupport all values above 0 indicate that a majority of the respondents support the single currency The dashed lines distinguish the introduction of the euro as a book keeping entity in January 1999 the actual circulation of the euro in January 2002 and the start of the financial crisis in September 2008 Data for EB45 were not available Populationweights are applied Netsupport is measured as the number of

8285 in Roth et al 2016 948 Figure 1 leads us to the following conclusions Over the 27year time period a majority of citizens within the EZ12 has supported the single currency with average net support exceeding 15 at all times Since the introduction of the euro in 1999 a large majority of EZ12 citizens has supported the euro with average net support exceeding 30 In the 8th year in May 2016 since the start of the financial crisis average net support of 42 has surpassed the precrisis level of 40 in MarchMay 2008 Figure 1 gives the aggregate picture How has support for the euro evolved in the individual members of the EZ12 Figure 2 provides an answer Figure 2 Net support for the single currency in EZ12 countries 19902016  Source  Figure 2 is an updated version of Figure A1 until 52016 by EBs 8285 in Roth et al 2016 957 Figure 2 suggests that Since the introduction of the euro in 1999 aside from short periods in Finland and Greece before the crisis a majority of citizens in each member state of the EZ12 supported the euro even in times of crisis From 2008 to 2016 significant increases in support in Greece Portugal and Germany 26 23 and 10 percentage points respectively have levelled out the fall in net support in other EZ12 countries ranging from 11 percentage points in Ireland to 5 percentage points in Finland Over the 27year time period 19902016 Italy has always had a proeuro majority with the minimum net level of 17 in November 2013 clearly above the majority threshold of 0 Support for the Euro Among the New Members of the Eurozone How has support for the euro evolved in the new member states that joined the euro after its physical introduction in January 2002 that is in Cyprus Estonia Latvia Lithuania Malta Slovakia and Slovenia After adopting the euro aside from short periods in Cyprus a majority of citizens in each country has supported the euro Figure 3 Net support for the euro across seven EZ countries that joined the euro in the period 200416  Source  Figure 3 is an updated version of Figure A3 until 52016 by EBs 8285 in Roth et al 2016 958 Support for the Euro Outside the Eurozone In our 2012 column we highlighted the distinct fall in public support for the euro in EU member states outside the Eurozone Roth et al 2012 What has happened since then Figure 4 displaying the evolution of net support for the euro outside the Eurozone from 19902016 gives an answer Figure 4 Net support for the single currency in nonEZ countries 19902016  Source  Figure 4 is an updated version of Figure A2 until 52016 by EBs 8285 in Roth et al 2016 958 Figure 4 suggests Outside the Eurozone net support for the euro has declined in a pronounced manner Whereas in Bulgaria Czech Republic and Poland a majority of citizens supported the euro in the years preceding the crisis a majority in those countries has turned against the euro after the crisis The decline in support ranging from 65 to 30 percentage points is strong In contrast in Romania and Hungary in spite of a fall of 35 and 28 percentage points respectively a majority of euro support still exists In Denmark and Sweden the majority has turned away from euro support after the crisis Just before the crisis there was for brief periods a majority for the euro The UK is an exceptional case For the 26 years from 1991 to 2016 a majority of citizens was always against the single currency During the crisis net support for the euro reached levels as low as 66 in November 2012 Given the persistent rejection of the euro the Brexit vote should not come as a surprise but rather as reflecting a longrunning critical view towards the European project Therefore any knockon effects of the Brexit vote in the form of a breakup of the Eurozone via potential upcoming referenda in the Eurozone are not likely to emerge On the contrary recent survey data from July 2016 by the French polling institute Ifop suggest an enduring majority support for the euro in the Eurozone Fourquet et al 2016 52 Conclusions Our updated analysis of public support for the common currency over a quarter of a century from 19902016 brings out four major conclusions First in contrast to recent claims a majority of citizens support the euro in each member state of the original Eurozone including in Germany and Italy This was the case even during the peak of the recent crisis Second in contrast to some critical euro voices we do not believe on basis of Eurobarometer data that any knockon effects of the Brexit vote in any potential upcoming referenda on EU issues would pose an imminent threat to the euro Third taking into account our earlier findings which identify the unemployment rate as a key driver of public support for the euro in times of crisis Roth et al 2016 a strong job recovery in the Eurozone is likely to increase public support for the euro Fourth popular support for the common currency has fallen sharply after the recent crisis in EU member states that have not adopted the euro Here the negative sentiment is strongest in the UK We suggest the following bottom line with the exception of short periods in Finland and Greece before the crisis the evidence points towards majority support for the euro in each original Eurozone member state including Italy and Germany before during and after the crisis So far the euro has clear backing from the public It has adopted the common currency as its own currency See original post for references 0 0 0 0 0 0
