Hipster dog only likes 80s dog food that you cant get any more 071116 A DOG hipster will only eat an obscure type of vintage dog food that he enjoys in a semiironic way Labrador Wayne Hayes refuses to eat normal dog biscuits preferring a discontinued American 80s brand of dog food called Chunkiez that his owners have to buy off the internet at vast expense Hayes said Im all about Chunkiez Beefy Mix because the box they come in has such a cool design aesthetic It just speaks to my vibe I realise its 17 a box because they stopped making it in 1984 and theres only one warehouse in Canada that has stock but like everything in my life its paid for by my parents Hayes who also claims to like postmen and fireworks reckons he is friends with all the working class bull terriers at his local park even though they growl at him whenever he approaches Share
