Jeb Bush previewed the ideas at the heart of his likely presidential campaign delivering a sweeping address here Friday about the economy foreign affairs and energy exploration and challenging the country to question every aspect of how government worksIn his first major speech since stepping into the 2016 presidential sweepstakes in December the Republican former Florida governor spoke confidently and in significant detail about the broad range of issues beginning to shape the campaign for the White House Bush signaled he would offer the country the adult conversations he said are lacking in Washington and would focus on people who have been left out of the economic revivalSixty percent of Americans believe that were still in a recession Bush said Theyre not dumb Its because they are in a recession Theyre frustrated and they see a small portion of the population on the economys up escalator Portfolios are strong but paychecks are weak Millions of Americans want to move forward in their lives  they want to rise  but theyre losing hopeBush was sharply critical of Washington  not only of President Obama but also of the Republicancontrolled Congress  saying there were too many academic and political hacks with hardcore ideology who are running the country without making progressTheyre basically Maytag repairmen he said Nothing gets done Bush added It is time to challenge every aspect of how government works  how it taxes how it regulates how it spends  to open up economic opportunity for allBush delivered Fridays keynote address to the National Automobile Dealers Associations annual convention in San Francisco one of his final paid speaking appearances before he turns his attention fully to the 2016 campaignBush  who has been on an ambitious national tour to raise money for Right to Rise PAC his leadership political action committee  was careful to say he was only seriously considering the possibility of running He told the crowd of 4000 auto dealers and industry executives Your checkbook by the way is very safe hereBut Bush used the opportunity to signal the kind of campaign he intends to run His message contrasted starkly with the rhetoric expected from some other hopefuls who are gathering in Iowa this weekend for a political festival hosted by Rep Steve King RIowa an antiimmigration reform firebrandBush drew loud and sustained applause when he called for immigration reform that would provide a path to legalized status for undocumented immigrants living in the United StatesWe have a history of allowing people to come in legally to embrace our values and pursue their dreams in a way that creates prosperity for all of us Bush said No country can do this like America Our national identity is not based on race or some kind of exclusionary belief Historically the unwritten contract has been come legally to our country embrace our values learn English work and you can be as American as anyone elseIn an subtle swipe at other GOP leaders and potential rivals who rally the conservative base with hot tirades about Obamas overreach Bush said the Republican Party will win back the White House only if it offers an optimistic message Hope and a positive agenda wins out over anger and reaction every day of the week he saidBushs called for simplification of the tax code including lowering rates and eliminating as many loopholes as possible He also called for more energy exploration Approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was a nobrainer he said as is support for horizontal drilling and hydraulic frackingIts not cool here in San Francisco to talk about this he joked But Its cool in places like North Dakota and West Texas and South Texas Its cool because it creates significant economic activityIn his appearance here Bush did not shy away from his place in a dynastic political family The bio video that played before he spoke was heavy on references to his father former president George HW Bush and brother former president George W Bush Jeb Bush cited both in his remarks saying his dad was a model for leadership especially on foreign policy and noting that his brother had become a rather fine painter Who wouldve thunk it he saidBush is not alone among likely 2016 presidential candidates on the paid speaking circuit Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has been delivering speeches and making other appearances for pay since stepping down as secretary of state in 2013Clinton was a keynote speaker at last years auto dealers convention in New Orleans where she disclosed that she had not driven a car in nearly 20 years The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996 she said Jokingly she added I remember it very well Unfortunately so does the Secret Service which is why I havent driven since thenBush made an indirect reference to Clintons remark During the questionandanswer session when the associations chairman asked Bush his favorite kind of car Bush said he just bought a Ford Fusion For the record I do drive he said adding that he plans to return to the dealership for a twohour tutorial on the Fusions technologyBush was asked about his Thursday meeting in Utah with Mitt Romney the 2012 GOP presidential nominee who also is exploring a 2016 run The two men each a favorite of the party establishment are on a collision course but Bush said they mostly avoided talk about the campaignWe talked about the Patriots Bush said We talked a little bit about politics not as much as you might imagine We talked about the future of the country We talked about the need for a more engaged foreign policyThe awkward side of this about running and such we put asideAnswering questions on stage Bush opened a window on his personal life He said he loves Sundays  Its Sunday fun day  because he doesnt work I play golf really fast so I can have breakfast really fast so I can go to Mass slower  cant ask the priest to accelerate that I probably would if I couldHe called himself an introvert saying he would rather read a book than go out and get in a conga lineIntroverts actually are grinders Bush said They identify a problem by and large and then they overcome it But I learned that in order to make your case or in order to serve or in order to advance a cause you have to connect with people and you cant connect with people if youre back in the corner reading a book
