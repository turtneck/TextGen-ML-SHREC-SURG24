Fiorina and Trump are both touting their CEO qualities in their bid for the White House But the differences between executive and political power are enormousAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealWas Carly Fiorina a good business executive or a poor one Thats a hot question in United States politics as Ms Fiorina rises in the polls Right now the media is full of indepth examinations of her tenure as CEO of HewlettPackard and her 20 years at Lucent Both firms grew during her tenure but both struggled after she left and it remains unclear whether her decisions contributed to their stumblesHowever amid the flurry of competing profit claims and clashing job figures theres a third question thats going largely unasked Is the toplevel business experience of Fiorina and Donald Trump actually relevant to the presidencyAfter all the Oval Office is a very different place from a Fortune 500 corner office Government bureaucrats dont instantly obey orders Troublesome lawmakers cant be dismissed Reporters are so interested in your decisions that a horde of them occupies a press office in your own buildingSome CEO qualities are indeed useful in politics JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said Sunday on Meet the Press Successful business executives have a general talent for running things he said and for identifying and recruiting successful subordinatesIts not sufficient though You have a whole other set of attributes necessary to the presidency said the JP Morgan chief Its complex Its threedimensional chessMr Dimon is a selfidentified Democrat who has supported Hillary Clinton in the past So its possible he has a partisan interest in pushing the notion that CEO experience isnt a White House prerequisite But its undeniable that the greatest presidents werent business leaders In at least one case  Harry Truman  a successful president was a private sector flopHerbert Hoover was a prominent mining engineer executive and investor before his disastrous Oval Office tenure Jimmy Carter peanut broker is typically rankednear the bottomof modern presidentsGeorge H W Bush made a fortune in oil and then lost his presidential reelection bid amid an ailing economyGeorge W Bush was the first US president with an MBA Given the rise of that credential among the American elite class its unlikely hell be the lastIn fact 2016 could be a business executives year Fiorina and Trump both insist that business experience is crucial to understanding the economy and job creation and to bringing order and clarity to difficult issues Trump in particular boasts that America would be transformed by the sheer power of his business acumen Pressed last month by George Stephanopoulos of ABC News about how he would find and deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US and where hed get the billions to pay for the move Trump said Its called managementThe substance of Trumps immigration proposals aside management might not be enough to carry them out or indeed to push though and then execute any complex controversial US political actionThe differences between executive and political power are simply enormous By comparison executives are the masters of their domain Their leverage over subordinates is direct and considerable Their ability to set strategy for their entity is similarly unchallengedPresidents have little of that Their hiring power extends to their own staff and cabinet top levels Congress holds the purse strings and has a huge say in the direction of the nation Public opinion is a powerful influenceIn his classic study of the office Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents the influential scholar Richard Neustadt argued that presidents areweak when it came to domestic matters They werent in any sense the nations CEOPresidential power is the power to persuade Mr Neustadt concludedThat involves lots of skills CEOs dont need They include the ability to cajole 435 lawmakers all of whom think they should be sitting in your chair They include the ability to take an indirect line toward your goal and often settling for far less than you wanted They include an inclination to compromise and an acceptance that muddling through isnt so bad particularly when it comes to foreign policyTheres no equivalent in the corporate world to the separation of powers that often thwarts a presidents will And the job demands political savvy more than managerial experience wrote Bloombergs David Lynch in 2012 when considering businessman Mitt Romneys presidential qualificationsThis doesnt mean CEOs are by definition unqualified for presidential duties To reach the top they need drive clarity the ability to set goals and the ability to rally a staff  all useful qualifies in politicsAnd business failure can lead to political success The outline of Harry Trumans story is wellknown Hes the failed haberdasher who rose to finish World War II and save Europe with the Marshall Plan But Trumans Kansas City clothing store thrived until an economic downturn sucked it under Many of Trumans friends from National Guard days used the store as an informal clubhouse and through the store he met many local small businessmen and joined civic associationsThis gave him his entre into the local Democratic machine He entered county politics then won a US Senate seat and was chosen as Franklin D Roosevelts vice presidentOn the afternoon of April 12 1945 Truman received an urgent summons from the White House Eleanor Roosevelt met him and told him that FDR had diedTruman asked Mrs Roosevelt Is there anything I can do for youIs there anything we can do for you she replied For you are the one in trouble now
