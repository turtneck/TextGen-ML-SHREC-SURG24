Video of a confrontation between a news photographer and protesters at the University of Missouri on Monday led to a dispute between journalists and the activists sympathizers beyond the campus walls In response to a series of racial issues at the university a circle of armlinked students sought to designate a safe space around an encampment on the campus quad When they blocked journalist Tim Tai from photographing the encampment reporters complained that media were denied access to a public spaceCertainly Tai  like any journalist  had a legal right to enter the space given that it was in a public area But that shouldnt be the end of this story We in the media have something important to learn from this unfortunate exchange The protesters had a legitimate gripe The black community distrusts the news media because it has failed to cover black pain fairlyAs a journalist I understand how frustrating it is to be denied access to a person or place thats essential to my story I appeared with other journalists on local mediain New York City to discuss our frustration over Mayor Bill de Blasios sometimes standoffish attitude towards the pressHe is a public figure whose salary is paid with tax dollars He is obligated to be accessible to usCampus racism makes minorities drop out of college Mizzou students had to actThe student protesters Tai encountered though didnt owe him anything They did not represent a government entity stonewalling access to public information They were not public officials hiding from media questions They were young people trying to build a community free not only of the racism that has recently wracked Mizzous campus but also of the insensitivity they encounter in the news media Newspapers Web sites and TV commentary had already been filled by punditry telling black students to toughen up and grow a pair Then in the noisy conversation about First Amendment rights that Tai elicited journalists compounded the insult by drowning out the very message of the students Tai was coveringAs journalists we should strive to understand the motivations of the people we cover In this case black students at the University of Missouri have had a string of racist encounters on campus The president of the students association wascalled the nword and other black students have been racially harassed while participating in campus activities A Missouri journalism professor wrote in the Huffington Postthat she has been called the nword too many times to count during her 18 years at the university In February 2010 black students woke up to cotton balls strewn over on the lawn of the black culture center on campus The crime carried out by white students was designed to invoke plantation slavery University president Tim Wolfe resigned Monday after graduate student Jonathan Butler went on a hunger strike and the schools football players boycotted team activities to protest the very public racism he and many black students believe the school did little to addressEstablishing a safe space was about much more than denying the media access it was about securing a zone where studentsblackness could not be violated Yes the hunger strike the safe space and other demonstrations were protests and protests should be covered But what was fueling those protests was black pain In most circumstances when covering people who are in pain journalists offer extra space and empathy That didnt happen in this case these young people werent treated as hurting victimsInstead after the confrontation with Tai aggrieved journalists responded with a ferocity usually reserved for powerful entities with the means to inflict lasting damage on their First Amendment rightsThis wasnt a problem with Tais character or his journalistic integrity he was doing his job and his past outstanding work speaks for itself But in this conversation over public space weve overlooked the protesters message  that conditions on campus make it an unbearable environment for black students to live and learn in Their approach to creating a safe space should have been better conceived but reporters should also feel a responsibility to try to understand and respect their pain instead of rushing to judge them and panicking about an imagined assault on press freedomsShooters of color are called terrorists and thugs Why are white shooters called mentally illFurther as reporters we have to drop our sense of entitlement and understand that not everyone wants to be subjects of our journalism Our press passes dont give us the license to bully ourselves into any and all spaces where our presence is not appreciatedIts one thing to demand access to public lands its another to demand access to peoples grievingIn many communities that historically have been marginalized and unfairly portrayed by the media theres good reason people do not trust journalistsThey often criminalize black peoples pain and resistance to racial oppression We saw it in coverage of Ferguson and Baltimore when news stations seemed more concerned with the property damage than with the emotional damage that prompted it Though peaceful protests in Ferguson had been going on for days reporters didnt descend on the town in large numbers until there were clashes with police Suddenly coverage spiked but most of it was about cars vandalized and buildings burned On Fox News the channel most watched for Ferguson coverage at the height of the unrest protesters were called thugs Reporting from the protests CNNs Don Lemon noted Obviously theres a smell of marijuana in the air We heard comparatively little about the residents longheld grievances about police harassment and brutalityThe unfair portrayal of black people in the news media is well documented One study analyzing news coverage by 26 local television stations black people were rarely portrayed unless they had committed a crime A 2015 University of Houston study foundthat this imbalanced coverage may lead viewers to develop racial bias against black people because it often overrepresents them in crime rates Recognizing this kind of bias in news media black Twitter users started the IfTheyGunnedMeDown hashtag to call out news images of Mike Brown that many felt criminalized him in his deathThat black students would beskeptical ofmedia is understandable Weve already seen the kind of headlines they undoubtedly feared In an Atlantic piece headlined Campus Activists Weaponize Safe Space Conor Friedersdorf calls the protesters a mob and insists they are twisting the concept of safe space Again a journalist criminalizes black people for expressing their pain It wasanother piece centering the reporters privilege over the students traumaFriederdorfs piece completely ignores the intolerable racial climate that forced the students to establish a safe space in the first placeBlack college football and basketball players are the most powerful people of color on campusThere were other ways to cover these students protest without breaching their safe space and without criminalizing themThe human chain students formed provided ample broll and still photos Students could have been interviewed outside of that space I would have pitched a story to my editors with the headlineWhy Black Students Were Forced To Secure A Safe Space On A Public Campus But to do that requires selfreflection and not a condescending selfabsorbed soliloquy about the First AmendmentFor journalists the Missouri protests are a big news story For the black students were covering however its a fight for their humanity and liberation Tai is correct he was doing his job But in that stressful moment he may have failed to realize that the space he wanted to enter was a healing one that black people had worked to secureBlack pain is not an easy subject to cover but the lesson we can take from this encounter at Missouri is that our presence as journalists with the long legacy of criminalizing blackness that comes with it may trigger the same harmful emotions that led to the students protestsin the first placeWe used to count black Americans as 35 of a person For reparations give us 53 of a voteDont criticize Black Lives Matter for provoking violence The civil rights movement did tooThis is what white people can do to support BlackLivesMatter
