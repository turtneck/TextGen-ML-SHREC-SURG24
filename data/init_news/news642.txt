Trump Will Skip GOP Debate As Feud With Fox News Boils OverThis post was updated Wednesday at 845 am ETThe stage is set for Thursdays Fox News Channel final debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses  but frontrunner Donald Trump wont be thereAfter teasing earlier Tuesday evening that he probably wont bother with the debate Trumps campaign confirmed he wont participate citing unfair treatment from the networkAs someone who wrote one of the bestselling business books of all time The Art of the Deal who has built an incredible company including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars Mr Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates and setting ratings records the highest in history where as in previous years they were lowrated afterthoughts   Unlike the very stupid highly incompetent people running our country into the ground Mr Trump knows when to walk away Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him but Mr Trump doesnt play games There have already been six debates and according to all online debate polls including Drudge Slate Time Magazine and many others Mr Trump has won all of them in particular the last one Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process  and it has been very good for him both in polls and popularityTrumps objections stem from last years first GOP presidential debate when anchor and moderator Megyn Kelly pressed him about his derogatory comments about women Trump was outraged and later said on CNN that Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her wherever with her angry questioningOn Tuesday evening Trump doubled down when speaking to reporters in Iowa dismissing Kelly as a thirdrate reporter who is frankly not good at what she doesFox News hasnt backed down on picking Kelly again as one of its moderators alongside Bret Baier and Chris Wallace And earlier Tuesday the network slammed Trump for trying to bully it into changing the moderatorsWe learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president  a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings a Fox News spokesman said in a statementThat tongueincheek statement seemed to push Trump to follow through on his threat to not participate in the debateIn lieu of attending the debate Trumps campaign said he would instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors who have been treated so horribly by our all talk no action politicians Like running for office as an extremely successful person this takes guts and it is the kind mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great AgainFox News shot back in a statement late Tuesday evening saying it was the Trump campaign who had threatened KellyWere not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing  Megyn Kelly whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage a Fox News spokesperson said Capitulating to politicians ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards as do threats including the one leveled by Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly In a call on Saturday with a Fox News executive Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a rough couple of days after that last debate and he would hate to have her go through that again Lewandowski was warned not to level any more threats but he continued to do so We cant give in to terrorizations toward any of our employees Trump is still welcome at Thursday nights debate and will be treated fairly just as he has been during his 132 appearances on FOX News  FOX Business but he cant dictate the moderators or the questionsEarlier in the day Trump posted an Instagram video calling Kelly biased On Twitter he asked followers to vote on whether he should debateHis absence would change the balance of the debate and give his rivals free shots to attack TrumpWith Trump off the stage for the 9 pm ET debate that means its Texas Sen Ted Cruz who will be center stage followed by Florida Sen Marco Rubio neurosurgeon Ben Carson former Florida Gov
