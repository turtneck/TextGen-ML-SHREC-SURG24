At 1016 pm on Aug 15 1977 astronomer Jerry Ehman culled through data collected by the superpowered Big Ear radio telescope in Delaware OhioAnd there it wasStaring back at Ehman was something SETI Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence investigators had never found before or since The data transcript collected by the Big Ear revealed an astonishingly strong nonterrestrial signal which didnt even originate in our solar system The anomaly lasted for 72 seconds Experts believe it emanated from the constellation Sagittarius Scientists contend the event observed by Ehman is the best candidate for a nonorganic extraterrestrial signal ever documented on EarthA computer chronicling the episode spat out a vertical alphanumerical series onto a dot matrix printer 6EQUJ5Ehman quickly circled the sequence and scribbled but a single word WowThe aberration became known as the Wow Signal Scientists have struggled to replicate Ehmans finding or locate a similar beacon there or anywhere in the cosmos All efforts ended in failure Ehmans episode stands aloneWhen it comes to ObamaCare congressional Republicans find themselves in a similar bind Theyre like scientists trying to locate the Wow Signal For six years now congressional Republicans have made an effort to take out the health care law Better yet lay low the Affordable Care Act ACA and replace it with something else Remember the GOPs old repeal and replace mantra from the Pledge to America circa 2010But there are two problems Republicans have yet to come anywhere close to repealing the health care law More importantly they have yet to craft any legislation which would replace ObamaCareCongressional Republicans are a lot like scientists If they could theyd staff the Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory in New Mexico or take shifts at the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope in Puerto Rico Six years since a Democratled Congress first toiled on ObamaCare and five years since the president signed the bill into law Republicans still scour the frequencies for the health care equivalent of the Wow Signal A legislative transmission from above that would fundamentally tilt the ACAHowever even Jerry Ehman detected the Wow Signal once ObamaCare opponents just keep coming up emptySomething big has to happen soon for Republicans ObamaCare is the law of the land And if a Wow transmission is out there it could come from an intergalactic source as mysterious as that perceived extraterrestrial source in Sagittarius the US Supreme Court In just a few weeks the high court will render its decision in King v Burwell a case evaluating the qualification of subsidies for the health care law The Supreme Court could impale the ACA ruling subsidies unconstitutional for some ObamaCare beneficiaries Such an outcome could be catastrophic for the law It also means that Republicans  having talked a good game for years with little to show for it  had better turn up their dials to capture that Wow broadcast The onus is on themA working group of key House members has prepped for Supreme Court scenarios for months House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton RMich Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline RMinn and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan RWis are the players here They want to give states the chance to sidestep mandates which compel people to purchase insurance and void requirements that companies provide care for their employees The trio also wants states to have the option to back away from ObamaCareHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price RGa is also crafting a package of tax incentives and tax credits which consumers could use to buy health coverageIts anybodys guess though if these members will get the traction necessary to move a bill on the floor ThenHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor RVa and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers RWash spearheaded a working group a few years ago to find an ObamaCare replacement plan No accord ever materialized The reason Republicans never put an ObamaCare replacement bill on the floor is because the GOP rankandfile never coalesced around a plan which could passSen Ron Johnson RWis faces a potentially tough reelection in a swing state next year Mindful of the policy calamity which could upend Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court ruling the Wisconsin Republican authored a bill to maintain the subsidies for health care  but only for a few more years In exchange the Obama administration would have to end the individual and employer mandates for insuranceBut past is prologue here Its anyones guess if Johnsons idea could vault two parliamentary hurdles and secure supermajorities just to get the bill on the floor and stave off a filibuster And no one knows what the appetite is for such legislation in the House Republicans arent going to get help from Democrats Its unlikely that staunch conservatives would vote for anything short of a full unvarnished repealHence the continual sky sweep by the legislative stargazers searching for the Wow SignalHealth care is front and center Thursday in Washington Last summer the House of Representatives voted to sue the Obama administration over taking unilateral actions in administering the ACA The GOPled House charged that President Obama couldnt arbitrarily tweak and adjust deadlines and provisos in the law without the consent of Congress Those allegations go before a federal court ThursdayThe House alleges that the administration waived the employer mandate when it shouldnt have Ironically most conservatives want to dump the employer mandate But they didnt like it when the administration altered the terms of that mandate without congressional action Moreover the House says the law spends money which Congress never allocated toward implementing the law The House contends that subverts the ConstitutionTime and again the president has chosen to rewrite the law whenever it suits him said House Speaker John Boehner ROhio in a statement No president is above accountability to the Constitution and the rule of lawThe Houses lawsuit certainly does a lot for the GOP base and energizes Republican members  eager to demonstrate that Obama extends his reach beyond constitutional parameters That may be so This exercise extends the conversation about ObamaCare But it doesnt cut to the root of the problem facing Republicans when it comes to unraveling the law This is a separate track which still doesnt dial in the Wow SignalA definitive plan that can react to King v Burwell presuming the case goes the way GOPers want it to go remains elusive But until that happens congressional Republicans sweep the legislative frequencies searching for that interstellar health care solutionIf and when they finally get it they can mimic the penmanship of Jerry Ehman and his finding on a hot summer night in 1977 Wow they can write having discovered a legislative path
