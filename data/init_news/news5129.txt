destiny  PANICKY HILLARY STARTS SHOUTING You can turn the volume back up on your televisions the Democratic debate is done and the shouting has endedApparently believing that commitment and sincerity can be measured in decibels Hillary Clinton turned up the volume in Sunday nights showdown with rival Bernie SandersShe also matched her louder volume with sharper attacks on Sanders But the Vermont socialist came ready to fight counterpunching and even landing a few blows Youd have to give him the win if only narrowly on the grounds that not only did he dominate the discussion but that she was strangely treating him as the frontrunnerOr maybe it was just that she was trying to fight on Sanders turf Hes been shouting since before it was cool Clinton seems to be abandoning the mantra of her campaign  Im a fighter  for an effort to approximate the anger that candidates on both sides of the aisle have been trying with varying degrees of success to apeBut its hard to believe that Clinton is angry or at least that she is angry about something other than the fact that her party seems to delight in spurning her Life has been very good to the Clintons over the past 16 years to say the least Except for the politics partClinton and her crew could assuage themselves after her 2008 primary loss that they were victims of history  the sudden ascendance of a gifted AfricanAmerican candidate was more of a force of nature than a reflection of her political weaknessBut what if she were struggling with a guy who was deeply white and five years older than her What if the guy this time was not a gifted speechmaker but one who gave shouty campaign boilerplate in a Brooklyn honk What if he had been honking around Washington for 25 years and was generally written off as a crankIt has apparently all been enough to rattle Clinton whose onetime indulgence of Sanders has turned into attacks and who seems to be on the verge of yet another campaign rebootTied or trailing Sanders in the first two nominating contests its hard to say shes wrong A huge lead in South Carolina and what last month at least was a wide advantage in Nevada still suggest that Clinton isnt yet in danger of being toppled a second time  and that her strategy of aggressively pursuing black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition is paying offBut would those leads look so stout if Clinton were to lose the first two contests Certainly not Just ask South Carolina Democratic powerbroker Rep Jim Clyburn who told the NYT The reality is if Mrs Clinton loses Iowa and New Hampshire that could create new and real problems for her hereAs of now you can still call Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee but we are now seeing a scenario in which she might have to waste several damaging months on a fight that will harm her general election chances and distract public attention from the bazooka blasts on the GOP sideWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE America seems to owe an awful lot to highliving French noblemen And if you like the idea of separation of power between branches of government then say Joyeux anniversaire toCharlesLouis de Secondat Baron de La Brde et de Montesquieu born on this date in 1689 Montesquieu led something of a dissipated life as a young nobleman at court in Paris but became increasingly serious about his political writing and philosophizing A visit to England would open his mind further and give birth to a riot of political thought But perhaps chief among his insights was the value of divided governmentBritannica explains Dividingpolitical authorityinto the legislative executive and judicial powers Montesquieu asserted that in the state that most effectively promotes liberty these three powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies acting independently Though its accuracy has in more recent times been disputed in its own century it was admired and held authoritative even in England it inspired theDeclaration of the Rights of Manand

protect my family if someone were to come after us he said Sunday on CBS Face the Nation In fact if ISIS were to visit us or our communities at any moment the last line of defense between ISIS and my

endorsing Ohio Gov John Kasich for president as the Republican aspires to a toptier primary finish there The Nashua Telegraph Fosters Daily Democrat and Portsmouth Herald all threw their support behind Kasich in Sunday editionsWhat if its a twoman race  What happens if Jeb Bush or Chris Christie can succeed in crippling Marco Rubio and leaves the Republicans with only two choices One might assume that establishment support would flow to Cruz a lifelong Republican and sitting senator Not necessarily says Molly Ball in a dispatch from the trail Some Republicans who have moved through the stages of grief from denial to bargaining if not yet acceptance have begun to suggest that Trump might be preferable to Cruz Trump is if you squint a sort of moderate Republican hes a dealmaker and surely hes craven enough to reverse his most alienating positions and say what people want to hear if he gets to the general election Cruz on the other hand is an ideologue The scariest prospect of all is that he really means what he says and might if elected take it upon himself to actually upend the establishments cherished status quoGOP POWER INDEX CHRISTIE FADES New Jersey Gov Chris Christie has painted himself a straighttalker since he was elected to the governorship in 2009 and has made it a cornerstone of his presidential campaigns Telling It Like It Is sloganTown hall videos of his early days as governor hit the Internet and people around the country were drawn to this frank no nonsense guy When he took on the teachers unions and was asked about his own childrens private education he responded Its none of your business which resonated with people tired of hearing exhaustive explanations from politiciansBut his straighttalk attitude hasnt quite delivered on is message of late As Christie tries to find a path from the middle of the pack in New Hampshire to national viability hes come under increasing scrutiny And voters are hearing a lot more runon sentences than they were used to from ChristieIn the Fox Business Network Debate last week Christie claimed that he never supported Justice Sonya Sotomayors appointment to the Supreme Court but his statement at the time reads I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bipartisan supportIts been the same of gun control Although he has vetoed limits on clipsize and photo IDs for gun owners Christies record on guns is scattered National Reviews Jim Geraghty points out that in a 1993 race for New Jersey Senate Christie issued a statement asserting thatwe already have too many firearms in our communities The issue which has energized me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal New Jerseys ban on assault weapons In todays society no one needs a semiautomatic assault weapon In November 2015 Christie told Bret Baier in an interview for Special Report that he didnt remember making that statementOn the radar  Carly FiorinaBen CarsonandRand Paul  Watch FoxChrisStirewaltjoins The Real Story withGretchen Carlson in the 2

peak of the Civil Rights movement Houck headed to Atlanta to join the movement and was surprised at being picked up by Dr King and his wife Coretta Scott King with the reverend at the wheel After lunch that day she asked Houck if he might drive the children to school the following day Just like that Houck began his stint as the Kings family driver For nine months Houck drove Martin Luther King Jr around Atlanta though King liked to drive himself often too But he was a terrible driver Houck says And he turned WAOK radio in Atlanta on full blastThat wasnt the only puzzle presented to Houck There were also the cigarettes Dr King was a chain smoker all right But Coretta did not like the cigarettes Houck says So when we would come back to the house first thing Coretta would do she would check Dr Kings pockets So he started giving me his cigarettes In the midst of the struggle Houck found himself a coconspirator in Kings vice And with good reason Houck idolized the reverend for his virtuesChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News Want FOX News First in your inbox every day Sign up hereChris Stirewalt joined Fox News Channel FNC in July of 2010 and serves as digital
