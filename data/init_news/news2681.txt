THE HOUSE Select Committee on Benghazi further discredited itself on Thursday as its Republican members attempted to fuel largely insubstantial suspicions about Hillary Clintons role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks Grilling MsClinton all day they elicited little new information and offered little hope that their inquiry would find anything significant that seven previous investigations didntIn fact the highlight of the hearing came before lawmakers asked any question at all in MsClintons opening statement as she offered a stout defense of the need for assertive US diplomacy and engagement  even or especially when the circumstances are not idealAmerica must lead in a dangerous world and our diplomats must continue representing us in dangerous places MsClinton said We have learned the hard way when America is absent especially from unstable places there are consequences Extremism takes root aggressors seek to fill the vacuum and security everywhere is threatened including here at home It would be disastrous if future administrations held back in fear of politicized backlash if and when tragedies occurredWhen questioning began MsClinton repeatedly pointed out that Ambassador J Christopher Stevens one of four Americans who died in the attacks did not ask to pull out of Benghazi in fact he chose to travel there with knowledge that doing so carried significant risk Republicans argued that those facts did not excuse the lack of significant diplomatic security in Libya grilling MsClinton on why more of MrStevenss requests for additional security were not honoredOn that MsClinton argued that she was not personally responsible for diplomatic security  the State Departments security experts were  and she insisted that budget constraints limited how much security they could deploy around the world She also pointed out that intelligence experts lacked knowledge about the dangers in eastern Libya around Sept11 and 12 2012 and they knew of no credible threat to US diplomats on those days in particular An astoundingly large portion of the rest of the hearing focused on petty questioning related to Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal and other wastes of timeMs Clinton is not blameless As she admitted she had final responsibility for the actions of those who served under her A State Department review found bureaucratic failures that contributed to the relatively light security in Benghazi While its unreasonable to expect MsClinton to have known about MrStevenss precise circumstances she bears some blame for the bureaucratic context in which security decisions were madeYet the major topline policy fumble in Libya stemmed not from callousness or incompetence on MsClintons part but from the Obama administrations broader failure to live up to the vision of assertive US engagement she articulated on Thursday Had the United States devoted more effort and resources to helping the fledgling Libyan government the country might well have been more stable in 2012 and sinceAs she has on the campaign trail MsClinton hinted Thursday that she would use Americas international toolbox with ambition  I believe lead with diplomacy support with development and as a last resort defense  and probably more confidently than President Obama has If the hearing was useful at all it was in filling out her larger vision for US foreign policy
