The liberal media is going bathit crazy over David Duke participating in Louisiana senate debate BLM holds massive riot attack police officers and damage their carsDavid Duke is a former Imperial grand dragon wizard sorcerer magician cyclops of the knights of KKK and whatever you want to call him but what the bathit media is always conveniently forgetting to mention about him is that he is also a former Republican State Representative from 1989 to 1992 who reformed the partyAccording to an online poll hosted by FOX 8  the channel which hosted the debate David Duke won the debate in a landslide 92 of the respondents voted for David Duke but could this poll be accurate Certainly NOT David Duke has a lot of national support among his wizard circles while no one heard of the other 5 candidates outside of Louisiana So his supporters rushed in to vote but does he have any real authentic support in Louisiana Yes he has at least 5 statewide support since he participated in the debate because you need at least 5 points in Louisiana state polls in order to qualify for the debatesDavid Duke is associated with the devil across America so people naturally avoid admitting to support him in public polls so it is only logical to assume that his actual numbers may be more than double This is a phenomenon now known as the shy voter Donald Trump suffers with the same phenomenon When you see his polls out there Those are only the known voters There are many more voters who avoid publicly admitting that they support Donald Trump out of fear of repercussions from tolerant leftiesIf you have no idea who David Duke is MSNBC of all TV stations out there did a quite fair description of him He is a cutting edge politician whose ideas were stolen by establishment politicians even top Democrats such as Bill Clinton then claimed it were their ideas Chris Hayes described David Duke as The Duke Effect admitting that his ideas and policies were stolen by other politicians such as repealing affirmative action programs stricter public housing guidelines eliminating minority setasides welfarePhilip Bump who was the guest at All In With Chris Hayes said that Dukes fight from 1991 over welfare which evolved into a centrist position for Bill ClintonChris Hayes said Hes leading the edge over of the kind of political discourse that takes the country in a certain direction not singlehandedlyThe former KKK wizardmagiciandragonknightsnakesorcerer alright lets be fair to him the former Representative was definitely the most dominant figure in the debate and he stood his ground after Ted Cruz slandered him saying that he scammed his supportersJohn Neely Kennedy who is a former Democrat and who looks like and even sounds like hes Ted Cruzs lost twin brother accused David Duke of being a convicted felon who went to prison for lying to his supporters he swindled them out of their money and took that money and used it for his gambling addictionDuke wanted to respond and the moderator granted him 15 seconds which is definitely not enough for ANY of the candidates to rebuke an attack but after just 12 seconds the moderator interrupted Duke and jumped in to help Ted Cruz Sorry John Neely KennedyThe moderator interrupted Duke and supported John Neely Cruzs accusations After that a full scandal broke out during the debate The moderator saw that he was not going to back down so he finally decided to let him answer Duke waved some papers in the air and said that he was audited and he actually overpaid his taxes by 6000 and that he was targeted because of his extreme political viewsWe measured his second response time which he earned after being interrupted in the first place and it was a 40 seconds answer Definitely over the allocated 15 seconds but the moderator preferred to create a scandal worth of 1 minute and 22 seconds instead of letting him answer the first time Definitely some bias there BUT after this incidentfightscandal the moderator was very fair and unbiasedHis supporters think that the moderator was also biased because of asking Duke about Trumps pusy tape and why he condemn The CNN Jews Well the question was definitely legitimate since David Duke does spend a lot of time focusing on The Jews which is the reason he never gained any serious traction Not because that The Jews dont have any power on the contrary they do own CNN actually from top to bottom but because the average American doesnt know and doesnt care about that The average American cares about paying lower taxes having a strong military and a strong border and David Duke should focus more on those things if he really cares about what white people wantneed and if he wants to achieve more in his political careerAside for the 1 minute scandal there was also a funny moment during the debate when they were talking about Social Security which is seen in the video below at exactly minute 40 when Democrat candidate Foster Campbell is seen writing down something on some paper not paying any attention to the debate 10 seconds later David Duke is seen waking him up Foster is then seen looking around disoriented clearly not paying any attention The question had to be asked againThere was also a Democrat woman candidate on stage which was virtually like a Hillary Clinton clone vote for me because Im a woman not for the snake next to me David Duke Just like Hillary Clinton she works for Goldman Sachs and is funded by them with lots of cashAside from everything else David Duke was a spectacular watch and if people can be opened minded about him he would win in a landslide actually because he was the strongest Trump supporter on the sceneTrump needs a team of people who strongly support him such as Jeff Sessions strong loyalist people He will need his team in order to drain the swamp and clean the system otherwise he will just run into barriers and be unable to deliver any of his promises Duke always came out in Trumps defense when other fled like flees He even defended Trump with his pusy tape Not once has he refuted or denied Donald Trump It appears that Duke would make a perfect Trump loyalistDonald Trump strongly disavowed David Duke but even being disavowed by the Republican leader David pursued his own quest to win the senate and vehemently outlined his strong support for the nomineeTrump has Jews in his family his daughter Ivanka is Jewish his son Erick is also Jewish by marriage and he has Jewish members in his staff allover such as Michael Cohen and hes a strong supporter of Israel and a good friend of Netanyahu Now Trump doesnt have to agree with Dukes beliefs about Jews and frankly it doesnt matter Its not like David would have any power to do anything as a Senator In the senate the power is collective through voting thus hes powerless on his own with his own ideas However if hes such a strong Trump supporter then whenever Trump will ask for some law to be passed through Congress and Senate Duke will deliver by voting in its favor This is exactly the kind of people Trump needs in order to drain the swamp obedient loyalists Otherwise Trump will not be able to destroy the corrupt Washington octopus Besides David stressed during the debate that he is not against all Jews hes just against powerful billionaires who control the narrative such as the people working at CNN or major Hillary Clinton puppet master George SorosDavid Duke is definitely the best choice for Louisiana but if you still cant vote for him because of his past then hopefully John Fleming would win since he was also a good supporter of Donald Trump According to this article  toxic Trump is only supported for real by David Duke and John FlemingEach is on record supporting Trumps candidacy But except for Fleming Maness and Duke who seem eager to embrace Trump  dont ask them why Because Trump is so toxic  these leaders must be grateful Louisiana is not a battleground state They would surely hate to face a decision about whether to campaign with Trump if he showed up for ralliesRob Maness didnt participate in the debate because he is irrelevant hes below 5 percent and would thus be a waste of votes Its only between Fleming and Duke now You wouldnt want to vote for another scumbag RINO who thinks Trump is toxic and who would hate to campaign with Trump now would you Louisiana is a true red state the choice is clear Show the middle finger to establishment and vote for the candidate you thought supports Trump the most Whatever you do dont vote for a Democrat or that leading Charles Boustany Hes an Arab from Lebanon And despite being married he had been the client of 3 prostitutes who were later murdered  The choice is clear its either David Duke or John FlemingBLM Black Lives Matter thugs who are at least JUST AS BAD AS the KKK or even worse for killing cops and holding violent rallies allover the country held a violent protest outside the Dillard University where the debate took place to oppose David Dukes right to run as a Senator The thugs attacked cops and police cars resulting in at least 6 arrests  David Duke needed a police escort in order to exist the building safelySo heres the debate
