Badass Patriot Has MASSIVE Surprise For Thieves Who Stole His Trump Sign   Amanda Shea   Trump supporters Its become a trend for Hillary Clintonsupporters with far too much time on their hands to steal any Donald Trump sign they can get their grubby hands on Theres no returning the favor by taking a Hillary sign since they are practically nonexistent in almost all neighborhoods So one proud patriot took retaliation to new heights ensuring liberals stay away from his sign The unnamed owner of the Trump sign who is believed to be in Arizona is aware that his sign may not cost a lot but is worth much more than the plastic its printed on based on what it represents  a chance to take America back Hillarysupporters are an odd group of people who seem to believe that the Constitutional right to free speech is only bestowed upon them along with the power to take it from anyone who says something that they dont like Perhaps this the driving purpose behind the nationwide rash of Trump sign theft paired with the fact that they think that theyre helping by removing these visual statements of support from public view Either way where there is a Trump sign theres a liberal nearby waiting for their chance to make a stupid statement of their own in stealing it However this sign owner beat them to the punch by putting it in a place that was not only impossible to reach but showed his support of the GOP candidate loud and proud It sat up high in a tall tree keeping it out of reach for thieving liberals Taking Trump sign to new heights to prevent it from being stolen and make a bold message at the same time If liberals really want to show their support for Hillary theyll have to climb this massive tree and tear it down but chances are theyre not as tough as they think they are and prefer to stick to easy to steal signs We commend the hero for Trump who showed his bravery in putting the sign up so high knowing that no liberal would dare to go there since its so far out of their safe space and more work than they are willing to perform
