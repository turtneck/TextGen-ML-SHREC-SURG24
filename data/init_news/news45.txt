By Dan ZukowskiThree major US pipeline spills within the last month are just a small part of the 220 significant incidents reported so far this yearand 3032 since 2006that provide a stark reminder of the environmental hazards of an aging pipeline infrastructure carrying fossil fuels The costs of these leaks since 2006 has amounted to 47 billion1 Oklahoma On Oct 24 the 30inch S1 pipeline carrying crude oil from the critical Cushing Oklahoma hub to refineries and chemical plants on the Gulf Coast began to leak and was shut down overnight It was the second release connected with the Cushing storage facility in less than a month2 Pennsylvania On Oct 21 55000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a ruptured Sunoco Logistics pipeline in Williamsport Pennsylvania just upstream from the Susquehanna River Carol Parenzan Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper  said that witnesses who contacted her office reported that the smell of petroleum is so thick you can taste it The 80year old pipeline was damaged by a heavy storm that dumped seven inches of rain on the area3 Alabama Last month the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama leaked an estimated 336000 gallons of gasoline and triggered concerns about gas shortages for drivers in the East That spill was Colonials fifth in the state this year and occurred on a 43year old section of the pipelineBased on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA an arm of the US Department of Transportation the number of significant pipeline incidents grew 268 percent from 2006 to 2015 A significant incident is defined as one that results in serious injury or fatality costs more than 50000 releases more than five barrels of volatile fluids such as gasoline or 50 barrels of other liquids or results in a fire or explosion In 2015 there were 326 such incidentsalmost one per daySome 55 percent of the US network of 135000 miles of pipeline is more than 45 years old Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way to insure safe operations But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are about as successful as a random member of the public finding a leak Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters only 22 percent or 105 were detected by advanced detection systems The others were found in different ways with the public finding 99 of the leaksIn testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year Carl Weimer executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust  said Under the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulationsIt is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality said ParenzanDan Zukowski  Environmental journalist and nature photographer Member Society of Environmental Journalists Follow me on Twitter DanZukowski and visit DBZ Photo Source EcoWatch
