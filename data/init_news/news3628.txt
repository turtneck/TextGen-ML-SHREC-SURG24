Some are insisting on a better deal than the framework nuclear agreement reached with Iran on April 2 But the idea of a better deal is a chimera an illusory option and it should not lull us into thinking there is another agreement to be had if only we were to bear down harder The present agreement which depends on important pieces to be resolved by the end of June can substantially reduce the ability of Iran to develop a nuclear weapon over the next ten years or more and also creates a dynamic that could be a game changer in the combustible Middle EastSenator Mark Kirk has postponed a vote on the Iran sanctions bill he wrote with Senator Robert Menendez possibly until June 30 This is a constructive step avoiding an action that would undercut negotiations toward a final agreement But we need to keep the sanctions issue in mind because it is inextricably intertwined with the same calls for a better deal emanating from people in Congress Israel and other critics No one can argue that a better agreement wouldnt be better3000 Iranian centrifuges is better than 5000 a 20year deal is better than 10 The tough question is How do you get there Putting aside what the Iranians might do in response to additional pressuredig in deeper speed up their programand looking just at our side of the equation the notion of a better deal is unachievableHere is why According to critics seeking a better deal starts with increasing sanctions on Iran If tough sanctions brought them to the table tougher sanctions will bring them to their knees At some point their economy will be in tatters from the intensified sanctions and they will be forced to return to the bargaining table and agree to better deal With a closer look however this scenario unravelsFirst it is highly unlikely that even our allies in Europe would join us in further sanctions against Iran in the wake of a nuclear agreement they believe is sensible and positive That is even truer for other countrieslike India Japan South Korea and Chinathat were pulled into the existing sanctions regime quite unwillingly The support of these countries for the oil sanctions in particular has been critical to the sanctions effectiveness They will not willingly sign up for moreSecond if a deal falls through it is likely that the existing multilateral sanctions regime will begin to crumble As noted countries like India and South Korea who dont feel threatened by an Iran nuclear weapon will be only too happy to find a pretext to break out of the sanctionsperhaps tentatively at first but in a rush as others do It will be hard to argue the rationale for sanctions which from the perspective of nearly every nation will have achieved their purposebringing Iran to the table to negotiate serious limitations on its nuclear programIndeed the proponents of tougher sanctions to get a better deal have misunderstood the nature of the Iranian sanctions The fact is that the United States does not own or control the multilateral sanctions regime The effectiveness of the sanctions is based on how the international community views the perceived threat and therefore the legitimacy of coercive actions to stop itThird those who seek a better deal through tougher sanctions argue that we dont necessarily need international support The United States could unilaterally enact sanctions that have extraterritorial reach as we already have done with a number of Congressional measures since 2010 The proposition is that we will to some degree deny foreign companies access to the larger more important American market if they choose to do business with IranHowever the context has entirely changed since the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act was passed in 2010 New extraterritorial sanctions would be directed against an Iran that has reached an agreement on its nuclear program with major world powers The rest of the world generally detests our assertion of authority involving foreign companies in foreign countries Here for example we would seek to close the US market to Germanys BMW if they sold cars to Iran or Japans Sony if it sold in Iran If Congress imposed sanctions in spite of a nuclear agreement reached with Iran by major powers the international communityexcept for a few countrieswould believe those sanctions to be illegitimate In this context it is hard to imagine the US government moving ahead with major sanctions proceedings against many of our friends and alliesSo as we discuss and debate the merits of this framework agreement and a final agreement that may follow lets recognize that this is the agreement we will havenot some imagined alternative In my judgment if the next stage of negotiations succeeds the framework that emerged this week lays the groundwork for a strong and effective agreementThe framework does notnor by itself is it likely tofundamentally alter the other threats Iran poses in the region including its ongoing efforts to exert control in Damascus Beirut Baghdad and Sanaa and its continuing threat to Israel That is why it is important to embed this agreement in a regional strategy that bolsters concrete cooperation with our friends in the region and reassures them that we are there for the long haul President Obamas summit with regional partners at Camp David will be an important opportunity to look not only at the hot spots but at the bigger pictureThe Iran nuclear agreement is important not despite other troubles in the region but because of them Each challenge would be more difficult and dangerous if Irans nuclear program was unconstrained and unmonitored let alone if Iran were to develop a nuclear weapon and spark others in the region to follow Under the agreement that is emerging we will have a high degree of confidenceas will others in the regionthat Irans nuclear program is seriously constrained Walling off the nuclear threat does not extinguish the fires that are burning in the region But it does remove what would be the most combustible fuelThere is no second bite at this apple This is a good deal We should not be distracted by talk of a better oneEnacting new tough sanctions in an effort to force Iran toward a better deal would mystify and alarm the rest of the world isolating and weakening us Such sanctions would crumble under their own weight amounting to as Shakespeare said sound and fury signifying nothing
