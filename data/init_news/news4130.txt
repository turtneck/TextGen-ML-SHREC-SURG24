Take a look at the map above It was put together by Nate Silver over at FiveThirtyEight and it depicts an unlikely but credible scenario in which Gary Johnson wins his home state of New Mexico and neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton get the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election outrightSilver stresses that plausible is a long way from likely but also skylarks that its not farfetched to think the Electoral College would be close enough that New Mexico would make the difference and its not totally crazy to think that Johnson could win his home state Silver points to a new Albuquerque Journal poll that has Clinton at 35 percent Trump at 31 percent Johnson at 24 percent and Green Party nom Jill Stein at 2 percentExactly how that ends up with Johnson winning New Mexico is a StretchArmstrongstyle reach but lets play with this a bit Trump is either in full panic mode after blowing the first debate or getting there between the Miss Universe story and continuining questions about his taxes In any case his lack of direct experience and volatility will likely make him less appealing to noncommitted independents who otherwise want change Clinton is not anyones true favorite and perhaps her comments about Sanders supporters being historys losers and living in their parents basements starts some bleeding on the part of her lukewarm supporters Maybe Wikileaks which promised a while ago to leak some really bad stuff about Clinton this Wednesday and then cancelled the event actually has the goods on her in a way that causes her to crater And lets assume Johnson takes Matt Welch and other critics seriously ups his game and wins over the folks who know him best New Mexicans to eke out a victory in his home stateThe guy is pulling down newspaper endorsements after all and angering Bill Maher who recently called Johnson a fucking idiot Maher grants that Johnson is a good guy but hes afraid that apart from being against dumb wars the surveillance state and the war on drugs Johnson will cost Hillary Clinton the election That sort of articulation can only help Johnson with voters who are indeed socially liberal and fiscally conservative a group that Maher and many others essentially says doesnt exist Seeing selfconsciously edgy avantgarde types slag Johnson for believing too strongly in free markets global trade and technological innovation will help erase doubts raised by the governors spacedout answers on Aleppo and world leaders As the Albuquerque Journal notes Johnson is pulling more support from Clinton than from Trump in New MexicoWe live in a country where Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction by a twotoone margin and large majorities or pluralities hate the major parties dislike Clinton and Trump and think the government is trying to do too much that should be left to individuals and businesses To such people Clinton isnt any kind of solution to what ails us and neither is Trump if nothing else both are talking about spending more money than our currently historically high levels during peacetime Each of them is part of the problem and a figure like Johnson may come to be seen as a true alternative an experienced nonprofessional politician who promises a smaller but more effective governmentThe idea of Johnson winning New Mexico and the two majorparty candidates stalling out short of 270 is of course incredibly unlikely But it is worth thinking about especially for those of us who stubbornly refuse to buy into the false binary choice narrative being pushed by both Republicans and Democrats Change needs to be seen as possible before it takes place right Sometimes change comes in big revolutionary waves Other times it comes from a small but steady rivulet of water that hollows out seemingly impregnable structures However awful the 21st century has been so far to many of us it is far worse for established ideologies and political parties who are really taking it on the chin The question is whats the smallest victory it will take to show just how weak and foundering our political duopoly really is
