Comments The altright and other Trump supporters were flush with excitement yesterday as their online echo chamber resounded with stories that Hillary Clinton was about to be indicted on the basis of the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiners computer Today of course we learned that this was nothing but a boldfaced lied While many of the more obscure right wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims  the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than Fox News On November 2 Fox News Bret Baier claimed that according to two anonymous sources within the FBI the agencys investigation of Clinton would continue to likely an indictment The very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims which he called inartful acknowledging that thats not the process Nonetheless Baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent Clinton indictment maintaining that there is confidence in the evidence Given that Clintons indictment has been impending for months in the rightwing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that its not going to happen  and for good reason  Instead every time there is the slightest mention of Clintons emails no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential  the altright rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible In reality there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of Clinton emails and it has become increasingly clear that FBI Director James Comeys announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy In part the announcement was designed to fuel a new Republican storyline that Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation The demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases  including the rape of a 13 yearold girl Another disconcerting storyline in yesterdays firestorm of rightwing rumors is the political interference of Trump supporters in the FBI If Baiers socalled anonymous sources really were FBI agents it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by Trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency In any case the endless lies and distortions of the rightwing pseudomedia from Fox News down to the lowliest blog are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people
