In 2015 Vox talked to Secretary Perez about how social change happens  and the role played not just by government and activists but by individual interactions between people and by the slow relentless force of demographics and history This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and lengthPerezs track record has made him something of a lightning rod for the right when he was nominated for labor secretary thenSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called him a crusading ideologue whose convictions lead him to believe that the law simply doesnt apply to himHis office reflects the importance of both insiders and outsiders the picture behind his desk is of former Labor Secretary Frances Perkins the namesake of the building where the department is headquartered but the picture in the anteroom outside his office is of labor leader and activist Cesar ChavezAt the same time hes a close ally of Democratic politicians hes spent time campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary and is sometimes mentioned as a possible VP pick if Clinton wins the nominationPerez has spent the majority of his career inside government from the staff of Senator Ted Kennedy to the council of Montgomery County Maryland But hes always been closely aligned with activists and movements outside of the government For a time he was president of the board of directors of CASA de Maryland a leading immigration advocacy group even when he hasnt had an official title hes worked closely with LGBT organizations civil rights groups and labor unionsProgressive activists havent always loved Democratic presidents and they certainly havent always loved President Obama At times theyve been deeply frustrated with the president and his White House But at least one senior administration official has remained a progressive hero throughout the entirety of Obamas presidency Thomas Perez who ran the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division during the presidents first term and has served as secretary of labor since 2013What role does government play in social change Dara Lind I think progressives feel a lot of ownership in having you here in the Perkins Building Tom Perez Thats why her portrait is right behind my back  because shes the gold standard Dara Lind Over the course of your career youve been working very closely with a lot of movements but mostly from the inside The big question I want an answer to is what role you think government plays in social change Do you see this role as primarily leading public opinion and instituting things that people can then catch up to Or is it mostly responsive to people who are already organizing on the ground and demanding that government respond When you look at the history of any successful movement its always been a partnership By partnership I mean there are external forces at work Also in the anatomy of every successful movement that has resulted in change whether its the Civil Rights Act of 64 or the Voting Rights Act of 65 or movements before that  the Fair Labor Standards Act under FDR for example You look at the work of Frances Perkins leading up to the Fair Labor Standards Act and you look at the work of the external labor movement at that point And I talk about civil rights and labor rights I mean the March on Washington was a march for civil rights and a march for labor rights Each one of those forces is indispensable to the movement Theyre all really links on a chain And when you break a link the chain can be broken Dara Lind How have you seen these kinds of partnerships play out over the course of your career Tom Perez We had a livingwage movement in Montgomery County and it would not have been successful without progressive businesses without grassroots leadership and faith leaders and without folks inside Montgomery County government who said This is the right thing to do Or moving the needle on the Hate Crimes Bill for instance  which was for me a 15year odyssey I can tell you a lot about that one because I really did had a frontrow seat on that Who is more responsible Ill let historians judge that But I think I can say fairly that it was all of us working together And if you didnt have the insidegovernment person you wouldnt have gotten it done What happens when activists are frustrated with their allies inside government Dara Lind In hindsight throughout history it often seems theres a partnership between inside and outside In the moment there can be tensions I think both of us have seen this recently with the immigrant rights movement and the administration leading up to the executive actions in November Tom Perez Oh sure And there were tensions in the hatecrimes bill There was tension during the drafting there are existing death penalty provisions and what do you do about that Those are fair questions Those are important questions The immigrantrights movement  believe me these are my very very good friends  That doesnt mean even when you know you have shared values and shared vision that we havent had pitched battles And it doesnt mean that at the end of the day we dont come out with a very clear vision of where to go forward and sometimes you dont agree at the end But I think were in a good place right now Dara Lind In cases where there is direct pressure on the people who are friends of the movement when have you seen that kind of pressure be effective in spurring them to do better When have you seen it entrench attitudes and make people feel underappreciated Tom Perez I consider myself a pretty passionate person but I have always tried hard not to personalize things In the heat of the moment at times thats easier said than done so I think its really important to keep that in mind In every debate I had when I was at the County Council I saw folks on the left and folks on the right whod do this when they disagree with you they also disagree with who you are They add Youre morally bankrupt or something like that And you know we just have different visions of America at times when we see things differently One thing I learned from Senator Kennedy and from Senator Paul Simon and others whom I watched firsthand as a staffer was that you can disagree without being disagreeable You can be passionate in your views but youve got to remember that you have got to work with folks If youre attacking their integrity as opposed to attacking their point of view on an issue it just makes it harder to get to the finish line I think people understand that But people are human And as a result sometimes we do things that perhaps dont move the ball forwardDara Lind The presidents made some substantial changes recently through executive action  on immigration for example or raising the minimum wage for federal contractors Theres often a belief in DC that changing policy through the executive branch isnt as permanent as getting it done through legislation or waiting for public opinion to come around Do you feel thats a concern Or do you feel that changes like this set a standard that society will then rise to meet Tom Perez I see them as both When I look back on the most important civil rights developments in the last hundred years in the top three for me would be President Trumans executive order integrating the Armed Forces And I couldnt help but note the parallels in rhetoric with some opponents when he did that and when we were talking about Dont ask dont tell  military readiness and this and that I had a trial down in Texas when I was prosecuting hate crimes It was a horrible hatecrime case I got to be good friends with the attorney for one of the defendants and hes a World War II veteran He said once that he grew up in the segregated South he grew up with attitudes about African Americans and the singular thing that changed his life was when he fought side by side with them So I think executive action can be transformational The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program orDACA has been in place since 2012 The program applies to many of the DREAMers young unauthorized immigrants who would have qualified for legalization under theDREAM Act Under the current DACA program young unauthorized immigrants who meet certain criteria apply for two years of protection from deportation its going to be extended to three years under the new set of orders and can get work permits once theyve been DACAmented An estimated 12 million immigrants were initially eligible for the program and about half of them have actually applied Read this Vox feature for more about how well DACA has worked so far Theres no substitute for comprehensive immigration reform DACA was transformational but not sufficiently so I met a DACA kid see sidebar yesterday down in Carolina when I was there and she inspires me She absolutely inspires me But she cant get instate tuition and you know theres a ceiling for her even though shes better off now than before So I look at executive action and legislative action as two tools in our toolbox of expanding opportunity How can progressives organize people who dont have the time for political activism Dara Lind What are the lessons you learned while working and serving on the CASA board that you took with you when you went back to working for the government Tom Perez It was something that I understood intuitively as a student in the civil rights movement but then when you live it you see firsthand that change happens from the bottom up You build things from the bottom up you organize and thats how you effect change And so Im trying to bring that operating principle to our paidleave discussion to our skills movement to the working families businesses nonprofits faith leaders and educators working side by side I just talked to 400 community college presidents and trustees this morning And we have tremendous opportunities The wind is at our back economically But weve got to make sure we have shared prosperity and the longterm key to that is we need to upskill America We need to equip Americans workers with the skills to compete And the community I hear the most about this issue from is the business community And I said to them We need to build a movement around this I dream of a day when I hear  and more importantly Congress hears  as often from the business community about skills as they do about trade or other issues If you were to commission a poll of 500 employers right now skills would be in the top three of their priorities But we havent built a movement around it Were building a movement right now around paid leave and childcare We live in a Modern Family world but we have these Leave It to Beaver principles that are still all too frequently in place I mean Rebecca the woman who sat in the box with the first lady at the State of the Union  to put a finer point on their situation they have two kids under the age of five their mortgage is 1400 a month and their childcare bill is 1900 a month You cant survive like that for any long period of time Dara Lind The question that raises is what happens when you have someone whos working to support a family and doesnt benefit from paid leave or needs to work two jobs because he or she isnt being paid minimum wage  who might not have the energy to be the forces on the ground How does it affect the ability to build a movement when the people who are most likely to benefit may not be able or just may not be terribly motivated to make change happen because theyre focused on their daily lives Tom Perez Thats a huge question When you look at where we were 100 years ago and you look at where we are now there was a lot more attachment to institutions  your union the Elks the Eagles bowling your church or other place of worship Today there is more bowling alone In that context how do we build movements Im inspired by people like Sarita Gupta executive director of the workersrights advocacy group Jobs With Justice and others who have recognized that we can organize lowwage workers and we can partner with businesses Shes doing the same thing you and I are talking about And shes working on behalf of exactly the cohort you described people who understand at a basic level that their life is a struggle that the playing field isnt level but they dont have time to go to the rally or go to the union hall and they may not necessarily have the wherewithal They need help Thats the voice we have to give Thats why our work is so important Because there are folks out there with a lot money to spend who are saying I wake up every day figuring out how I can screw unions Weve got to understand this that there are folks who wake up every day who believe we get ahead in America by squelching workers voices by making it harder for workers to organize and creating more topdown stuff And I just refuse The Gilded Age was not a golden age in America Thats why we do what were doing here to service that voice Thats what gets the president out of bed every morning These are hard battles because the people were fighting on behalf of are working two and three jobs Its not realistic oftentimes to ask them to come down to Capitol Hill to do Hill visitsDara Lind On the one hand youre saying there are people who are working against the ones you are working for But on a historical scale attitudes change people who would have been opposed to integrating the Armed Forces 70 years ago arent opposed today Do you think that kind of change of winning hearts and minds is inevitable Tom Perez Usually Im optimistic I believe the moral arc of the universe bends not only toward justice but also toward those who seek to expand opportunity rather than contract opportunity At the beginning of the 20th century there was a big debate about whether to have free access to public education K12 Youre going to give out free high school degrees You dont need that Come on I suspect some of the descendants of those folks are the ones who fought Medicare 50 years later Medicare you know You dont need that Theres an album you should look at Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine Theres actually an album I think I still have the album cover I gave it to Diane Rehm one day because I was on her show Not only did Reagan say Medicare would lead to socialized medicine he said Medicare would lead to socialism in America Thats what he said in the album And 50 years later Ive met all these people I met a guy Ward in Nashville who got his ACA coverage March 1 and got his liver transplant two weeks later I met a guy Victor two weeks ago in Salt Lake kidney cancer And what they both wanted more than anything  You know what I want to do most now they say Im like No what I dont know what theyre going to say I want to work I want to get a job again because I was so sick I couldnt work It just makes me ask the question whats in it for opponents of the ACA for Ward and Victor not to be able to work And then they have to become a ward of the state How is that good for the economy How is it good for healthcare delivery to have the ER be their primary care physician How is that good on any metric of success putting aside the moral and ethical aspects of that So I have optimism Because we are on the right of the facts and we are on the right side of history and thats how the moral arc has historically bent It doesnt bend on its own We are talking about movements and movement building Dara Lind Over the course of your career do you think there are any issues that have suffered setbacks  where youre now fighting just to get back to where things were when you started out Tom Perez Im going to Selma in a couple of weeks to commemorate Bloody Sunday and 50 years after Bloody Sunday and almost 50 years as we come up He looks toward a corner of his office Im looking over there right now because its John Lewis one of my favorite people in the photo I find it impossible to believe that 50 years after folks fought struggled so hard and gave their lives in some cases the biggest problem in the voting space is inperson voter ID fraud That is as Colin Powell said How can a problem be so widespread and yet so undetected I firmly believe we should have a pitched battle about policies Democracy is all about having passionate debate  respectful but passionate debate And then at the end of the day what we should be doing is making sure everybody gets the opportunity to vote Thats why I had some friends on the left who asked me when I was in the civil rights division Why do you spend so much time making sure that veterans service members can vote Because dont you know they vote Republican And I said First of all I dont know how they vote Second I dont care how they vote And third Im offended by that Because these folks are serving our country and we need to make sure everyone gets access to the ballot Im just thoroughly offended by that suggestion So we should be having this debate and then at the end of the day we should all be working together to make it as easy as possible for eligible voters to vote As opposed to a world in which the strategy is Ive got to make it harder for my perceived ideological foe to exercise his franchise By the way you might win a shortterm victory here and there but you are swimming into an unwinnable headwind of demographics that will be a tidal wave And its totally inconsistent with our values as a nation
