Sunday President Obama morally abdicated his place as the leader of the free worldHis decision to stay home instead of standing side by side with French President Hollande as millions marched in Paris in solidarity with the slain journalists of Charlie Hebdo in opposition to radical Islam  an enemy fiercer than we have seen in decades  sent a clear message to the world Obama just doesnt careHis words about the horrendous terrorist attack this week were not enough They came off as inauthentic at best and offensive at worstTo speak about the most serious terrorist attack on Western soil since 911 London and Madrid in between speeches about his free community college plan demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding for the gravity of the situation in Paris and indeed the worldTo this end it is not surprising that President Obama is the only Western leader who has refused to call this attack Islamic terrorism even though President Hollande has declared that France is it at war with radical Islam And to not even send Vice President Joe Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry in his place shows a level of disrespect that makes me ashamed of our nationWe are at war with radical Islam And President Obama needs to say itMany have tried to understand why President Obama made this choice Its certainly not possible that Obama has different intelligence than the French Or that he and his advisers cant see what the rest of the world has seen and come out against  the radicalization of Islam the greatest threat of our timeIncredibly in a speech on Friday Egyptian President elSisi called upon the Islamic leaders in his own country to stand up to the extremism that is destroying Islam We are in need of a religious revolutionYou imams are responsible for Allah The entire worldis waiting for your next movebecause the Islamic world is being torn it is being destroyed it is being lost  and it is being lost by our own landsSisis words strike at the heart of the problem in Islam today where radicals and extremists have hijacked a religion for their own hateful means He doesnt condemn the whole religion by calling out the terrorists for what they areSo why is our own president afraid to do the sameA condemnation and declaration of war against Islamic extremism does not mean a condemnation and declaration of war against Islam They are separate and distinct and the president shows a profound lack of understanding for todays world and threats to America and indeed the world without being honest about whats at stake hereI made these same points Sunday night on Fox News Channel with my colleagues on Political Insiders when we talked with Harris Faulkner and will continue to do soI have been disappointed by President Obama many times during his six years in office but perhaps never more so than this weekend He is redefining what it means to be a lame duck as well as giving the world a master class in what it means to let the world down
