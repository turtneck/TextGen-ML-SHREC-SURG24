Theyve called each other names Theyve mocked belittled skewered and slimedAnd now that oddest of couples  Donald Trump and Fox News  is engaged in a titfortat feud like none seen in the annals of modern American politicsThe greatest show on Earth  or at least in IowaIf things go as promised Trump wont be there Thursday when Fox hosts the final Republican debate before Mondays Iowa presidential caucuses He says hes backing out because of a taunting statement from Fox though his detractors accuse him of dodging a last showdown with his chief rival Sen Ted Cruz Tex Instead Trump has made plans to materialize elsewhere in Iowa hosting a benefit for wounded veterans  counterprogramming on a Trumpian scale of swaggerHis threatened absence from the debate stage is a demonstration of Trumps perception of his own selfworth his verifiable status as a ratingsgenerating gargantuan whose screen persona can translate into millions of advertising dollars In a sense its an act of subversion by a candidate who has broken all the normal rules of modern campaigns But its also a manifestation of Trumps philosophy about getting what he wants when he wants itThe best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you can have Trump wrote in his careerdefining and profileelevating 1987 bestseller Trump The Art of the Deal Leverage is having something the other guy wantsFox a network that has reigned as a kingmaker in Republican politics now seems faced with an adversary who is acting as if hes already the king and doesnt need itThe sniping peaked this week when the billionaire developer appeared to taunt Fox by polling his social media followers on whether he should appear at the debate He also stepped up his attacks on Fox anchor Megyn Kelly whom he wanted to have removed as debate moderatorThe poll and the Kelly criticism irked Fox News chairman and chief executive Roger Ailes according to an executive at Fox and the network chief personally crafted a statement in response We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president  a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetingsAccording to the Fox executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations Ailes put together a tongueincheek statement to take the heat off MegynOn Wednesday Trump  via Twitter naturally  said Fox went too farIt was the childishly written  taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter megynkellyWhile publicly feuding with Trump the cable news behemoth also seemed to be at crosspurposes with itself toggling between the competing goals of taking a hard line with the recalcitrant candidate and wooing himFox executives did not respond to multiple interview requestsTrump and Fox have been poking at each other for months Their needling and gnashing began facetoface at the first Republican presidential debate in August when Kelly pressed Trump about calling women fat pigs and other derogatory names Trump parried back the next morning by huffing that Kelly had blood coming out of her wherever Critics said that was a reference to the anchors menstrual cycle but the candidate said it was merely a reference to her demeanorThe tangle soon devolved into longdistance warfare a series of snippy news conferences and social media taunts periodically interrupted by detentes Even as Trump has pounded away at Kelly retweeting claims that she is a bimbo and calling her average in everyway he has frequently appeared on Fox News programsA defiant Trump appeared on Fox host Bill OReillys show Wednesday night his 133rd appearance on the network since announcing his presidential run according to a Fox tally When OReilly suggested that Trump was making a mistake by skipping the debate the GOP frontrunner said I think youre wrongTrumps camp denied that the candidate was afraid to debate He loves debating He has participated in six debates said Trump spokesman Corey Lewandowski He welcomes the opportunity to debateFox has claimed that the Trump spokesman leveled a threat against Kelly on Saturday in a conversation with one of the networks executives Lewandowski stated that Megyn had a rough couple of days after that last debate and he would hate to have her go through that again a Fox spokeswoman said in a statement We cant give in to terrorizations toward any of our employeesWhen asked about the Fox claim Lewandowski said I didnt do anything of the sort  I did not threaten anyoneJill Olmsted a journalism professor and media critic at American University said the cable channels unnecessarily snarky comments mean that Trump has won this round with Fox  big timeThey took the low road and made Mr Trump look like he is being targeted by Fox she said I am quite surprised that grownup media spokespersons for a major media outlet didnt know better or at least werent more practiced in holding their tempers when giving public commentBut John Carroll a communications professor at Boston University said This may be a situation where Donald Trump was too clever by half It may have been a gambit to get concessions but when Fox rightly told him to take a hike he was boxed in To save face he had almost no choiceRush Limbaugh the influential nationally syndicated radio host concluded that Fox is underestimating TrumpI heard people on Fox last night talking about this Who does he think he is He cant control the media Limbaugh said on his program Wednesday I got news for you He is controlling the media and its his objective  He controls the media when hes not on it He controls the media when he is on it He controls the media when hes asleep Nobody else has been able to do anything like this short of the Kennedys and theyre pikers compared to the way Trump is doing thisFor the umpteenth time in this strange Republican primary season Trump has made the race all about one thing Trump
