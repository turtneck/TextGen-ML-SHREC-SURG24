Entitled Customer Slams Restaurant On Yelp What Happens Next Is Sheer Badassery By Tiffany Willis on October 11 2014 Subscribe A customer  Yelp name Sonal B was visiting Kansas City for a conference when she decided to try to get takeout food from Voltaire  an upscale restaurant across the street from her conference building The only problem with that is that Voltaire doesnt offer takeout and they never have by policy The customer pitched a fit threatened to get her lawyer husband involved and did and threatened the manager with a bad Yelp review which she did minutes after leaving the restaurant But Voltaires owner responded And it was fabulous The Yelp review Most unfriendly and arrogant restaurant in KC Just called Voltaire to try to order some food because were in a late business meeting across the street First they refused to answer our question about what type of broth is used in the risotto Then they said they wont pack food to go My husband spoke to the manager and explained that were in a conference room across the street and asked if they can pack our dinner which we would pick up The hostess flatout refused to answer our question about the food or to try and work with us so we could get food in our meeting My husband asked to speak with the manager The manager Jamie said our food is plated beautifully and we cant put it in a to go container So thanks Jamie well just starve What the manager said is just not true by the way weve eaten there before and they did pack our food to go When my husband said that he was going to post a Yelp review about the way the restaurant was treating us the manager questioned Are you a grown man and an adult Yes Jamie we are grown adults and we do not do business with people who behave like you do We regularly travel to NYC and eat at a variety of restaurants which are more than happy to accommodate people by packing food to go This restaurant thinks theyre too good for their customers They will soon learn that if you ignore your customers theyre going to start ignoring you I would not even give this place one star after this experience and Im dismayed by their unprofessional and arrogant behavior The owners response I sincerely apologize that we dont offer takeout food at our restaurant Being a Yelp user Im sure you were aware that on our Yelp business page on the right side of the screen it lists details about our establishment There is an item listed TakeOut  No We have never offered takeout food as we believe the food we prepare should be presented as we see fit usually on a plate inside the dining room As for the risotto its made with a vegetable stock  this dish is vegetarian and Im certain that who you were speaking with wanted to make extra certain the information provided to you was accurate On your previous visits you say you have witnessed dishes being boxed up as proof that we provide takeout food Although we do allow our guests to take their uneaten food with them in togo boxes after they have dined with us we have never offered takeout food If you were actually starving as in a life threatening condition requiring nutritional sustenance we would be happy to assist youwe do make exceptions for emergency situations Our general manager did question the agematurity of your husband after he became combative and threatened us with a negative Yelp review if we did not alter our operational practice and provide him with takeout food 15 minutes later you indeed came through with this threat I can assure you that we dont offer takeout food because we feel we are too good for our customers we just prefer to have our guests dine with us allowing for the proper presentation and temperature of their fare that has been skillfully prepared by our kitchen I am very
