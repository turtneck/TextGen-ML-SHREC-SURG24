The Senate voted 85 to 12 Wednesday to pass the Every Student Succeeds Act The replacement for the No Child Left Behind law next heads to the presidents deskKelci Gouge teaches a third grade class at a summer reading academy at Buchanan elementary school in Oklahoma City in July 2014 Oklahoma lawmakers repealed Common Core standards for English and math instruction The Senate was expected to vote Dec 8 on a replacement for the No Child Left Behind law which among other things would shift power to deal with failing schools toward states and away from the federal governmentUpdate This story was updated at 1201 pm to include the final voteAcross Minnesota the number of native American kids heading to college is on the rise The reading and math scores of black students are catching up to those of whites Lowincome students kids whose native language isnt English and kids with disabilities are meeting the higher expectations teachers have been setting for themThe state  a high performer by many education measures  still faces many academic gaps between groups of students But it is well on its way toward a goal it set in 2012 to cut those disparities in half by 2017Minnesota offers an example of what can happen when a state puts a priority on closing achievement gaps It developed its approach through a waiver to some of the requirements of the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind NCLBNow that old and many say broken law is on its way out State leaders for years have been clamoring for more flexibility in how they hold schools accountable for academic improvement  so they can prioritize and tackle issues as they see fit not as the federal government dictatesAnd Wednesday the Senate voted 85 to 12 to clear the longawaited law that will finally grant them their wish The bipartisan compromise known as the Every Student Succeeds Act ESSA already passed the House by a wide margin Dec 2ESSA will leave the main tools in place to track achievement by categories such as race income level disabilities and Englishlanguage learners But a big question remains Will this shift to empowering states help or hurt the equity agenda embedded in the original law from the 1960s civil rights eraHistorically not all states have shown the political will to set high standards for all students and some observers worry theyll again feel somewhat off the hook There probably will be less attention now on the achievement gap The new law doesnt force that conversation the way it did under NCLB says Chad Aldeman an associate partner at the nonprofit Bellwether Education PartnersOthers are more hopeful that many states will stay the course or come up with new innovations to address achievement gaps  recognizing the impact those can have on their future workforce and economic healthMinnesotas current accountability system uses a range of measures for school achievement including how well individual student and subgroup test scores improve from year to yearThe state legislature expanded the system in 2013 to cover all public schools not just those that receive federal dollars for lowincome students It set up regional centers of excellence to provide assistance to schools that were struggling And its dedicating more than 180 million in state funds to the effortWere focusing on the strengths of our schools and teachers and asking them to do more says Brenda Cassellius the states first AfricanAmerican education commissionerSo far twothirds of the schools are on track to meet their gapreduction targetsAt TrekNorth a charter middle and high school in rural Bemidje the state goals align with a mission to prepare as many students as possible for college through participation in Advanced Placement coursesThe school has been recognized five times in the states annual list of Reward Schools recently scoring an 81 out of 100 on the Multiple Measurements Rating which takes gap reduction into accountThe more sophisticated accountability system has contributed to a healthy pressure to hone the subtleties of the craft of teaching says the charter schools executive director Dan McKeonMany of the lowincome or native American students that make up much of the TrekNorth population wouldnt have access to AP at other schools Mr McKeon says He helps teachers develop the ability to stop midlesson to do a formative assessment  checking to see that everyones getting the main points Then they take that extra 10 minutes if they see some students struggling with a certain conceptThe staff also works with families to help them understand the world of opportunity that can open up for students who put in the time on academicsOn a recent trip to visit colleges around the state McKeon says he watchedas one 12thgrade girl  from a lowincome family where college has not been the norm  looked through a brochure about how college credit is calculated for students who have passed AP examsShe starts counting up classes since she was in 10th grade  and she realizes that if she went to this college shed walk in with 29 credits under her belt he says and that would mean saving a years worth of tuition and possibly earning scholarships Icould see the realization on her face of how big of an accomplishment it wasAs he has watched the new law move through Congress McKeon says his cynical side worries that some educators might see it as a release from accountability to underserved students On the other hand he says hes excited to see what gets created at state and local levels when professional educators get the freedom to do what they know works bestCivil rights groups are gearing up to take a seat at the table as accountability systems take shape over the next year and a half leading up to full implementation of the new federal lawMany civil rights and education advocacy groups had pushed for the federal role to remain strongerBut when it comes to what states now must do in regard to Englishlanguage learners ESSA actually strengthens accountability Their progress has to be accounted for by all schools whereas previously that happened only in schools with high percentages of such studentsStates have been asking for a while now for more flexibility to own their state accountability plans so well be monitoring how this plays out and calling out states that arent doing better by English learners says BrendaCalderon an education policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza The number of English learners in the US has grown to about 1 in 10 students she saysCivil rights and student advocacy groups are also pushing local conversations about opportunity gaps that lie at the root of lower achievementA recent report in Boston for instance found that black and Latino males were horrifically underrepresented in key opportunities as early as third grade that largely determined whether students ended up on a collegeprep track says Dan French executive director of the Center for Collaborative Education in Boston which published the reportThe report is helping inform a new task force in the city thats exploring ways to address the gaps One need is for greater cultural competence among school staff to understand their diverse population of studentsOne school for instance held a wellintentioned celebration of the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo The problem none of the Latino students at that school had Mexican heritage If you dont know who your kids are Mr French says you are going to have a hard time reaching themLocal efforts to address stubborn gaps like this nascent one in Boston  and state support for such efforts  will become even more important under the new federal education law And the degree of success states have could vary greatlyThe equity agenda doesnt get a significant boost from the new law some education and civil rights observers say because its definition of accountability is still too narrow They are focused on accountability by test scores but really not focused nearly enough on the learningopportunities part of the equation We still have so many kids in underfunded underresourced schools says Pedro Noguera an education professor at the University of California in Los Angeles
