You are here Home  US  Hillary Isnt Only One Who Suffers Memory Loss Look What Bill Just Did Hillary Isnt Only One Who Suffers Memory Loss Look What Bill Just Did October 27 2016 Pinterest Bill Clinton will probably have to avoid Hillary even more than usual after his latest showing on the campaign trail in which it became clear that it isnt just his wife that has memory issues Slick Willy was out on the campaign trail on Tuesday angling to get his lecherous allegedrapist butt back in the White House and apparently he forgot his own criminal business partner wifes campaign slogan But we were growing together Bill said This slampaign slogan of Hillarys growing together its more than just two words that sound good Thats not a typo either according to IJR  Bill called Hillarys campaign slogan a slampaign slogan before mangling Hillarys alreadystupid actual campaign slogan Stronger Together Bill probably shouldnt use Im With Her either since he might lapse into and her and her over there and her right there too Stronger Together is also the name of Hillarys flop of a book which I highly doubt Bill bothered to read although you cant really blame him for that he has a hard enough time staying awake when his wife speaks  he must be immune to shrill cackling by now Im guessing Bill is going to want to stay as far away as he can from Hillary while she likely has one of her infamous cooling off periods Hillary has been widely reported to have a nasty temper  so itd certainly be wise for Bill to stay far away Hillary cant be mad for too long though because its likely that shes going to need Bill to run the White House Although neither of them appear to be in the greatest health they can do a great deal of damage between the two of them Bill and Hillary have had a painfully obvious agreement throughout their married life to help each other politically Now its Hillarys turn and shes surely not going to take too kindly to Bill screwing up her ascendancy No need to worry Hillary youre responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya ruining the life of a 12yearold rape victim and numerous other crimes and disgusting deeds so a few memory lapses from Bill wont affect the election Hillary managed to forget answers nearly 40 times during the FBI investigation into her use of private servers to send and receive classified information as secretary of state so forgetting a dumb campaign slogan should be no big whoop What would be nice is if Bills memory lapses led to a moment of clarity and human decency and he let everyone know where the bodies have been buried during the Clinton mafias assault on American politics Wont happen though we cant have nice things
