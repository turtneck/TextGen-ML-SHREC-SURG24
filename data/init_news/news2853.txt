Sorry but Sanders doesnt think like mainstream black voters The tell is Cornel West He hates Obama We do notIowa and New Hampshire had their turns in the spotlight and Nevada comes this Saturday And a week after that my state South Carolina will host its own Democratic primary Compared to those first two states ours is highly diverse Battle ground trial phasecall it what you willSouth Carolina once a crucible of the civil rights movement and Barack Obamas surge can help vet the candidate best aligned with the black communityBernie Sanders is not that candidatenot next to Hillary Clinton From his bouts with the president to the laws he contested to the company he keeps Sanders raises alarm bells for Obama supporters especially those from the AfricanAmerican communityBack in 2012 while still a proud Independent Sanders took a page from the Republican playbook and called for a primary challenge to Obamas presidency His aim to contrast a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing as if to say affordable health care and safe cities are not progressive enough goals The Democrats I know would disagreeThat antiObama jab followed an earlier resistance to the Affordable Care Act now considered President Obamas greatest legacy Back in 2009 coming from the far left wing Sanders held out on voting yes hoping instead for an impossible ideal Over 200000 South Carolinians now have quality affordable health insurance through Obamacare If Sanders fulfills his campaign promise and starts those talks from a blank slate then he risks undoing years of progressImproving health care matters greatly to our community Its no secret that African Americans die earlier than whites and suffer in larger numbers from diseases like diabetes and heart disease We also die twice as often from gun violence In Charleston County alone blacks accounted for 29 percent of the population in 2014 but claimed 78 percent of gun violence deaths We demand equality where our lives are at stake and on that note Sanders has a mixed record on gun safety having opposed reforms that Obama now pushesThe Vermont senator once voted for legislation that allowed the Charleston shooter to buy a gun despite a clerical errorthe nowinfamous Charleston Loophole More recently he voted down legislation meant to shield gun makers from victim lawsuits When President Obama last month refused to back any candidate even in my own party who does not support commonsense gun reform he may well have been referring to SandersIn what perhaps struck the candidate as an act of solidarity Sanders also chose Cornel West as liaison to South Carolinas black voters As The Washington Post puts it West serves as Sanderss controversial traveling companion and has been highly critical of President Obama Thats an understatement Cornel West hates President Obama He once called the president a brownfaced Clinton a Rockefeller Republican in blackface and a counterfeit progressiveMy own father Cleveland Sellers was a real civil rightsera activist as were Jesse Jackson and Rev Joseph A Darby All of them are alive and well with deep South Carolina roots and could have been surrogates for Sen Sanders So of all the black leaders Sanders could have chosen why West West is a scholar sure but his views are extreme and they clash with much of the proObama black communityBernie Sanders means well and his calls for income equality rightly resonate with Democratic voters But certain issuesgun violence and health care among themand certain viewpointsCornel Wests not among themappeal specifically to most African Americans My vote goes to someone who supports President Obama and intends to wholly and ambitiously build on his legacy That someone is not Bernie Sanders
