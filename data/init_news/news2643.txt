attention because they could change the political calculus in a state that President Obama won by the thinnest of margins in 2012 50percent to 491percentIts a potential game changer for the state said Mark Hugo Lopez director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center Its the biggest movement of people out of Puerto Rico since the great migration of the 1950sIs it lights out for Puerto
