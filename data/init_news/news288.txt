In a Tuesday editorial the papers opinion editors cast significant doubt on the Texas Republicans ability to assemble a winning coalition arguing that Cruzs assumption that he can win by turning out more white conservative voters is fundamentally flawed and warning that the Tea Party firebrands hardline stance on immigration makes him a dream come true for Hillary Clinton the likely Democratic nominee in 2016Blaming Cruz for plunging the GOPs favorability by leading the 2013 government shutdown  part of a botched attempt to derail health care reform  the Journal depicts Cruz as a polarizing figure all too willing to reflexively oppose anything the Obama administration proposes The editors castigate Cruz as an opportunist for seeking to pare back government surveillance and for opposing the administrations abortive effort to authorize air strikes in Syria in 2013  stances that Cruz took despite a generally hawkish worldviewAs for Cruzs claim that Republicans like 2012 nominee Mitt Romney have lost because they failed to galvanize the rightwing base the Journal allows that Romney in particular failed to motivate enough conservatives However the editors posit Cruz is probably wrong to think that conservatives alone especially white conservatives can elect the next President adding that the partys 2016 nominee must broaden the GOPs electoral appeal Part of that the editorial suggests entails a softer line on immigration continued opposition to reform will only prove a boon to Democratic efforts to keep Latino voters solidly in the blue columnThis being the Wall Street Journal editorial board the piece is not without potshots at Democrats Indeed the editorial is framed around the notion that Cruz is the Republican version of Barack Obama There are areas of overlap Both began their presidential bids as 40something firstterm senators both graduated from Harvard Law School both are perceived as dynamic speakers and both boast appeal among key segments of their parties respective constituencies Although the similarities largely end there the Journal insists otherwise Much as Cruz is notorious for his scorchedearth Tea Party tactics the Journal would have us believe that Obama harbors contempt for Republicans and for the very idea of working across the aisleIn the latter half of his second term Obama may have come to the belated realizationthat Republicans had no interest in cooperating with him but the president reached this conclusion only after the failure of his assiduous efforts to woo GOP support His 2008 campaign rested on the notion that he not Hillary Clinton would bridge Washingtons partisan divide and he spent much of his first term negotiating against himself in the vain hope that his proposals would garner Republican backing There was the largely fruitless effort to secure GOP support for the 2009 stimulus package for instance and the monthslong illfated bid to get thenSen Olympia Snowe RME to vote for health care reform Obamas Kumbayaism was doomed literally from the start just as Obama took office top congressional Republicans decided in a closeddoor meeting that the next four years would be ones of kneejerk opposition to the presidents policies Six years later Cruz is telling Republicans that the obstructionists who run his party arent intransigent enough That view may be held by a large segment of the Tea Party but even some of the nations most conservative voices find it laughable  and politically perilous
