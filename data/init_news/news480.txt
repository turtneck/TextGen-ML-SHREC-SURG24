Enough Is EnoughIf we really want to do something about the worst effects of our electoral process lets start by simply having less of itYou might think that Hillary Clinton has been running for president for well ever  but technically she began her campaign on April 12th last year 18 months ago Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House a more restrained 15 months ago But if you want a real contrast cross the Atlantic I once ran elections in the UK where the typical length of a campaign is not 18 or 15 months but four or five weeksLook I get it about the constitution free speech and all that Believe me As a recentish immigrant living in Silicon Valley having taught at Stanford and started a business here I have all the zeal of the convert I truly think that America is the greatest nation on earth and I feel profoundly lucky to be able to be part of itBut can we just talk about the election process for a moment Is there a single person in this country who feels better able to choose between Trump and Clinton today than a year ago What have we learned about these candidates that we couldnt have discovered over the course of the nine weeks since Labor Day Nine weeks is double the length of a general election campaign in the UK Im not saying British democracy is perfect not by a long way But at least the flaws arent inflicted on the population on a continuous basisThe most common thing I hear people saying about the election right now is Please let it be over Of course you could argue that the reason is not so much the length of the process but the uniquely polarizing nature of the major party nominees this time and the fact that unusually they were both wellknown to the American people before they even entered the race If two relatively obscure candidates had been nominated perhaps the cries of pain from the public wouldnt be quite as anguishedTheres more to this question though than familiarity with  or contempt for  any individual politician at any given time The length of election campaigns in America causes real structural problems throughout our democratic system regardless of who the candidates areFirst the relentless posturing involved in nearpermanent campaigns contributes to the hyperpartisanship that makes reasonable debate on public policy issues increasingly difficult An environment where any halfthoughtful comment can almost instantly find its way into an overnight online attack ad is one that incentivizes politicians to put messaging ahead of problemsolving and thats not goodFor example I agree with Hillary Clintons emphasis on the importance of early intervention and parenting support as one of the best ways to tackle poverty and inequality But if elected I expect her administration would approach this priority in a disastrously oldfashioned topdown bureaucratic way that would end in failureNo candidate of either party could say that its too nuanced a position With most members of Congress literally starting their next election campaign the day after this one has ended you wont see any of them move beyond yelling platitudes like nanny state or war on womenFor a start it means that its harder for people who are not wealthy to run for office Who has the time and the resources to take two years off work to get elected Rich people thats who Its no surprise that the proportion of millionaires in Congress is at an alltime highMore than that the cost of lengthy political campaigns is a direct factor in the systemic corruption that is such a notable feature of American democracy In fact if you look at what actually happens in Congress and in state legislatures it is difficult to argue that America is in any meaningful sense of the word a democracy at all It is a donocracy where the funders of election campaigns literally buy the outcomes they want from the political systemLook too at the role of organized labor providing campaign infrastructure volunteers get out the vote operations None of that would be touched by campaign finance reform And then look what the unions get in return in my home state of California budgets that increase compensation for corrections officers while cutting spending on public schools and state universities Way to go progressivesThe truth is that even if Clinton wins and by some miracle enacts some version of campaign finance reform the assorted lobbyists bloodsuckers sleazebags and other hangerson in Washington DC will breathe a huge sigh of relief because they know that for them life in our nations capital will go on as corruptly as beforeNo if we really want to do something about the worst effects of our electoral process lets start by simply having less of it Think of it like pollution control it doesnt make the problem go away but it does make the world a bit less toxic Radically shortening election campaigns is no more a silver bullet than changing the law on political donations But it would make a big difference and has the advantage of being easier to implement
