RT October 27 2016 The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than twothirds in the 50 years to 2020 according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020 The reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012 The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14152 monitored populations of the 3706 vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them According to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem Vaccineladen MMs to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowm4DUucNxn pictwittercom9a6F9x3raG Humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said WWFs director of science Mike Barrett A d v e r t i s e m e n t Animals across the planet are expected to be affected However rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures We are no longer a small world on a big planet We are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the Stockholm Resilience Centers Professor Johan Rockstrm said in a foreword for the report The decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earths geology and ecosystems The notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse WWF DirectorGeneral Marco Lambertini said as quoted by the Guardian In fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states There does however appear to be some hope Some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis However Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources Youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business Barrett said The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added My hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost onetenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s   641
