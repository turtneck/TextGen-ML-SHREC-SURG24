Sen Rand Paul is about to announce that hes running for president  kicking off a longpostponed Republican civil war on foreign policyUnlike the rest of the likely GOP presidential field Paul is a diehard true believer in scaling down Americas involvement in conflicts around the world That pits him against the mainstream hawks in the Republican party whose ideas are sure to dominate the campaign By running for president Paul hopes to inject his ideas into the debate and shift priorities his partys held for decadesPauls presence alone is a threat to people in the party establishment The partys most hawkish voices fearing exactly this are mobilizing in force to stop Paul  lobbying internally and even potentially running candidates whose sole purpose would be challenging Paul on foreign policyThe coming campaign then is a major test of where the Republican Party view of foreign policy is headingPaul is pretty open about what he believes on foreign policy Its a simple pitch no more foreign wars and less government involvement in our lives in the name of security It also happens to be 180 degrees from what most other Republicans thinkPaul supports nuclear negotiations with Iran though hes been conspicuously quiet about the recently announced framework deal Hes tacitly endorsed the Obama approach to Russia and Ukraine and has vociferously opposed NSA surveillanceHes blasted both the Afghanistan surge and the Libya intervention Today he opposes arming the Syrian rebels to fight ISIS or Bashar alAssadAfter the tragedies of Iraq and Libya Americans are right to expect more from their country when we go to war Paul said in an October speech widely seen as an outline of his 2016 foreign policy platformPaul often builds conservative cred for these ideas by couching them as critiques of Democrats In his recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee for example he bashed Hillarys war in Libya for ushering in chaos that helped jihadi groups flourishThis is a standard noninterventionist argument  Americas allegedly humanitarian wars often produce terrible unintended consequences  that also implicitly criticizes Republican hawks But because its couched as an attack on Democrats it can play with RepublicansPaul will occasionally do something that makes it seem like hes moving in a more hawkish direction Sometimes thats a sop to political necessity Paul used to call for zeroing out US aid to Israel  an extremely unpopular position in the GOP that hes now reversedBut other times its a fakeout Paul learned from his father former Rep Ron Paul that refusing to compromise or tailor your libertarian message at all will simply lead to marginalization inside the GOP Instead hes developed a more subtle strategy repurpose classic Republican positions and tactics to endorse noninterventionist rather than hawkish views about foreign policyTake a recent amendment on defense spending Paul a longtime critic of wasteful defense spending proposed a larger defense budget  shocking even stalwart libertariansBut Paul wasnt mounting a serious campaign to hike defense spending The amendment was designed to embarrass hawkish Sen Marco Rubio a likely primary rival Pauls amendment proposed increasing spending by the exact same amount as one Rubio had proposed earlier only Paul paid for it with other domestic spending cuts which Rubio didntThis amendment is to lay down a marker that if you believe we need more funding for national defense you should show how you would pay for it Doug Stafford a senior Paul adviser told Reason The whole thing was a stunt designed to show that increasing defense spending requires tradeoffs from any Republican whos serious about the debtPaul is basically alone on these issues in the primary Virtually every plausible Republican candidate has argued that the Obama administrations major problem is that its been too unwilling to intervene forcefully around the world Paul of course thinks the oppositeIf Paul wins the primary  let alone the presidency  then the GOP and its elected officials will have to line up behind him That will mean defending his foreign policy against Democrats who will likely blast Paul from an interventionist point of viewThe Democratic criticism of Pauls big October speech shows how this dynamic would work Pauls been clear about his goal DNC Press Secretary Michael Czin told reporters before the speech He wants to see America retreat from our responsibilities around the world Republican Party organs like the RNC couldnt just take this stuff Theyd need to defend their candidate essentially forcing Republicans around the country to back Pauls noninterventionismAs Republicans defend Paul Democrats might also drift hawkish as they unite against Pauls philosophy Thats particularly true if Hillary Clinton who is already on the more interventionist side of the Democratic spectrum is the nomineeIts hard to say if a Paul nomination would transform the Republican Partys generally hawkish positions in the long run But itd be the biggest challenge to the GOPs hawkish orthodoxy in decadesThe bulk of the Republican Partys foreign policy is relatively hawkish Pauls campaign represents an intolerable threat to their dominant position in the party so hell face massive resistance from them in the coming monthsYesterday for example Bloombergs Josh Rogin reported that a new group called the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America planned to spend seven figures on an ad campaign painting Paul as soft on foreign policy particularly on Iran Rick Reed the man behind the campaign is the same guy who spearheaded the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks on John KerryReeds group is hardly the first major institutional pushback against Paul Both Sen Lindsey Graham Rep Pete King and former UN Ambassador John Bolton appear to be considering runs None really have a real shot at the nomination Its very clear as MSNBCs Benjy Sarlin reports that the entire point of their runs would be to attack Paul from the interventionist rightWhether these antiPaul campaigns succeed is an open but really important question Since the early Bush administration the GOPs hawkish factions have enjoyed essentially unchallenged control over the partys national agenda In fact there probably hasnt been this serious a challenge to Republican orthodoxy on foreign policy since the Reagan revolutionPauls announcement today then isnt just about him Its about whether the Republican Party is open to a fundamentally different way of approaching the world
