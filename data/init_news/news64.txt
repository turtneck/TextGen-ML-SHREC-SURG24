While the country has been fixated on Donald Trumps tormenting his Republican primary opponents and deeply concerned about the governments efforts to identify any confederates in the San Bernardino California killings a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents continues to examine Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of state in order to determine whether she committed any crimes and if so whether there is sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubtWhat began as an innocent Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch a DCbased public advocacy group promoting transparency in the executive branch has now become a full criminal investigation with Clinton as the likely targetThe basic facts are wellknown but the revealed nuances are important as well When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit When the State Department made the same representation to the court  as incredible as it seemed at the time  the judge accepted that representation and the case was dismissedThen The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the governments server for all of her workrelated and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state After that the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clintons emailsWhen Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails the judge ordered Clinton under penalty of perjury to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State DepartmentEventually Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails because she had wiped clean her server She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked classified while secretary of state using her private serverAll of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes For example it is a crime to steal federal property What did she steal By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails  metadata that when attached to the workrelated emails of a government employee belong to the government  she stole that data The metadata do not appear on her paper copies  hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the governmentowned metadataThis is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property She is probably already barred from public office  though this was not prominently raised when she entered the US Senate or the Department of State  because of the china silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected nongovernmental venue  her own server  and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked classified is that protected government secrets are not marked classifiedSo her statement though technically true is highly misleading The governmental designations of protected secrets are confidential secret and top secret  not classified State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secretsBack when Clinton became secretary of state on her first day in office she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets She signed a statement under penalty of perjury acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails not any stamped markings that makes them secretEarlier this week my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of topsecret materials among the 999 emails Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always topsecret whether designated as such or not And she knows thatAs well she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case When the House Select Committee on Benghazi in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans gathered emails it found emails she did not surrender to the State DepartmentLast week the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her familys foundation her husband and her soninlaw Moreover the FBI knows of a treasuretrove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributionsTwo months ago a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward At the end of the meeting it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigationAnd Clinton is the likely targetAndrew P Napolitano a former
