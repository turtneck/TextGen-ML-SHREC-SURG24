Common painkillers linked to increased heart failure risk Tuesday November 01 2016 by LJ Devon Staff Writer Tags heart failure  pain management  antioxidants NaturalNews When elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen their risk of heart failure increases This is the finding of a UK study published in the British Medical Journal  The study investigated 10 million people with an average age of 77 from the UK the Netherlands Italy and Germany Those who took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs were rushed to the hospital with heart failure 19 percent more often than those who did not take the drugs The same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of 65 but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers Dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for longterm health Regular use of NSAIDs is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life Using these overthecounter painkillers may take the edge off the pain but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place And old age is not the reason for the painFor this reason elderly patients could benefit more from natural antiinflammatory substances that work with the bodys healing process Over time giving the body phytonutrients such as astaxanthin curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than NSAIDs These plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular levelNumbing the pain is not enough and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed leading to heart failure  Pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown an imbalance or a deficiency When NSAIDs are thrown at the problem regularly there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces When the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired Better pain management essential for the elderly Flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as medicine The aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine The inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systemsNatural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population However the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants These real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress Something as simple as Siberian ginseng  Eleutherococcus senticosus  can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina This root contains a powerful combination of sterols coumarins flavonoids and polysaccharides that lessen the effect of stress on the body allowing one to adapt to high stress situations and manage pain more effectively Sources include
