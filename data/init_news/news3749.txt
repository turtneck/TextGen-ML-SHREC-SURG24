The upcoming Supreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act could wipe out insurance for millions of people covered by the presidents health care plan leaving states that didnt set up their own health care markets scrambling to subsidize coverage for those left uninsuredTwentysix of the 34 states that would be hardest hit by the ruling have GOP governors Twentytwo of the 24 Senate seats that are up for reelection in 2016 are currently held by Republicans What that means is that its the GOP  and not the White House thats working on damage controlPresident Obamas landmark legislation offers subsidized private insurance to those without access to it on the job In the Supreme Court case opponents of the law argue that its literal wording allows the government to subsidize coverage only in states that set up their own health insurance marketsThe justices will determine whether the law makes people in all 50 states eligible for federal tax subsidies  or just those who live in states that created their own health insurance marketplaces The question matters because about three dozen states opted against their own marketplace or exchange and instead rely on the US Health and Human Services Departments HealthcaregovIf the court rules against the Obama administration insurance subsidies for people in those states would be in jeopardyIf the court invalidates the subsidies in those states the results would be ugly former Kansas insurance commissioner Sandy Praeger told The Associated PressPeople who are reasonably healthy would just drop coverage she said Only the unhealthy would keep buying health care It would really exacerbate the problem of the cost of health insurancePraeger a Republican who retired this year called it a classic death spiral using a term for market collapseIn March the Supreme Court appeared divided along ideological lines after hearing the challenge that if struck down could affect up to 8 million policy holdersIf the subsidies survive the ACA will look like settled law to all but a few passionate opponents However if they are overturned the shock could carry into next years electionsHere are just a few of the potential consequencesAround the time when the court announces its decision insurers will be working to finalize premiums and plans for the coming year Contracts with the government for 2016 health law coverage have to be signed by early fall If the subsidies are overturned insurers would have to tear up their projections about markets in more than half the statesPopulous states such as Texas Florida Ohio Illinois New Jersey Georgia and Pennsylvania would be among those affectedState lawmakers could mitigate the impact by setting up their own insurance markets or exchanges But that cant be done overnightStates might try authorizing an exchange and then contracting with the federal government to run it But that sort of endrun might prompt lawsuits from opponents of the lawIn any case most state legislatures will be out of session by the summerDuring arguments Associate Justice Samuel Alito raised the possibility that the court might be able to delay the effective date of its decision Even a delay through the end of this year wouldnt buy much time Enrollment for 2016 health law plans is scheduled to start Nov 1The health law was designed as a balancing act Insurers cant turn people away because of health problems but most healthy people are required to contribute to the insurance pool and the government subsidizes most of the premium for low to middleincome householdsTake away subsidies and the other two parts become unstableThe laws requirement to carry insurance never popular would probably become the biggest target for repealMy guess is there would be overwhelming political support for the elimination of the individual mandate if people cant afford the premiums said former Sen Tom Daschle DSD who was an influential Obama adviser on health careInsurers would demand relief from provisions of the law intended to limit premium increases or they might drop out of the insurance exchanges  STICKER SHOCK FOR SELFPAY CUSTOMERSMany people still buy individual health care policies directly from an insurance company bypassing the laws markets and paying the full cost They tend to be smallbusiness owners selfemployed professionals and early retireesBut even they would not escape the tumult in states losing subsidiesThe health law created one big insurance pool in each state combining customers who purchase their policies directly with those who buy through the government market If healthy people exit the insurance exchanges in droves premiums for those buying directly would go up Some may be unable to afford the higher costIt would set off cascading events said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation The individual market would empty out as premiums rise significantlyLeading congressional Republicans have been walking a fine line opposing the law in the Supreme Court case while pledging to protect consumers if their side winsIf the subsidies are overturned Republicans will first try blaming Obama and the Democrats for writing flawed legislation and then trying to paper over problems with regulations Then theyll move ahead with a patch to appease angry constituentsA bill introduced by Sen Ron Johnson RWis would continue the subsidies for existing customers only on the federal exchange until September 2017 That would open a window for states to act but it would ultimately leave the problem for the next president and Congress Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy is a cosponsorJohnsons bill would repeal the requirements for individuals to have insurance and for larger employers to offer coverage to workersObama is unlikely to accept any of those changesThe president is likely to veto whatever we would propose because we dont have a willing partner said Sen John Barrasso RWyo leader of a GOP working group on health careThe
