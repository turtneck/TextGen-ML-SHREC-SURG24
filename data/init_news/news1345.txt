The Hillary Clinton campaign is taking some hard knocks from liberals over its maladroit attacks on Bernie Sanders singlepayer proposal In one sense the knocks are welldeserved Even if singlepayer markedly lowers medical expenditures proponents such as Larry Seidman estimate that a tax increase of at least 8 percent of GDP would likely be required to finance it Thats a heavy political lift Its about as much as the entire federal income tax on individualsYet as proponents rightly observe these taxes would replace many visible and invisible ways we now provide to support a health sector that consume more than 17 percent of our economy The experience of peer industrial democracies suggests that a welldesigned singlepayer system would be more humane and markedly less expensive than what we have right nowSuch a system would certainly be less convoluted and bureaucratically hidebound Aggressively deploying government power to rein in prices a welldesigned singlepayer system would be more fiscally disciplined and would probably be more effective in targeting resources to best promote public health Sanders deserves credit for noting the real virtues of a wellexecuted singlepayer systemIn another way though Clintons critique raises uncomfortable questions that deserve greater attention Its commonplace though true to note that singlepayer is beyond the current boundaries of American politics But what if by some miracle liberal Democrats won comprehensive victories that created a window of opportunity in which singlepayer becomes realistically possibleImagine what would happen were President Bernie Sanders to sweep into office backed by a Democratic congressional majority similar to what President Obama enjoyed in 2008 Imagine further that President Sanders were sufficiently fortunate and skilled after that victory to enact a singlepayer system I wonder how different our policy dilemmas would really be from what we now face in implementing the Affordable Care ActAs I have written at length in the Journal of Health Politics Policy and Law and draw upon here an American singlepayer system would be more complex and kludgy than many proponents have considered or admitted The source of these problems resides in American politics rather than the technocratic or ideological premises of our health care system A different system operating through the same political mechanisms would produce similar complexity and kludgeThe pitch for singlepayer is admirably simple We cover every legal resident We mail a Medicare card to everyone Everyone is covered Thats a lot easier to explain and market than it is to explain the convoluted structures of Medicaid and state marketplace plansThis is also a caricature of how such a singlepayer plan would be passed and how it would touch the lives of millions of Americans Singlepayer would immediately raise myriad intricate and divisive transition issues It would potentially uproot thousands of critical arrangements President Obama Speaker Pelosi and Sen Reid struggled to leave intactAfter all ACAs sales pitch to the healthy and insured was If you like your insurance you can keep it This pledge proved politically damaging when it could not be fully kept for several million people Singlepayer would be far more disruptive to even more peopleIts telling that no fully articulated singlepayer bill was ever drafted as an alternative to the ACA Such a bill would have been no less complicated and would probably have been more encyclopedic than the ACA was A huge reform that creates millions of winners creates millions of losers tooAs with ACA the biggest winners would be relatively disorganized lowincome people in greatest need of help The potential losers would include some of the most powerful and organized constituencies in America workers who now receive generous tax expenditures for good private coverage and affluent people who would face large tax increases to finance a singlepayer system At least some of these constituencies would need to be accommodated in messy political bargaining to get singlepayer enacted And states would have a role to play too potentially replicating the messy patchwork we got with ACA reformsSinglepayer would require a serious rewrite of state and federal relations in Medicaid and in many other matters It would radically revise the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA which strongly influences the benefit practices of large employers Singlepayer would require intricate negotiation to navigate the transition from employerbased coverage The House and Senate would be in charge of this tension and at risk of the negotiations among key legislators and committees who hold swaySinglepayer would be openly or quietly opposed by virtually the entire supply side of the medical economy We saw this dynamic during the political knife fight over ACAs public option Early versions of the public option would have allowed consumers shopping in the state marketplaces to buy into some public insurance modeled on MedicareMany stakeholders who supported other aspects of ACA noisily or quietly wanted to see the public option dead Community hospitals medical groups pharmaceutical and medical device companies feared precisely the outcome liberals hoped to see a viable public insurance product that gained broad acceptance and market share and that used Medicares tremendous market power to discipline providersThese constituencies understood and dreaded the heavy hand of government across from them at the bargaining table These constituencies helped to kill the public option They would be a force to be reckoned with in any political process that seeks to implement a singlepayer systemGiven our polarized judiciary there would be legal and constitutional challenges too Whatever fine print of the ACA found its way to the Supreme Court the real fight concerned the propriety of an expansive federal government that seeks to regulate and humanize a national health care market Constitutional conservatives reject this vision of American government A singlepayer system would engage even more contentious issues of federalism and the reach of national governmentSome progressives hope that singlepayer could provide an attractive replacement for the grubby pathdependent logrolling that now dominates our 3 trillion health care political economy No viable singlepayer program will replace these grubby politics Thats logically impossible because such a program must be produced through that very same process Barring a historically comprehensive defeat of Republicans at every level of American government advocates for expanded health coverage will face this discomfiting realityPassing a singlepayer plan requires precisely the same interest group bargaining and logrolling required to pass the ACA The resulting policies will thus replicate some of the very same scars defects and kludge that bedevil the ACAProgressives should still push for basic reforms that improve our current system I supported the public option in 2009 I still do I hope it resurfaces in some form particularly for older participants in the state marketplaces It may open a pathway to a true singlepayer If it doesnt  which I suspect it will not  it might still provide a valuable alternative and source of pricing discipline within our pathological health care marketWhatever policy one supports we must actually consider how this imperfect and messy process will actually play out Theres no immaculate conception in American politics
