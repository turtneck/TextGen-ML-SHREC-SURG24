 Barrel Bomb The Cataclysmic Close of Campaign 2016 By Chris Floyd Well here we are at the bottom of the barrel under forty feet of slag In a few days time well know our fate the fivealarm fire of Trump Rule oh how those police unions are chomping at the bit or the Clinton Age of HyperWar oh how those neocons are chomping at the bit In either case the entrenched coagulation of corporate interests and war profiteers that have strangled the peace prosperity and prospects of the American people will not be budged an inch The change that people are so desperately hungry for  so hungry that that some of them might well elect an Establishment insider whose sinister clowning makes him appear to be a rebel  will not come Thus their bitterness will grow deeper more sour erupting more and more often in physical violence from militarized police against protestors from Trumpempowered racists if he wins or loses from extremist militias from angry maddened people on every side And of course there will be more  much more  of the horrific neverending globespanning violence of the bipartisan Terror War that churns on and on no matter who is sitting temporarily in the White HouseTheres no use in pretending thats not what we face But theres also no use in pretending that this situation is somehow sui generis  some terribly unlucky conflation of unforeseen circumstances coming together at this particular time It is in fact the culmination and embodiment of the deliberate choices of the most powerful forces in society the choices to enrich themselves beyond all reason and extend their military and economic dominance over the earthIt doesnt matter that many if not most of the practitioners and functionaries of this system believe in its rightness It doesnt matter that brutal neoliberal nostrums and extremist imperial notions have become religious dogmas for those who see themselves as the meritocracy It doesnt matter if the leaders and factotums genuinely believe in the exceptionalism they preach or if they are cynical powerseekers It doesnt matter if they actually believe their rapacious financial machinations are reflections of the natural law of the the market that will eventually benefit all or if they know themselves to be what they really are ugly souls disfigured by greed The end result has been the same a long series of deliberate choices by a bipartisan elite that have hollowed out the lives and communities and futures of millions of Americans and created a living hell of war ruin and hatred over much of the earthThis is a system that has delegitimized itself a system that has undermined its own institutions Through its own actions it has rotted out the foundations of trust and reason which once upheld it Some might say Oh but theres been a decadeslong concentrated effort by rightwing billionaires and corporate forces to foment ideological and religious extremism to undermine the legitimacy of secular government which might restrict their profiteering or let more people have a share in power And thats true But its been accompanied at every step by the collusion and cowardice of the putative opposition The socalled New Democrats exemplified by the Clintons jettisoned concern for the common good to embrace centrist and technocratic policies ie to adopt the neoliberal dogma that unbridled pursuit of private profit by a connected elites will somehow someday lead to general prosperity The idea that the party should fight to improve the lives of ordinary people in the here and now to fight for their quality of life in a genuine substantive way came to be seen as oldhat a quaint and fusty notion of hasbeens and dreamers who didnt understand the way the world really worked A true savvy moderate knows you must compromise every ideal show yourself to be a willing and avid servant of the monied interests and the militarists in order to gain power so you can make a few cosmetic changes around the edges a few little social improvements here and there but only  of course  in partnership with private interests but never ever challenge the system at its coreThis is the only deal in town outright unvarnished rightwing rule or simpering cowardly moderate management of a violent rapacious system Thats been the choice on offer since 1976 Thats the choice on offer today The only difference is that the system has metastasized to a monstrous degree over the years lacking any genuine opposition the system has grown more violent more rapaciousEstablishment collusion  and Democratic cowardice  finally and completely degraded and delegitimized the American electoral process 16 years ago when the Supreme Court  with two members who had direct family ties to the Bush campaign  stopped a recount that would have resulted in the actual winner of the election to take office This outrageous action was accepted by every single organ and institution of the American system With the momentary exception of the Black Congressional Caucus whose members tried in vain to get a single Democratic senator to challenge the result Instead Americans were encouraged to applaud the fact that power had changed hands without tanks in the street That is we were to celebrate that an actual coup detat had taken place before our eyes without the slightest show of resistanceOnce in place the coup regime  staffed at the highest levels by extremists who a year before had publicly called for a vast militarization of American policy and society even if the public had to be galvanized by a new Pearl Harbor  led the nation into a disastrous war based on false pretenses a vast crime that not only killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people but has led directly to unbridled turmoil extremism conflict and corruption around the world The elitesupported coup regime instituted torture programs and death squads and launched an orgy of war profiteering unprecedented in world history The regime then presided over the worst economic collapse in generationsNot a single member of the regime was ever tried  or even investigated at even the most preliminary level  for a single crime committed during its time in power There were no highprofile Congressional investigations into the hideous carnage and ruin and instability they wrought not even a Chilcot Commission into the origins of the war as the UK belatedly launched Instead the regimes leaders and top factotums were heaped with honors and wealth Today their endorsement is eagerly sought  and gained  by the progressive Democratic candidate for presidentIn 2008 the desperate electorate turned to a figure presented to them as an outsider who would at last bring real change He had the trappings of difference  a black man with a Muslim name who spoke eloquently of peace and social justice who most people thought was far to the left but voted for him anyway But Barack Obama was of course a meritocratic centrist to his core Riding an enormous wave of popularity and a strong Congressional majority he proceeded to bail out Wall Street fraudsters and finaglers with tax money and create a health care system based on the plan of a rightwing thinktank that prioritized corporate profit  and probably killed the chance for a genuinely public health care system for generations if not for good He also doubled down on the Terror War expanding it to more countries extended Bushs death squads helped destroy nations like Libya and Yemen thus spawning more chaos and terror expanded illegal surveillance of the populace and the world to an extent beyond the wildest dreams of the Stasi or KGB And after saving Big Money from itself and securing the guaranteed profits of the healthcareinsurance corporate complex he spent most of his time on the domestic front trying to strike a grand bargain with Republicans to cut Social Security and MedicareAgain all hopes of any real change were thwarted So now the nation swings from being ready to embrace a perceived leftist to the brink of voting in a bellicose rightist as it seeks the genuine change no one will give them Of course after the scorchedearth tactics of bipartisan neoliberalism and the inevitable moral degradation and brutalization that comes from year after year after year of vicious aggressive war the choice for Trump is more nihilistic Its as if people believe positive change is no longer possible  so lets tear everything down and see what happens This is the actual open philosophy of the Breitbart gang who are now directing Trumps campaignEven if Clinton wins this nihilism will still be rampant And given that she happily embodies the bipartisan Establishment now roundly despised on all sides for its many depredations the nihilism will grow even worse  especially as she has given no indication whatsoever that she will even try to make substantive changes in the neoliberalmilitarist system that is strangling us Quite the contrarySo yes this has been a campaign like no other  but mostly because it has brought the systematic decay of the Republic into the sharpest possible relief and has shown more clearly than before that the neoliberalmilitarist ascendency offers no hope for a better life a better world indeed that it offers nothing at all  except more violence more bitterness more ruin more degradation for us allChris Floyd blogs at
