Democrats however should be concerned for a different reason The last consecutive twoterm presidents from the same party were James Madison and James Monroe who were both DemocraticRepublicans That transition occurred before the formation of our modern twoparty systemThe 2020 election is one Democrats cannot afford to lose It is a census year which means the future of the House will be determined for the next decade It is also highly possible that at least two or three seats will open on the Supreme Court given the ages of the justicesmore than are likely to open between 2016 and 2020 If the Democrats do not win the GOP will have a solid hold on government for at least another 10yearsAnd that raisesone very important question Do Democratic voters really want to hitch their wagon to four years of a centerright candidate like Hillary ClintonThe Democratic Party as a whole is moving to the leftalbeit slowly Elizabeth Warren would never have gotten elected in the 90s let alone become as influential as she has It can easily be said that the Democrats are no longer the party of the Clintons the New Democrats and are instead the party of Elizabeth Warren If Hillary Clinton wins the nod in 2016 and manages to win the general it is unlikely she will be able to excite the base of her own party in four yearsas the DNC may slowly be realizing Shes a hard enough sell now in spite of every effort chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has expended on her behalf Many on the left will not turn out to vote for Clintonin fact a new poll showed that 20percentof Democrats would defect and vote Trump over Hillary in a general electionClintons problems start with image More Americans mistrust her than trust her This may be due to her various scandals especially her private email server But it probably also has something to do with the fact that she is politically expedient A look at her campaign strategy throughout her career is telling In this regard she is nearly indistinguishable from the GOP In 2008 her campaign reportedlycirculated a picture of Barack Obama dressed as a Somali elderwithout providing context for the image in a seeming effort to stir fears that the nowpresident was a Muslim In this current election cycle Clinton has relied on Republican talking points to attack Bernie Sanders Specifically she cited Rupert Murdochs Wall Street Journals faulty analysis of the cost of his domestic plan Clinton has gone as far as attacking him for proposing universal health carea move 2008 Hillary called out as a Republican tacticClinton has also resorted to Republican talking points to justify opposing a 15 minimum wage Though she calls them her greatest enemies her argument relies on the same false premise as the GOPs it will cost jobs First Clinton purposefully ignores that a raise to 15 per hour would be gradual Additionally she pays no heed to the fact that evidence indicating such increases will cost jobs is thin In fact studies overwhelmingly suggest that minimum wage hikes have no impact on employmentAdditionally many on the left worry that there is no way for Democrats to know what Hillary Clinton will morph into given her numerous flipflops And for all of her talk about fighting for the middle class she has an uncomfortably cozy relationship with Wall Street and powerful private industries oil private prisons big banks cable companies etcBut Clintons problems run much deeper than impressions of her character As a candidate Hillary is closer to George HW Bush or Ronald Reagan than to the heart of the Democratic Party FDR Progressives know this about her She exists outoftimepropped up by a Democratic establishment similarly stuck on Third Way politics Hillary is a New Democrat in 2016 shes caught between two narratives the GOPReagan narrative that government is too big and inherently inefficient and the Democratic narrative that government can and should work for all to solve the problems we face as a countryClintons background creates a disconnect between her policies and those of her partyHillarys strongest issue is foreign policy given her years of experience at the State Department Unfortunately her foreign policy ideas dont fitwith many on the left Put simply she is an interventionist hawk In 2008 Barack Obama compared her to George W Bush and that comparison still seems appropriate She did after all vote for the Iraq War and support the use of torture on detainees Although she has called her war vote a mistake we must look at it in its proper context When we consider the initiatives she pushed at the State Department the bombing of Libya arming the Syrian rebels and selling arms to Clinton Foundation donors as well as her current plans like the noflyzone in Syria it seems less of a oneoff and more like part of a patternClintons strategy is to deal with ISIS is nearly indistinguishable from Marco Rubios defeat ISIS rather than contain them by forming a coalition with our allies to take back territory sending in ground troops disrupting their recruitment and ramping up airstrikesHillarys plan like those of the Republicans is predicated on the idea that by taking out ISIS US involvement in the region can endWhat Clintons and the Republican plans fail to take into account is political culture Changing political culture within a generation is impossible let alone changing it in a part of the world Westerners as a rule barely understand where people mistrust and resent us and where democratic tradition is a novel conceptThe Middle East and North Africa MENA is not the only part of the globe where intervention is Hillarys modus operandi Her involvement in legitimizing the violent coup regime in Honduras indicates that as president interference would also define her Latin America policyBesides intervention Clintons foreign policy prioritizes free markets She appears to view the world through the lens of how much multinational business rather than domestic companies or workers benefits Though she has now flipflopped on both the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership TPP her years of support for each suggest her shift is politically motivatedAll things considered it is safe to call Clinton a neoconservativeEconomically speaking in spite of touting herself as a progressive who likes to get things done Clinton is essentially a moderate Republicanwhich makes economic progressives angry Her capital gains tax proposal does not increase longterm capital gains taxes and instead targets shortterm investments This might sound solid on paper but as Ive said before it will impact new investors and the middle class while preserving the status quo where billionaires who keep the majority of their assets wrapped up in long term investments pay lower rates than their secretaries She is also against reinstating GlassSteagall and breaking up the banksinstead opting for a game of regulatory catchup to monitor shadow banking Her plan barely tackles symptoms while leaving the underlying illness untouched To make matters worse this issue is timesensitive as there may be another financial crisis brewing with subprime auto loans A collapse would spell disaster for the Democratic Party should it hit after eight years of President Obama with another Democrat in the Oval OfficeHowever Hillary seems unconcerned Shes even attacked proponents of a new GlassSteagall on the premise that her policy is strongerthe only plan that tackles shadow banking As Zach Carter of the Huffington Post explains in his recent article titled Hillary Clinton Is Not Telling the Truth About Wall Street her claims are dishonest Shadow banking is a direct consequence of the toobigtofail model The concentration of financial power in just six institutions is the fundamental problem we face The size of the banks allowed them to exert unprecedented influence over rating agencies like SP or Moodys due to the payperrating model This undermined the integrity of our entire rating system At the same time lenders were taking insurance policies out on their loans and products The size of the banks and by extension the sheer volume of the insured debt is why when borrowers began defaulting insurers like AIG went under All of this could have been avoided with a decentralized banking system like the one Bernie Sanders is proposing Clintons stance on social programs and spending is equally disappointing to many liberals and progressives Though she used to she no longer supports universal healthcare She explained her flipflop during one of the few sanctioned DNC presidential debates by saying the revolution never came Hillary is also against expanding Social Security She does not support free college tuition for all Instead she feels it should essentially be a meanstested welfare program And speaking of welfare Hillary has stood by her husbands signing of the disastrous Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 aka welfare reform deeming it necessary in spite of evidence that it caused a spike in extreme poverty particularly in minority communities This bill was a Republican initiativepart of the Contract With America Clinton isnt exactly Nancy Reagan on drugs but her evolution on marijuanacannabis has not come very far since the 90sand thats difficult for many young Democrats to acceptClinton also scares many environmentalists She used to be in favor of the Keystone Pipeline until it became a political liability for her and her State Department helped spread fracking to the rest of the world Shealso has trouble convincing some people of her support for LGBTQ equality It wasnt until 2013 that she fully embraced samesex marriage Prior to that she believed that marriage was a sacred bond between a man and a woman She also supported the Defense of Marriage Act DOMA She hasnt even been consistent on gun control Sure Clintontalks a big game now about background checks and modest reforms supporting President Obama in his executive actions But in 2008 she was Annie Oakley accusing Obama of being hostile to hunters rights Everything about Hillary Clintons record suggests that she will negotiate from the centerrightleaving only one direction to go in compromising with Republicans further right Like her husband before her shell likely use social programs and financial reform as bargaining chips After all shes already given up on universal health care Her commitment to campaign finance reform is also doubtful considering how much she is raising for this campaign from big donors Time Warner and Morgan Stanley are both in her top 10 Clinton is not the candidate Democrats should back This leaves the Democratic Party with two options 1 Nominate Bernie Sanders Hes the candidate drawing the largest crowds the candidate beating the GOP field by the widest margins in a majority of polls the candidate Americans feel is honest If anyone has a shot at breaking the trend of backandforth in presidential elections it is Sanders for the simple reason that he has been an independent for the majority of his political career His outsider image gives him the greatest chance at beating the odds against consecutive twoterm presidents from the same party 2 Let a Republican have four years With a Hillary ticket this scenario isnt out of the questionespecially if the candidate is Donald Trump who can run on the fact that he donated to Clinton Theres a cold logic in this move In 2020 Democrats can run someone like Elizabeth Warren who excites the base Coming off of four years with the GOP a twoterm presidency would be easily attainable with the added benefit that any economic downturns that happen between now and then would be blamed on Republicans Even if one hit during the first term of the newly elected Democrat the GOP would still take the fall Also worth mentioning people typically vote down the party linewhich is good for Democrats considering it is a census year 2020 could see the Democrats take the presidency the House and the Senateand with the likelihood that two or three seats will open on the court theyd control all three branches of government The downside to this option is that Senate Democrats would have to obstruct for four years Such a move will exact a political cost but as the Republicans have shown obstruction isnt a death knell in elections Of course the main drawback is the fact that people will suffer as budgets are slashed Theres also the high probability that liberals will lose one seat on the Supreme Court as well as federal judge appointmentsall of which be damaging The only mitigating factor is that as previously mentioned theres strong possibility that more seats will open up on the SCOTUS between 2020 and 2024 than between 2016 to 2020 Bernie or Bust is undoubtedly a controversial position as many Democrats insist that if Hillary Clinton gets the nod she should be elected president This argument relies on thelesseroftwoevils mindset vote Hillary because shes better than the GOP However with all things weighed and considered it is clear that Clinton should neither be the Democratic nominee nor the president and that her differences with her opponents are not so stark The 2020 election cycle is far too important to risk it on a candidate who can barely relate to her own party nowespecially taking into account historical trends Democrats must ask themselves where a Hillary presidency leaves the country in four years Would her halfmeasures be enough that they would feel comfortable handing the keys over to the GOP in 2020 That is why Bernie or Bust is the real lesseroftwoevils option
