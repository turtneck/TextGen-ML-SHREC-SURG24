This item has been updatedHouse Republican leaders abruptly dropped plans late Wednesday to vote on an antiabortion bill amid a revolt by female GOP lawmakers concerned that the legislations restrictive language would once again spoil the partys chances of broadening its appeal to women and younger votersIn recent days as many as two dozen Republicans had raised concerns with the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act that would ban abortions after the 20th week of a pregnancy Sponsors said that exceptions would be allowed for a woman who is raped but she could only get the abortion after reporting the rape to law enforcementA vote had been scheduled for Thursday to coincide with the annual March for Life a gathering that brings hundreds of thousands of antiabortion activists to Washington to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortionBut Republican leaders dropped those plans after failing to win over a bloc of lawmakers led by Reps Rene Ellmers RNC and Jackie Walorski RInd who had raised concernsThe House will vote instead Thursday on a bill prohibiting federal funding for abortions  a more innocuous antiabortion measure that the Republicancontrolled chamber has passed beforeA senior GOP aide said that concerns had been raised by men and women Members that still need to be worked out The aide who wasnt authorized to speak publicly about the plans said in an email that Thursdays vote will help advance the prolife cause and that GOP leaders remain committed to continue working through the process on the Pain Capable bill to make sure it too is successfulOther aides said that leaders were eager to avoid political fallout from a large number of female Republicans voting against an abortion bill in the early stages of the new GOPcontrolled CongressThe dispute erupted into the open in recent days and once again demonstrated the changing contours of the expanded House Republican caucus The 246member caucus is seeing rifts on issues where it once had more unity Thats because there are now more moderate Republicans from swing districts who could face tough reelections in 2016 when more Democratic and independent voters are expected to vote in the presidential electionAlready this month a large bloc of moderate Republicans voted against a spending bill that would repeal President Obamas changes to immigration policy enacted by executive action More than two dozen Republicans from metropolitan areas with large immigrant populations also voted against an amendment to the bill that would end temporary legal protections to the children of illegal immigrantsThe abortion bill pulled Wednesday night was strongly opposed by Democrats and womens rights groups But a similar version of the bill easily passed the GOPcontrolled House in 2013 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy had vowed to bring it up for a voteRep Trent Franks RAriz the bills lead sponsor had predicted Wednesday that his proposal would easily pass because it has overwhelming support among the American peopleBut Ellmers and Walorski had withdrawn their support and voiced concerns during meetings at the annual Republican policy retreat in Hershey Pa Ellmers did so again Wednesday at a closeddoor House GOP meeting in the basement of the Capitol according to several people who attendedSeeking to rebut growing criticism from conservatives Ellmers said on Facebook Wednesday evening that she would vote for the bill I have and will continue to be a strong defender of the prolife community she wroteBut she had recently asked leaders to reconsider holding the vote noting that Republicans had faced harsh criticism from Democrats in recent years for mounting a war on women by passing restrictive abortion legislation and other similar billsThe first vote we take or the second vote or the fifth vote shouldnt be on an issue where we know that millennialssocial issues just arent as important to them she said in an interview with National JournalThe opposition set off a scramble Wednesday among top GOP leaders concerned about how several no votes could be perceived by their party and the general publicWith word of the opposition spreading Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif and Majority Whip Steve Scalise RLa conferred nervously off the House floor after a midday vote From there Scalise headed to a meeting in his office suite with Ellmers Walorski Rep Marsha Blackburn RTenn  a lead cosponsor of the bill  and several other womenIn a caucus dominated by men a meeting with top leaders requested and attended almost exclusively by women is a rare sightOnebyone they exited the meeting and remained tightlippedWalorski said the dispute is no different than conversations that occur before votes on other legislation When pressed to explain her specific concerns she rushed off I cant I cantOthers seen exiting included Reps Kristi Noem RSD Diane Black RTenn Jaime Herrera Beutler RWash Vicky Hartzler RMo Elise Stefanik RNY Barbara Comstock RVa Susan Brooks RInd and Ann Wagner RMo Hartzler had already signaled her support for the bill to reporters The other women declined to commentThe impasse prompted Tony Perkins who leads the conservative Family Research Council to visit the Capitol Wednesday to meet with ScaliseHe cited a lot of misconceptions for causing lastminute disputes with the bill Were talking about a measure that would limit abortions after five months he said America is only one of four nations that allows abortions throughout the entire pregnancyWomens rights groups and Democrats have denounced the legislation as dangerous and unconstitutional In a message to group members the National Organization forWomen cited federal statistics showing that just 35 percent of rape victims report the incident to police  and said that the bill will do nothing to increase the rate of reportingIlyse Hogue president of NARAL ProChoice America cheered the decision of GOP leadersI never thought I would see the day that the Tea Partyled House of Representatives would wake up to the fact that their priorities  outright abortion bans are way out of touch with the American people she said in a statement The GOP drafted a bill so extreme and so out of touch with the voters that even their own membership could not supportThe 22 women in the House GOP caucus are well aware that many of their male colleagues have earned the ire of Democrats and womens rights groups for talking about rape and womens rightsAt the same closeddoor retreat two years ago Republican pollsters implored GOP lawmakers to stop discussing rape on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill The warnings came after several candidates faced heat in 2012  including former congressmanTodd Akin RMo who said a woman could terminate a pregnancy resulting from a legitimate rape and Richard Mourdock a GOP candidate for an Indiana Senate seat who said that babies resulting from rape were a gift from GodFranks who is an ardent antiabortion activist has been known to take an aggressive stance on the issue in the past often clashing with Democrats opposed to his proposals But on Wednesday he took a notably softer tone as he acknowledged the concerns of his colleaguesIve maintained an open heart because I realize that all of the people involved have sincere perspectives and have knowledge and experiences and information that I dont have he said So my heart is open  my desire here is not a political victory it is to try to somehow be part of catalyzing an awakening in America to where we finally see the humanity of these little victims and the inhumanity of whats happening to them
