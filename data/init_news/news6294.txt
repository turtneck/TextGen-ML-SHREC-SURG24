By failing to disclose his donations to the Clinton Foundation George Stephanopoulos has damaged his credibility and tarnished his networkBut you know something Hes got plenty of companyWhat an awful couple of years its been for the news business even by our alreadytattered standardsWhile ABCs chief anchor has landed himself in a heap of trouble this comes at a time when NBCs chief anchor Brian Williams is serving a sixmonth suspension for fabricating an Iraq war tale and possibly embellishing other reporting exploits And it comes weeks after Rolling Stone had to retract its horrifyingly irresponsible tale of a gang rape at the University of VirginiaWhen these episodes erupt critics carp about how this or that organization has suffered a grievous blow Whats often missed is that all of us who practice journalism suffer as well that it reinforces public doubts about whether the business is riddled with bias and conflicts of interestThis was true back when Janet Cooke committed her fraud at the Washington Post It was true when Stephen Glass was making up a bunch of articles at the New Republic It was true when I exposed the serial fabrications of Jayson Blair at the New York Times and Jack Kelley at USA Today It was true when CBS had to retract Lara Logans 60 Minutes story on Benghazi And its true every time theres a new instance of plagiarismWe all make mistakes myself included and how you handle those mistakes is crucial Stephanopoulos didnt realize he couldnt be giving money to the family foundation of the guy he used to work for whose wife is running for president especially when he was covering the uproar over its tangled finances But he also misjudged the negative reaction and his initial statement apologized only for the lack of disclosure A day later he realized he had to apologize on camera and for making the 75000 donations as well The former White House official also bowed out of ABCs Republican presidential debate although his hand may have been forced by GOP demands to yank the debate from the networkWhen Williams was found to have invented the story of being shot at in a helicopter over Iraq he issued a botched apology and said hed be taking a few days off Only later did NBC launch an investigation and remove him from Nightly News for six monthsSome of this gets caught up in the ideological wars as liberals would surely include Mother Jones account of exaggerated talk about reporting by Bill OReilly who has vehemently denied the allegations and denounced the accusersThe crux of Stephanopoulos problem is that hes never fully been able to shake his partisan past as a Clinton Democratand deepened that wound by giving money to the one charity that should have been offlimits to himOf course the cable networks have hired plenty of political operatives David Axelrod Robert Gibbs Jay Carney Karl Rove but theyre in the commentary business And of course some people have made the transition from politics to straight newsTim Russert who worked for Mario Cuomo and Pat Moynihan did it but he was an NBC executive before taking over Meet the Press and was famously tough on both sides Tony Snow had been a speechwriter for George HW Bush before eventually taking over Fox News Sundayand of course leaving to become Bush 43s press secretaryAs someone who started interviewing Stephanopoulos in 1992 I can say that it takes a long time for a former political adviser to win the audiences trust as a journalistand just a short time to lose it Viewers will have to judge in the future whether George is being as unbiased as possible but theyve already rendered their verdict on the mainstream mediaClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
