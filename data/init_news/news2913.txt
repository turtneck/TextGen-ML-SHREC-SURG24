By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon Oct 31st 2016 at 759 am In Donald Trump you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day up to 37 on some days Share on Twitter Print This Post CNNs Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a uniquely factchallenged candidate which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star  who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper  Dale says most factcheckers look at two or three things Trump says meticulously factchecks them and posts an article but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day up to 37 on some days For example Dale tallied 35 Trump lies on Tuesday October 25 Donald Trump said 35 false things yesterday TrumpCheck pictwittercomEwfYFEDFx9  Daniel Dale ddale8 October 26 2016 Which as Dale pointed out  followed his recordtying 37 false claims on Monday not coincidentally a day on which Trump called fact checkers scum Watch courtesy of CNNs Reliable Sources There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty DDale8 says Trump lies a lot more than Clinton httpstcoKp6KvPNtmO  Reliable Sources ReliableSources October 30 2016 The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton As Dale told Stelter There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty Trump says Dale is not a normal political liar For example look at the presidential debates  in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton Dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent Trump also lies pointlessly argues Dale explaining to Brian Stelter that He gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts This was Mark Cubans complaint of course that Trump has no interest in learning In the end it matters less why Trump lies than that he does especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate And it is working This is a trope frequently repeated by Trumps supporters You can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect The lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected and observational bias takes care of the rest The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality and as Dale tweeted last night If Trump loses the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long hard base reeducation Given the GOPs history with facts good luck with that Image Screen capture Twitter
