 Purchasing Loyalty with Foreign Aid By Jacob G Hornberger FFF   A dispute that is taking place between Saudi Arabia and Egypt indirectly demonstrates the nature of US foreign aid After dumping a walloping 25 billion in foreign aid to help the Egyptian military dictatorships economic woes the Saudis are hopping madWhyBecause last month in the United Nations contrary to Saudi Arabias wishes Egypt voted in favor of a Russian resolution on SyriaIn the world of foreign aid thats a super nono When a regime has received 25 billion from another regime it is expected to vote the way its benefactor wants it to voteIn a remarkable admission regarding foreign aid at least in this particular case the New York Times  in an article on the matter wrote The Saudis may have thought they were buying loyalty  The Times article pointed out that to punish the Egyptians for their independence The stateowned Saudi oil company Aramco postponed a promised shipment of 700000 tons of discounted oil in October and the spokesman for Egypts oil ministry said the fate of Novembers shipment remains unknownAlthough the New York Times would probably be reluctant to describe US foreign aid in the same way thats precisely what it is  a way to purchase loyalty from foreign regimes including dictatorships The US government loves to put foreign regimes on the federal dole because once that happens US officials know that they have bought them lock stock and barrel Once a regime is on the dole it inevitably becomes dependent on itThe racket works like this The IRS collects money from hardpressed US taxpayers which US officials use to send millions of dollars in foreign aid to foreign regimesThe foreign regimes then use the money to buy weaponry to fortify their hold on power or to just to line the pockets of government officialsIt doesnt matter to US officials what the tyrants do to people within their country They can abuse them incarcerate them torture them or kill them None of that matters to US officialsWhat matters to US officials is the international arena Like votes in the UN Or public support for US invasions coups interventions assassinations kidnappings and the like Or joining coalitions of the willing Thats when US officials expect loyalty in the form of blind support which was what Saudi Arabia was expecting from the Egyptian tyrantsAnd heaven help any nation that takes the wrong position The US will respond in the same way the Saudis have responded to the Egyptians It will threaten to do very bad things to the nation that opposes a US invasion coup or resolution within the UN When a nation is on the US dole US officials expect loyaltyAmericans cant do anything about foreign aid by the Saudi government But they can do something about US foreign aid What they should do is demand that it be ended immediatelyJacob G Hornberger is founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation He was born and raised in Laredo Texas and received his BA in economics from Virginia Military Institute and his law degree from the University of Texas He was a trial attorney for twelve years in Texas He also was an adjunct professor at the University of Dallas where he taught law and economics In 1987 Mr Hornberger left the practice of law to become director of programs at the Foundation for Economic Education
