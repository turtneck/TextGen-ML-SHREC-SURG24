Because of Hillary Clinton EmergencyContraception Is Banned In Honduras Because of Hillary Clinton EmergencyContraception Is Banned In Honduras By Eric Zuesse Of course one of Hillary Clintons proudest claims is that as the US Secretary of State she championed reproductive choice throughout the world She championed it in words but her actions were sometimes in the opposite direction and there is perhaps no nation where her actions as the US Secretary of State had a bigger impact than Honduras which case will therefore be examined and her impact on this documented here The reason that the morningafter pill which enables raped women to avoid becoming pregnant from a rape was made illegal by the government that now exists in Honduras is that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton persuaded President Barack Obama not to terminate US financial aid to the coupregime that came into power there on 28 June 2009 Without that aid the democratically elected President would quickly have been restored Though the US Ambassador in Honduras told Secretary of State Clinton that there was no way in which that coup was legal and that consequently it undoubtedly was a coup and that existing US law therefore required US funding of the Honduran government to cease immediately she ignored the law and she ignored everything except her friend Lanny Davis the lobbyist whom the coupplotters had hired to represent them to Democrats a different lobbyist was hired to represent them to the congressional Republicans President Obama took his Secretary of States advice and refused to enforce the law and Hillary Clinton publicly praised what the regime was doing The regime was condemned throughout Latin America because the coup which consisted of the local aristocracy or oligarchs overthrew the democratically elected President of Honduras who had wanted a landreform law to be introduced Immediately after the coup that overthrew him the newly installed regime allowed the aristocrats paid thugs to murder anyone who tried to lead the opposition and therefore the regime that had been imposed by Hondurass aristocracy and kept in power by Americas aristocracy has remained stable since However after the coup Honduras has had the worlds highest murderrate Thus its a stable but now extraordinarily violent country Detailed documentation of every allegation in this paragraph can be found in the Honduras section of this article I earlier wrote about Hillary Clintons Six ForeignPolicy Catastrophes  and that section on Honduras in turn links to 68 sources which provide the sometimes gruesome details regarding Hillary Clintons impact upon the lives of the Honduran people since the coup However that article didnt mention this matter concerning contraception rape and abortion and so the present article will be an extension from that earlier one dealing specifically with Hillary Clintons impact upon familyplanning and reproductive choice in Honduras One feature of the new USbacked regime was the imposition of draconian fundamentalist laws against contraception and intensifying the abortionban On 13 February 2012 the Center for Reproductive Rights headlined Honduras Supreme Court Upholds Absolute Ban on Emergency Contraception Opens Door to Criminalize Women and Medical Professionals and reported The Honduras Supreme Court has upheld the countrys absolute ban on emergency contraception which would criminalize the sale distribution and use of the morningafter pill  imposing punishment for offenders equal to that of obtaining or performing an abortion which in Honduras is completely restricted By banning and criminalizing emergency contraception Honduras is telling the world it would rather imprison the women of its country than provide them with safe and effective birth control said Luisa Cabal director of international legal programs at the Center for Reproductive Rights Todays decision from the Honduras Supreme Court blatantly disregards womens fundamental reproductive rights and completely ignores the respected medical opinion of experts around the globe It will cause significant harm in the lives countless women and doctors across the country  Consequently the hell in Honduras has been accentuated by punishment of women who have been raped and punishment of doctors and pharmacists who try to help them The President whom Hillary Clinton Barack Obama and the ten main aristocratic families of Honduras  overthrew and prohibited from running for President ever again Manuel Zelaya had in April 2009 vetoed a law that the Honduran legislature controlled by those ten families plus another 15 or so  had just passed to ban the morningafter pill So that law didnt enter into force until the USimposed regime restored it However the restoration of the ban wasnt final until this decision was handed down by the Honduran Supreme Court As Amnesty International said at that time  On 1 February the Supreme Court in Honduras upheld a decree imposing an absolute ban on emergency contraception This decree was vetoed in May 2009 by the former President on grounds that it conflicted with the Constitution The Supreme Court has now concluded that the decree is constitutional and that Congress can begin to develop laws enforcing a ban of the emergency contraceptive pill on the basis of its alleged abortive nature The World Health Organization PanAmerican Health Organization and several other expert bodies have clearly stated that the emergency contraceptive pill is not abortive it is a form of contraception that works by ensuring the egg is inaccessible and impeding fertilization The criminalization of the emergency contraceptive pill will have appalling consequences For example rape victims will be unable to prevent pregnancy  And so it has been in Honduras During the period since the 28 June 2009 Honduran USbacked coup the hell in Honduras has been so bad that Honduras has become one of the top sources of illegal immigration into the United States The worldrecordhigh murderrates and crushing poverty with no opportunity for the public to move up in the world other than through becoming one of the paid enforcers for the aristocrats which often also entails leading the nowbooming druggangs there has essentially forced out of Honduras millions of residents and many of them have escaped through Mexico into the United States in order to be able to have a decent life rather than murder and be murdered Hillary Clintons opponent in the US Presidential campaign Donald Trump never talks about the hell that Clinton and Obama have been imposing around the world except regarding nonChristianmajority countries such as Libya and he seems to view illegal immigrants as if US foreign policies have nothing to do with creating the problems that those people are facing but there is no indication that he would continue those policies which have been causing them to be illegal immigrants here To the contrary his antiinterventionist foreignpolicy proposals would be inconsistent with coups and invasions regarding any foreign country whose government is not posing an imminent threat to US national security Trumps foreignpolicy proposals are not in any way favorable toward those of Hillary Clinton who is simply an extreme version of Obamas worst policyorientations And Americas own Federation of American Scientists has stated that Obama is lying in order to justify his policy now to ignore existing inforce nuclear treaties with Russia as being supposedly not violations of them So though he may not be as much of a neoconservative as she is he basically is one too His aggression against Russia is subtle  but forceful  Consequently at least regarding foreign policy a President Trump would be authentic change irrespective of whether a particular voter would approve of that change as opposed to continuing Americas existing foreign policy but in a more extreme way Among other things a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to retain the statusquo in Honduras and around the world but to go much farther in the same direction A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to change that statusquo  to change and in some important respects reverse  that direction  The biggest impact of this election will be on foreign including both economic and military policy Even domestically within the United States the difference between the two candidates on foreign policies will have a much bigger impact including possibly even nuclear war  than will the other policyareas which the general public erroneously think will have a bigger impact upon their lives and their future than will foreign policies And here are quoted recent reports in the Washington Post  Spiegel  Huffington Post  and other serious media discussing her preparing her coming Administrations plans and personnel for a war with Russia and Obama is right now setting everything up for her to be able to start the war as soon as possible Regardless of whether the American public know it the main impact of this Presidential election will be on foreign policy including on the immense impacts that foreign policy will have domestically So this is not the time when the US will be progressing but instead regressing and intelligent voters will be aiming to minimize the harms rather than to achieve progress Progress at this stage so late in the game is still being hopedfor only by some fools who happen to be also progressives Any intelligent progressive at this late stage is focused entirely upon minimizing the harm And the maximum harm could happen with surprising rapidity Back in 1961 the estimation of experts was that  as one of the few who spoke publicly stated  A nuclear war between the United States and Russia would be all over in 24 or 48 hours because both sides would let go with their full atomic arsenals The estimates today are far more precise but unpublished and theyre all well under an hour  some as low as 20 minutes There wouldnt be any surrender nor any armistice There would only be the end of civilization  and unspeakable misery including details that are ignored by the major media such as this  until practically everyone is dead from starvation if nothing else Those are the stakes in this election Even to be debating domestic issues at a time like this simply doesnt make any sense But the situation in Honduras points up the ridiculousness in a fundamentally different context which is why I am writing about it now
