Email Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy If we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent he said Thats trillions of dollars over the next decade Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania on Tuesday The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued Were still battling recession I dont care what the official stats are saying America is still in recession And were not doing anything about it He added that it was lazy American women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them Im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move Like yesterday he said Mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work This is true because of a number of reasons First shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman So you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times Second Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties Shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way I might add Biden continued Todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said Theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy The reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher Now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce And thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces And like I said Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States We need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper Biden concluded
