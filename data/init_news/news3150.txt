Republicans have never passed an Obamacare repeal through both houses of Congress forcing Obama to veto That changed WednesdayRep Tom Price R of Georgia chairman of the House Budget Committee and a physician appears before the Rules Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington Tuesday as he sponsors legislation that would repeal President Obamas signature health care law The legislation will be the first order of business as the House returns for the holiday break and will mark the first time a bill repealing the health law makes it all the way to the White HouseOn Wednesday House Republicans passed a bill that guts Obamacare  their 62nd attempt to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act The crucial difference is that this time it will get all the way to the presidents desk instead of being blocked by Senate DemocratsBut this bill will never become law At least not under this president He will veto it along with its companion provision to stop federal funding of Planned Parenthood for a year Congress will not have the votes to override and so the bill  like the other 61 attempts  has symbolic value onlyHouse Speaker Paul Ryan R of Wisconsin says that getting the bill to the president will finally hold him accountable for his disastrous policiesBut Americans already know where the president stands on these issues Observers say the real point is to remind voters what could happen if a Republican is sitting in the Oval Office and the GOP keeps control of Congress Lawmakers also want to show critics that theyre living up to a campaign promise or at least trying harderThis bill will sharpen contrasts between Republicans and Democrats going into a presidential election year says GOP consultant Matt MackowiakBut will the voters care Republican voters contacted by the Monitor suggest Wednesdays vote is neither pointless nor a clear victory While many like the signal it sends others see it as yet another hollow gestureThey want action and this is seen as only a startTravis Sawyer a financial advisor in Abilene Kan says he falls into the camp of folks who view maneuvers like this as generally a waste of time However he does like this move even though he already knows how the president will reactHaving him actually have to go through the process of vetoing legislation passed by both houses of Congress its big I think its a big step Hes happy to see lawmakers follow through on their promiseJoshua Thompson a warehouse worker in Nashua NH is impressed that the bill will get as far as the president On the other hand he says if Republicans ever succeed in repealing the health care law they should at least have something to replace it Something better than ObamacareMeanwhile Carol Hill a retired physician from Diamondhead Miss says in an email that the ridiculous show bill repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood only feeds the anger of votersIf establishment Republicans  she calls them the eGOP  wanted to stop either Obamacare or Planned Parenthood they could have done it in the past by defunding them she maintainsThe eGOP is totally incapable of understanding how angry conservatives really areObamacare has receded a bit as an issue eclipsed by other concerns such as national security Still a majority of Americans disapprove of it and shining the spotlight during a rare presidential veto is beneficial to Republicans says Mr Mackowiak the strategist He believes that repealing Obamacare is going to be a big fight in the general electionAnticipating the House vote on Wednesday  which follows Senate approval last month  conservative group Heritage Action sent a letter to GOP presidential candidates on Tuesday urging them to push Obamacare to the forefront in 2016The letter highlighted the Republicans repeal promise  which they have been loudly criticized for breaking It then supported an ironclad commitment to repeal the entire law in 2016 through a rare parliamentary process known as budget reconciliationThe process allows a bill to avoid a Senate filibuster and pass by simple majority Its this procedure that Democrats used to pass the health care law in the first place  and its this route that Republicans after gaining control of the Senate last year used to finally get this bill to the presidents deskDemocratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton fiercely defended the law on Monday reminding Iowans at a rally that it has extended coverage to 19 million Americans doesnt discriminate against preexisting conditions and sets equal premiums for men and womenThey have no plan she said Republicans just want to undo what Democrats have fought for If theres a Republican sitting there it will be repealed and then we will have to start all over again she warnedNo question the move to force the president into a veto raises the stakes in the rhetorical war says Amy Black a political scientist at Wheaton College in Illinois It will give more attention to the issue and remind voters yet again that Obama and Democrats are not on their sideBut will the veto strategy mean much to voters Shes not so sure Its a question whether the strategy will work with voters or not
