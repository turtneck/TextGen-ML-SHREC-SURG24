When Susan E Rice took over as President Obamas national security adviser two years ago she was struck by how the White House had grown Since she had last served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration its staff had nearly quadrupled in size to about 400 peopleEarlier this year Rice embarked on an effort to trim that number hoping to make the policymaking process more agile By midJuly she said in an interview the staff had been cut by 6percentBut it may be too late to change impressions of an NSC bureaucracy whose size has come to symbolize an overbearing and paranoid White House that insists on controlling even the smallest policy details often at the expense of timely and effective decisionsIn the Defense Department where mistrust of the White House has persisted since the administration began Obama is described as resolute and bold when a quick executive action is needed on operations such as hostage rescues and targeted captures and killingsHowever when the president has wanted to move swiftly on some of his most ambitious policy initiatives  the opening to Cuba and the early Iran nuclear negotiations  he has circumvented the usual practice for decisionmaking and kept a close hold within the White HouseTwo senior NSC officials  deputy national security adviser Benjamin J Rhodes and thenLatin American director Ricardo Zuniga  handled secret talks leading to last Decembers announced opening to Cuba The White House did not inform Secretary of State John F Kerry until the discussions were well underway and State Department officials in charge of the region found out only as they neared completionThe success of those policies  along with a climate deal with China trade agreements and other legacybuilding achievements in recent months  have boosted internal morale and for some at least validated the way the administration operatesBut on a host of other important issues the NSC designed in Harry Trumans time to coordinate sometimesconflicting diplomatic and defense views is still widely seen as the place where policy becomes immobilized by indecision plodding through months and sometimes years of repetitive White House meetingsIn addressing challenges where there is internal disagreement or there are no good options  civil war in Syria Russians in Ukraine and military dictatorship in Egypt for example  policymaking has been sclerotic at best constipated at worse a senior Defense Department official saidTime seems to be all this process produces More time more meetings more discussions the official saidOthers fume that the NSC has taken over things that could and should be handled elsewhere in the government Former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta who left the administration in February 2013 has spoken of the increasing centralization of power at the White House and a penchant for control that in his case included submission of speeches and interview requests for White House approvalHis predecessor at the Defense Department Robert M Gates has said that micromanagement by the Obama White House drove me crazyMany inside Cabinet departments and agencies complain that their expertise and experience is undervalued and that they are subjected to the whims of less knowledgeable NSC staffers With such a large structure that in some areas duplicates their own departments senior officials see the NSC as usurping their responsibilities leaving them feeling unappreciated and frustratedIf assistant secretaries deputy assistants dont have a sense of authorship and accountability they tend to get beaten down said a recently departed highlevel administration official When large agencies  the Defense Department or State or others  dont feel as much a part of the takeoff implementation tends to suffer Its just human natureOthers are less diplomatic Any little twerp from the NSC can call a meeting and set the agenda a senior State Department official saidMore than a dozen current and former senior officials in national security departments and agencies and in the White House discussed the NSC for this article some of them in several interviews Most spoke only on the condition of anonymity whether to criticize or to praiseOutside the administration some lawmakers policy experts and scholars charge that a bloated NSC staff filled with what they describe as acolytes who distrust the rest of the government and see protecting the president as their primary job has helped make Obamas foreign policy ineffective and riskaverseThere are problems that call for a real whole of government solution said David Rothkopf who has written extensively on the history and structure of the National Security Council and served in the Clinton administration Ive never seen an administration that says it more and does it lessGrumbling about how the White House operates is far from unique to the Obama administration and the NSC staff has grown substantially under virtually every successive president since Jimmy Carter But the size and intrusiveness of Obamas NSC has made it a prominent targetThe White House thinks that some administration officials blame the NSC to disguise disorganization and disagreements within their own departments or when decisions dont go their wayIm not saying there isnt micromanagement at the NSC There is Rhodes saidBut sometimes I think the NSC just becomes kind of the boogeymanNever getting to yes or noThis will likely piss everybody off Obama observed at a national security meeting last March when he decided to end an 18month long internal argument by releasing weapons shipments to EgyptThe arms  F16 aircraft Abrams tank components and Harpoon missiles  had been on hold since the July 2013 military overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi and the installation of Gen Abdel Fatah alSissi as presidentSeveral months of debate ensued over whether to call the military action a coup  a designation that would have required all military assistance to be withheld The White House decided to leave its options openSome assistance would continue while major military items would be withheld as a message of disapproval Obama ordered a review of the overall US aid relationship with Egypt a strategic ally in the Middle East and said the full partnership would not be restored until Sissi took steps toward a sustainable nonviolent democracyAs the review dragged on for months internal frustration grewKerry and thenDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel argued that the United States needed Egypt as a reliable wellarmed ally in the region and should restore the weapons aid Partner nations in the Persian Gulf region  already stung by Obamas refusal to take military action in Syria  warned that the administration was alienating the Egyptians when it should be working with themOthers including departmental officials under both Kerry and Hagel along with Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and outside human rights advocates took a different view They insisted that Obama needed a sign from the Egyptians some indication they were prepared to stop rounding up political opponents and journalists release the ones they had thrown in jail and stop dealing with dissent by killing and executionBy the time Obama decided in March to lift the ban on the planes and other bigticket items no ones view had changed Little to nothing had been gained on the human rights front Sissis distrust for the administration had deepened and Persian Gulf partners thought that the administration had once again let them downTo many on the inside Egypt policy has been a prime example of the NSCs failure to bring together disparate Cabinet views and fashion options for timely presidential decisionThe White House sees different phenomena at work including the inability of Cabinet secretaries to marshal unity within their own departments and resentment on the losing side On both Egypt and Ukraine where there has been similar reluctance to make final decisions there has been a lateral difference between principals and those beneath them a senior official said Both are sets of issues where decisions have had to go directly to the president and where the decisions havent always been popularWere working to fix it the official said Its everybodys problem It frustrates everybodySome remain unsatisfied however A senior State Department official recently described White House meetings held four or five days a week on an issue of current concern with little turnaround time to prepare ordered documents or consider what was discussed the day before Often the meetings amount to timewasting repetition of the same argumentsIn another example the Justice Department indicated in a highlevel meeting last summer that a proposal to hold in indefinite detention older children who crossed the Mexican border without their parents was likely illegal Yet the same proposal appeared repeatedly on the agenda for discussion by evermore senior officials eventually rising to Obama  who pointed out that in addition to being unwise it was likely illegal a participant saidOn some issues meetings at the level of Cabinet deputies  the place where options are supposed to be refined before consideration by department heads and then the president  grew so repetitive last year that deputies stopped coming sending assistant secretaries and below in their steadIt was like Groundhog Day  with no progress no refinement said one official In fairness these are all tough questions But eventually youve got to make a choiceA former White House official said The thing I think is fundamentally wrong with the NSC process is that theres too much process Theres too much airing of every agencys view and recommendations and not enough adjudicating  Someones got to be the decisionmaker whos just going to say Were going to do this and Were not going to do thatCrucial delays can be as much about what a policy will look like as about what it actually is During NSCled meetings early last year over Ukraines list of requested military assistance most items were seen as too military a senior Defense Department official said We were not sure how far Russia was going to go in helping a separatist takeover and whether this would provoke themThe Ukrainian militarys urgent need for blankets and packaged meals was easily agreed at the start The question was how to get them thereOver multiple NSC meetings there was a lot of discussion about optics the official said and whether to send the items by military cargo aircraft or overlandEventually it was decided to ship the supplies by Europeanlicensed trucks to avoid the provocative sight of US military transport planes on the ground But a few weeks later this official flew into Kiev airport for a meeting with Ukrainian officials only to spot several large grey C130 US military transports on the runway Vice President Biden was visiting and the planes were there to deliver his communications equipment and sensitive gearThings like that color moods and sour people the official said of the lengthy debates When you litigate all the small stuff it makes the big stuff even worseDebates over Ukraines request for heavy weapons have now gone on for well more than a year The White House has not said yes but it has never said noEstablished in the years following World War II to help the president coordinate and reconcile diplomatic and military perspectives the National Security Council initially included only the president and the secretaries of state and defense Since the Truman administration each chief executive has added or on rare occasions subtracted seats at the head tableA small secretariat eventually developed into a presidential staff led by the national security adviser Different presidents have put the staff to different uses but virtually all have increased its size and the staff itself is now more commonly known as the NSCJimmy Carter managed with about 25 NSC staffers and a powerful and outspoken national security adviser in Zbigniew Brzezinski who often eclipsed Cabinet secretaries Ronald Reagan went through six national security advisers in eight years and an operational NSC that led to fiascoes such as the Irancontra scandalBrent Scowcroft national security adviser to George HW Bush is often cited as the gold standard for how to run an effective and collaborative NSC Concerned that its staff would overwhelm the departments he limited it to 50 peopleIts purpose was to integrate views and create a cohesive national security policy Scowcroft said in an interview not to replace departments  Thats always the instinctive thing  well These guys arent doing a good job on something well just do it ourselves I tried not to do thatUnder Bill Clinton the NSC doubled in size to about 100 George W Bush doubled it again to 200The first indication of how Obama planned to use the NSC came with Presidential Policy Directive 1 issued three weeks after his inauguration Following the Scowcroft structure it established a Principals Committee of Cabinet secretaries and top agency officials chaired by the national security adviser as the last stop before policy options reached the presidentThe Deputies Committee of No 2 agency officials analyzes issues and options before they reach the principals handles daytoday crisis management and monitors policy implementationA third lower level of interagency committees generally determines what will rise up to the deputies In previous administrations the committees usually were chaired by a lead department or agency  normally the State or Defense departments Obamas directive moved them into the White House chaired by the NSCFormer officials who participated in Obamas White House transition and later served in senior administration posts described that decision as a crucial driver toward more centralization It was a conscious decision to elevate the NSCs role by having it chair those committees one saidBut it was far from the only reason for growthThe staff grew by 35 almost immediately when Obama folded the Homeland Security Council established by his predecessor into the NSC Slightly more than half of todays NSC personnel  many of them detailees from other agencies who are not on the White House payroll  are what Rice calls policy people The rest are divided among management and human resources staff and about 100 who supply technology support including manning the White House Situation Room in shifts 24 hours a dayStaffing of traditional NSC directorates and coordinators organized by function and geographic regions ballooned with each new crisis Surging issues such as cyber and health security  including Ebola  brought additional staffEach subject area produces White Houserun meetings often overlapping sessions called by separate NSC chieftains on security economic and diplomatic aspects of the same issue For every meeting both NSC and agency personnel are tasked with writing issue and option papers than can run to a dozen or more pagesRice  who came to the job with unique prior experience at the NSC and the State Department and as a Cabinet member during Obamas first term  resisted her initial impulse to cut staff until she understood the reasons for the growth This year as part of her review she has folded the separate Bushera NSC office in charge of AfghanistanPakistan affairs back into the South Asia directorate Implementation of the recently completed Iran nuclear agreement has been based at the State Department along with the coordinator of the USled coalition fighting against the Islamic StateThe office that opened at the NSC last year to coordinate the Ebola response among agencies has also been closed as that crisis has ebbedBut Rice strongly defended its establishment in the first place With participation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the State Defense and Health and Human Services departments and the US Agency for International Development she said the US response wasnt working until we sucked it into the White House and the president put his personal muscle behind itNearly every Thursday morning since the September 2012 terrorist attacks on the US compound in Benghazi Libya senior and midlevel officials from at least five government agencies have gathered at the White House to talk about security for US facilities and personnel overseasProtecting diplomats and other Americans abroad is a core responsibility of the State Department Yet the weekly talks are convened by the NSC and led by Lisa Monaco Obamas chief counterterrorism adviser who guides discussions about where threats are greatest and what kind of protection should be availableTo the White House this makes perfect sense Many agencies have personnel based overseas and many of the resources to protect them reside outside the State DepartmentIt used to be that State ran foreign policy said a former White House official Now everyones got a hand in it Go around the table and theyve all got equities theyve all got personnel out in the field and all that needs to be managedBut others drew a direct line from White House management of the issue back to the political embarrassment of the Benghazi attacks which resulted in the deaths of four US officials Nearly three years later a Republicanled congressional committee is still searching for a smoking gun of administration coverupBenghazi is a good example the former official said and  Ebola That cant just be left to CDC and State and others to manage No You have to have a czar and a whole team of people And why is that Because the politics on this issue have become so much more corrosive and challenging that its a natural instinct for the White House to say Weve got to have an eye on this On everythingThe embassy security meetings have frequently bogged down over minor issues such as whether to deploy a handful of Special Operations troops or to approve a State Department request for an additional 10 diplomats at an embassy One official recalled that White House oversight even extended to the overseas deployment of dog handlers and their bombsniffing caninesThe first thing Im going to do is to stop all this micromanagement from the NSC Deputy Secretary Antony J Blinken joked as he chaired his first senior staff meeting at the State Department in December after moving there from his White House job as Rices deputyBlinken who has gone back and forth among buildings several times knows better than most that where one sits usually indicates where one stands on the subjectWhen you look at it from the White Houses perspective another former official whose career has traveled much the same path said of micromanagement charges and youre just constantly worried about something going wrong and youre wearing the shirt for it you can understand how this happensIn January as internal administration complaints about the NSC escalated Rice acknowledged the problems but praised the policy outcomesIf you look at where we started in 2014 we had no Ukraine and Russia no Ebola and no ISIL as the next major counterterrorism threat she said in an interview at the time referring to the Islamic State In each of those instances of unforeseen crisis on top of all the business we were having to do anyway with some complexity and obviously not always with perfect form we bent the curveStyle points Sure Take some off at the margins she said Substance Managing an unprecedented array of complex crises and continuing at the same time to pursue the presidents longterm agenda on things that will matter when the music stops like climate change and Cuba I feel pretty goodBut at the same time she decided she had seen and heard enough to know that her initial reaction to the NSCs size and structure might have merit At her direction aides drew up staffing charts and held focus groups to solicit suggestions for improvement Senior officials were interviewed organizational meetings were heldBy June a statement posted on the White House blog promised a newly lean nimble and policyoriented NSC with fewer more focused meetings less paper to produce and consume and more communication that yields better policymakingIn late July more than half a year after she began the exercise Rice said that she was satisfied with the results Were going to keep going with staff trims she said But were going to do it in a thoughtful way  We need to not compromise quality simply for the sake of structureOpinions on the depth of the changes differ One senior department official agreed last month that there were fewer NSC meetings and less paperwork Another official en route to a third White House meeting on a single recent day hadnt noticed any change
