Europe Mounts Historic Challenge to Googles Domination of Tech Services Posted on Oct 31 2016 Jon Russell  CC BYSA 20 The European Commission has slapped Google with three sets of monopoly charges  starting a fight that could cost the company up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and show American firms that theres a bazooka in Europe that can be shot at companies that seek to obtain dominant market positions The New York Times DealBook reports The cases relate to Android Googles mobile operating system some of its dominant online search services and some of its advertising products While each response will be couched in legalese Googles main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the regions tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europes more than 500 million consumers Our search engine is designed to provide the most relevant results and most useful ads for any query Kent Walker Googles general counsel wrote in a blog post when previously rebutting some of Europes antitrust charges Users and advertisers benefit when we do this well So does Google The companys detractorsincluding small European startups some local politicians and significant American firms like Oracledisagree with Googles optimistic outlook Google has taken its best shot but the European Commission has decided that its still on the right track said Thomas Vinje a lawyer for FairSearch Europe which represents those of Googles rivals that filed complaints against the companys perceived dominance I dont doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense But thats what other previously dominant companies thought too he added DealBook continues Whatever happens Googles battle in Europe will not end overnight European officials must first review the companys rebuttals and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017 at the earliest If found to have breached the regions rules Google faces fines totaling up to 75 billion or 10 percent of its annual revenue and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28member bloc While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible the company is likely to appeal any European ruling further lengthening the process Yet it is this deathbyathousandcuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google
