The United States kept up its breakneck pace of hiring in January adding 257000 jobs as workers received wage increases unseen since the financial crisis according to government data released Friday morningThe unemployment rate ticked up by onetenth of a point to 57 percent largely because so many people  nearly 11 million  entered the workforce some coming off the sidelines after years of discouragementThe latest data indicates a fully firing labor market that has become the engine for the American recovery The United States has added jobs over the last year at its steadiest pace in two decades and January offered fresh evidence that employers are now willing to raise wages and compete for workersWere finally getting to that point where a selfsustaining recovery is going on said Jeremy Lawson chief economist at Standard Life Investments an asset management firmThe US labor market has expanded quickly enough in the last year that President Obama recently called 2014 a breakthrough year in America And as it turns out 2014 just got even better As part of the latest data from the Department of Labor net jobs growth figures from November and December were significantly revised upward Novembers net jobs gain now stands at a whopping 423000 up from the previous 353000 the biggest onemonth gain since 2010 The November through January stretch qualifies as the nations best threemonth stretch of jobs growth in 17 yearsThe monthly jobs data can be volatile particularly in January when government economists try to calculate seasonally adjusted hiring growth amid the layoffs of holiday workers US stocks were up and the dollar strengthened Friday morning on the jobs news which slightly exceeded market expectationsPerhaps the best sign in the jobs report wasnt the net payroll gain  the figure has topped 200000 for 11 months in a row  but rather the nascent sign of rising salaries The average hourly worker saw a 12centperhour raise in January the best onemonth increase since 2007 Since the Great Recession real wages have remained stagnant but this is slowly beginning to change Over the last year wages have risen 22 percent Meantime consumer prices are seeing inflation below 1 percent largely because cheaper oil has caused gasoline prices to plummetWhen I look at this report I see a confident economy Department of Labor Secretary Thomas E Perez said Friday in an interview Companies that are bullish New jobseekers who are more optimistic And when you factor low gas prices and wage growth that adds up to money in peoples pockets a greater hop in their stepThe January wage numbers were being closely watched because wages had taken a slight step backward in December Real wages are an important indicator for labor market health as they rise when more workers leave the sideline and companies feel pressure to compete for employeesSome economists caution about reading too much into one months salary data and say only sustained wage growth will help the country fill one of the missing pieces of the recoveryEarnings are increasing but the rates of real wage growth suggest that more must be done to ensure that all families can feel the strengthening recovery in their own lives Jason Furman chairman of the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers said in a statementFor the Federal Reserve this report offered perhaps the strongest evidence yet encouraging a shortterm rate hike in the middle of this year  even as inflation falls below the central banks targetThe pickup in average hourly earnings gains was a belated Christmas present Scott Anderson chief economist at Bank of the West said in an email It should help the Fed look past a temporary drop in inflation this year and keep their eye on gradually normalizing interest ratesIn January jobs growth was broadbased The healthcare and retail sectors were again strong as theyve been throughout the recovery But so too were construction with 39000 jobs added and professional and technical services 33000 jobs addedFor months now the US economy has looked like the strongest in the developed world But the recovery here came with a mystery Some primeaged workers were sitting on the sideline unmoved to again begin actively seeking work That meant they werent counted as unemployed It also left the US economy below its full potentialJanuarys data showed at least some evidence that these workers are again looking for work The labor force participation rate  which tracks the proportion of Americans holding or seeking a job  nudged up from 627 to 629 percent That number looks small but it was caused by a wave of new entrants  some 105 million roughly the population of Rhode IslandThe labor force participation rate is still at its lowest point since the 1970s but some of that decline is demographic the result of a retiring wave of baby boomers The key for the labor force economists say is encouraging frustrated middleaged potential employees to resume their job searches even if it requires new training or skillsThere is this drumbeat  were seeing more and more jobs in a wide range of different occupations and industries said Tara Sinclair chief economist at Indeedcom a job search Web site Hopefully that will attract these people to get the necessary skills and jobs
