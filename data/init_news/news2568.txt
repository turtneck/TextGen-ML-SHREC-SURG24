The tagline for the 2016 GOP race might as well be Make America Misogynist Again On Wednesday night Donald Trump and Ted Cruz got into a Twitter spat After a conservative antiTrump SuperPAC ran a gross slutshaming ad which used a halfnaked photograph of Trumps wife Melania Trump threatened to spill the beans on Cruzs wife Heidi presumably because he thought Cruz was behind the ad The SuperPAC is not affiliated with the Cruz campaign though it is backing Cruz against Trump Trump then retweeted the below image which compares a model shot of Melania with an unflattering photograph of Heidi These images are worth a thousand words reads the meme implying that when it comes to the position of First Lady all that matters is a womans hotnessTo Cruzs credit  and I truly cant believe Im giving a man who has compared abortion to slavery credit for anythingthat has to do with women  Cruz didnt take Trumps bait Instead he responded with this tweetFor Trump and the GOP candidates writ large the 2016 election has come down to a pathetic and terrifying rallying cry for traditional masculinity There have been comments about hand size and comments about dick size and comments about Marco Rubios highheeled booties Trump has indirectly called Cruz a pussy and a soft weak little baby and said that Romney would have dropped to his knees for a 2012 endorsement As The Guardians Jessica Valenti put it Trump and Cruz have officially gone full cavemenWe are seeing the MasculinitySoFragile hashtag play out in real time As women  or any group of people who arent straight white men  continue to demand their voices be heard and that policy change accordingly we will see a backlash from those traditional arbiters of power The 2016 GOP race has become their vicious last stand Editors noteDonald Trump regularlyincites political violenceand is aserial liarrampant xenophoberacistmisogynist andbirtherwho has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims  16 billion members of an entire religion  from entering the US
