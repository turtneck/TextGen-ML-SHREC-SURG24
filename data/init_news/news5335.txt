A new scientific theory claims our universe was born from an Event Horizon event as part of a second dimension in an enormous black hole gobbling up other universes in the fourth dimension Via YourNewsWire At the very beginning of time around 138 billion years ago there was a hot dense energetic point where the laws of physics did not apply  something scientists today refer to as a singularity The only other place where a singularity occurs in the Universe and all the known laws of physics are temporarily abandoned is at the event horizon of a black hole  which scientists cannot explainScroll Down For Video Below What is odd about black holes is that the even horizon is twodimensional in an otherwise completely threedimensional universe This means that there is something that we are unable to perceive and the theory which was first suggested in 2014 and is now under serious scrutinisation claims that our Universe is the result of a singularity of a huge black holeIn simpler terms there is a possibility that our threedimensional Universe is surrounding the event horizon of a fourdimensional Universe A 2014 study from the Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo stated In this scenario our Universe burst into being when a star in a fourdimensional universe collapsed into a black holeRevisiting the theory recently Ethan Siegel a professor of physics and astronomy at Lewis  Clark College in Portland explained how a black hole could have formed in another universe which led matter to fall into our UniverseDr Siegel wrote for Forbes As the black hole first formed from a stars core imploding and collapsing the event horizon first came to be then rapidly expanded and continued to grow in area as more and more matter continued to fall inIf you were to put a coordinate grid down on this twodimensional wrapping you would find that it originated where the gridlines were very close together then expanded rapidly as the black hole formed and then expanded more and more slowly as matter fell in at a much lower rateThis matches at least conceptually what we observe for the expansion rate of our threedimensional Universe
