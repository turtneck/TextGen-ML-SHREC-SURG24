 Hillary Clinton FBI and the Real November SurpriseBy Pepe Escobar As bad as it is the folks above the President make the decisions They may have decided on Trump These things do not happen by accident  Sputnik   Thus spoke a highlevel US business mover and shaker with secure transit in rarified Masters of the Universerelated circles amidst the utter political chaos provoked by head of the FBI James Comeys latest bombshellIts virtually established by now that US Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Comey not to release his letter to Congress But Comey did it anyway If he had not and a scandal would  inevitably  spring up after the US presidential election Lynch would be perfectly positioned to deny she knew anything and Comey would be on the firing lineLynch is a certified Clinton machine asset In 1999 thenPresident Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorneys office She left in 2002 taking the private practice revolving door She was back to the Brooklyn office in 2010 urged by Obama Five years later she became the 83rd US Attorney General replacing the dodgy Eric HolderA plausible case has been made that Comey took his fateful decision based on a serious internal revolt at the FBI  led by key people he trust  as well as being eggedon by his wifeYet one of the key questions that refuse to go away is why the FBI waited until 11 days before the US presidential election to supposedly find an email trove on certified sexting pervert Anthony Weiners laptopA Deal With DonaldThe business source although unsympathetic to the Clinton machine especially in foreign policy is a realpolitik practitioner not a conspiracy theorist He is adamant that the FBI reversal could not have happened without orders above the President If the Masters of the Universe have changed their mind then they will destroy HillaryHe adds they can make a deal with Donald just like anyone else Donald wins the Masters win the people think that their voice has been heard And then there will be some sort of controlled changeWhats paramount in the whole soap opera is the faith in the US political system  as corrupt as it may be  must endure That mirrors the faith in the US dollar if confidence in the US dollar fails the US as a hegemonic financial power is no moreThe source is equally adamant that it is almost unprecedented to see a coverup as extensive as Hillarys A secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the Attorney General the FBI ignoring all evidence and initially clearing Hillary to near rebellion of the whole of the FBI attested to by Rudolf Giuliani whose reputation as a federal prosecutor is unquestioned the Clinton pay for play foundation The Masters are troubled that this is getting out of handThe record shows that the Masters do not usually have to go to such lengths to protect their own They did manage to save Bill Clinton from the Monica Lewinsky perjury and keep him in the presidency The Masters were not attacked in this case They even got away with the 1987 cash settlement crash and the theft surrounding the Lehman debacle In all these cases there were no overarching challenges to their control as we see now open to the public by Trump They antagonized and insulted the wrong manAll Aboard the Huma TrainHillary Clinton is not at the center of Comeys jawdropping October Surprise its actually her righthand woman and ersatz daughter Huma Abedin This early January essay on Huma Abedin contains plenty of nuggets out and about  some of them positively eyebrow raisingIn case Hillary Clinton becomes the next President of the United States POTUS Abedin alternatively known as Princess of Saudi Arabia will most likely become Hillarys chief of staff  the power behind running all White House operationsA glimpse of the FBIHuma Abedin connection is available here  Abedin was granted Top Secret security clearance for the first time in 2009 when Hillary named her deputy chief of staff for operations Abedin later said she did not remember being read into any Special Access Programs SAPsIts crucial to remember that one of Abedins emails was humaclintonemailcom Crucial translation she was the only highlevel State Dept aide whose emails were hosted by the notorious Subterranean Clinton Email Server  which she claimed she didnt know existed until she heard about it in the newsAbedin swore under oath in a lawsuit brought against the State Dept by Judicial Watch that she had handed over all of her laptops and smart phones that could host emails relevant to the Subterranean Email Server investigationThat may not have been the case The laptop at the center of Comeys bombshell was shared by Abedin and her husband Wiener before they split If Abedin lied she could face up to five years in jail for perjury As if the whole illegal emailcumsexting saga was not sordid enough the climax now seems to have turned into a mixed wrestling match between the former couple with the big prize being the slammerThe FBI has finally obtained a warrant and is now frantically searching no less than 650000 Abedin emails found on sexting freak Wieners laptop the objective is to exactly determine which ones came from the Subterranean Email ServerAs if this was not demeaning enough the FBI continues to conduct an investigation on the Clinton Foundation As former Assistant Director of the FBI Tom Fuentes said  The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation the investigation would go forward as a comprehensive unified case and be coordinated so that investigation is ongoing and Huma Abedin and her role and activities concerning Secretary of State in the nature of the foundation and possible pay to play thats still being looked at nowWhatever happens until election day US voters will have to consider the startling fact they may choose a next POTUS that is the subject of a wideranging comprehensive unified FBI investigationA Rotten Rigged SystemA former federal public corruption prosecutor volunteers a plausible take on Comeys action In a nutshell FBI agents investigating Weiners sexting  and they are a different set of agents investigating Emailgate  saw evidence of State Dept emails on his laptop Comey knew he needed a search warrant to comb the emails at Wieners computer So he preempted the  inevitable  subsequent hype by sending out a vague letter to the Hill that in the end left everyone even more confusedThat interpretation though may be only scratching the surface Deeper and deeper it seems that Comeys decision was really precipitated by the senior FBI agents insurgence  fed up with the extreme carelessness Hillary coverup Theyve got to have some surefire material on the Clinton cash machine that never saw the lightComey could have just waited to say something after the election after all the FBI maintains they had checked all Clinton emails including deleted ones not to mention the Podesta emails So the emails on sexting Wieners laptop may be no more than a limited hangoutA much more plausible explanation is that Comey had to do it not only because of the FBI internal revolt or because he had an urge to upstage WikiLeaks He had to do it because the rot goes way beyond the Clinton pay to play racket and involves virtually the whole system from the deep recesses of the Obama administration to the War Party scam the Department of Justice the CIA and the FBI itselfWhat next Brace for impact it may well be the ultimate November Surprise
