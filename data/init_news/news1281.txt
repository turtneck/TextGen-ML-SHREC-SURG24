  by Jon Rappoport  Jon Rappoports blog Oct 31 2016 Vote fraud expert Bev Harris exposes electronic voting machines Okay She finally did it On Monday Bev Harris  blackboxvotingorg  the great investigator of vote fraud appeared on the Alex Jones show and laid it all out  The GEMS votefraud system fraction magic the way the vote is being stolen Not just in theory but in fact Listen to the whole interview and get the word out Bevs findings are staggering Below the video is the original piece I did on this earlier this month  High Alert the election can still be rigged Votes counted as fractions instead of as whole numbers Amazingly the voterigging system it describes has not gotten widespread attention The system can be used across the entire US As we know there are a number of ways to rig an election Bev Harris at blackboxvotingorg  is exploring a specific cheat sheet that has vast implications for the Trump vs Hillary contest Its a votecounting system called GEMS I urge you to dive into her multipart series Fraction Magic Part1 here  Here are key Harris quotes Theyre all shockers Our testing of GEMS shows that one vote can be counted 25 times another only one onethousandth of a time effectively converting some votes to zero This report summarizes the results of our review of the GEMS election management system which counts approximately 25 percent of all votes in the United States The results of this study demonstrate that a fractional vote feature is embedded in each GEMS application which can be used to invisibly yet radically alter election outcomes by presetting desired vote percentages to redistribute votes This tampering is not visible to election observers even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer Use of the decimalized vote feature is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures and can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds GEMS votecounting systems are and have been operated under five trade names Global Election Systems Diebold Election Systems Premier Election Systems Dominion Voting Systems and Election Systems  Software in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors At the time of this writing this system is used statewide in Alaska Connecticut Georgia Mississippi New Hampshire Utah and Vermont and for counties in Arizona California Colorado Florida Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Massachusetts Michigan Missouri Ohio Pennsylvania Tennessee Texas Virginia Washington Wisconsin and Wyoming It is also used in Canada Instead of 1 the vote is allowed to be 12 or 178 or any other value that is not a whole number Weighting a race through the use of GEMS removes the principle of one personone vote to allow some votes to be counted as less than one or more than one Regardless of what the real votes are candidates can receive a set percentage of votes Results can be controlled For example Candidate A can be assigned 44 of the votes Candidate B 51 and Candidate C the rest All evidence that rigged fractional values ever existed in the GEMS system can be removed instantly even from the underlying database using a setting in the GEMS data tables in which case even instructing GEMS to show the rigged decimals will fail to reveal they were used Source code Instructions to treat votes as decimal values instead of whole numbers ie rigging are inserted multiple times in the GEMS source code itself thus this feature cannot have been created by accident A contact who so far apparently wishes to remain anonymous states the following about the history of the GEMS system The Fractional vote rigging portion traces directly to Jeffrey W Dean  whose wife was primary stockholder of the company that developed GEMS He ran the company but was prohibited from handling money or checks due to a criminal conviction for computer fraud for which he spent 4 years in prison Almost immediately after being released from prison he was granted intimate access to elections data and large government contracts for ballot printing and ballot processing I see no effort on the part of the federal government state governments or the mainstream press to investigate the GEMS system or respond to Bev Harris extensive analysis Its not as if media outlets are unaware of her From shesourceorg here is an excerpt from her bio  Harris has been referred to as the godmother of the election reform movement Boston Globe Vanity Fair magazine credits her with founding the movement to reform electronic voting Time Magazine calls her book Black Box Voting  the bible of electronic voting Harriss investigations have led some to call her the Erin Brockovich of elections Saloncom Harris has supervised five hack demonstrations in the field using real voting machines These have been covered by the Associated Press the Washington Post and in formal reports by the United States General Accounting Office So far her analysis of GEMS seems to be labeled too hot to handle Press outlets prefer to report the slinging of mud from both Presidential candidates camps Meanwhile the actual results of the coming electionsincluding Congressional racesappear to be up for grabs depending on who controls GEMS Update From what I understand each state government appoints a consultant to manage GEMS on election night That person would be capable of
