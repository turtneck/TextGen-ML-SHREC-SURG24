The recent spate of protests against police brutality have changed the way the left thinks about rioting The old liberal idea which distinguished between peaceful protests good and rioting bad has given way to a more radical analysis Riots work insists George CiccarielloMaher in Salon But despite the obviousness of the point an entire chorus of media police and selfappointed community leaders continue to try to convince us otherwise hammering into our heads a narrative of a nonviolence that has never worked on its own based on a mythical understanding of the Civil Rights Movement Voxs German Lopez while acknowledging the downside of random violence argues Riots can lead to real substantial change In Rolling Stone Jesse Myerson asserts the historical pedigree of property destruction as a tactic of resistance is long and frequently effective Darlena Cunha writing in Time asks Is rioting so wrong and proceeds to answer her own question in thenegativeThe direct costs of violent protests are fairly selfevident People who may not have anything to do with the underlying grievances get injured or killed their livelihoods are impaired the communities in which the rioting takes place suffer property damage that can linger for decades and the inevitable police response creates new dangers for innocent bystanders The prorioting or antiantirioting argument portrays this as the necessary price of worthwhile social change Rioting can generate attention among people who might otherwise ignore the underlying conditions that give rise to itIt is surely the case that some positive social reforms have emerged in response to rioting Lopez highlights the Kerner Commission and diversity efforts in the Los Angeles Police Department But the question is not whether rioting ever yields a productive response but whether it does so in general Omar Wasow an assistant professor at the department of politics at Princeton has published a timely new paper studying this very question And his answer is clear Riots on the whole provoke a hostile rightwing response They generate attention all right but the wrong kindThe 1960s saw two overlapping waves of protest nonviolent civilrights demonstrations and urban rioting The 1960s also saw the Republican Party crack open the New Deal coalition by among other things appealing to public concerns about law and order In 1964 Lyndon Johnson swept every region of the country except the South running a liberal procivilrights campaign in 1968 Richard Nixon won a narrower victory on the basis of socialbacklashDetermining just what caused the change in public opinion is obviously tricky Wasow approaches the problem in different ways One method he uses is to compare the publics concern for civil rights and its concern for social control with violent and nonviolent protests They match up prettycloselyWasow has another even more persuasive method He looks at countybycounty voting and compares it with violent and nonviolent protestactivityExamining countylevel voting patterns I find that blackled protests in which some violence occurs are associated with a statistically significant decline in Democratic voteshare in the 1964 1968 and 1972 presidential elections Blackled nonviolent protests by contrast exhibit a statistically significant positive relationship with countylevel Democratic voteshare in the same period Further I find that in the 1968 presidential election exposure to violent protests caused a decline in Democratic voteshare Examining counterfactual scenarios in the 1968 election I estimate that fewer violent protests are associated with a substantially increased likelihood that the Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey would have beaten the Republican nominee Richard Nixon As African Americans were strongly identified with the Democratic party in this time period my results suggest that in at least some contexts political violence by a subordinate group may contribute to a backlash among segments of the dominant group and encourage outcomes directly at odds with the preferences of the protestorsWasow finds that nonviolent civilrights protests did not trigger a national backlash but that violent protests and looting did The physical damage inflicted upon poor urban neighborhoods by rioting does not have the compensating virtue of easing the way for more progressive policies instead it compounds the damage by promoting a regressivebacklashThe Nixonian law and order backlash drove a wave of repressive criminaljustice policies that carried through for decades with such force that even Democrats like Bill Clinton felt the need to endorse them in order to win elections That wave has finally receded and created space for sentencing reforms demilitarization an emphasis on community policing and other initiatives that even have bipartisan support If the violent protests in Ferguson and Baltimore supercede nonviolent protest Wasows research implies that the liberal moment might give way to another reactionaryera
