Immigrants and refugees are taking jobs from black workers Undocumented criminals prey on American women Muslims pose a threat to gay men and lesbiansFor Donald Trump appealing to minority groups and women often amounts to an us vs them proposition  warning one group that it is being threatened or victimized by another using exaggerated contrasts and a very broad brushPoor Hispanics and African American citizens are the first to lose a job or see a pay cut when we dont control our borders the Republican presidential candidate said at a rally last week in Akron Ohio adding that blacks in particular should vote for him because their lives are so terrible What do you have to lose he said Youll be able to walk down the street without getting shot Right now you walk down the street you get shotFrom the start of his campaign Trump has shaped his message around who is to blame for the nations problems  often pointing at illegal immigrants Black Lives Matter activists and other minorities in a pitch that was aimed primarily at white RepublicansBut now as Trump seeks to reach out to women and minorities who favor Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton he has increasingly taken to pitting one group against another in a bid for support Its not clear how well it will work Many minority voters already turned off by months of blunt and polarizing statements still hear the language of separation in Trumps wordsLook I just think a lot of his views are very ignorant Crystal WoodsBrookes who is black said as she folded clothes at a laundromat a few miles south of Trumps Akron rally This is not our country in his words  I believe thats his whole purpose to divide to put us  against each other make one believe the other side is betterI believe now hes trying to change because  its not about black people its about the votes she added Hes already made his point quite clear as far as Im concernedInside Donald Trumps new strategy to counter the view of many that he is racistThe real estate developer and his team insist that he wants to be an inclusive president and he is in the midst of an outreach effort that includes a new stump speech and meetings with blacks Latinos and other groups He also has engaged in a war of words with Clinton over racial issues repeatedly calling her a bigot because he says her policies have not helped minoritiesAmid criticism for courting minority voters while speaking to overwhelmingly white audiences Trump will hold a questionandanswer session Saturday at Great Faith Ministries International in Detroit which has a primarily black congregation It will be the first of many such events at black and Latino community centers according to the campaignFor many of Trumps supporters  including some minorities fearful of national security threats  Trumps rhetoric on immigration is more about facing up to the grim realities of a dangerous world even if that means saying uncomfortable things about MuslimsAlejandro Lugo who moved to Miami more than 20 years ago after living in Cuba for 30 years said outside a recent campaign event in Fort Lauderdale Fla that hes concerned that the United States is not vetting new immigrants sufficiently He also rejected any comparison between Cuban refugees and Syrian refugees seeking to escape the Islamic StateThe Cubans that came were running away from Castro They settled in Miami they worked But we did not use an 18wheeler truck to kill 150 Americans And the Muslims they do that Cubans dont do that Lugo said If the Cubans come from Cuba and they start killing American people they have to be vetted If you have connections with alQaeda and you come here to kill my family I dont want you in this nationFor the most part though Trumps message has not resonated with minorities or women who strongly favor Clinton in opinion polls Most also think Trump is biased against those groups polls showThe Rev William Barber II the president of the North Carolina NAACP said in a recent interview that he objects to Trumps reductive view of the black community that all African Americans live in poverty that their communities are the sources of crime and that they have been fooled into voting for DemocratsYoure saying All black people  Theyre all lazy theyre all poor he said It fits that racialized narrative that crime is a particular communitys problem rather than crime being a reality in the American constructAfter Trump cited the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations in June to support his call to temporarily ban Middle Eastern immigrants from entering the country LGBT leaders accused Trump of fearmongering after a massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando  and of suggesting that there are no gay Muslim immigrantsWomens groups and activists also have blasted Trump for suggesting that immigrants are a disproportionate threat to women a rhetorical appeal they say is intended to divide communities among racial linesThis is the culmination of all the different ways in which he has painted groups with a very broad brush said Marcy Stech vice president of communications for Emilys List Every week he has shown us this side of him exposing his racist and misogynistic worldview And any attempt to erase those moments now is just not going to workJos Torres 54 a computer programmer who works at the Orlando airport said he was unmoved by Trumps new pitch to African Americans and Latinos and his potential softening on whether he would seek mass deportation of 11million undocumented immigrantsHonestly the guy as I see him is good at earning money but as a politician hes got radical ideas and Im not in agreement with him I think hes very racist also Torres said Itll cause disunity in the countryJeremiah Armstrong 33 of Akron said Trumps new message to black voters suggests a competition between voters where one really doesnt exist Armstrong a selfemployed barber said the notion that immigrants are taking jobs away from other minorities in the United States does not match with his experienceLet me ask you a question How many black farmworkers do you know Where around here can you find someone where a Hispanic has come and taken a job Armstrong said We dont accept those jobs anyway Ive never been offered one and Ive never had one taken away from me so I dont think thats the issueTrumps tough lawandorder talk also has agitated members of the Black Lives Matter movement who think he doesnt understand their concerns Trump has escalated his law enforcement rhetoric in recent months suggesting several times that protesters are wrong to question police actionsThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country Trump said at a campaign rally in West Bend Wis They have fostered the dangerous antipolice atmosphere in AmericaMany political strategists say the real payoff to Trumps overtures to minority voters would be to assuage moderate Republicans who are concerned by charges that he is racist But most doubt his effort will change the minds of minority votersThe attempt is at trying to fix a problem he has with mainstream voters and Im not optimistic that will work said John Weaver a longtime GOP strategist Its heavyhanded its such a hamhanded attempt Heres his problem People would have to have EtchASketch memory in their brains to forget everything he has saidEd OKeefe in Orlando Jenna Johnson in Washington and Eva Ruth Moravec
