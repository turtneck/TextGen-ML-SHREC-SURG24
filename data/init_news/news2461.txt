SIOUX FALLS SD  Five days  thats how many sick days Tom McLaughlin took to lose his job at a carton manufacturerMcLaughlin was in the hospital for three of those days being treated for a potentially lifethreatening flareup of an infection in two sores on his right legHis doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn pleaded last week with Bell Inc to keep McLaughlin saying his medical care was necessary He had ignored her advice and returned to work once already in April even as his daughter pleaded with him to stay in the hospitalIt was no use The 49yearold was two months shy of his oneyear anniversary with the company  too green to qualify for Family and Medical Leave Act benefits Bell told him he had to go that he didnt quality for medical leaveOur world fell apart in a week said his wife Kristi McLaughlin who works parttime as a pastor at a small Mitchell SD congregation about an hour west of here He was the primary income He was the primary breadwinner He provided the insurance Were looking now at food stamps Were looking at movingThe McLaughlins situation is not rareUnder state and federal law few legal protections are ironclad for employees who miss work for illness If attendance is deemed essential employers have little obligation to extend leave to employees on the job less than a yearBells chief executive Ben Arndt would confirm only that Tom McLaughlin had been a night supervisor for the Sioux Fallsbased folding packaging manufacturerWe respect our employees privacy and our policy is to not discuss employees personal matters with anyone other than the employee Arndt wrote in email We would encourage anyone who can meet the requirements of an open position to apply or to reapplyThose who work for companies with 50 or more employees can apply for unpaid time off under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act but they qualify only after a year on the job Hospital stays count but not every sort of illness doesIf an illness qualifies a covered employee is eligible for jobprotected unpaid leave of up to 12 weeksEven with a doctors note  or call in this case  employers are fully within their rights to terminate an ill worker go if that person hasnt been on the job a year An employer in South Dakota doesnt need a specific reason to fire an employee a legal concept called termination at willSouth Dakota has had a constitutional amendment that prohibits joining a union as a condition of employment what supporters call a righttowork law since 1946 according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Union contracts often provide additional protections for ill workers 6 of the states workers are represented by unions and 5 are membersOnly Connecticut California the District of Columbia and Massachusetts have state and districtwide paid sick leave laws according to the National Partnership for Women  Families a Washingtonbased nonprofit At least 18 cities also have such ordinances and Californias and Massachusetts laws arent effective until JulyIts unclear which if any other states require employers to provide unpaid time off for illness So how a worker whos sick is treated largely depends on where the person worksThose who believe theyve been discriminated against because of a disability as Tom McLaughlin does can file a complaint with the state ie the South Dakota Department of Labor and RegulationEven then the hurdles to overcome for an outcome in a workers favor are significant said James Marsh the departments labor and management division director Claims about job loss because of illness or disability make up about a fifth of the claims each yearWe get calls about that every day he saidOnly a fifth of all claims are substantiated Employers can terminate someone who is disabled because of poor attendance if attendance is considered an essential job functionMarsh gave an example of a police officer who has to be on the beatIf theyre not showing up theyre not fulfilling an essential job requirement Marsh saidIf South Dakotas lone claims investigator finds discrimination which takes about six months the resulting document can be used to file a civil lawsuit or a claim with the states Human Rights CommissionIts the difference between a cop pulling you over for speeding and a judge deciding youve committed a crime he said Were the cops  Youre not going to be guilty of discrimination by virtue of the fact that weve found probable causeThe state isnt the only avenue for claims of discrimination of course Federal discrimination claims about sex race age and disability go through the Equal Opportunity Employment CommissionIf the federal agency finds that a company has not made reasonable accommodations the EEOC can take action itself fining employers for a violation regardless of potential lawsuits Mediation is possible through the EEOC as wellTom McLaughlin believes that he was discriminated against but realizes that proving it could be an uphill slogThe company told Tom McLaughlin that he needed to be there on the floor as a supervisor he said But Tom McLaughlin knew that Bell had been without a night supervisor for years before he started in JuneOperations at the packagingmaterials plant had been reworked with him in the night supervisors role McLaughlin said But the work had been done without oneThey said Our hands are tied We dont have any choice  Tom McLaughlin said I said Bell has a choice They didnt have much to say about thatEven if he had a job he could not return to work tomorrow Even with the hospital care the infection is nowhere near goneHe wears a wound vacuum over his shoulder that pulls fluid at a steady drip through a tube connected to the blackbandaged plasticwrapped divots in his legA nurse comes to empty the bag three times a week Antibiotics are pumped into his arm dailyHe cant work on light duty for at least a few more weeks and full healing is at least three months and thousands of dollars awayHe wants to work He just cant not yetI cant remember the last time I havent been able to work Tom McLaughlin said
