Donald Trumps style puts a ceiling on his political appeal pundits have long suggested This week offered new evidenceHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueThis week the popular mass email that helps people build their vocabularies   AWordADay  featured a word that has been used to describe Donald Trump Its clairaudience and it means the supposed ability to hear what is inaudibleRolling Stone writer Paul Solotaroff has described the GOP presidential frontrunner as clairaudient  able to see into and hear the hearts of disaffected underemployed white people from his office on the 26thfloor of Trump Tower and to read their rage back to them word for word in ways that no Republican has ever done beforeBut the past two weeks suggest that clairaudience has its limitsLosing Wisconsin by 13 points is the latest evidence that Trumps strengths  reading voters and accurately identifying their concerns  are no longer outweighing his shortcomingsHis limitations have long been known He speaks off the cuff His policies lack specificity and practicality His demeanor can be boorishFor months the connection he has made with his core audience  in some cases through those very qualities  has limited any damageBut now with only two other competitors left in the race and Trump urgently needing 1237 delegates to avoid a contested convention in which the party will be aligned against him his clairaudience isnt enough So far hes won fewer than 50 percent of the delegates on offer to get to 1237 hell need to win more than 60 percent of those remaining In other words he needs to expand his supportAs a result the candidate who has broken all the political rules of how to run for president is at last having to reckon with themHes kind of like a guy in a barber shop that makes a lot of sense complaining about things But that doesnt mean he should be president of the United States says GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak who has not endorsed any candidateThis is the challenge going forward Can he grow as a candidate and can he grow as a credible nomineeNo question the billionaire has identified issues that voters care about says Republican pollster David Winston president of The Winston GroupAlong with Mr Cruz Trump criticizes lax immigration enforcement and wants to build a big barrier on the southern borderAlong with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders Trump has railed against international trade deals that have cost Americans wellpaying manufacturing jobsAnd he has made a consummate dealmakers complaint that the US is getting ripped off by allies who wont contribute a fair share to NATOIs Trump identifying dynamics that people care about Yes says Mr Winston who does polling for Republicans in Congress So youve identified the problem Great Whats your solutionUntil this week Trump has been able to successfully run a primary campaign on such broad policy prescriptions or none at all because of his celebrity his tellitlikeitis style and the fact that there were so many candidates in the race  candidates who mostly fought each other not himWith 17 candidates running theres not enough time to force details on tax cuts or whatever your foreign policy is says Mackowiak Now were down to three candidates and theres more of a requirement for specificityAs that dynamic has changed however Trump has not grown as a credible nominee Mr Mackowiak argues He cites the billionaires recent interviews on policy positions in The New York Times The Washington Post and other media Hes laid out positions such as a nucleararmed Japan and South Korea possibly leaving NATO and forcing Mexico to pay for a wall on the border by cutting off money that Mexicans in the US send back homeExperts have called these positions unworkable or even dangerous But perhaps more important to voters they have revealed how totally out of his depth he is on almost every major issue Mackowiak saysSo can Trump study up and act more presidential as he says his friends and family are urging him to doHes planning soon to roll out more policy speeches his speech on USIsraeli relationswas written by his soninlaw Recently one of his foreign policy advisers appeared on the respected PBS Newshour  but his team is made up of unknowns or people who have mixed reputations in foreign policy circles according to PoliticoHe would need a lot more than a few policy speeches written by somebody else to be a credible candidate for president He would need an entire personality transplant and thats not going to happen says GOP pollster Whit Ayres president of North Star Opinion Research Mr Ayres was the pollster for Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio who has dropped out of the raceTrump has said that he will be very presidential once he dispenses with his competitors Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich Hell be so presidential hes telling the media that theyll be boredBut in Wisconsin exit polls show that nearly 40 percent of Republicans said they would not vote for him if he were the nominee He would need north of 90 percent in his own party to win a general election Ayres points outMeanwhile his controversial style and broad policy pronouncements may have won him a loyal following among primary voters but his approach so far has also resulted in very high negative ratings among general election voters  unfavorables in the mid to high60sOne of Trumps challenges will be to find some way to drop those staggering negatives explains Winston Thats incredibly hard to do
