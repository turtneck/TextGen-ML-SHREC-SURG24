But on one issue  guns  President Barack Obama lets the public mask slip revealing the ire boiling withinBefore the cameras moved by the massacres of innocents that have punctuated his presidency Obama has wept his voice has cracked hes visibly shaken with frustration hes lashed out at lawmakers he sees as cowards and even led a congregation in Amazing GraceOn Tuesday as he faced a room filled with parents and relatives of victims of gun violence he stopped speaking grew silent and wiped away the tears that began to fall when he recalled the first graders killed in a Connecticut elementary school three years agoEvery time I think about those kids it gets me mad Obama said in the East Room of the White HouseAt times the President has questioned the nation he leads asking why no other advanced country seems so blighted with regular killing sprees and wondering aloud why Americans will not choose to stop the bloodshedEvolving through a cycle of sadness poleaxing grief frustration and outright fury Obama has even offered hints of selfrecrimination at his own earlier failure to touch the perfidious politics of gun control himselfBut so far all the emoting anger and frustration have added up to little Despite an expansive flexing of his executive powers Obama hampered by a Republican Congress and wary Democrats has failed to significantly tighten gun control lawsWe are not inherently more prone to violence But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency It doesnt happen in other advanced countries Its not even close Obama said Somehow we become numb to it and we start to feel that this is normal And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem this has become one of our most polarized partisan debates despite the fact that theres a general consensus in America about what needs to be doneHe added We do have to feel a sense of urgency about it In Dr Kings words we need to feel the fierce urgency of now  because people are dyingHe will also press for public support on the issue at a live town hall meeting hosted by CNN on Thursday night  making gun violence a priority of his final year in office days before his valedictory State of the Union addressObama insisted Tuesday that he merely wants to enact a few commonsense gun safety measures But the gun lobby is mobilizing and Republicans led by 2016 frontrunner Donald Trump insist Obama is out to make it impossible for people to buy gunsFrom the campaign trail to Tucson to AuroraObamas often demoralizing and politically radioactive experience with the politics of gun control started when he first set eyes on the White House and have confounded him ever sinceHe got off on the wrong foot with Second Amendment advocates with an offhand remark during his 2008 campaign when he said people in Midwest communities hit hard by economic blight cling to guns or religionThat seemed to many critics as disdainful of lawful firearms owners themselves a slip his foes have used again and again to warn the president is coming to get their gunsObama also appeared to underestimate the potency of the gun lobby and National Rifle Association back then as wellWhat we have to do is get beyond the politics of this issue Obama he said at a 2008 Democratic debate in PhiladelphiaBut when he took office gun control seemed far from his mind With a financial crisis raging and other priorities like health care reform demanding political capital Obama was absent on the issue while Democrats controlled both chambers of CongressAnd to be fair there were few Democrats  especially those in red states  who would have welcomed tough votes on gun controlAt a memorial service a saddened Obama comforted relatives and cracked hearts when he hoped the youngest victim nineyearold Christina Taylor Green was jumping in rain puddles in HeavenBut he used the tragedy not to make the kind of outspoken call for gun control that would become familiar in later years but to call on Americans to cleanse their poisoned politicsRather than pointing fingers or assigning blame lets use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations to listen to each other more carefully he saidIn the months to come Obama would be called upon to react to more shootings including one at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in which six people died and a massacre at a movie theater in Aurora Colorado in which 12 were killedBut the emotional strain was clearly beginning to take a toll as he wondered after Aurora how he would feel if his daughters had been caught at the sceneFor Obama the dam broke on what he later named as the worst day of his presidency in December 2012A few days later at a heartsearing memorial service loud sobs rang out in a school auditorium as Obama slowly read the roll of those killed while crossing a threshold  no longer reluctant to start talking politics as he mourned the deadWe as a nation are left with some hard questions  can we truly say as a nation that were meeting our obligations Obama said offering to put whatever power his office held to prevent more tragediesAnd Obama kept to his word  for several monthsThe process did not only leave Obama looking like hed let the relatives of the Newtown dead down it appeared to further sour him on Washington itself a town he no longer saw as moveable by the forces of hope and changeThis was a pretty shameful day for Washington Obama said in a stunningly frank appearance in the White House Rose Garden after the lost Senate vote in April 2013It came down to politics  the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections said Obama They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as antiSecond AmendmentObama did enact 23 executive actions that the White House says have been successful though officials admit that true reform is only possible through CongressBut gun control once again slipped down the presidents agenda  after the White House apparently concluded the politics of the issue were impossibleIt took another year shattered by tragedies in 2015 from a bloodbath in a church in Charleston South Carolina to a massacre at a community college in Roseburg Oregon to draw Obama back into the frayIn one of the seminal moments of his presidency Obama broke into Amazing Grace at a memorial service for a preacher and eight others killed in South Carolina by a gunman who wanted to incite a race warAfter another weary appearance at the White House podium after the Oregon shooting Obama made clear his heart was sick at the whole futile business of going before the cameras to bemoan another massacreSomehow this has become routine Obama told reportersHe made no apologies for politicizing the issue and warned this is not something I can do myself before going the extra step of worrying about his nations soulI would ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws he saidBut the killings went on After a radicalized Muslim couple staged a mass killing in San Bernardino California Obama faced a buzzsaw of Republican opposition when he spoke of the need to stop potential terrorists getting hold of guns GOP presidential candidates said he should be focused on the threat from radical Islam not making it more difficult for law abiding Americans to defend themselvesNow Obama is back to try again but even the President admits the measures are limited in scopeWe maybe cant save everybody but we could save some Just as we dont prevent all traffic accidents but we  try to reduce traffic accidents Obama said Tuesday As Ronald Reagan once said if mandatory background checks could save more lives it would be well worth making it the law of the landAnd with prospects bleak for any significant action in Congress Obamas latest effort may be more about making peace with the relatives of the dead and his own conscience as the result of a realistic assessment that change is possible now
