A CNNORC poll released WednesdaypinsJeb Bushs favorablerating at 35 percent compared to 57 percent who viewhim unfavorably The only good news is that hes 30 points above water amongRepublicans 61 percent to 31 percent and Republicans are the demographic that counts in a Republican primary He remains underwater among Tea Party supporters thoughHes way underwater among Democrats  but also among independents who view him unfavorably 30 percent to 62 percentThen theres ol Don Trump whos long held the position of candidate viewed most unfavorably thoughvery much likedby the people who do view him favorably hence the high national and earlystate polling numbers Trumps favorability rating sits at 38 percent with hisunfavorable at 58 percent Not that different from BushAnd then consider how each fares in a matchup with Hillary Clinton whose favorables arentin such great shapeeither Clinton defeats Trump by sixpercentage points 51 percent to 45 percent Against Bush She leads byninepercentage points 52 percent to 43 percentAll of which raises some questions about what exactly the GOP establishment and the many many wealthy donors who have donated to Bush see in him expect from him Or as the New York Times Nate Cohn puts itJeb Bush is supposed to be the electable one Thats why establishment donors flock to him get him past the primary by giving his super PAC over 100 million with which he can slam everyone else for as long as necessary and then he can win the general election in a way that Cruz or Walker or Trump cannot Thats because Jeb is supposedlythe most reasonable of the general election candidates the least beholden to ideological overreach and the one most rhetorically openarmed about wooing Hispanic voters into the Republican coalitionThe only problem is that the more the public sees of Jeb the more they dislike him and the thought of him becoming president That wretched 3062 figure among independents combined with a headtohead hypothetical in which he fares worse against Hillary Clinton than TRUMP does would seem to throw the whole rationale behind the Jeb Bush campaign down the toilet Which is funny because Jeb Bush doesnt come across as nearly as much of an asshole as many of the other candidates do He can seemmumbly or boring or stilted but not actively malevolent That hes doing so poorly among independents  and that 92percentof independents know enough about him to have an opinion is likely a function of his last name Bushhopes that the more he shows himself and explains his plans the more hell be viewed as his own personHes not executing this plan especially well The smartest thing that Jeb Bushhasdone this year was convince a whole host of wealthy Republican donors and establishment operatives to get behind his candidacyearlyNowthat theyve investedso much into this candidate theyre willing to stick it out well past the point at which the candidate has proven himself to be a boob
