As many have already observed one of the big questions that will help decide whether Hillary Clinton wins the White House next year is this Can Clinton turn out the coalition that helped power Barack Obamas 2008 and 2012 wins at the same levels that the president didA new poll by veteran Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg to be released later this morning illustrates the challenge Clinton facesThe new poll which was commissioned by Womens Voices Women Vote Action Fund and conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner shows that members of the Rising American Electorate  minorities millennials and single women  are significantly less tuned in to next years election than GOPaligned voter groups areThe poll has some good news for Democrats The survey which was taken in four key battleground states  Colorado Florida Ohio and Wisconsin  suggests that in those states the demographics do favor Dems Thats because the poll finds that RAE voter groups  who helped drive Obamas wins  now make up a majority or near majority of the vote in all those states The poll also finds Dems leading in Senate races in two of those states and tied in two othersBut members of the RAE are insufficiently engaged in next years election when compared to Republicanaligned voter groupsUnmarried women minorities and particularly millennials are less interested in next years voting than seniors conservatives and white noncollege men are Noncollege women  a group the Clinton camp is reportedly eyeing as a way to expand on the Obama coalition  are also less interestedUnmarried women are a key dynamic in American politics Page Gardner the president of Womens Voices Women Vote Action Fund tells me Its clear that the party or candidate who can increase turnout of unmarried women and the other segments of the Rising American Electorate will be wellpositioned for victory in 2016Now obviously there is a very long way to go and plenty of time for these voter groups to get more engaged If Clinton wins the Democratic nomination and the prospect of electing the first female president seems increasingly within reach you could see engagement kicking in much more substantially It will be interesting to see how noncollege unmarried minority and millennial women respondBut Greenbergs pollsters are sounding the alarm now warning that Democrats need to take more steps to tailor their message towards boosting the interest level among these voters As Stan Greenberg outlines in his new book America Ascendant the key to engaging these voters is twofold It isnt enough to simply outline bold economic policies to deal with college affordability child care universal preK workplace flexibility paid family and sick leave and so forth though those things are crucial Whats also required to engage these groups Greenberg argues is a reform agenda geared to reducing the influence of the wealthy the lobbyists and the special interests over our politics Todays new poll suggests the sameThe basic problem outlined by Greenberg and noted by other Dem pollsters is that even if Democratic economic policies are broadly popular this isnt enough on its own because many Americans dont believe government can or will actually deliver on those policies Greenberg writes when voters hear the reform narrative first they are dramatically more open to the middleclass economic narrative that calls for government activism in response to Americas problemsThus its not an accident that Clinton in addition to embracing a robust economic agenda has also stressed campaign finance and voting access reform Her campaign knows engaging these voter groups on Obamalike levels is crucial to her White House hopes and seems to share in Greenbergs analysis ITS ON TED CRUZ VERSUS MARCO RUBIO Bloomberg reports that Ted Cruz is carefully escalating the attacks on Marco Rubio now that both are roughly tied in national polls Cruz is making the case that he is a real conservative while Rubio is competing in the moderate lane ButAs I noted on Friday the GOP race could shape up as a battle between CubanAmericans over who is more antiamnesty ARE DEMS BROADENING THE SENATE MAP Politico takes a look at the Senate map and finds signs that Democrats may be putting unexpected states in playBut Dem chances of winning in places like North Carolina and Indiana may not be as great as expected Still Dems only have to flip four seats out of the above seven if they win the White House  A BIG PUSH FOR AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION The New York Times reports that a group called iVote which is headed by former aides to Barack Obama and Bill Clinton is pushing a national bill that would require states to make voter registration automatic with the issue of drivers licenses Thats not going anywhere ButIts another reminder of the longterm importance for Democrats of regaining ground on the level of the states AMERICANS DONT THINK GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR THEM A Los Angeles Times poll released over the weekend showed a fascinating disconnect Americans say by roughly 6040 that unfairness in the economic system that favors the wealthy is a bigger problem than overregulation of the free market that interferes with growthBut only one in 10 say the federal government increases opportunities for people like me while half say government gets in the way This  majorities see an unfair economy but most dont believe government can do anything about it for them  perhaps confirms the problem laid out in the lead item Though generic government always polls badly A DEEP DIVE INTO HILLARYS EMAILS Hillary Clinton has claimed that 90 to 95 percent of her work related emails are in the State Department system Glenn Kessler does a very deep dive into the controversy over this statement and what is really true and what isnt concluding that it is not unreasonable for her to claim that most those emails might be in the State Departments system but that it is wrong for her to definitively declare this to be soThe upshot is that these emails were sent over State Department servers because they were sent to other State employees with gov accounts but the department has not made any official determination of how many of them have been captured WHY IS MORTALITY RISING AMONG WHITES With a new paper showing rising mortality rates among middle aged whites Paul Krugman knocks down the conservative explanation that faults the left for eroding traditional valuesKrugman also suggests that many of these Americans may be feeling betrayed by the American dream though he concedes economic explanations may not account for whats happening AND WEVE HIT ANOTHER GRIM CLIMATE MILESTONE Nothing to see here folksWhich gives me another excuse to link to my new feature on the current state of GOP climate skepticism
