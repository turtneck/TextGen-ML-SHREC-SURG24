Theres not really any good news for the GOP in the aftermath of yesterdays House Benghazi Committee interrogation of Hillary Clinton There had been some flickers of hope among conservative activists that the committee Republicans led by chairman Trey Gowdy would finally produce the longrumored smoking gun that would prove once and for all that Hillary did whatever evil thing she supposedly did with regard the Benghazi Or maybe theyd goad her into making a terrible gaffe that would ruin her politically But thats not what happenedAfter weeks of damaging stories about the Benghazi committees partisan agenda and vanishing credibility it might have done Gowdy some good to put together a quiet and informative hearing that was befitting the serious investigation that he insisted he was leading Instead Gowdy took the lead role in proving correct each one of his Republican colleagues who said the committee was focused on damaging Hillary Clintons presidential chancesIn his opening statement Gowdy tried to shoot down allegations that the committee was focused on Clinton There are people frankly in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you Gowdy said to Hillary at the outset Let me assure you it is not But when it came time for Gowdy to ask questions he focused singularly on Clintons emails with Sidney Blumenthal a longtime Clinton friend and DC barnacle who was feeding Hillary intelligence reports from a source he knew in Libya Gowdy used the volume of emails sent from Blumenthal to Clinton to portray him as a key advisor who had unfettered access to Clinton and contrasted him with slain Libya ambassador Chris Stevens who never emailed Clinton directly Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you Madame Secretary but the ambassador did not Gowdy asked with much gravityGowdys implication  that Stevens either lacked access to Clinton or that Clinton prioritized her communications with Blumenthal  was flagrantly false and Gowdy knows it was false Stevens had access to Clinton through a variety of means and could have been in touch with her at a moments notice if hed wanted But Gowdy used the frequency of email communication  and only email communication  to give the impression that Blumenthal was in the loop while the ambassador was notThis theme was picked up on by his Republican colleagues who werent nearly as subtle in their dishonesty as Gowdy was Rep Mike Pompeo grandiosely asked Clinton if Stevens had had Clintons cell phone number fax number or home address and if hed ever stopped by your house After Clinton said no to all these things Pompeo went in for what he thought was the kill Mr Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things This man who provided you so much information on Libya had access to you in ways that were very different from the access that a very senior diplomat had to you and your person If youre the sort of thickheaded dolt who thinks the ambassador was at a disadvantage because he couldnt send the Secretary of State a postcard or pop in on her every Sunday afternoon then this point was probably quite compellingWhile the Republicans were wasting their time trying to portray Clinton as a tool of Sid Blumenthal the Democrats used their time to make clear just how pointless they believe the entire investigation is and allowed Clinton her opportunities to offer sanitized and carefully worded defenses of the Libya intervention At least one member of the committee used the hearing to pose useful and interesting questions about issues that arose from the Benghazi attack Rep Tammy Duckworth DIL She asked Clinton about policies for outsourcing security to local militias and security contractors which has caused problems for the State Department and other government agencies All in all it was a bust for Gowdy and the Benghazi committee to the point that conservative pundits were griping about how poorly the Republicans fared against Clinton Anyone who doubted that the committee was a partisan exercise in Clintonbashing came away free of doubts The only sliver of good news for the Republicans is that it likely wont matter The notion that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton engineered some sort of evil Benghazi coverup is already assumed to be true in the minds of conservatives and Republican voters The fact that Gowdy and crew spent the day stepping on rakes and scoring owngoals in a failed attempt to prove it wont change their minds And the House GOP wont put the brakes on the investigation because the committees utility as a vehicle for strategic press leaks outweighs the bad press its enduring at the moment The Benghazi committee will grind on performing much the same role it always has
