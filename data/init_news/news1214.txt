Matt Bevin the Republican nominee in the Kentucky governors race wasnt a very good candidate By all accounts he was standoffish and ill at ease on the campaign trail and inconsistent  to put it nicely  when it came to policy The Republican Governors Association frustrated with Bevin and his campaign pulled its advertising from the state Polling done in the runup to todays vote showed Bevin trailing state Attorney General Jack Conway DAnd yet Bevin won going away on Tuesday night How Two words BarackObamaObama is deeply unpopular in Kentucky He won under 38 percent of the vote in the Bluegrass State in 2012 after taking 41 percent in 2008 In the 2012 Democratic primary uncommitted took 42 percent of the vote against the unchallenged Obama One Republican close to the Kentucky gubernatorial race said that polling done in the final days put Obamas unpopularity at 70 percentSo when the RGA returned to Kentucky for the final two weeks with 1 million worth of ads you can guess who was prominently featuredYup President Obama And in particular his famousinfamous comments about his policies being on the ballot during an October 2014 economic speech at Northwestern Here are the key 28 wordsfrom Obama I am not on the ballot this fall Michelles pretty happy about that But make no mistake these policies are on the ballot Every single one of themRepublicans clubbed Democrats in swing and GOPleaning states with Obamas comments in the 2014 midterms So why not repeat the same blueprint a year laterOur families cant afford four more years of the liberal policies of President Obama and career politicians like Jack Conway the ads narrator says as ominous pictures of the two men are shown on thescreen Can you really trust Obama and Conway to make things betterNow it wasnt solely Obamas popularity that cost Conway on Tuesday night Conway was the anchor around Conway said one Democratic strategist familiar with the polling in the contest In many ways Conway is the former Massachusetts state attorney general Martha Coakley of Kentucky Theres just something about him that voters simply dont want to vote forConway might not be Kentuckys cup of tea But Bevin from his odd and lessthanpromised primary challenge to Sen Mitch McConnell R in 2014 all the way through his surprise primary win in this race and rougharoundtheedges general election campaign was far from the ideal GOP candidate eitherThe difference Conway had a D after his name  just like President Obama And in a state like Kentucky that appears to be more than enough
