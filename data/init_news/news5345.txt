The Democratic Party Got Crushed During The Obama Presidency Heres WhyThe GOP may be in the midst of an identity crisis but the Democratic Party is also facing a political crisis that could be made a lot worse if it doesnt win the White House in NovemberPart of President Obamas legacy is the health of his party Hes had many successes in office  health care reform climate change regulations Wall Street reform  but his legacy will also include one huge failure a diminished Democratic PartyEvery president sees his party lose hundreds of positions  its the price a party holding the White House pays  but no president has come close to Obama During Obamas eight years in office the Democrats have lost more House Senate state legislative and governors seats than under any other presidentWhen Obama took office there were 60 Democratic senators now there are 46 The number of House seats held by Democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188There are now nine fewer Democratic governors than in 2009 Democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s1 There are two different electorates in AmericaThere is Presidential Election America where turnout is diverse The electorate is younger browner more single more secular  more Democratic Then theres Midterm Election America where the electorate is older whiter more rural more churchgoing  in other words more Republican Whats great for Republicans and bad for Democrats is that the vast majority of the governorships and state legislative seats are elected in the midtermsAnd those positions are the seed corn for a party  theyre the farm teams for higherlevel offices Right now the Democrats are at a very low ebbThis is something President Obama lamented when he campaigned for Democrats in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014 Republicans manage to turn out their voters every two years but Democrats for some reason only turn their voters out every four Maybe Obama mused because Democrats just dont think midterms are sexy enoughDemocrats had one spectacularly bad piece of luck The Republicans Tea Partyfueled surge in 2010 was perfectly timed to coincide with the decennial census after which new congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by governors and state legislatures Republicans huge gains in the 2010 midterms put them in the drivers seat when it came time to draw new congressional districts in 2011 Former Pennsylvania Gov Ed Rendell remembers what happened when Republicans took over the governors mansion and the Legislature in his stateWhen I left office in January of 2011 says Rendell there were 13 Democratic congressman and six Republican congressman As a result of redistricting in the 2010 election that turned around and we now have 13 Republican congressmen and five Democratic congressmanIts not only bad timing and gerrymandering that have hollowed out the Democratic Party Mo Elleithee a former Democratic National Committee official says Democrats have never put enough effort and resources into state legislative races Republicans on the other hand make those races a top priority4 Too many Democrats live in citiesThis is another problem that makes it easier for Republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage Democrats Democratic voters are clumped together in urban areas You could say that for the purposes of winning elections Democratic voters are just not efficiently distributedIts why even in red states like Texas and Utah there are cities that are solidly Democratic  and why lesbian mayors were elected in Houston and Salt Lake City When Democrats cluster in and around cities they win local elections but that doesnt help them win suburban or rural congressional seatsThis November the stakes for Democrats couldnt be higher Without the White House assuming party control elsewhere remains the same Democrats would be truly out in the cold
