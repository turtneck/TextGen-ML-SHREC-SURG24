President Obamas 2016 budget seeks higher spending on education roads and bridges and a boost to middle class incomes Republicans want to spend more on defense The search for common ground is onIts Budget Day in Washington and President Obama is taking a sharp turn from the pastGone is an emphasis on deficit reduction Talk of putting Social Security and other safety net programs on a more sustainable path has also been put to the side Now with deficits down Mr Obama is focused on boosting the middle class and reducing income inequality That means higher taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations and more government spendingWhat Id like to see is not only that the economy continues to grow but I also want to make sure that everybodys benefiting Obama told NBC News Sunday looking ahead to his final two years in officeThe result is a nearly 4 trillion federal budget plan for fiscal 2016 that ditches what Obama calls mindless austerity and raises spending for domestic priorities  foremost on education infrastructure and tax relief for middleincome Americans  as well as on national security By proposing higher defense spending Obama hopes to lure Republicans into a dealMany Republicans agree that the sequester  the automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts put in place two years ago  is a bad way to budget But theyre not ready to go along with what Obama has in mind And so while deficits are down that doesnt necessarily mean Washington is on the verge of a spending spreePolitical reality points to a tough slog ahead Republicans now control both houses of Congress and if they can agree amongst themselves on what to present Obama  and thats a big if  he could face tough choices of his own later this year to keep the government runningWhats more deficit hawks have hardly given up They point to retiring Baby Boomers and the prospect of skyrocketing interest payments on the debt with alarm Though annual deficits have shrunk markedly from the early Obama years they will begin to rise again in 2018 reaching 11 trillion in 2025 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week If Obamas 10year budget plan were to become reality nearly 6 trillion would be added to the federal debt which now stands at 18 trillionBut for now Obama is all about planting a flag for the middle class which involves investment  ie spending Presidential budget proposals are a statement of priorities and the opening bid in a negotiation not a blueprint for what will happenThis year as the race to succeed Obama gets under way the budget is especially political Its also a reaction to the blowout of last Novembers midterms when Republicans won control of the Senate and built a larger majority in the House Just as Obama appeared ebullient even liberated in his recent State of the Union address so too is his budget almost a declaration of independenceThe president is not running for reelection so hes a little freer to propose what he wants says Stan Collender a budget expert and executive vice president at Qorvis MSL Group Since hes proposing it to a Republican Congress and its dead before typesetting hes also free because he doesnt need to come up with something Democrats will acceptThe budget is also a campaign document Not only does it set the table for Hillary Rodham Clinton strongly favored to win the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination it also affects the partys bid to retake the Senate and win back House seats Whether former Secretary of State Clinton known as more of a centrist wants to move so far to the left is another matter But for now Obama may have at least mollified the restive liberal base of the Democratic PartyAnd there is plenty in Obamas budget for liberals to cheer about including free community college costing 60 billion over 10 years and a sixyear 478 billion program to repair the nations roads bridges airports and other infrastructure To pay for his college plan Obama would change how inherited wealth is taxed Money for the infrastructure plan would come from a onetime 14 percent tax on corporate wealth repatriated from overseasObama also proposes a 19 percent minimum tax rate on corporate profits earned overseas as part of a larger overhaul of taxes that would take the corporate rate down from 35 percent to 28 percent and 25 percent for manufacturersAn overhaul of the entire tax code has long been on Washingtons agenda but amid partisan gridlock the process hasnt gotten off the ground Rep Paul Ryan R of Wisconsin the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee which handles taxation signaled on Sunday that hes open to working on tax reform with Obama but warned it will be difficultWe want to work with this administration to see if we can find common ground  and we want to exhaust that possibility and if and when that possibility is exhausted then we will put out what we think ought to be done Congressman Ryan said Sunday on NBCs Meet the PressWe havent done tax reform since 1986 because it is just that hard he addedOther elements of Obamas budget were telegraphed in advance In calling for an end to the sequester Obama proposed a 7 percent hike in discretionary spending for both domestic and defense spending by roughly equal amounts Domestic nonentitlement spending would go up 37 billion over the sequester caps to 530 billion defense spending would rise by 38 billion to 561 billionThe rest of the budget is consumed by nondiscretionary spending entitlements such as Social Security Medicare and Medicaid plus interest on the debtObama used to speak regularly about the perils of deficits and the everrising federal debt which is the cumulative total of annual deficits In 2010 he appointed a panel the SimpsonBowles commission to come up with proposals for tackling the nations unsustainable fiscal path The Budget Control Act of 2011 did bring spending down via sequestration but now both parties are ready to move away from that techniqueSome economists argue that deficits and debt are sustainable as long as they remain at a reasonable percentage of the size of the US economy But deficit hawks are as alarmed as everEntitlement reform  the most critical piece of fixing our fiscal situation  is the disappearing story of the upcoming budget cycle says Maya MacGuineas president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget The debt levels are still quite scary and yet were about to see a budget that no longer even aspires to get control of the debt
