potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaignClinton who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention delivered a strong performance in

staying off the campaign trail recentlyI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate she said And yes I did And you know what else I prepared for I prepared to be President And that is a good thingTrump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate and made some effective points on the economy and jobs  some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans But the debate highlighted Trumps tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing his support for the Iraq War and

I ever thought he told CNNs Dana BashA CNNORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62 felt Clinton won compared to 27 for Trump The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCainOne of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the socalled birther debate following Trumps recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US  a fact that has been evident for years

In one practice debate Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women campaign sources saidReines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foeThe Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton but his preparation has been less intense than his opponents in keeping with his more freewheeling style He did not hold mock debates for instance with someone standing in for Clinton
