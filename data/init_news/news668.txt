The Senates failure to extend the USA Patriot Act will bring the legislation on NSA phonerecord collection and other key surveillance activities perilously close to expiring on June 1 forcing senators to return early from recess for a rare Sunday sessionThe Senate vote was just one of two this weekend that set the stage for dramatic showdowns on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks and monthsThe GOPled upper chamber passed bipartisan legislation Friday night to strengthen President Obamas hand in global trade talks However the legislation must now pass the Republicanled House with help from Democrats because some conservative members oppose the legislationSpeaker John Boehner supports the measure and says Republicans will do their part to pass itDozens of House Republicans oppose the legislation either out of ideological reasons or because they are loath to enhance Obamas authority especially at their own expenseSenate and now House Democrats are showing little inclination to support legislation that much of organized labor opposesOn the Patriot Act bill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will bring the upper chamber back into session on Sunday May 31  roughly 24 hours before the post911 legislation expiresMeanwhile the National Security Agency is starting to winding down its bulk collection of domesticcalling records in preparation for the Senate voting again against the legislation according to the Justice Department which says the collection takes time to haltThe Senate went into the early hours on Saturday morning to vote on the legislation before leaving Washington for Memorial Day recessBy the time senators broke for the holiday they had blocked a Housepassed bill and several shortterm extensions of the key provisions in the Patriot ActThe main stumbling block was a Housepassed provision to end the NSA collecting the phonecall metadata and instead have the records remain with telephone companies subject to a casebycase reviewMcConnell warned against allows the NSA and other key surveillance programs under the act to expireHowever he and other key Republican senators oppose the House approach backed by officials who argued it is the best way for the United States to keep valuable surveillance toolsFellow GOP Kentucky Sen Rand Paul also a 2016 presidential candidate called the Senates failure to allow the extension a victory for privacy rightsWe should never give up our rights for a false sense of security Paul said in a statement This is only the beginning  the first step of many I will continue to do all I can until this illegal government spying program is put to an end once and for allThe White House has pressured the Senate to back the House bill which drew an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote last week and had the backing of GOP leaders Democrats and the libertarianleaning membersBut the Senate blocked the bill on a vote of 5742 short of the 60vote threshold to move ahead That was immediately followed by rejection of a twomonth extension to the existing programs The vote was 5445 again short of the 60vote thresholdMcConnell repeatedly asked for an even shorter renewal of current law ticking down days from June 8 to June 2 But Paul and other opponents of the postSept 11 law objected each timeAt issue is a section of the Patriot Act Section 215 used by the government to justify secretly collecting the to and from information about nearly every American landline telephone call For technical and bureaucratic reasons the program was not collecting a large chunk of mobile calling records which made it less effective as fewer people continued to use landlinesWhen former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the program in 2013 many Americans were outraged that NSA had their calling records President Obama ultimately announced a plan similar to the USA Freedom Act and asked Congress to pass it He said the plan would preserve the NSAs ability to hunt for domestic connections to international plots without having an intelligence agency hold millions of Americans private recordsSince it gave the government extraordinary powers Section 215 of the Patriot Act was designed to expire at midnight on May 31 unless Congress renews itUnder the USA Freedom Act the government would transition over six months to a system under which it queries the phone companies with known terrorists numbers to get back a list of numbers that had been in touch with a terrorist numberBut if Section 215 expires without replacement the government would lack the blanket authority to conduct those searches There would be legal methods to hunt for connections in US phone records to terrorists said current and former US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly But those methods would not be applicable in every caseFar less attention has been paid to two other surveillance authorities that expire as well One makes it easier for the FBI to track lone wolf terrorism suspects who have no connection to a foreign power and another allows the government to eavesdrop on suspects who continuously discard their cellphones in an effort to avoid surveillanceThe Associated Press contributed to this report
