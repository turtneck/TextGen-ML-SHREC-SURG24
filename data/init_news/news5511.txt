What To Watch For At Democrats First DebateA bruised Hillary Clinton will have much to prove as she takes the debate stage Tuesday evening alongside four of her Democratic presidential challengers The former secretary of state has been damaged by lingering questions about her private email server and doubts about her trustworthinessThat has partly enabled Vermont independent Sen Bernie Sanders to ride a wave of progressive support to a lead over her in New Hampshire and an impressive 25 million fundraising haul last quarterSanders too will need to impress in his most highprofile appearance so far This will be the first chance for many voters to see him on stage and theyll be watching to see if hes someone they want to be presidentIts certainly not going to be as entertaining as some of the previous Republican debates but it will be important especially for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to finally show the broader public what exactly theyre made of said Jim Manley a longtime Democratic strategist and former top Senate aideOf course theres also the elephant  or rather the donkey  in the room Vice President Joe Biden Hes not yet announced his intentions as he continues a public flirtation with a bid CNN has left open the possibility of allowing Biden on stage even if he were to decide as late as Tuesday He has given no indication that he will do soBut perhaps the most important thing for Democrats is that its finally their turn in the political spotlight After two rollicking GOP debates and a cycle thats largely been dominated by the outsiders in the Republican field party loyalists have worried they are being overshadowedThis is the first real opportunity for a Democratic message to break through said Mo Elleithee a former Democratic National Committee communications director who now directs the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service The numbers game is working against us right now and the Republican message is penetrating far more than the Democratic messageHeres what to watch for from each candidate in the first Democratic debate CNNs coverage begins at 830 pm ET while the debate is expected to start at 9 pm ET Tuesday on CNNNeed Appear likable and straightforward especially when talking about those emails and recent policy positionsShe will be center stage and the center of attention Shes the most experienced campaign debater on stage  there were 25 primary debates in 2008  and that will be an asset But Clinton still has some of the same struggles she had eight years ago  trying to appear likable and not scripted to a public very skeptical of traditional politiciansIn Hillarys case she has to be more likable and come across as genuine and down to earth said Dan Payne a Democratic strategist and debate coach She is those things from what people say who know her well She can talk to daytoday people about their lives and share experiences but somehow it doesnt come across when shes on camera She gets stiff and stern and not likableShe wasnt that way during her cameo on Saturday Night Live last week Payne noted and that should be an instance her team should draw fromShe was selfaware he added She was poking fun at herself and doing it with a laugh If she can do that in the debate occasionally it can helpOne of the first questions directed to her will likely be about her email server She has yet to put to rest questions about why she had the private server and whether it was a security threat Last month she finally apologized for the decision but it may have been too little too lateIn an interview on 60 Minutes on Sunday President Obama said the server was not a nationalsecurity threat But he did not forcefully defend Clinton instead directing questions back to herI would hope that if pressed she would again apologize for allowing this to be an issue in the first place said Manley who is a Clinton supporterIts no mistake that in the runup to the debate Clinton came out against both the Keystone XL Pipeline and Obamas TransPacific Partnership something she once called the gold standard of trade agreements Clinton was trying to clean up messy policy positions ahead of the debateBut Clinton will still likely have to answer whether the moves were politically calculated Sanders and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley have been against both for some time expect them to point out the disparityNeed Convince a national audience hes presidential material and that he can branch out beyond his core economic messageWhile Sanders may not have had much campaign debating experience  he has faced mostly safe elections in Vermont  he does have more than two decades of congressional experience to draw from He brings skills debating on the House and Senate floor and in committees to Tuesdays eventHis challenge will be translating the considerable enthusiasm hes been generating on the campaign trail to the debate stage Filling arenas is quite impressive but facing questions from moderators and elbows from his rivals is another thing entirelyHe can give a line or two or three and get a roar from the crowd Payne said but you have much longer in a TV debate  you have to sustain your argument for 45 seconds to a minuteDont expect Sanders to go for the jugular against his chief rival though As much as the moderators might try to goad him into it the Vermont senator has largely avoided direct attacks on Clinton and his team has telegraphed to expect the same on Tuesday Instead of focusing on lobbing hits Politico reported his somewhat limited debate prep has instead been policyheavyUltimately Democrats say they dont anticipate fireworks between the two top candidatesI suspect that neither one is really going to go after the other predicted Elleithee who worked on Clintons 2008 campaign They may disagree and they will point out where they disagree Thats normal and thats fine But I dont think youll see either one come in and try to tear the other one down That would be a bad strategyBut Sanders will have to keep his cool throughout the debate too Hes been testy with reporters when pressed in the past and that type of reaction might not play well in front of a national TV audienceIn Bernies case he has to be in control and not appear unpleasant  be a man who you could conceivably believe is president said Payne the debate coach If youre angry it may come across as extremely harshNeed Show he belongs in consideration as a toptier candidateAvoid Debating about debates and getting on a high horseFormer Maryland Gov Martin OMalley has struggled to catch fire but has also proven to be the most dogged Clinton attacker of the bunch  another element Clinton will have to manageUltimately OMalley may have the most to gain and the most to lose during Tuesdays debate Once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party he was supposed to have been the top alternative to Clinton Instead that distinction has gone to Sanders or possibly even Biden if he does indeed runNow OMalley needs to give a rationale for his candidacy and prove he can be an able sparring partner with both Clinton and Sanders OMalley has vigorously pushed for more debates instead of the scheduled six faceoffs and he needs to show why thats a good idea for himThis could be his Scott Walker moment Elleithee said comparing OMalley to the Wisconsin governor whose presidential campaign was doomed after a dismal performance in the second GOP debateOMalley can either break through and show he deserves to be considered as a toptier candidate he continued or if he doesnt break through his advisers are going to have to circle up recalibrate and figure out what theyre going to say to donors The rationale for his candidacy is not very evidentThat doesnt mean OMalley should come in being a bombthrower which could backfire on stage Instead he needs to draw wellreasoned contrasts with his opponentsOne top issue where he could do that is on gun control which is back in the news after yet another mass shooting last week OMalley has by far the most progressive and farreaching plan of any Democratic candidate He also stands in contrast especially with Sanders who has had a mixed record on the issueNeed A breakout moment to show theyre serious candidatesAvoid Getting left out of the conversationThe other two candidates on stage  former Virginia Sen Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov Lincoln Chafee  have been almost entirely absent from the campaign trail and will simply need to explain why theyre in the race Both need to introduce themselves to voters as expectations are already very lowWebb the only veteran on the stage could bring a valuable voice in terms of foreign policy and national securityHe needs to tell his story Payne said He was a star in the making eight years ago but once he left the Senate his star has all but extinguishedChafee a former GOP senator turned independent turned Democrat could still have to explain his liberal bona fides and defend a controversial tenure as Rhode Island governor Expect him to needle Clinton on her vote for the Iraq War  and to point out that even as a Republican he opposed it from the startBoth Webb and Chafee need a breakthrough moment
