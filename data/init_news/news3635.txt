  Ed wasnt excited about his job He worked for a large automotive manufacturer This is the kind of industry that might invest heavily into robots and research and development but when it comes to managing their supply chain and accounts receivable their IT infrastructure was frozen in amber circa 1974 The pay was fine but the work was frustrating Things like Code reviews and refactoring were viewed as wastes of time or developers playing with toys Unit tests were a luxury for lazy developers good developers should just be writing code that works If the work youre doing isnt directly involved in getting cars built and shipped you shouldnt be doing it Ed was looking to get out of the company and while he kept sending out resumes he found more excuses to get away from his desk by taking smoke breaks with Mitchell Mitchell was a lifer he joined the company back when pensions were a thing and was close enough to retirement that he just needed to keep his head down and stay the course to check out with a nice nestegg But you hed tell Ed youve gotta get out of here Youre young You shouldnt be wasting your time here After one of those smoke breaks Ed returned to his desk to see Pilar waiting for him Pilar was their summer intern a junior in college She mostly handled manual reporting which was a euphemism for we dont actually have a reporting system for this data set so we have an intern run SQL queries against production and then copypaste the results into a spreadsheet Yes there were still manual reports because none of the SBUs wanted to pay to automate them Ive got a new report she said and its on something called SCORDBE You wouldnt know how I get access would you Ed didnt know At best he might have seen the acronym someplace on a PowerPoint during a quarterly meeting once No but has anyone shown you the Internal Apps Sheet He was referencing a spreadsheet used to track support contacts for different applications He CTRLFed to the entry for SCORDBE Oh no The SCORDBE database was administered by Yev TicketNazi Kassem He automatically closed any tickets for changing the database even for production releases Any ticket requesting access to the database for any reason received a simple reply NO ACCOUNT FOR YOU He used IP whitelists to prevent connections from unapproved devices While it probably was good for security that was an afterthought Yev had a small bit of power and he wanted to make sure that he held onto it Still that was just the database side There was an application on top of that database He scrolled across the spreadsheet past the cloumns for Approving Manager SBU Contact SBU Backup Contact SBU Backup Bakcup Contact and found IT Development Contact It was Mitchell I dont think youll get very far with the database Ed said But maybe Mitchell can help Pilar went off to visit Mitchell and Ed got back to his regular work A half hour later Mitchell CCed him on an email to Pilar Ive got a solution Just visit this URL and itll run your query And you can change the id part at the end to do it for other part numbers Ed didnt think much about it until his next smoke break So he said howd you get past the TicketNazi Mitchell laughed I didnt He paused and lit his cigarette taking a few drags before explaining SCORDBE is about 35000 lines of Perl written back in the 90s Nobody ever wants to touch this code and nobody really understands what it does I figured there had to be some poorly escaped queries so I just grepped until I found one Now we can run adhoc queries as needed Ed left the company a short time later Mitchell and his injectionbased reporting solution however are still there Advertisement BuildMaster integrates with an evergrowing list of tools to automate and facilitate everything from continuous integration to database change scripts to production deployments Interested Learn more about BuildMaster
