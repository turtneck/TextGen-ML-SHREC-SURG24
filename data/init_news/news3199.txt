October has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign In the beginning of the month women came forward accusing Trump of unwelcome advances Later FBI Director James Comey reopened the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton after finding more government emails on pervert Anthony Weiners computer But the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights Hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective serviceThe meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the DraftOurDaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the Hillary campaign First Hillary is a radical feminist Thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat As a step in that direction Hillary told the Huffington Post that she will support legislation to register for the draftYoung women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal They should reconsider because of the second policy of the Clinton campaign She will almost certainly start a war against Russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front linesHillary has repeatedly blamed Russia for Wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military actionAs president I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack We will be ready with serious political economic and military responses The DraftOurDaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the Hillary campaign To get elected Hillary relies on two demographics People of Color and liberal white women Up until now women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively If they become aware that Hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with Russia they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist positionHere are some of the best examples of the DraftOurDaughters campaignI feel this one is the most powerful It clearly states Hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with Russia Unlike the Arab nations that the US has been toppling for the neocons Russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons Any military conflict will not be short and easy That means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect HillaryThe above three ads all target the weak cowardly men who either support Hillary or the Never Trump cuckservatives In the Alt Right these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives Hence they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own My wifes son or My wifes daughterThe ad below drives this point home even more forcefully While women might encourage their men to vote Hillary or oppose Trump for being too alpha they secretly despise the weakness of these menThe following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist Feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your Louboutins for combat boots Lots of the ads emphasize Hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward Putin and Russia She has blamed WikiLeaks on Russian hacking even though there is no proof that the Russians were to blame And she and the Obama administration have been saber rattling against Russia in SyriaThe really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the US must go to war with Russia All the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like HillaryThe ad below indicates that our enemy Putin has a saner view on women in combat than the Democrats doWhile the campaign is mostly geared to point out Hillarys intention to draft women it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that Hillary will startThe media often portrays war as a sanitized affair A soldier safely positioned in a USlocated command center controls a drone that takes out the bad guys The reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed Once Hillary gets in it wont be just men dying in large numbers Women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed outA final ad drives home the point that the future war with Russia and Iran and Syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil It will be for Hillarys power trip Conclusion Elections matter For decades women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people If they are successful in electing Hillary they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions But unfortunately they will not be the only people impacted Thousands of innocent Americans Russians Syrians and Iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signalingThe DraftOurDaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their follyRead More Hillarys Alt Right Speech Bombed
