posted by Eddie Below is a great example of how police harass the innocent CJ and Matt were simply walking at night They had committed no crime and presented no threat to anothers property or person when a police officer decided to detain them This police officer had no reasonable suspicion to stop these guys so he says they were loitering Apparently walking through a public space at night is now loitering After stopping them the officer claims that not answering questions is suspicious activity Apparently the 5th Amendment to the Constitution is suspicious to this cop Some people will say that he should have consented and answered the questions this cop was asking However they have probably never heard this lecture by officer George Bruch of the Virginia Beach Police Department explaining why you should never never never ever talk to the police ever The police will all to often use your own words to imply that a crime has been committed even if you are innocent Around the 430 mark in the video CJ makes this officer look pretty silly It was good that CJ got this jab in early as the night had apparently just started for these cops Tax payer money well spent
