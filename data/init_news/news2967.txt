On the day ISISrelated terrorists spread out across Paris and killed more than one hundred people Barack Obama claimed ISIS was contained After the attacks liberals actually tried to argue that the attacks in Paris showed how successful Barack Obama had been because ISIS was having to lash out to get attention Yes liberals actually argued thisEarlier this year while President Obama still considered ISIS to be a junior varsity team he said the greatest threat to humanity was global warmingAt Saturday nights Democratic debate Bernie Sanders reaffirmed that global warming was the greatest threat to humanity and was also the root cause of terrorism in the Middle East Meanwhile Martin OMalley said he still wanted to bring 60000 Syrian refugees into this country though we now know some of those refugees were involved in the Paris attackThe White House Deputy National Security Advisor saysthe importation of refugees will go ahead as plannedThen there is Hillary Clinton As John Podhoretznoted Sunday the former Secretary of States policy solutions amount to a jumble of contradictory platitudesWe must root out ISIS she said and implicitly criticized Obama when she said it cannot be contained it must be defeated At the same time she said it cannot be an American fight However American leadership is essential And yet she said I dont think that the United States has the bulk of the responsibilityInstead and breathtakingly she suggests the person who must take the lead is Syrias dictator himself responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of his own people and the progenitor of the refugee crisis that is turning Europe inside out I really put that on President Bashar Assad and on the Iraqis and on the region itselfThese are children and we need grownupsThe Republican Party rarely wins domestic policy elections But when it comes to foreign policy it turns out the American people want someone in the White House who is willing to kill bad guys while suffering no delusions The Democrats are infantile and delusional They have reached a point where no evidence contrary to their world view will ever be allowed to pierce their bubble and get them to change their waysBarack Obama and the Democrats have no intention of protecting us or killing ISIS They instead want to wreck our economy with global warming regulations They think if we wind up having to become powerless tent dwellers like ISIS maybe then theyll leave us aloneThe United States needs adults leading it right nowErick Erickson is a Fox News contributor He is host of Erick on the Radio and foundereditor of The Resurgent He is the founder of RedStatecom Follow him on Twitter EWErickson
