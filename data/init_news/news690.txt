For Jeb Bushs campaign August was a cruel month Donald Trumps attacks on the former Florida governor as a lowenergy politician were beginning to stick and the two were bickering over immigration The issue before the Bush team was what to do about itSome advisers argued for an aggressive response even to the point of challenging Trump to some kind of oneonone confrontation Others resisted believing Trumps candidacy was unsustainable while some cautioned against getting into a pigpen with a pig as one adviser recalled Others described it as trying to wrestle with a stumpThose summer days crystallized the plight of a campaign that had begun with enormous expectations and extraordinary resources as the scion of one of Americas dynastic political families sought to follow his father and brother to the presidencyAt what would become a crucial moment Bushs team had no clear strategy for a rival who was beginning to hijack the Republican Party that the Bush family had helped to build other than to stay the course set months earlier of telling Bushs story to votersThere was no consensus senior strategist David Kochel said of the discussions about how to combat the threat of Trumps candidacy Other campaigns were wrestling with the same problems but as the frontrunner in the polls at the time Bush would suffer more than the othersOn Saturday night the candidacy that had begun with such promise ended quietly after a disappointingly weak fourthplace finish in South CarolinaEver the gracious realist Bush announced in his concession speech that he would end his campaign as Trump continued to soar as the GOP frontrunner I have stood my ground refusing to bend to the political winds he saidWhether Jeb Bush ever had a chance to win the Republican nomination in a campaign year that proved so ill fitting for a rusty politician who preferred policy papers to political combat is a question that will be debated long after the 2016 race has endedDonald Trump channeled the worst fears frustrations and anxiety of voters but he also magnified those same feelings Sally Bradshaw Bushs chief strategist and confidant said Sunday in an email It would be difficult for any solutionsoriented conservative to tackle Trump in this environment much less one who was seen as having been so much a part of the establishment He was never going to be an angry guy  and voters wanted angryMike Murphy the chief strategist for Bushs super PAC Right to Rise explained what had happened this way on Sunday Our theory was to dominate the establishment lane into the actual voting primaries he said That was the strategy and it did not work I think it was the right strategy for Jeb The problem was there was a huge antiestablishment wave The establishment lane was smaller than we thought it would be The marketplace was looking for something different and well find out how that ends when we have a nomineeThe result is one of the most startling failures in the modern history of American politics the fall of the House of Bush It is a human story about the struggles of one of the most successful former governors in America in his bid to become president like his father and brother set against the backdrop of one of the strangest political cycles the country has seen in yearsBeyond underestimating the anger in the electorate three other problems led to Bushs downfall First the candidate and his team misjudged the degree of Bush fatigue among RepublicansAides said an internal poll conducted last fall showed discouraging news Roughly twothirds of voters had issues with Bushs family ties Bush stuff was holding him back said one aide who saw the polling data We obviously knew it was an issue but even still the gap between it and other issues  I dont think we thought it would be that bigFor Jeb Bush the challenge remains making it about Jeb not BushSecond Bush and his team miscalculated the role and power of money and traditional television commercials in the 2016 race During the first six months of 2015 Bush raised more than 100 million most of it stockpiled in Right to Rise a strategy that seemed right at the time but came at the cost of not dealing with other pressing needsWe didnt use that time to introduce him as a unique brand said Vin Weber an outside adviser We used it to raise money I dont want to say they made an obvious and clear mistake but in retrospect it was a mistakeThe aggressive fundraising came to be known as shock and awe an echo of the initial bombing of Iraq by USled forces before the 2003 invasion In the campaign context it could be read as code to other potential candidates to get out of the way But the prodigious fundraising of Bushs broad network scared off no one As the Bush campaign would learn every credible candidate today has a few billionaire friends who can enrich a super PAC In the end all that money came to symbolize frustration rather than powerThird Bush ran a campaign that whether deliberate or not was rooted in the past managed by loyalists who admired Bush and enjoyed his confidence but who like the candidate found themselves in unfamiliar political terrainHis advisers were convinced from the start that the more voters learned about what Bush had done as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 they would flock to him as their presidential candidate Bush stubbornly held to that approach  even as evidence mounted that it was out of step with votersDoug Gross a prominent Iowa Republican recalled meeting with Bush in July 2014 in Kennebunkport Maine to talk about the impending campaign He definitely wanted to run Hes always had it in him and knew this was his last chance Gross said He was trying to figure out how to do it his own way I was struck by his obstinate avoidance of any political discussion  He wanted to do it his way or no wayIn contrast to the doldrums of August 2015 July seemed a glorious time for the Bush team Early that month Team Jeb gathered in Kennebunkport to celebrate that the campaign and two allied political committees had together raised nearly an unprecedented 120 million The numbers were made public as nearly 300 major Bush fundraisers assembled to mingle with the Bush family and campaign advisersGuests were transported in blackandred trolleys to Walkers Point the Bush family compound The group gathered for a photo with former president George HW Bush and Barbara BushThat evening Bush touted the teams record fundraising as guests dined on lobster rolls and hamburgers at a luxury resort tucked among a forest of birch groves and balsam fir It was incredibly memorable to be there with several generations said Jay Zeidman a Houstonbased investor who helped raise money from young professionalsThe next day the donors got briefings from senior Bush aides including Bradshaw campaign manager Danny Diaz and finance director Heather Larrison They laid out how the campaign planned to take on contenders such as Sen Ted Cruz of Texas Sen Marco Rubio of Florida and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie Throughout there was little mention of Donald TrumpThat time Jeb Bush invited 300 top donors to his parents houseNone of us thought he would last the summer said one person who was in attendanceAt that moment however Trump was already in the process of undermining Bushs candidacy If Bush had ever gone up against someone like Trump it didnt show Trump was a new and different kind of rival one given to personal insults rather than policy debates who monopolized media coverage and got away with provocative statements that would have sunk normal politiciansAfter marching in two July 4 parades on a rainy Saturday in New Hampshire reporters asked Bush about Trumps claim that Mexico was allowing immigrants to illegally cross into the United States It was one of the hundreds of times he would face such questionsBush said absolutely he was offended by Trumps rhetoric Were going to win when were hopeful and optimistic and big and broad rather than grrrrrr he said  literally growling  just angry all the timeThat very night Trump attacked Bush as soft on immigration and took aim as well at Bushs wife Columba who was born in Mexico and entered the country legally  retweeting and then deleting a disparaging comment about herNothing however cut as close to the bone as Trumps claim that Bush was too lowenergy to serve as presidentThe accusation was laughable  until it began to stick Trumps charge was in fact a proxy for a different and more difficult argument to combat that Bush was neither strong nor edgy enough for a party seething with anger at the grass rootsInside the BushTrump melodrama Decades of tension and discomfortNobody tapped into it for all the polling all the focus groups said Theresa Kostrzewa a North Carolina lobbyist who raised money for the campaign The biggest thing they did was miss was just how angry the American electorate was and that Trump would be their Captain AhabBushs advisers would contest that claim They could see the anger they said The issue was what to do about it Donors political operatives and big thinkers from around the country urged us to ignore Trump for months Bradshaw said There was no one in the news media or the operative class at the time who felt Trump would ultimately be a serious contender for the nominationAt the same time others feared that engaging Trump was almost beneath Bush and would thrust the candidate into a neverending game of chargecountercharge Jeb should be bigger than this another aide recalled thinkingOver at Right to Rise Murphy sent a clear signal Trump is not our fight right nowIf other campaigns wish that were going to uncork money on Donald Trump theyll be disappointed Murphy told The Washington Post in late August Trump is frankly other peoples problemAt that moment the Bush teams analysis showed that no Trump voters were likely to shift their support to Bush On Sunday Murphy said that attacking Trump would only have benefited other candidates Bushs campaign needed to consolidate the establishment lane while hoping that Trump and Cruz would sort out the competition among the antiestablishment candidatesBradshaw also dismissed complaints from some donors that she cut the candidate off from advice Noting that Bush long has been active on email Bradshaw responded in a message by saying Donors constantly gave conflicting advice  attack Trump dont attack Trump smile more smile less  you look like you are smirking I didnt tell people they were wrong  not my style  I did a lot of listening and Im sure there were things we could have done better  but withholding info from the Governor simply did not happen in our campaignFor much of the autumn Bushs engagement with Trump was onagain offagain  skirmish then turning away Not until late last year did he truly start a concerted and sustained series of attacks Aides said Bush was particularly affected by the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino Calif and felt as one adviser put it that it was time to stand up to the bullyJeb was the only candidate with the political courage at the time and frankly throughout the last six months to take on Trump directly for doing something that the governor felt was very harmful to the Party and to the country Bradshaw wrote There was no hesitation at that point given his comments about women about Hispanics his lack of knowledge on issues of national security and on and onBushs failure to come to terms with one of the downsides of his family name came to a head over a fourday period in May when he stumbled over the decision by his brother former president George W Bush to go to war in IraqChanging his answer on a daily basis Bush came across as a flatfooted campaigner clearly uncomfortable articulating his views on the most critical moment of his brothers presidency But it also highlighted the doubleedged nature of being a candidate named BushIn a January Washington PostABC News poll nearly 6 in 10 Americans held an unfavorable view of Bush He was the only Republican with a negative favorability rating 44percent said they had a favorable impression of the former governor while 50percent rated him negatively His rankings grew worse as the campaign progressedA fundamental weakness supporters said was the lack of a coherent rationale for Bushs candidacy and the failure to make inroads with activists on the right At the end of the day it wasnt clear the name was ever surmountable said a Bush donor If the name was going to be surmounted it would have to be because there was a fresh set of ideasBush offered ideas but in a campaign dominated by Trump they were ignored or lost to most votersOne of the biggest tactical advantages Bush appeared to have early on  a richly endowed super PAC  was not the invincible weapon his team thought it would be It cut off his access to a key adviser Murphy whom he installed at the groups helmIt also meant that during the first six months of last year nearly all of the coverage about Bush focused on how he was socking away millions into the super PAC all while maintaining that he had not decided whether to run In an election brimming with anger toward the wealthy elite Bush seemed almost flippant about his pursuit of big dollarsMurphy was convinced that much of what was taking place was noise and that when the voters began to check in the super PACs financial might would be overpoweringFirst the committee would use it to lay out Bushs biography Then as necessary the group would turn its arsenal on his rivals Our job is just to amplify his story and what hes saying and we banked enough cash that nobodys turning our speaker off Murphy told Bloomberg Politics in OctoberBack at campaign headquarters the team hewed to that timetable and sensibility Once the Bush record was burned into voters minds attitudes would shift Bradshaw said at the time A Bush donor complained Murphy had a timetable and nothing mattered until December and JanuaryBy the end of January Right to Rise had raced through at least 957 million out of the 1186million it had collected according to Federal Election Commission filings Almost 87million went into a barrage of television ads online videos slick mailers and voter phone callsto no availMel Sembler a former Bush ambassador who helped raise money for the super PAC and served on its governance board said he believes the groups strategy was soundWe had confidence in Mike and I think we did the best we could in deploying of resources Sembler said Thats not where the problem is  The timing was not right for Jeb Our candidate was just not connecting with the electorateThe final months were difficult for Bush After a particularly weak performance during a debate in Boulder Colo in October in which Rubio appeared to get the better of him there were suggestions that he might quit the campaign right thenReporters who made inquiries about the possibility were brushed off In the middle of it all Bush spotted a reporter who was a regular on the trail with him Hey  I didnt drop out did I he shouted You know that kind of stuff really gets my juices going Im going to win this thing and when I do  youre going to give me a big hugThrough it all Bush attempted to keep both good humor and determination in the face of the inevitableI was stunned by how well he handled the last month of this campaign when the writing was on the wall said Tim Miller Bushs communications director It is hard to go out there every day and put on a fake smiley face He was in really high spirits and didnt lash out at people in private throughout the last two monthsThe final indignity in a campaign that had suffered through many came three days before Saturdays primary when South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley endorsed Rubio rather than a man she described as a friend and mentorWhen it ended Saturday night Bush told saddened supporters We put forward details innovative conservative plans to address the mounting challenges that we face Because despite what you might have heard ideas matter policy mattersHis final remarks as a presidential candidate were a reflection of the campaign he had constructed from the start one he had built to his unique specifications which nonetheless proved to be a mismatch for a political environment that caught him by surprise  and for which he paid a hefty price
