We all know by now that the Clinton campaign will stop at nothing to win Even if it means publishing embarrassing demeaning photos of fellow Democrats thats just fine with them Evidenced a photo that was circulated showing Bernie Sanders in a swimming suit apparently attending a Democratic retreat This was all while the Clinton team was hyping stories about Sanders attending fundraisers for wealthy benefactors which lets be honest pales in comparison to the  wealthy benefactors Hillary has in her back pocket Breitbart reported that Tina Flournoy Bill Clintons Chief of staff emailed the photo of Sanders sunning himself by a pool to Brian Fallon and John Podesta two Clinton lackeys Fallons response OMG Can we tweet Podesta asked Fallon responded I think we shd give to NY post Flournoy added shed send more juicy details about the event including the people who attended Thank you Fallon replied  We are on this  The entire conversation was part of the ongoing WikiLeaks document hacks of John Podestas account The New York Post apparently never ran with the story but that didnt stop the Clinton camp from sending it to other people It was published by celebrity gossip dirtbag Perez Hilton the day after the Clinton team discussed releasing it I wonder what Mike Bloomberg would think about this wrote Hilton on his blog Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Marthas Vineyard pool summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists Just the next week there were several stories in the media questioning Sanders for even attending the fundraiser for Harry Reid For Sanders campaign finance purity not always possible wrote MSNBCs Alex SeitzWald citing a guest list obtained by MSNBC that included previously unreported are details about who exactly attended those fundraisers Bernie Sanders Prolific Democratic Party fundraiser wrote CNNs Eric Bradner on Monday February 8 announcing that CNN has obtained invitations that listed Sanders as a host for at least one Majority Trust event in each year since 2011 Then both Bill and Hillary picked up on those same media stories accusing Sanders of taking Wall Street money  the height of hypocrisy Senator Sanders took about 200000 from Wall Street firms Hillary Clinton said during a rally in New Hampshire on February 8 Not directly but through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee There is nothing wrong with that It didnt change his view Well it didnt change my view or my vote either Bill Clinton attacked Sanders referring directly to the CNN story and pointing out that he likely accepted money from Wall Street And thats how Hillary Clinton wins By Any Means Necessary
