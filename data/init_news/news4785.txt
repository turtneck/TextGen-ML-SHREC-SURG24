Bush also said he has little confidence in Trumps ability to appropriately handle Americas nuclear weaponsI have grave doubts to be honest with you Bush told CNNs Jake Tapper in an interview airing Sunday on State of the UnionHes not taking the responsibility the possibility of being president of the United States really seriously For him it looks as though hes an actor playing a role of the candidate for president Not boning up on the issues not having a broad sense of the responsibilities of what it is to be a president Bush said Across the spectrum of foreign policy Mr Trump talks about things as though hes still on The ApprenticeBush said Trumps proposed plan of hoping ISIS removes Syrian President Bashar Assad from power and then Russia taking on ISIS is like some kind of board game and not a serious approachThis is just another example of the lack of seriousness And this is a serious time Were under grave threats again and I think we need a president with a steady hand Bush said Bush again dismissed Trumps suggestion that George W Bush was responsible for 911 because it occurred during his presidency My brother responded to a crisis and he did it as you would hope a president would do He united the country he organized our country and he kept us safe And theres no denying that The great majority of Americans believe that he said And I dont know why he keeps bringing this up It doesnt show that hes a serious person as it relates to being commander in chief and being the architect of a foreign policy Bush added Bush said his defense of the 43rd presidents response to the attacks isnt just because hes his brother I mean so next week Mr Trump is probably going to say that FDR was around when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor Its what you do after that matters And thats the sign of leadership he said You dont have to have your last name named Bush to be able to understand that Despite Trump leading the polls Bush predicted that support for him will eventually fade I dont think Trump is going to win the nomination I think were going to have a nominee that will unite the party Bush said He also offered praise for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clintons debate performance though he argued the policies she supports are bad for the country She did a good job in the debate for sure he said Shes a smart person no doubt about that But every chance she had to lay out a different approach than the one were on now she actually doubled or tripled down on it more taxes more regulation more creating barriers on peoples ability to rise up
