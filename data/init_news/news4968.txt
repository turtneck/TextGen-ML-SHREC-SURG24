Ben Shapiro Destroys John Oliver On Abortion And Trump By Hank Berrien October 27 2016 On Thursday on his daily podcast Daily Wire EditorinChief Ben Shapiro decimated HBO host and supposed comedian John Oliver for his comments regarding Donald Trumps comments on abortion during the third presidential debate Shapiro began HBOs John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses He continued So John Oliver does a political show on American politics he doesnt know much about American politics he doesnt know much about politics generally but hes been feted by the media because hes a comedian whos wildly to the left So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee who is legitimately the least funny person in human history she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine whos the least funny person in human history Both of them I believe beat Stalin for that title a while back so now were going to unify the championships so Obamas going to be on with Samantha Bee where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortions wonderful John Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony and because hes British that means were supposed to pay attention to him even though we fought a revolution so we wouldnt have to pay attention to the Brits Heres John Oliver talking about abortion The screen then showed Oliver pontificating In terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of lateterm abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work no clear understanding of the basic biology of womens bodies and a very poor sense of grammar as well So I guess we got in a sense what we were asking for If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a childs drawing of a cobra Shapiro fired back Okay I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here because he obviously doesnt know Now look I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasnt graphic enough But let me for those who missed it explain what exactly happens in a lateterm abortion which is what he was talking about okay What happens in a lateterm abortion what happens in a lateterm abortion is something completely awful this is according to americanpregnancyorg okay Not a rightwing prolife website americanpregnancyorg The fetus is rotated forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs shoulders and arms through the birth canal A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside The catheter removes the cerebral material that would be the brains until the skull collapses The fetus is then completely removed Shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure Okay thats one procedure thats used thats dilation and extraction In lateterm abortions it usually one of these two dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction Dilation and evacuation The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it sometimes they dont use such injections then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the childs body in the womb and remove it piece by piece Then he proceeded to carve up Oliver So I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic I dont know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that but he could have been more graphic I suppose But this is what they do laugh it up Oh he cant draw a Fallopian tube Okay John draw an abortion Really Draw it lets see it I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like Its not waving a magic wand and its not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb I would like to see that Okay John draw an abortion Really Draw it lets see it I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like Ben Shapiro Shapiro concluded But of course hell never do that other than It might look like a cobra it might look like a cobra maybe itll look like a princess waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to childkilling is absolutely ridiculous and despicable Video below
