WASHINGTON  The future of samesex marriage and President Obamas health care law hang in the balance as the Supreme Courts 2014 term draws rapidly to a close this month But those arent the only big issues on the justices plateFree speech and fair elections Religious liberty and racial discrimination Clean air and capital punishment All await rulings over the next three weeks as the court completes action on 20 cases remaining this term The next decisions will come Thursday morningHeres a look at the Elite Eight Samesex marriage In a decision likely to come on the terms last day  possibly June 29 or 30  the court will decide whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry or whether state bans against samesex marriage can remain in placeSix cases from Ohio Michigan Tennessee and Kentucky have been consolidated for the courts consideration In them 32 total plaintiffs are asking for the right to marry or to have marriages licensed elsewhere recognized in their home states Most legal experts predict the court led by Justice Anthony Kennedy will rule in favor of the gay and lesbian couples Obamacare The future of Obamas health care law is on the line for the second time in three years and its anyones guess how the court will rulePassed in 2010 and narrowly upheld by the court in a 54 ruling in 2012 the law has extended health insurance to 12 million Americans But four words in its lengthy text  established by the state  now endanger federal subsidies relied upon by 64 million participants in 34 states that did not create their own exchanges or marketplaces The justices must decide whether the law prohibits that financial aid Clean air Environmental regulations approved by the Obama administration regularly come before the Supreme Court and this year is no exception A major rule requiring coal and oilfired power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants hangs in the balanceThe justices appeared closely divided on the central issue in the case  whether the Environmental Protection Agency should have considered the nearly 10 billion annual cost in relation to the potential benefits before approving the regulation  when it was argued A decision in favor of objecting states and utilities could send the EPA back to the drawing board Housing discrimination The third time could be the charm for the courts conservatives who tried twice in recent years to consider cases challenging the way housing bias claims are decidedUnder the Fair Housing Act of 1968 minority groups have been able to win lawsuits by showing that housing practices  such as sales rentals zoning and lending  have a disparate impact on minorities Housing industry opponents challenging the law say it was intended only to ban intentional discrimination Lethal injections The death penalty also is never far from the high courts docket After a steady diet of cases and emergency appeals on issues such as claimed intellectual disabilities and the actions of defense lawyers and prosecutors the court now must rule on a relatively new method of executionThe case involves the use of a sedative called midazolam as part of a threedrug cocktail used by several states including Oklahoma where three deathrow inmates are challenging its use Unlike stronger barbiturates that are in short supply the drug has failed in some cases to block pain and suffering during the lethal injection process License plates This is a free speech case that hinges on who is speaking  the state government issuing specialty license plates or the vehicles ownersTexas which like every other state issues such plates to produce revenue while promoting a variety of causes refused to approve the Sons of Confederate Veterans request for a plate featuring the Confederate flag The justices must decide if the government has the right to suppress its own speech or must allow private speech by motorists no matter how offensive Political maps In the second case to reach the court this year on political redistricting the justices must decide whether nonpartisan commissions can replace state legislatures in drawing congressional district maps every 10 yearsThose commissions are used in seven states including California to take the redistricting process out of the hands of politicians with a vested interest But the Arizona state Legislatures Republican majority argued that the Constitution gives that power solely to state legislatures A majority of the courts justices appeared to agree during oral arguments Religious signs Also from Arizona comes a case combining religious freedom and highway clutter Tiny Good News Community Church is challenging the town of Gilberts sign ordinances which restrict signs advertising upcoming events  such as church services  far more than political and ideological signsWhile acknowledging that local governments can regulate for the purposes of beautification the justices likely will rule that the town went too far in limiting church event signs to 6 square feet and 13 hours That would be good news for Good News
