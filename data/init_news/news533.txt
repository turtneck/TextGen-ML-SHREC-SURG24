WASHINGTON Two Capitol Hill panels that police the ethics of members of Congress appear to be battling about which has authority over 10 lawmakers accused of unwittingly accepting improper travel and gifts from the state oil company of AzerbaijanA Washington Post story published Wednesday detailed the contents of a confidential Office of Congressional Ethics OCE investigation of a 2013 trip to Azerbaijan a former republic of the Soviet Union in Central AsiaThe OCE was created in 2008 to vet ethics cases and recommend action to the Ethics Committee The Ethics Committee retains sole authority to judge whether members have broken the rules and to mete out punishment The committee apparently asked the OCE to drop this case There is no evidence the committee has ever made such a request beforeThe OCE report indicated that 10 members of Congress had improperly accepted travel and gifts from the stateowned oil company of Azerbaijan which secretly paid for the trip and not the nonprofit groups that purportedly sponsored it The lawmakers said they had no idea the nonprofits were not the true sponsors of the trip and apparently neither did the Ethics Committee which approved the members travel in advanceThe report found no evidence that the lawmakers made any effort to aid an Azeri pipeline project that the stateowned oil company was pushing at the timeRep Gregory Meeks DNY  one of the lawmakers involved in the case  said the Ethics Committee asked the OCE to stop its investigation of the trip because the committee had started one of its own OCE declined however the Post reportedSuch a refusal is pretty outrageous said Chris DeLacy a partner at the law firm Holland  Knight who represents lawmakers in ethics cases Its like weve generated two separate Ethics Committees and OCE has gone rogueThe OCE report indicates that Meeks did not cooperate with its investigation according to the Post but Meeks office says that is not trueMeeks gave OCE documents and other information in response to its request said spokeswoman Sophia Lafargue but OCE did not tell him that the Ethics Committee had asked it to end its review despite House rules requiring it do soThis is why he would not be interviewed by OCE and this is why OCE said in the leaked report that he declined to cooperate  Lafargue said Congressman Meeks is committed to cooperate with the Ethics Committee in its review of this matterThe 2008 House resolution that created the OCE states that when it is notified that the Ethics Committee is investigating a case the board shall refer such matter to the committee and cease its preliminary or secondphase review  and so notify any individual who is the subject of the reviewOCEs own rules however state it will stop its investigation when the Ethics Committee starts an investigatory subcommittee  the committees rarely used formal investigative process The committee makes a public announcement when it creates those subcommittees and has not announced one for the Azerbaijan tripOCE may draw a lot of flak for the Azerbaijan case but the process worked as it should except for the leak said Craig Holman government affairs lobbyist at the liberalleaning watchdog group Public CitizenThe OCE investigated and reported to the committee Holman said adding that if the committee prevailed upon the OCE to not do a report the case probably would have been buried The report shows a real concern Holman said the use of bogus nonprofits by a foreign government to circumvent congressional travel rulesHolman said the dispute between the two bodies is reminiscent of the early days of the OCE when the two publicly feuded repeatedly over jurisdiction and the rules of investigations But he said I do not see it escalating to the point we saw in the very beginningThe case also involves the first leak of a full OCE report before its public release which has led lawyers who defend lawmakers to call the entire process unfairThere have been more ethics case since OCE started DeLacy said a trend for which the office deserves some credit But if the intent of the law was to spur for Ethics Committee investigations and the committee has launched a probe in a case there is no reason for OCE to keep investigatingEarlier this year the House changed its own rules to give lawmakers a new defense against ethics investigations The language stated that the two ethics bodies may not take any action that would deny any person any right or protection provided under the Constitution of the United States an apparent reference to longsimmering concerns that the OCE does not allow the subjects of investigations to see the evidence against them At the time Elliot Berke a lawyer who has defended several Republicans in ethics cases said from Day One of the OCEs existence there have been serious concerns about lack of due processThe OCE report apparently found that the 10 members who traveled to Azerbaijan  Meeks Jim Bridenstine ROkla Yvette Clarke DNY Danny Davis DIll Rubn Hinojosa DTexas Sheila Jackson Lee DTexas Leonard Lance RNJ Michelle Lujan Grisham DNM Ted Poe RTexas and thencongressman Steve Stockman RTexas  were unaware that the trip was improperly funded by a foreign government Nevertheless in similar past cases the Ethics Committee has required lawmakers to pay back the costs of travel which for this trip would total thousands of dollars for each traveler In past cases lawmakers have been allowed to use campaign money instead of their personal funds to pay these costsAirfare for the members and their spouses totaled more than 110000 the Post reported
