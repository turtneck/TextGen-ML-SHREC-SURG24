Washington CNN Mitt Romneys decision to pass on 2016 anoints Jeb Bush as the clear establishment favorite in the Republican presidential race and lays down a challenge to the partys divided conservativesThough the first contests will not take place in early voting states for a year Romneys swerve announced on a conference call with supporters on Friday is the most important moment yet in the nascent GOP contest It removes the prospect of a bruising battle for big establishment donor cash and moderate right of center Republican primary voters between Romney the 2012 nominee and Bush heir to a dynastic political machineI think it is hard to argue that todays news did not help Gov Bush said Matt Moore chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina which holds one of the crucial early voting primaries next yearBush sent the Republican race into overdrive with his sudden announcement last month that he was actively exploring a run for president Since then he has been flying around the nation in an apparent bid to put up a formidable shock and awe early fundraising number to define the contest in his favorThough Bush is seen as leading establishment Republicans Romneys decision could improve New Jersey Gov Christies hopes of financing a long campaignTodays news certainly does reopen the fight for donors I know many donors had been frozen in recent weeks taking a wait and see approach said Moore Theres a finite amount of money that can be raised  so every candidate benefitsKevin Madden a onetime adviser to Romney who is now a CNN commentator said his former bosss decision opened up an early trial of strength between Christie and BushThis becomes the first big test between those candidates which one of them can quickly move to lock down those donors It is a very successful very large fundraising network Its going to be an important assetSome party insiders also believe conservative candidates who can also straddle the line with the establishment could benefit from Romneys departureA top adviser to one potential Republican primary contender said in an interview that Romneys exit likely helps both Florida Sen Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker who both have strong conservative support but have also been warmly received by some establishmentminded donorsTheyre acceptable to the establishment but they also have support within the various conservative bases  among economic conservatives social conservatives and national security conservatives the adviser saidRomneys decision not to run doesnt remove him from the 2016 calculus entirely  it sets him up to be a potential kingmaker in one of the most wideopen primary fields in recent memoryThough sources told CNNs Dana Bash not to expect a Romney endorsement of another candidate in the near future contenders will be clamoring for his blessingA top Rubio aide said any leading candidate would want Romneys supportJim Merrill Romneys top strategist in New Hampshire said that his guess is Romney probably will endorse a candidate in the primaryRomneys statement however made clear that he was not stepping aside in favor of Bush In fact he appeared to take a veiled swipe at the 61yearold former Florida governorI believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders one who may not be as well known as I am today one who has not yet taken their message across the country one who is just getting started may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee Romney told his supportersHe appeared to be implying that the GOP would be best served by a younger candidate taking on Clinton who will be 69 at the time of the general election in November 2016Rubio 43 quickly picked up on the idea of a generational shift stressing repeatedly in a short statement praising Romney that he was close to the 2012 nomineeHe certainly earned the right to consider running so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to leadWalker 47 also picked up the signals thanking Romney in a tweet for opening the door for fresh leadership in AmericaRomney may also be making a point by sitting down for dinner on Friday night with Christie 52 in New YorkHis exit will also shift the terrain more practically in the early states where his former staffers can now join the campaign of their choiceMerrill said hes been receiving calls from former Romney operatives in the state  and interested candidates  wondering whats next but he wasnt yet leaning toward any candidate in particularRomneys not gonna be a candidate so that means we are open for business Merrill saidReverberations are also being felt in Iowa where voters will get the 2016 ball rolling next year and where Romney lost by only a handful of votes to Rick Santorum on the way to the GOP nomination in 2012A Des Moines RegisterBloomberg poll published Friday showed 57 percent of likely caucus goers had favorable feelings about Romney But that figure was down from 65 percent in OctoberRomney may have calculated that he would have struggled to keep that level of support fighting Bush and Christie for moderates and facing fresh faced conservatives like Walker and firebrand Sen Ted CruzThere a lot of people who had second thoughts about Romney said Steffen Schmidt an Iowa State University Professor who is an authority on the states fabled caucusesMitt Romney would have had a much harder time in Iowa in 2016 Schmidt saidBush is basking in a second straight day of good news On Thursday he poached David Kochel one of the states most highly regarded political consultants for a possible post running his campaignKochel previously worked for Romney in Iowa and his departure was seen as a serious blow to the former Massachusetts governorThe narrowing of the establishment field may hold a wake up call for conservatives who hoped a candidate preferred by the grass roots would emerge this cycleBut with candidates like Walker Cruz Mike Huckabee Santorum and Kentucky Sen Rand Paul all tipped to appeal to certain sections of the conservative electorate they face a familiar problem  the lack of a single rightwing favorite to take on the establishments pickRomneys announcement which kept political pundits guessing until minutes before he spoke with supporters was in keeping with the already rich drama of the 2016 raceEven a month ago no one thought that Romney who twice ran for president and lost could find a rationale to underpin another shotBut in three frenzied weeks Romney apparently disdaining the quality of the crowded GOP race and bumped into a swift decision by Bushs early move appeared to be about to jump in Bush had previously effectively forced out another possible establishment candidate Sen Rob Portman by getting into the raceRomney traveled to California to headline the Republican National Committees winter meeting and stoked speculation by consulting former staffers and party heavyweights about a possible runFor now most of those close to Romney believe he will resume his role as the defacto leader of the party until a nominee emerges speaking out on key issuesYoull see him do what hes already been doing post2012  be someone that stands up to President Obama speaks the truth when the opportunity calls Merrill said
