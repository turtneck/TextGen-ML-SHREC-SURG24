W hen trying to explain the current unrest in the Middle East from Iraq to Syria to Yemen American officials often resort to platitudes about Sunni and Shia Muslims fighting each other for centuries due to ancient hatreds Not only is this claim historically inaccurate but it also ignores the unintended consequences that the Iraq War more recently leashed on the region That warand the manner in which the United States left it behind in 2011shifted the balance of power in the region in Irans favor Regional competition of which Irans tension with Saudi Arabia is the main but not only dimension exacerbated existing faultlines with support for extreme sectarian actors including the Islamic State turning local grievances over poor governance into proxy warsNothing that happened in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 was preordained different futures than the one unfolding today were possible Recall that violence declined drastically during the 2007 US troop surge and that for the next couple of years both Iraq and the West felt that the country was going in the right direction But the seeds of Iraqs unravelling were sown in 2010 when the United States did not uphold the election results and failed to broker the formation of a new Iraqi government As an adviser to the top US general in Iraq I was a witnessMy greatest fear General Raymond Odierno the then commanding general of US forces in Iraq told me in early 2010 is that we stabilize Iraq then hand it over to the Iranians in our rush to the exitGeneral O as he is known had recently watched the 2007 movie Charlie Wilsons War which recounts how US interest in Afghanistan ceased once the mujahedeen defeated the Soviet Army in 1989 and drove them out Now he had a premonition that the same could happen in Iraq Ive invested too much here he said to simply walk away and let that happenI had first met Odierno in 2003 when he was the commanding general of the 4th Infantry Division responsible for the provinces of Salah alDin Diyala and Kirkuk in the early days of the Iraq War I had been the representative in Kirkuk of the Coalition Provisional Authority the Americanled transitional government that controlled Iraq after Husseins fall Now as his political adviser I was helping General O ensure that the United States kept its focus on the mission in Iraq while drawing down US forcesOdierno wanted US engagement with Iraq to continue for years to come but led by US civilians not the military He believed that in order to train Iraqi security forces and provide the psychological support needed to maintain a level of stability 20000 or so US troops needed to stay in Iraq beyond 2011 when all American troops were scheduled to be withdrawn But the real engagement General O believed should be from the other instruments of national power led by the US embassyEvery time a congressional delegation visited us in Baghdad General O put up a slide showing why the United States should continue to invest in Iraq through the Strategic Framework Agreement that the two countries had signed in 2008 General O knew that for the mission to succeed there needed to be a political agreement between Iraqi leaders Otherwise all the security gains that the American troops had fought so hard for would not be sustainable He took every opportunity to educate and communicate these complexities to the new Obama administrationFor six months General O had tried hard to support the leadership of Chris Hill the new American ambassador who had taken up his post in April 2009 But Odierno had begun to despair It was clear that Hill though a career diplomat lacked regional experience and was miscast in the role in Baghdad In fact he had not wanted the job but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had persuaded him to take it she admitted as much to General O he told me when he met her in early 2010 in Washington to discuss the dysfunction at the embassy General O complained that Hill did not engage with Iraqis or with others in the diplomatic communityhis only focus appeared to be monitoring the activities of the US militaryIt was frightening how a person could so poison a place Hill brought with him a small cabal who were new to Iraq and marginalized all those with experience in the country The highly knowledgeable and wellregarded Arabist Robert Ford had cut short his tour as ambassador to Algeria to return to Iraq for a third tour and turned down another ambassadorship to stay on in Iraq and serve as Hills deputy But Hill appeared not to want Fords advice on political issues and pressured him to depart the post early in 2010In his staff meetings Hill made clear how much he disliked Iraq and Iraqis Instead he was focused on making the embassy normal like other US embassies That apparently meant having grass within the embassy compound The initial attempts to plant seed had failed when birds ate it all but eventually great rolls of lawn turf were brought inI had no idea from whereand took root By the end of his tenure there was grass on which the ambassador could play lacrosseThe national elections took place on March 7 2010 and went more smoothly than we had dared hope After a month of competitive campaigning across the country and wide media coverage of the different candidates and parties 62 percent of eligible Iraqis turned out to voteThe European Union and others had fielded hundreds of international pollwatchers alongside thousands of trained Iraqi election observers while the United Nations provided the Iraqis with advice on technical matters related to elections All this helped to sustain the credibility of the process Insurgents sought to create a climate of fear by planting bombs in water bottles and blowing up a house but the Iraqi security forces stood up to the testWe won the elections Rafi Issawi the deputy prime minister shouted excitedly to me on the phone I could hear celebratory gunfire in the background We had not expected Iraqiyaa coalition headed by the secular Shia Ayad Allawi and leaders of the Sunni community and running on a nonsectarian platformto do so well The coalition had won 91 seatstwo more than the incumbent Prime Minister Nouri alMalikis State of Law CoalitionI accompanied General O and Hill to a meeting with Maliki the next day Maliki a Shia had been prime minister since 2006 Americans and Iraqis alike initially viewed him as weak but his reputation grew after he ordered military operations against Shia militias Since then Iraqi politicians had become increasingly fearful of his authoritarian tendencies He had insisted on running separately in the electionas State of Law rather than joining a united Shia coalition as had happened in 2005in large part because the Shia parties would not agree on him to lead the list Nobody wanted a second Maliki premiershipWhen Hill asked Maliki that day about his retirement plans it was immediately apparent that he was not contemplating stepping down Instead he claimed there had been massive election fraud and that the Mujahideen alKhalq an Iranian opposition group locked away in eastern Iraqs Diyala province had used satellites to tamper with the computers used to tally the voting resultseven though the computers were not connected to the Internet and thousands of election observers had monitored the voting But Malikis advisers had told him he would win big with more than a hundred seats so he demanded a recount Maliki was becoming scary
