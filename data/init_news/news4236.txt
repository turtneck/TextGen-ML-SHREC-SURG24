A dispatch from RTcom ABOVE Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton L and Julian Assange Founder and EditorinChief of WikiLeaks  Reuters  Darthmouth Films Hillary Clinton sparked an FBI backlash which is now surfacing when she stonewalled the Feds who were trying to investigate her private server Julian Assange said during the John Pilger Special courtesy of Dartmouth Films which is now available in full on RT If you go to history of the FBI it has become effectively Americas political police And the FBI demonstrated with taking down the former head of the CIA David Petraeus in 2012 over classified information given to his mistress that almost no one was untouchable The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that No one can resist us Assange told the Australian journalist during the 25minute interview This is treason Clintons email server reportedly exposed to hackers of 5 spy agencies But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIs investigation So there is anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak FBI director James B Comey threw a spanner into the presidential race that threatened to become a Clinton procession last week when he claimed that the agency had potentially obtained new information pertaining to Clintons use of a personal email server set up shortly after she became Secretary of State in 2009 when they obtained the laptop of Anthony Weiner the exhusband of close Clinton aide Huma Abedin Weiner was being investigated for an unrelated sexting offense Clinton has categorically denied mishandling classified information by using a vulnerable personal email address for State Department business Fox News has alleged that the FBI has obtained new evidence from Weiners computer that shows that Clinton was very likely hacked The rightwing network has also claimed that there is a high priority FBI investigation into whether favors were exchanged by Clinton for donations to her husbands foundation though other media have refuted these claims saying that an earlier investigation into the Clinton Foundation which cleared the power couple remained closed Assange Clinton  ISIS funded by same money Trump wont be allowed to win JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE Assange whose WikiLeaks website has over the last ten months released three sizable batches of emails relating to Clinton herself the Democratic National Committee and her campaign manager John Podesta said the FBI has cause to investigate Clinton Theres a thread that runs through all of these emails There is quite a lot of paytoplay as they call it  taking giving access in exchange for money for many individual states individuals and corporations Combined with the coverup of Hillary Clintons emails while she was Secretary of State this has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI to investigate increases Assange said Regardless of whether Clinton ever faces charges Assange asserted that Clinton was beholden to corporate and political entities that have been hidden from the electorate during the race to the White House Shes this centralizing cog so that youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street and intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis and so on Shes is the if you like the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs Shes smooth central representation of all that and all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States stated Assange who said that the leaked emails presented a clear picture of this nexus of influences Assange also insisted that despite his image projecting hope and change President Barack Obama became very close to banking interests during his own initial White House campaign in 2008 In fact one of the most significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed  and half the first Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from Citibank It is quite amazing Assange said Libya was Hillarys war According to Assange Clintons emails reveal a masterplan hatched months before the Wests intervention in Libya in March 2011 to make it the signature conflict of her tenure as secretary of state and a podium from which to realize her presidential dreams Assange WikiLeaks did not receive Clinton emails from Russian govt JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE Libya more than anyone elses war was Hillary Clintons war Barack Obama initially opposed it Who was the person who was championing it Hillary Clinton Thats documented throughout her emails Assange said Theres more than 1700 emails out of the 33000 of Hillary Clintons emails we published just about Libya Its not about that Libya has cheap oil She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state something that she would use to run in the general election for president So late 2011 theres an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that is produced for Hillary Clinton and its all the its a chronological description of how Hillary Clinton was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state But the scheme not only failed on a personal level after Clinton was largely blamed for allowing a jihadist ransacking of a US compound in Benghazi in 2012 but also continues to haunt the country which remains in a state of civil war and Europe As a result there have been around 40000 deaths within Libya Jihadists moved in ISIS moved in That led to the European refugee and migrant crisis because not only did you have people fleeing Libya people then fleeing Syria destabilization of other African countries as a result of arms flows said Assange Over the course of the interview Assange also expounded on his views on Donald Trump the relationship between WikiLeaks and Russia and his plan to leave the Ecuadorian embassy where he has lived as a legal fugitive since 2012 The full transcript of the interview is available below Assange Clinton is a cog for Goldman Sachs  the Saudis JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE VIDEO  TRANSCRIPT Published time 5 Nov 2016 0559 Edited time 5 Nov 2016 2153 Australian journalist and documentary maker John Pilger L and Julian Assange Founder and EditorinChief of WikiLeaks  Reuters  Dartmouth Films Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special courtesy of Dartmouth Films in which he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails released by WikiLeaks this year John Pilger another Australian migr conducted the 25minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US Last month Assange had his internet access cut off for alleged interference in the American presidential election through the work of his website Clinton made FBI look weak now there is anger John Pilger Whats the significance of the FBIs intervention in these last days of the US election campaign in the case against Hillary Clinton Julian Assange  If you look at the history of the FBI it has become effectively Americas political police The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress Almost noone is untouchable The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that noone can resist us But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIs investigation so theres anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak Weve published about 33000 of Clintons emails when she was Secretary of State They come from a batch of just over 60000 emails of which Clinton has kept about half  30000  to herself and weve published about half BREAKING Assange  Clinton resisted FBI  and now theyre out for payback WATCH FULL JOHN PILGER EXCLUSIVE ON RT Then there are the Podesta emails weve been publishing John Podesta is Hillary Clintons primary campaign manager so theres a thread that runs through all these emails there are quite a lot of payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases Russian government not the source of Clinton leaks JP The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails JA The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neoMcCarthy hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything Hilary Clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications That is false we can say that the Russian government is not the source WikiLeaks has been publishing for ten years and in those ten years we have published ten million documents several thousand individual publications several thousand different sources and we have never got it wrong Saudi Arabia  Qatar funding ISIS and Clinton JP The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically are quite extraordinary Im thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque JA And twelve million dollars from Morocco  JP Twelve million from Morocco yeah JA For Hillary Clinton to attend a party JP In terms of the foreign policy of the United States thats where the emails are most revealing where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism of ISIL in the Middle East Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL are actually those who have helped create it JA Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton not so long after she left the State Department to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation Even the US government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL or ISIS But the dodge has always been that well its just some rogue Princes using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves But that email says that no it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS JP The Saudis the Qataris the Moroccans the Bahrainis particularly the Saudis and the Qataris are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales particularly to Saudi Arabia JA Under Hillary Clinton the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia worth more than 80 billion In fact during her tenure as Secretary of State total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value doubled JP Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation JA Yes JP Thats extraordinary Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambition JA I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network Shes a centralising cog Youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis WikiLeaks emails shows Citigroups major role in shaping Obama administrations cabinet Shes the centraliser that interconnects all these different cogs Shes the smooth central representation of all that and all that is more or less what is in power now in the United States Its what we call the establishment or the DC consensus One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank This is quite amazing JP Didnt Citybank supply a list   JA Yes JP  which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet JA  Yes JP So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States JA If you were following the Obama campaign back then closely you could see it had become very close to banking interests Assange sorry for Clinton as a personality John Pilger exclusive courtesy of Dartmouth films JA So I think you cant properly understand Hillary Clintons foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate Libya is Hillary Clintons war JP Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us  told you  about what happened there Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria the ISIL jihadism and so on And it was almost Hillary Clintons invasion What do the emails tell us about that A very different kind of warfare Clinton team on Benghazi committee leaks in PodestaEmails JA Libya more than anyone elses war was Hillary Clintons war Barak Obama initially opposed it Who was the person championing it Hillary Clinton Thats documented throughout her emails She had put her favoured agent Sidney Blumenthal on to that theres more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that weve published just about Libya Its not that Libya has cheap oil She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state  something that she would use in her runup to the general election for President So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state which resulted in around 40000 deaths within Libya jihadists moved in ISIS moved in leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis Not only did you have people fleeing Libya people fleeing Syria the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa So all problems economic problems and civil war in Africa  previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean That was said explicitly at the time back in early 2011 by Gaddafi What do these Europeans think theyre doing trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State Theres going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe and this is exactly what happened Trump wont be permitted to win JP You get complaints from people saying What is WikiLeaks doing Are they trying to put Trump in the Whitehouse Assange Comey  Clinton The Assange Twilight Zone E354 JA My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win Why do I say that Because hes had every establishment off side Trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind Hillary Clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves JP There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians Some people say Well why doesnt WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia JA We have published about 800000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia Most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia most of which are critical Our Russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia which they use our documents to back up JP Do you yourself take a view of the US election Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump JA Lets talk about Donald Trump What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind He represents American white trash which Hillary Clinton called deplorable and irredeemable It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan urbane perspective these people are like the red necks and you can never deal with them Because he so clearly  through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies  represents people who are not the middle not the upper middle educated class there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way including any criticism of Hillary Clinton If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power that makes absolute sense US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee status JP Id like to talk about Ecuador the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where were doing this interview in the Embassy for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the US election campaign Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuadors support for you ProHillary US State Dept behind Assange internet cutoff  WikiLeaks activist to RT JA Lets let go back four years I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy because of the US extradition case and the result was that after a month I was successful in my asylum application The embassy since then has been surrounded by police quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than 126 million They admitted that over a year ago Now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds  so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador a country of sixteen million people and the United Kingdom and the Americans who have been helping on the side So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do Now we have the US election campaign the Ecuadorian election is in February next year and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador we publish from France we publish from from Germany we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status and this is this is really intolerable It means that they are trying to get at a publishing organisation they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election JP Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy JA I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden In Sweden I am not charged I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne We were not certain exactly what would happen there but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the US has requested since at least 2000 So over the last fifteen years every single person the US has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited and they refuse to provide a guarantee that wont happen JP People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here JA Look one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable They adapt and start to tolerate abuses they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses they adapt to adversity and they continue on So in my situation frankly Im a bit institutionalised  this the embassy is the world  its visually the world for me JP Its the world without sunlight for one thing isnt it JA Its the world without sunlight but I havent seen sunlight in so long I dont remember it JP Yes JA So  yes you adapt The one real irritant is that my young children  they also adapt They adapt to being without their father Thats a hard hard adaption which they didnt ask for JP Do you worry about them JA Yes I worry about them I worry about their mother I am innocent and in arbitrary detention JP Some people would say Well why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden JA The UN the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has looked into this whole situation They spent eighteen months in formal adversarial litigation So its me and the UN versus Sweden and the UK Whos right The UN made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden and that those countries must obey It is an illegal abuse It is the United Nations formally asking Whats going on here What is your legal explanation for this Assange says that you should recognise his asylum And here is Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say No were not going to recognise the UN ruling so leaving open their ability to extradite I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press because it doesnt suit the Western establishment narrative  that yes the West has political prisoners its a reality its not just me theres a bunch of other people as well The West has political prisoners Of course no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons political prisoners They dont call them political prisoners in China they dont call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the United States UK or Sweden it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of selfperception JA Here we have a case the Swedish case where I have never been charged with a crime where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum Those are the facts but what is the rhetoric JP Yes its different JA The rhetoric is pretending constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that  the UN formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes I am subject to persecution by the United States NOTE ALL
