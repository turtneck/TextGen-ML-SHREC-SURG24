Trumps comment that he has a winning temperament was the mosttweeted moment of the debate pointing to the debates main themeDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton answers a question as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listens during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead NY on Monday Sept 26 2016From the beginning of the 2016 presidential race Donald Trump has faced a nagging question Does he have the right temperament to be commanderinchiefHes brash hes entertaining hes thinskinned  none of which disqualify him in the eyes of many voters from sitting in the big chair and making the big decisions But on Monday night the Republican presidential nominee faced the toughest test yet in his highly anticipated first debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton Could he go toetotoe against an experienced political debater and come across as a plausible presidentThe bar was low and Trump began the debate strongly The billionaire scored points against Clinton on the economy jobs and trade Were losing our good jobs Trump said reinforcing a theme that has propelled him to a commanding lead among noncollegeeducated white men  and a virtual tie in the overall raceBut soon enough the temperament issue reared its head as Trump began interrupting and at times shouting According to Voxcom Trump interrupted Clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes and by the end had interrupted her three times as often as she had interrupted him 51 to 17Finally the meta became the explicit when Trump raised the issue of temperament himselfI have much better judgment than she does he said talking about Clintons vote for the Iraq war as a senator Theres no question about that I also have a much better temperament than she has you knowLaughter rang out from audience despite debate ground rules that forbade audience reactionI think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament he said I have a winning temperament I know how to win She does notIt was the mosttweetedabout moment of the debate according to Hollywood Reporter When I have the right temperament gets the biggest house laugh its not going your way tweeted Broadway star LinManuel MirandaClinton soon came back to the topic when discussion turned to USIran relations and Trumps statement last week that he would shoot Iranian vessels out of the water if they bothered American shipsThat is not the right temperament to be commanderinchief Clinton saidMerriamWebstercom reports that the exchange sent viewers to their dictionaries and that lookups of the word temperament spiked Inquiries were 78 times higher than the sites usual hourly averageBut the meaning of temperament is easier sensed than described MerriamWebsters definition is the usual attitude mood or behavior of a person or animal That it seems could mean anythingIn a political context a presidential temperament could refer to prudence wisdom and restraint Trumps outsize personality and his willingness to say things other politicians wouldnt dare has struck some voters as a breath of fresh air in an era when most politicians play it safe and speak in polltested sound bitesTrumps rhetoric  at times politically incorrect in his view  set him apart from the rest of the GOP primary field and helped him to the partys presidential nominationBut now hes playing for the presidency itself and his tone and comportment have emerged as major sticking points for some voters And there remain loyal Republicans who would like to support their partys nominee but still arent there yet  voters Trump needs to win in NovemberOne such voter Richard Bonomo a researcher at the University of Wisconsin Madison watched the debate closely but after it was over did not indicate a readiness to commit to TrumpTrump held his own Mr Bonomo said in an email Clinton did get in several very good points but her record of lying makes it difficult to accept uncritically just anything she saysOvernight polls showed Clinton as the winner of the debate but postdebate polls can be fleeting and dont predict the ultimate outcome of a presidential raceIt was a fiery debate that wont move a lot of votes says Republican strategist Ford OConnell So all eyes will be focused on the second debate Remember voters are grading the candidates differently Trump has the momentum in the polls and therefore he just has to be plausible in the Oval Office Which he wasStill he acknowledges that Clinton scored points noting how she put Trump on the defensive about his refusal to release his tax returns and on birtherism  Trumps longtime questioning of whether President Obama was born in the United States which he only recently said was a settled issueThe good news for Trump is that he went toetotoe with Secretary Clinton on the debate stage which elevated his legitimacy as a candidate  something especially crucial when you are the challenger party candidate Mr OConnell said As we move on to the second debate look for both candidates to tweak their tactics  particularly TrumpIndeed Trumps biggest failing in the debate may have been his many missed opportunities He didnt go after Clinton for calling half of Trump supporters a basket of deplorables He also skipped the Clinton Foundation Benghazi and Clintons ties to Wall StreetClinton for her part can be expected to continue to pound Trump on his range of vulnerabilities including his temperament his business record and his comments about women and minoritiesIn the business world half of the money spent on marketing is wasted we just dont know which half says David Redlawsk chairman of the political science department at the University of Delaware Newark Its the same with information flows in a campaign We know they matter somewhere but its hard to know which matter
