Save the Children Norway trialed antimalaria drug Larium in Mozambique19931994 By Moeen Raoof   Moeen Raoof Roche AG a Swiss multinational healthcare company needed to trial a new antimalaria drug Mefloquine also known under the brand name Lariam in malariaprone areas of Africa This was despite known serious side effects including longterm health problems such as depression hallucinations anxiety and neurological effects such as poor balance depression and impaired mental health The Norwegian Chapter of Save the Children also known as Redd Barna operated in Mozambique under a Dutch national Redd Barna began to distribute Lariam in Mozambique between 1993 to 1994 This drug was given to men women and children including pregnant women The Lariam trials were conducted by distributing the drug based on the criteria of prevention and treatment of malaria and without due regard to age medical status or state of pregnancy Recipients of the drug were not told of the sideeffects but were actively monitored during the period of treatment which lasted approximately 18 months after the commencement of distribution These trials were conducted without the consent of the Mozambican government or the Ministry of Health Children as young as 3years old were given whole pills to take during either the prevention or treatment phases without regard to the side effects of the pills on very young children Pregnant women and women with babies were also given the drug but only if they had contracted malaria not preventatively The trials were more common among Mozambican men and women between the ages of 18 and 60 years divided into prevention and treatment risk groups They were provided a course of treatment accordingly One assumes that these persons were closely monitored for symptoms and side effects during and after the treatment period Many young Mozambicans during and after the treatment period began showing signs of unusual behaviour including bouts of violence after the testing of the drug ended in 1994 There was an increase in violent crime as well as murders in Mozambique This despite there being a very low crime and murder rate among civilians prior to 1993 including during the civil war that had ended 1990 Media in Mozambique explained away this increase in crime and murder post1993 as drugrelated linking the violence to the use of the MethaqualoneMandrax drug that was allegedly smuggled in from South Africa However this drug could not justify the rising cases of mental illness among all age groups in users and nonusers alike Mandrax was the prime and only suspect drug blamed for all ills in Mozambique during the 1990s As to why the wide use of Lariam was not considered as a possible cause relating to increase in violence mental illness crime including murders remains a mystery The Mozambican Civil War began in 1977 two years after the end of the war of independence It resembled the Angolan Civil War in that both were proxy battles of the Cold War that started soon after the countries gained independence from Portugal The ruling party Front for Liberation of Mozambique FRELIMO and the national armed forces FAM were violently opposed from 1977 by the Mozambique Resistance Movement RENAMO which received funding from whiteruled Rhodesia and later apartheid South Africa About one million people died in fighting and from starvation five million civilians were displaced and many were made amputees by landmines a legacy from the war that plagued Mozambique for more than two decades afterward Fighting ended in 1992 and the countrys first multiparty elections were held in 1994 Roche admitted that Lariam had worse side effects than other common antimalarials The head of drug safety and quality at Roche admitted that a study had shown there was an increased risk of neuropsychiatric problems compared to other drugs available Roche further stated that anyone with preexisting conditions such as depression should not be given the drug stating that There is an increased risk but the balance of risk to the balance of benefit is still believed to be important in this global endemic if it is prescribed to the
