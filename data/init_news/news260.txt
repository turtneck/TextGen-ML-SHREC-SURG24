Hillary Clinton told a joke Speaking to a roomful of Goldman Sachs bankers in June 2013 Clinton said that Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein could leave the Wall Street firm thats made him a billionaire to start a soup kitchenThis exchange was written down by Clintons aides as they gathered information on what parts of her paid Wall Street speeches could prove damaging should they leak to the press Her team filed it under the heading AWKWARDThis AWKWARD quote and hundreds of other previously hidden nuggets about Clinton have spilled out into public view recently Over the last two weeks Julian Assanges whistleblower platform WikiLeaks has published about 20000 pages of emails illegally stolen from John Podesta Clintons campaign chairThe strangest thing about the ensuing uproar is that none of the Podesta emails has so far actually broken any fresh scandals about the woman on track to be the next president Instead theyve mostly revealed an underbelly of ugliness to the multiple Clinton controversies that weve already known about the questionable relationship between the Clinton Foundation and its donors Clintons ease with powerful interests on Wall Street her ties to wealthy campaign contributorsThe Goldman soup kitchen joke is a perfect example If theres one thing to really get mad about here its something weve known for years  that Clinton took millions from big Wall Street banks right before running for president Seeing her and Wall Street titans share a laugh about helping the hungry might turn your stomach but the most important question  was it wrong for Clinton to take big checks from Goldman right before running  is in no way new Clintons campaign refused to comment on individual emails instead blaming the Russians for hacking the emails and providing them to WikiLeaksThis is from what weve seen so far the real story of WikiLeaks Podesta emails Yes they have not found any major bombshells No theyre not going to sink Clintons campaign But by filling in the storylines that have long dogged her campaign with new and vivid detail we are getting our clearest picture yet of how the sausage  or if you prefer the creamy risotto  gets made in ClintonworldIt can be an ugly sightIve now read hundreds of the Podesta emails as well as upward of 60 stories from across leftwing mainstream and conservative media outlets about what they entailI should stress that what Ive found is far from all bad Dozens of these emails show Clintons team genuinely striving to discover the correct position on an issue Many of them show real determined efforts to find the right solution to some public policy crisis In general especially compared to the vicious infighting that characterized her 2008 presidential run you come away from the Podesta emails thinking that Clinton has assembled an admiringly loyal group of aides that believes in the candidate and the mission of the campaign Theres some backbiting but you could imagine far far worseThen theres the other stuff  the emails Podesta presumably wish never leaked To help make sense of what weve learned Ive broken out the interesting new bits into what I think can be moreorless characterized as four distinct categoriesVox reached out to the Clinton campaign for comment and spokesperson Glen Caplin replied that they are still not authenticating any individual emails The campaign also referred foundationrelated questions to the foundation itself and referenced several times that the leaks were tied to a Russian attempt to influence our election As it has to other reporters the Clinton campaign did not dispute the accuracy of any of the individual emailsWe should be clear that these Podesta email leaks have nothing to do with the multiple other Clinton email scandals percolating over the past few years So they arent as some news outlets have incorrectly reported related to the FBI investigation into Clintons private server or allegations that she went around transparency lawsInstead since these emails emerge from the private account of Clintons campaign chair they tend to tell us far more about candidate Clinton than they do about Secretary of State ClintonThere is however one exception to that general rule the Clinton FoundationSince the campaign began the Clinton Foundation has been at the center of an intense debate The most extreme critics like Donald Trump have alleged that Clinton used the state department to transactionally reward the charitys donors theres no evidence for that Meanwhile the campaign and foundation have fallen back on one consistent defense  that theres been no proof of a quid pro quo between donor and foundationThe Clinton Foundation really did do inarguably lifesaving work But good government experts have argued that the Clintons accepted private donations in a way that they should have known would have created dangerous conflicts of interest This more nuanced attack faults the Clinton Foundation for dangerously blurring the distinction between private and publicThe Podesta leaks back up that storyOne way it does so is by uncovering a private audit conducted by a widelyrespected New York City law firm The review concluded that the Clinton Foundations board had failed to oversee potential conflicts of interest and that some donors expected quid pro quo benefits Interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gift the audit foundIts not clear they received them but either way the audit is a striking confirmation that even the attorneys hired by Clinton recognized the danger in the relationship between donor and foundationThen theres another disclosure emerging from the Podesta emails that Qatari officials sought to present Bill Clinton with a 1 million gift on his birthday on during his wifes tenure as secretary of state As the New York Times noted this revelation suggests that foreign governments were able to gain an audience with Bill Clinton in exchange for a check The Times couldnt confirm if the 1 million check was ever cashedThe last revelation in the leaks about the foundation may also be the most unusual Chelsea Clinton apparently was running around raising the alarm bell over possible conflicts of interest suggesting the Clintons themselves were aware of the potential problems Politicos Kenneth Vogel has a detailed blowbyblow of Chelseas concerns over the overlapping roles of a consulting firm named TeneoNothing here represents a major revelation If you werent bothered by the Clinton Foundation before this probably isnt going to trouble you But if you were having an audit and Chelsea Clinton share your fears will fuel the sense that something suspicious was afoot hereOver the course of the election Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders leveled a similar critique of Clinton that shes too wedded to the political establishmentFor Sanders that usually meant that Clinton didnt have the independence to challenge powerful actors on Wall Street and in Washington DC Trump has used similar rhetoric going after Crooked Clinton for her big dollar campaign contributorsWhatever you think of the merits of those attacks its clear that the majority of the American people think its correct at least in broad strokes Seven in 10 voters consider Clinton part of the establishment Just 30 percent trust her to take on special interestsIts an impression that the Podesta emails only deepen  even if they dont provide groundbreaking new controversies around itAgain none of this is revelatory Nobody who has closely followed Clinton will be shocked to find her campaign was attuned to the wishes of donors Her affinity for Israel is well known Critics of her approach to campaign finance are mad about the decision to take money from big donors  not the internal discussion over whether or not to do soBut watching how all of this unfolded  seeing for yourself how Clinton spoke gently to Wall Street  wont make the disclosures any easier for her detractors to swallow Its a confirmation of what we already know but that doesnt make it any less astonishing at least for Clintons criticsClintons close ties to Wall Street and big donors are certainly part of the story revealed by the Podesta leaks But only one partIndeed dozens of interesting tidbits have also emerged that allow us to see inside the Clinton campaigns infrastructure They have showed that at some times the Clinton campaign openly discussed the political implications of her deciding to get behind one policy or another They also show the Clinton campaign at other times responding to more highminded policy concernsIn one leak for instance Clintons team discussed at length whether they should endorse the reinstatement of the GlassSteagall Act which would restrict commercial banks ability to engage in some investment activityClinton aide Mandy Grunwald worries that reversing course and backing the law would lead to phoniness charges while not doing so could lead Sen Elizabeth Warren to endorse Bernie Sanders Jake in the following exchange is Jake Sullivan a top Clinton adviserThen theres a lengthy exchange in Clintonworld about a carbon tax proposal As Voxs Brad Plumer explains the emails show how fears of embracing an unpopular idea dominated the internal discussion Robby Mook a top Clinton aide said that embracing the carbon tax would prove lethal in the general electionBut other revelations have pointed to how the Clinton campaign got behind positions it found genuinely worthwhile In one exchange highlighted by the Washington Post the Clinton team talked about forming the signature pillars of a future progressive agenda like a significant middleclass tax cutThe exchange about the carbon tax did involve frank political talk But as Plumer also noted Podesta elsewhere makes genuine efforts to convince his colleagues about the menace posed by climate change and the need for genuinely huge solutions to address itThere are other examples A debate over the Cadillac Tax which taxes the most expensive health insurance plans showed twin impulses fighting against each other As Vox has written the tax is widely seen as an essential way to raise revenue for Obamacare But its also hated by unions whose votes and endorsements Clinton wanted to cultivate during the primaryThe emails reveal Clintons policy advisers arguing for a fix it strategy while the political team pushed harder for her to call for a full repeal They ultimately came down fully on the political sideNone of Clintons critics will be surprised to find her team debating political ramifications of certain policies  its certainly widely understood that this is how almost all politicians make their decisionsBut a fair appraisal of the emails doesnt reduce Team Clinton to opportunism Even behind closed doors they appear motivated by a genuine embrace of progressive beliefs and causes At least much of the time that is But not alwaysLets be honest Everyone who has worked in a big enough office has said or written something about a coworker he or she wouldnt say to that coworkers faceClintonworld is no exception But most offices dont have to deal with essentially all of their internal communications being dumped unceremoniously on the web Team Clintons internal gossip and snipings have been neatly organized into a searchable database that the whole world can useThese are understandably the best catnip for reporters Like the other revelations they also dont tend to reveal anything genuinely earthshattering But by laying bare the bitter grievances we generally already knew about these emails are fueling added frustration and old grudges For instance the emails includeThis kind of stuff of course has the least to do with public policy or the positions of the campaignBut this category of emails is perhaps most interesting to people who work for Clinton In a terrific article in Politico Annie Karni and Glenn Thrush detailed the psychological impacts its having on the Clinton campaignAs Karni and Thrush note this should be a heady time for Clintonworld Shes cruising to victory in the polls Donald Trump has sunk in the polls and Clinton has trounced him in three consecutive presidential debatesIn general the critics most upset about the Podesta emails are the ones who have confirmed what Clintons innercircle thought about them Ironically that dynamic now appears to apply to Clintons own team as wellTwo clear conclusions jump out when trying to determine what these emails tell us about a future Clinton presidencyOne is that Clinton appears genuinely responsive to pressure from outside groups Her team has clear goals but theyre also closely attuned to polls and to winning over the organizations union backers environmentalist groups Black Lives Matter activists whose support they think they need In private conversations Clinton tells the audiences in front of her more or less what they want to hearBut while this appreciation for her listeners may reflect political savvy it also suggests a flexibility that may worry those on her left What happens if President Clinton gets polling suggesting a majority of voters support slashing entitlements What if the country clamors for a war in Iran What if she can win over Republican voters by tacking to the centerAnd second more than anything the Podesta emails show how Clinton is the transactional politician many have long suspected Thats a dispiriting conclusion for some who may wish she was a pure progressive But it also helps clarify the battle lines for what looks like the coming Clinton administration  persuade her team they need you and you might have a shot at getting them on your side
