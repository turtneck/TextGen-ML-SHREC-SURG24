Dan Pfeiffer who left his position as senior adviser at the White House last week after having worked with Barack Obama since his first presidential campaign has been involved from the outset in navigating the central contradiction at the heart of Obamas public persona He ran as a figure who could overcome partisan polarization yet he has instead presided over more of it despite accomplishing the majority of the substantive agenda hepromisedObama and his spokespeople have spent most of their administration quietly at war with the conventional wisdom in Washington over the cause of this failure and Pfeiffer has spent much of his time in the administration dealing with or scolding members of the media mostly in offtherecord conversations But in an interview last week a few days before he resigned he explained in unusually candid terms the administrations thinkingand how the White House lost itsillusionsI think Obama believes and I certainly believe that while we can always do better this is a case where structural forces are the large actor here he told me Pfeiffer cited three of them The first is rising polarizationthe great sorting as he called itwhich over a period of decades has driven white conservatives out of the Democratic Party and moderates out of the Republican Party creating two ideologically homogeneous political organizations The second is the disintegration of restrictions on campaign finance which gives people even more incentive to play to the far right or to a set of specialinterests donors so that one individual can basically especially in these House races do a 1 million expenditure and completely tip the balance And finally the news media has changed so that people select only sources that will confirm their preexistingbeliefsAll of this combined makes communication with Republicans mostly hopeless Theres very little we can do to change the Republicans political situation because they are worried about a cohort of voters who disagree with most of what the president says Pfeiffer said We dont have the ability to communicate with themwe cant even break into the tight communication circles to convince them that climate change is real They are talking to people who agree with them they are listening to news outlets that reinforce that point of view and the president is probably the person with the least ability to break into that because of the partisan biastherePfeiffers reading of the redblue impasse isnt that its a permanent catastrophe Demographic change will eventually force Republicans to compete with Democrats for some of the same voters reopening a national political conversation that is accessible to both parties And Democrats will find the millennial generation in play Were going to have to work harder to get them registered to vote and involved and that offers an opportunity because while they are very progressive in some of their general leanings theyre less tied to institutions and parties But that will have to happen after this administration has left thesceneThe original premise of Obamas first presidential campaign was that he could reason with Republicansor else by staking out obviously reasonable stances force them to moderate or be exposed as extreme and unyielding It took years for the White House to conclude that this was false and that in Pfeiffers words what drives 90 percent of stuff is not the small tactical decisions or the personal relationships but the big macro politicalincentivesIf you had to pinpoint the moment this worldview began to crystallize it would probably be around the first debtceiling showdown in 2011 when Obama tried repeatedly and desperately to cut a budget deal with House Speaker John Boehner only to realize eventually that Boehner did not have the power to negotiate The administration has now decided that in many cases even adversarial bargaining fails because the Republican leadership is not capable of planning tactically You have to be careful not to presume a lot of strategy for this group Pfeiffer said Ive always believed that the fundamental driving strategic ethos of the Republican House leadership has been What do we do to get through the next caucus or conference without getting yelled at We should never assume they have a long game We used to spend a lot of time thinking that maybe Boehner is saying this to get himself some more room And its like no thats not actually the case Usually hes just saying it because he just said it or its the easiest thing to solve his immediateproblemThis analysis puts the administration at odds with the reading of American politics that still dominates much of Washington reporting Many political journalists imagine that the basic tension for the White House lies between Obamas liberal base and appealing to Americans at the center who will be crucial for tippingelectionsPfeiffer believes the dynamic is in fact the opposite The incentive structure moves from going after the diminishing middle to motivating the base Ever since Republicans took control of the House four years ago attempts to court Republicans have mostly failed while simultaneously dividing Democratic voters Obamas most politically successful maneuvers by contrast have all been unilateral and liberal Whenever wecontemplate bold progressive action Pfeiffer said whether thats the presidents endorsement of marriage equality or coming out strong on powerplant rules to reduce current pollution on immigration on net neutrality you get a lot of hemming and hawing in advance about what this is going to mean Is this going to alienate people Is this going to hurt the presidents approval ratings What will this mean in red states And yet this hesitation has always proved overblown Theres never been a time when weve taken progressive action and regretteditThis was deeply at odds with the lesson Bill Clinton and most of his aides many of whom staffed Obamas administration had taken away from his presidency But by the beginning of Obamas second term at least the president seemed fully convinced As we were preparing for the potential that we would lose the midterms Pfeiffer told me a lot of the advice we got around town was You have to show major contrition heads have to roll you have to give some sop to the Republicans The presidents view was No were not going to do that Were going to go out and were goingto be the opposite of contrite were going to be aggressive in our policies and our politics And that worked It caused people to cheer But thats the exact opposite of the sort of advice youd get in thistownThough the administration has wound up embracing a very different political strategy from the one it began with one thing has remained consistent Obamas disdain for conventional wisdom In his introduction to America as the keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention he criticized the pundits who like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states Now the pundits insist that Obama would bridge the partisan divide if only he spent more time golfing with John Boehner Those whom Obama once dismissed as cynical he now dismisses asnaveWhich isnt to say that he sees his presidency as triumphant I asked Pfeiffer about how his bosss view of politics has changed He had hopes of being able to change the polarization not just in the country but in Washington Pfeiffer told me We learned very quickly that that was a lot harder than we thought He will always say that his one biggest regret is that hes been unable to deliver on thatpromiseThis article appears in the March 9 2015 issue ofNew YorkMagazine
