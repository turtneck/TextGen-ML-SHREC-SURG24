David Axelrod is CNNs senior political commentator and host of the podcast  The Axe Files  He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns The opinions expressed in this commentary are hisCNN About a half century ago a journeyman ballplayer named Rocky Bridges made his debut as the manager of the San Jose Bees a desultory California League teamThe day was marred however when the hapless Bees missed signs dropped balls and were generally routedI managed good a frustrated Bridges recalled in a Sports Illustrated profile but boy did they play badAll of this is to say good luck to Donald Trumps new managersTrapped in what appears to be a political death spiral the bilious billionaire has once again shuffled his leadership teamPaul Manafort a veteran political operative who took over in the spring from the loyal but volatile Corey Lewandowski apparently has been shoved aside for a new ruling juntaWere told that Manafort will also be part of the junta But having been an adviser to deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos Manafort surely recognizes a coup when he sees oneBut in fairness Trumps precipitous slide in the polls since the conventions in July could hardly be blamed on the managerHours after the gavel fell at the Democratic convention Trump kicked off a dizzying 10day spasm of offthewall comments and tweets that seemed to confirm the thesis advanced by the Democrats in Philly Hes not ready for the nuclear codesI am certain that none of this came at the suggestion of Paul Manafort though Manafort gamely defended his man in the ensuing uproar But there really was no adequate defenseAttempts by the campaign to tether Trump to a TelePrompTer and script provided only intermittent relief Arming him with charts to discipline his presentations also failedTrumps appalling distemper following a wellexecuted Democratic convention transformed what had been at least in polling a relatively close raceNow he has brought in a new management team led by Stephen Bannon  a former Goldman Sachs banker and chairman of Breitbart News Bannon has never run a campaign at any level much less one for president which is a highly complex and specialized challengeHis new governing partner Kellyanne Conway has extensive campaign experience  but as a pollster not a managerTrump also reportedly is consulting Roger Ailes the former CEO of Fox News who was recently forced out amid sexual harassment charges to help coach him for the impending presidential debatesAiles is what the other new additions are notThe brutal negative ad campaign Ailes ran against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis remains a classic of political advertisingAiles knows campaigns television and presidential debates which could be an asset to Trump Stellar debate performances may now be his only chanceBut that would presume the candidates ability to listen work study internalize and execute a capacity we have not seen in this campaignThe presence of Ailes whose edgy television channel became a rallying point for conservatives and Bannon whose rightwing news website is also notoriously pugilistic portends a bloody fall campaign And in the evercombative Trump they will find a willing deliverer of missilesThe question with Trump is always where will they landEven if Trump were adding the greatest political team in history which he is not the problem is not the campaign The problem is the candidate whose allergy to substance and impulse to react angrily  and often tastelessly  to any provocation has unnerved votersIn the primaries his shoot first ask questions later style was enough to ignite his base but that very quality has become a liability now that he has to expand beyond itMaybe Trump Team Three has the magic elixirMore likely however they will be left shaking their heads like old Rocky Bridges as they watch their candidate play
