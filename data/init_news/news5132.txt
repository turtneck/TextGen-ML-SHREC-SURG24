Washington CNN Ben Carson spent much of Friday aggressively rebutting media reports about his past  a striking departure from the mellow personality he has displayed on the campaign trailThere is a desperation on behalf of some to try to find ways to tarnish me because theyve been looking through everything they have been talking to everybody Ive ever known everybody Ive ever seen Carson told reporters at a media availability in FloridaTheres got to be a scandal Theres got to be some nurse hes had an affair with Theres got to be something They have gotten desperate Carson continued Next week it will be my kindergarten teacher who said I peed in my pants Its ridiculous But its OK because I totally expect itCarsons personal narrative  a centerpiece of his campaign and star power  has long revolved around his accounts of his violent past and descriptions of the healing powers of his faithIn a story published on Thursday CNN reported that childhood friends of Carson were surprised about violent incidents he has described in a book public speeches and interviews and had no recollection of such events Scott Glover and Maeve Reston spoke with nine friends classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson and none had any memory of the anger or violence the candidate has describedFriday morning on CNNs New Day he said the networks reporting of his past was a bunch of liesThis is a bunch of lies that is what it is Carson told Alisyn Camerota when she asked about the report by Glover and Reston in which they spoke to people Carson grew up with This is a bunch of lies attempting to say Im lying about my history I think its pathetic and basically what the media does is they try to get you distractedCamerota pushed back on Carsons argument that the reporters did not talk to people who knew him earlier than high school but Carson rejected that and launched into an aggressive attack on the media He accused the media of not scrutinizing President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to the same degreeThe vetting that you all did with President Obama doesnt even come close doesnt even come close to what you guys are trying to do in my case and youre just going to keep going back He said this 12 years ago  it is just garbage Carson said Give me a breakReston and Glover repeatedly approached the Carson campaign during their reporting and again before publication of the story But the campaign staff declined to comment or to assist them in locating classmates or victims of violence who could provide insights about Carsons pastOn New Day Carson did not explain which aspects of the story he feels are incorrectCNNs story pointed out that none of the people interviewed challenged the veracity of his accounts but said they were surprised at them and did not reflect the youth that they knewFriday night Carson told reporters that the piece was a boldfaced lieIn his autobiography Carson did not explicitly say he applied to the schoolAfterward Sgt Hunt introduced me to General William Westmoreland and I had dinner with him and the Congressional Medal winners Later I was offered a full scholarship to West Point I didnt refuse the scholarship outright but I let them know that a military career wasnt where I saw myself going Carson wroteCarson himself acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times that the scholarship offer was informalIt was you know an informal with a record like yours we could easily get you a scholarship to West Point he saidArmstrong Williams Carsons business manager said earlier in the day that the candidate has always been clear that he never applied He gracefully let them know that medicine was his callingIts clear that what the Politico writer with what he was trying to gain with the headline did not substantiate it with his article Williams told CNNs Wolf BlitzerPolitico also reported that West Point would have a record of whether he applied in 1969 But West Point spokeswoman Theresa Brinkerhoff told CNN there would be no records about Carsons interaction with the school unless he actually enrolled Files on potential cadets from that time would have only been kept three years unless the person became a student she saidNo matter what at this point because the records were so many years ago we wouldnt have anything on him she saidWhile an official letter of admission would have come from the adjutant general of the Army who was not Westmoreland she said it was common for top military officials to recruit the best and brightest high school students And she said she could imagine that the schools lack of tuition  as a federally funded institution  could have been communicated or interpreted as a scholarshipI wouldnt find that odd that a general would pursue a discussion to kind of talk to him and say Do you know what West Point would offer you And if youre using general terminology to a 17yearold I could see how you would call them scholarships We dont use that terminology but I could see how that could occur Brinkerhoff saidSpeaking at a gala for the Black Republican Caucus of South Florida in Palm Beach Gardens Friday night Carson was reflective on the dirty world of politicsA lot of times people say Why would someone who has had a wonderful career get involved in the dirty world of politics I frequently ask myself that when I wake up in the morning It is a dirty world Carson saidHe did not mention the scrutiny on him during the remainder of the speech but briefly alluded to how he is more forcefully pushing back nowA lot of people think that Im soft because Im quiet I think theyre starting to find out that Im not soft And that I can be loud particularly when the injustice is being done he said
