Here Are The Presstitutes Who Control Americans Minds httpwwwveteransnewsnowcom20161026101035965usjournalistsataprivatedinnerwithhillaryclintonsteamandjohnpodesta I just heard an NPR presstitute delare that Texas a traditional sure thing for Republicans was up for grabs in the presidential election Little wonder if this report on Zero Hedge is correct Apparently the voting machines are already at work stealing the election for Killary httpwwwzerohedgecomnews20161025texasriggedfirstreportsvotingmachinesswitchingvoteshillarytexas From my long experience in journalism I know the American public is not very sharp Nevertheless it is difficult for me to believe that Americans whose jobs careers and the same for their children and grandchildren have been sold out by the elites who Hillary represents would actually vote for her It makes no sense If this were the case how did Trump get the Republican nomination despite the vicious presstitute campaign against him It seems obvious that the majority of Americans who have been suffering terribly at the hands of the One Percent who own Hillary lock stock and barrel will not vote for the people who have ruined their lives and the lives of their children and grandchildren Furthermore if Trumps election is as impossible as the presstitutes tell usHillarys win is 93 certain according to the latest presstitute pronouncementthe vicious 247 attacks on Trump would be pointless Wouldnt they Why the constant frenetic vicious attacks on a person who has no chance There are reports that a company associated with Hillary backer George Soros is supplying the voting machines to 16 states including states that determine election outcomes I do not know that these reports are correct However I do know for a fact that the oligarchic interests that rule America are opposed to Trump being elected President for the simple reason that they are unsure that they would be able to control him It is hard to believe that dispossessed Americans will vote for Hillary the representative of those who have dispossessed them when Trump says he will reempower the dispossessed Hillary has denigrated ordinary Americans who she says she is so removed from by her wealth that she doesnt even know who they are Clearly Hillary paid 675000 by Goldman Sachs for three 20minute speeches is not a representative of the people She represents the One Percent whose policies have flushed the prospects of ordinary Americans down the toilet What is really disturbing is the pretense by the presstitute scum that Trumps lewd admiration for female charms is deemed more important than the prospect of nuclear war At no time during the presidential primaries or during the current presidential campaign has it been mentioned that Russia is being assaulted daily by propaganda threatened by military buildups and being convinced that the United States and its European vassals are planning an attack A threatened Russia made insecure by inexplicable hostility and Western propaganda is a danger manufactured by the neoconservative supporters of Hillary Clinton If the American people are really so unbelievably stupid that they think lewd remarks about women are more important than avoiding nuclear war the American people are too stupid to exist They will deserve the mushroom clouds that will wipe them and everyone else off the face of the earth Donald Trump is the only candidate in the primaries and the general election who has said that he sees no point in conflict with Russia when Putin has shown nothing but desire to work things out to mutual advantage In contrast Hillary has declared the thriceelected president of Russia to be the new Hitler and has threatened Russia with military action Hillary talks openly about regime change in Russia Surely in a free media at least one person in the print and TV media would raise this most important of all points But where have you seen it Only in my columns and a few others in the alternative media In other words we are about to have an election in which the important issue has played no role And yet allegedly we are the exceptional indispensable people a peoples democracy protected by a free press In truth this mythical description of America is merely a cloak for the rule of the Oligarchs And the Oligarchs are risking life on earth for their continual supremacy Reprinted from PaulCraigRobertsorg by permission of author or representative
