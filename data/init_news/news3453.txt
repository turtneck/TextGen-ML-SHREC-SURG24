Donald Trump swept to a convincing victory in the Nevada presidential caucuses here Tuesday evening building a broad coalition that left his top two rivals trailing far behind and accelerating his march to the Republican nominationAn angry electorate hungry for a political outsider in the White House catapulted Trump to his third straight win in the GOP primary race as the billionaire mogul used visceral rhetoric to tap into anxieties about the economy terrorism and illegal immigrationThe breadth of Trumps support was staggering with Sens Marco Rubio Fla and Ted Cruz Tex running more than 20 percentage points behind him in second and third place respectively despite their aggressive campaigning across Nevada in the closing days Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov John Kasich who did not mount a serious campaign here were far behind in single digitsIf you listen to the pundits we werent expected to win too much  and now were winning winning winning the country a triumphant Trump declared to supporters at his Las Vegas victory partyVowing to continue his streak and quickly secure the nomination Trump added Its going to be an amazing two months We might not even need the two months folksThe Nevada results underscored the challenge for Trumps opponents to slow his momentum heading into next weeks Super Tuesday when 11 states will hold primaries and caucuses in a single dayCruz and Rubio who have been fighting bitterly to become the chief alternative to Trump were dealt a serious blow by Nevadas votersAfter watching with disappointment as returns rolled in Cruz all but ignored Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Las Vegas caucus night party He argued that the real race for the nomination had come down to him and TrumpThe undeniable reality that the first four states have shown is that the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and the only campaign that can beat Donald Trump is this campaign Cruz said referencing his win in the kickoff Iowa caucusesRubio who jetted out of Nevada Tuesday morning for campaign events in Minnesota and Michigan made no public comments on the results His advisers had been hopeful that he might finish strongly here perhaps even win considering that he spent part of his childhood in Las Vegas and enjoyed the support of much of the states political establishmentHigh voter turnout apparently overwhelmed organizers at some caucus locations There were isolated reports of double voting dwindling supplies of paper ballots and what a Republican Party official described as chaos at a couple of caucus sites here in Clark County the states biggest population centerSome volunteer caucus officials collecting ballots wore Trump campaign Tshirts and hats sparking an outcry and allegations of voter intimidation on social mediaThe Nevada Republican Partys caucus rules allow precinct workers to wear campaign paraphernalia Volunteers went through extensive training  are doing a great job read a statement from the partyEarly entrance polling reported by CNN showed that Trumps victory here was commanding across most demographic groups and among voters of every ideology Nearly six in 10 caucusgoers said they were angry at the federal government and a similar percentage wanted the next president to be a political outsiderTrump reveled in the breadth of his winning coalitionWe won the evangelicals we won with young we won with old we won with highly educated we won with poorly educated  I love the poorly educated Trump said referencing the network entrance polls And you know what I really am happy about because Ive been saying it for a long time Fortysix percent with Hispanics Number one with Hispanics Im really happy about thatTrump who visited caucus sites Tuesday night to motivate his supporters had led every recent public poll by double digits Enormous crowds packed his rallies including one Monday night in Las Vegas that drew an estimated 8000 peopleTrumps nationalist call to deport illegal immigrants and wall them off resonated with Nevadas workingclass whites resentful of the booming Latino populationBut a Trump win was not seen as a done deal The states caucuses are peculiar and unpredictable  and Cruz and Rubio labored to spring a surpriseCruz worked Nevada harder than any other candidate flying immediately to the state after South Carolinas primary Saturday and making nine crowded campaign stopsYet a message seemingly tailored to Nevadas libertarianleaning Republicans  with a particular focus on the federal control of land in the state  did not appear to resonate as Cruz might have hopedAnd the day before the caucuses was squandered when Cruz fired his communications director Rick Tyler who had published a false smear of Rubio on FacebookThe Cruz roadshow had a slapdash feel recycling video endorsements from Iowa one of which ended with People of Iowa it is time to believe again In Carson City when state Attorney General Adam Laxalt needed to stall for Cruzs arrival he announced a short video  and the audience groanedIn a television ad and in speeches he promised to hand over to the state the 85percent of Nevada land controlled by the federal government The idea drew applause  and some protesters  but did not move votesLike the Cruz campaign Rubios thought it could exploit Trumps weak statelevel organization with a carefully tailored strategy Rubio targeted Nevadas wellorganized Mormon community which propelled Mitt Romney to victory here in 2012 as well as seniors who populate the many retirement communities around Las VegasHe also played up his local roots He lived briefly as a child in Las Vegas where his father tended bar at a casino and his mother cleaned rooms at a hotel During that time his family temporarily converted to MormonismDozens of extended family members still live here He has more family members in Nevada than in Florida Lt Gov Mark Hutchison Rubios state campaign chairman said Sunday night at a rally in North Las VegasDonald Trump is on course to win the delegates he needs for the GOP nominationAll along however Nevada was Trumps to lose He focused on big rallies in Las Vegas and the Reno area  the states two main population centers  but he had a ground organization as wellTrumps campaign bought limited television advertising time in Las Vegas In its main spot which also ran in South Carolina a man whose son was murdered by an undocumented immigrant said that Trump is the only one he trusts to secure the borderRubio campaigned across Nevada with a broader message trying to appeal to a more diverse crosssection of the electorate and entrance polls suggested he won among voters who decided in the final daysMany of the states top elected officials backed Rubio including Sen Dean Heller Gov Brian Sandoval who has angered conservatives over a state tax increase decided to stay on the sidelines though he caucused for Rubio on Tuesday nightRubio attracted some star power too Donnie Wahlberg a founding member of New Kids on the Block a boy band popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s endorsed him at his Sunday night rallyI have never ever voted for a Republican presidential candidate  that is until this year thanks to Marco Rubio Wahlberg saidRubio also had the support of Rick Harrison a celebrated Las Vegas pawn shop owner and host of the Pawn Stars realitytelevision show I really think hes got a shot at winning on Tuesday Harrison told the Sunday night crowdScott Clement in Washington contributed to this report
