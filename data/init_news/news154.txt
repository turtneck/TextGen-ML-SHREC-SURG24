This has turned into the whiplash election and its virtually impossible to keep up with the headsnapping revelationsEven the most diligent journalist can get vertigo trying to investigate and evaluate each disclosure which damages Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and spawns dire predictions that their campaign is toast only to fade in a news cycle or twoSome developments that in a normal election would badly wound a presidential candidate get meager exposure in the rest of the media because they are overshadowed by other megastories No one has the bandwidth to do it allThis is more than a mere campaign its craziness has become the beating heart of American culture debated in every cubicle and coffee shop and at every level of the increasingly toxic stew of social mediaJust look at the last few weeksDemocrats and many members of the media have taken up weapons and stormed a place called Comey IslandThe FBI director shook up the race by revealing a probe of emails that wound up on the laptop of a top aides estranged husband under investigation for sending illicit messages to an underage girlThe New York Times reported that Trump avoided hundreds of millions of dollars in income taxes through a loophole scheme so dubious his own lawyers advised him that the IRS could declare it improperThe Clinton campaign got advance questions before CNN town halls from a top Democratic Party official who was also a paid contributor at the network which booted herThe Washington Post reported that Donald Trump has repeatedly sought credit for charity he had not given  or had claimed other peoples giving as his ownBack on Comey Island the FBI chief was reported to have argued that the administration shouldnt accuse Russia of using cyberwarfare to interfere with the presidential campaign becauseyesit would look partisan so close to the electionHacked emails revealed that the daughter of the Democratic nominees husband himself a former president complained that his aides were cashing in on the Clinton Foundation and siphoning money from her parentsThe Trump Foundation was ordered to stop fundraising by the New York attorney general a Democrat and Clinton supporterClintons top advisers reeling after the email scandal broke complained that said she had terrible instincts and a pathological aversion to apologizing according to hacked emailsBack on Comey Island the FBI looked into whether Trumps company had a secret email server communicating with a Russian bank but found no direct linkA Clinton aide complained in a hacked email that wespeak in such a tortured nuanced way when we dont get any advantage from the nuance and just wind up looking politicalBack on Comey Island the FBI opened a preliminary investigation of Trumps former campaign manager and his ties to Russian interests which Paul Manafort said he knew nothing aboutTrump boasted a decade ago on a Hollywood entertainment show that as a celebrity he could grab women by the genitals which he now dismisses as lockerroom talkBack on Comey Island FBI agents were investigating financial and ethical issues at the Clinton Foundation but were told to stand down by top lawenforcement officials according to the Wall Street JournalEleven women accused Trump of sexually propositioning them or unwanted kissing or touching all of which he denounced as liesTrump held a news conference before a debate with Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and Juanita Broaddrick who has accused him of rape which he has deniedHillary Clinton nearly collapsed while getting into a car and belatedly revealed that she had pneumoniaAnd well I could go onMany of these cases prompted media firestorms complete with predictions that Trump or Clinton would be seriously or even fatally damaged But then the stories were overtaken by some new allegation or outrageIn the case of Comeys renewed email investigation polls so far suggest that it hasnt moved the needle much beyond the tightening that was already taking place in the raceIt may well be that weve all become numb in this whiplash campaign The race is so polarized and public attitudes toward Trump and Clinton so firmly established that each new frontpage headline or cable obsession changes few mindsPerhaps the only consensus is a sense of relief that this long strange trip is finally coming to an endHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
