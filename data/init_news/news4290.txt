Californias drought was spawned bynatural weather variationsthathave bedeviled the West throughout recorded historyBut a new study released Thursday says humancaused global warming is worsening the natural phenomenon The study by Columbia Universitys Earth Institute isnt the first tosay warming has played a key role in fueling Californias dry conditions but its the first to measure its impact calculating thatit increased the problem byas much as 25 percentNatural weather patterns that push away atmosphericmoisture that carries rain are normal for the state But warming adds to the resulting dryness and heat A small amount of moisture stored in plants and the soil evaporates into the drier atmosphereA lot of people think that the amount of rain that falls out the sky is the only thing that matters said Park Williams a bioclimatologist at Columbia Universitys LamontDoherty Earth Observatory who was the studys lead author But warming changes the baseline amount of water thats available to us because it sends water back into the skyAs water runs dry Californians brace for a new way of lifeLightning strikes on parched earth are igniting wildfires all over the state There are so many blazes that firefighters from across the world are rushingto help put them outIn the Central Valley the land is so dry that farmers are drilling deep into the soil to extract groundwater to irrigate crops The drilling and pumping are drawing down aquifers that serve as a sort of liquid bank that the state can rely on when rivers and reservoirs arent replenished by rain and snow because of droughtFarmers have been the targets of critics who say they take too much water but irrigationactually has environmental benefits Williams said It provides moisture that cools the air offsetting rising heat But theres a drawback When too much is drained the state loses its artificial moisture making the air even hotterThe current drought is the most severe on record state officials say and 2014 was the hottest year in state historySnowpack levels that recharged aquifers was near zero in the SierraNevada and theres little rainfallAs the water supply in dozens of metropolitan reservoirs drops to historic lows Californians are hoping that a giant El Nio weather pattern forming in the Pacific Ocean will deluge the state with rain next winterBut even a large seasonal gusher would only delay the inevitable  a future of longer and more frequent droughts in California numerous researchers have saidIn February researchers at NASA and Cornell and Columbia universities predicted that California and the Southwest would slip into a 30year megadrought by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailedA month later researchers at Stanford University said Californians by then will be well accustomed to drought They used historical data to predict that average temperature increases would continue quickly evaporating average precipitation that will remain steady and increasing the likelihood of prolonged drynessScientists have been reluctant to link the states drought to global warming saying there was not enough data to support such a conclusionBut the current study is part of a growing body of evidence thats changing the minds of researchersA megadrought will grip the Southwest in coming decades scientists sayWilliams said his team read all the studies and sought to answer whether or not global warming was having an immediate impact We didnt look at the future at all This is a study about now he saidThey analyzed monthtomonth climate data between 1901 and 2014 to find fluctuations in precipitation wind temperature and humidity The study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters said average temperatures in California have increased by 25 degrees Fahrenheit over 113 years And starting in the 1960s heat increased with the introduction of more greenhouse gases from automobiles and other sourcesRichard Seager a climate scientist at Columbias Earth Observatory John T Abatzoglou an associate professor at the University of Idaho and Benjamin I Cooka research scientist for NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies were coauthors of the studyWhen greenhouse gases accumulate its like a bully showing up at your door to demand that you give it more and more every year Williams said In California that meant more moisture evaporating from rain and ground water sprayed on crops in farming regions such as the Central ValleyAfter a century the effects of warming are becoming more noticeable in the current droughtThe current drought would be bad without the bully Williams said referring to global warming With it the problem can become catastrophicWilliams said the state which only loosely regulates the withdrawal of groundwater by farms and other sources of agriculture should act more aggressively in policing its use attaching higher fees for removing it and fines for overdoing it State officials whove been diligent on capping greenhouse gas emissions might consider tougher regulations to avoid more severe droughtNoah Diffenbaugh author of the Stanford study called the Earth Institute study a step forward saying it was based on firm data showing that temperature makes it harder for drought to break and increases the longterm riskAmir AghaKouchak a hydrology professor at the University of California at Irvine who said in June that science did not support connecting the drought to warming said the reports results show that human influences are having an effectWith a stunning 7 million acres burned so far the US
