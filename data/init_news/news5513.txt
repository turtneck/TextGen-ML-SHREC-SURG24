in Multimedia  Politics I know the debate was a couple of weeks ago but I just came across this video that certainly makes a good case for the fact that someone may have been feeding her answers statistics and information If she cant even ad lib a televised debate against Donald Trump how are negotiations with foreign powers going to go when someone takes away her tablet or other telepromptish device Not only did Trump win the last debate  he won it without reading the answers and information that someone else was feeding him Really with Hillary Clinton is there any type of dishonesty that seems too farfetched See for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think Article first posted at DaisyLuthercom Submit your review
