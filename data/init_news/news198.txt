 Western Lynch Mob on Russia Ties Itself up in Absurd Knots By Finian CunninghamOctober 31 2016  Information Clearing House    RT   The Western lynch moblike campaign to get Russia goes on with the gathering this week of the United Nations Human Rights Council By trying to suspend Russia from the council the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize The 47member UNHRC based in Geneva is the United Nations premier intergovernmental forum on human rights Members are selected on a rotational basis On Friday 14 seats on the council are up for renewalThis week 80 mainly Western nongovernmental organizations associated with human rights reportedly urged the UNHRC to drop Russias membership citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of AleppoOver 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria httpstcouKTfWXWOLn RT RTcom 24  2016  Among the antiRussia lobby were USbased and George Sorosfunded Human Rights Watch Notably billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in RussiaThe campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain  also a member of the council  convened a summit in Geneva The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forcesRussias permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkin rebuked the UNHRC for a onesided politicized statement which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States Britain and France along with Gulf Arab states which lobbied for the resolutionRadar data proves Belgian F16s attacked village near Aleppo killing 6  Russian military httpstcoAj8mgT39ri pictwittercomXHU4ljZb4H RT RTcom 20  2016  These states have been arming and funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011 They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country  in the name of fighting terrorism  which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure such as roads bridges public buildings and residential homesIn recent months warplanes dispatched by the US France and Belgium the latter two current members of the UNHRC have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualtiesSo of course Westernorchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminalityThe contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drugabuse charges or the pseudoprobe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligence agencies that Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next monthSaudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council httpstcosqWeSwjg48 UNHR SaudiArabia humanrights RT RTcom 27  2016  The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating demonizing and delegitimizing RussiaPerhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seatsThat Saudi Arabia  widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth  is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oilrich ally gain a seat according to documents released last year by WikiLeaksA Saudiled military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools hospitals mosques marketplaces funeral halls factories and residential homes Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen It is also well documented that US British French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes That makes these Western states fully complicitMoscow summons Belgian ambassador presents data on F16s bombing of Syrian civilians httpstcoWzwvworaZd pictwittercomcHlKvzaeUD RT RTcom 21  2016  Germany for example which is also a current member of the UNHRC has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years according to a report last weekBritain the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva has sold over 4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015 Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots to help train Saudi counterparts brazenly denying that there is any breach of international lawThere is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRCThe hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and voidImportantly too is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites but to also elucidate the antiRussia claims as fabricationsThe information that Western governments rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based incongruously either on claims issued by the Britishlocated socalled Syrian Observatory for Human Rights or by activist groups within terroristheld east Aleppo which are funded by Western governments such as the purported rescue workers of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media CenterBREAKING UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into Aleppo war crimes httpstcoxrdojTxO3v pictwittercom2gKhTiMovH RT RTcom 21  2016  In other words Western governments media rights groups and sadly UN agencies are promulgating an antiRussia narrative that is recycled terrorist propagandaGood proof of this is seen on the TV station called Free Syria broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudiowned satellite platform ArabSatFree Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman along with Saudi troops warplanes and tanksFree Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar alSham which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogansAnother regular contributor to the images and reports on this Saudifunded terroristsupporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center Thus on this publicly available Free Syria channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a selfincriminating amalgamWhat is even more damning is that the same  information is disseminated  albeit in a more polished form  through Western news outlets such as CNN BBC France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers like the New York Times and British GuardianIts an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted Russias military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxiesAnd to add insult to injury these terroristsponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxiesThe utter insanity of it all But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception
