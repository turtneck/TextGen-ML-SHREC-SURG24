Donald Trump gets trumped in upset loss to Ted Cruz while Bernie Sanders declares moral victory in fighting Hillary Clinton to the closest Democratic caucus result in Iowa historyTesla under Trump How will electric cars fare under the next presidentThat was the warning shot fired off by Iowa voters both Republican and Democrat in Mondays caucuses  the kickoff to the 2016 presidential nomination processOn the Republican side Texas Sen Ted Cruz won an upset victory over Donald Trump with a stateoftheart turnout operation that overcame the lessorganized billionaires strength as a showman and lead in the polls But together their combined vote count  52 percent  represented a win for outsiders who reject the status quo in WashingtonIn the Democratic race former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton barely eked out a victory over Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders a selfdescribed democratic socialist And as the prohibitive favorite among party regulars at the start of the campaign Mrs Clinton was deeply wounded by her inability to fend off Senator Sanders allowing the populist outsider to declare a moral victoryGiven the conventional wisdom going in and if turnout was as high as it now seems HillaryClinton may have done well to escape with a tie tweeted David Axelrod former political adviser to President ObamaThe way Democratic caucuses are run here raw vote totals arent reported just the number of county convention delegates won The state Democratic Party declared Clinton the winner early Tuesday morning by 410ths of a percent the closest Iowa Democratic caucus outcome in historyThe results of both caucuses showed a restive population angry about stagnant middleclass wages fearful over national security and frustrated by Washingtons inability to break through gridlockThat anger and frustration have been captured most pungently by Mr Trump a true outsider running in his first political campaign and relying on his considerable skill as a reality TV star to attract media and voter attention But Trump went long on showmanship staging big flashy rallies around the country and short on the technology data and boots on the ground needed to get voters to turn out in sufficient numbers to winSuddenly the man who campaigned on being a winner based on polls and crowds is now a loser Cruz won 277 percent to Trumps 243 percent  not a blowout by any means but a loss is a lossIowa State Sen Brad Zaun who endorsed Trump said the billionaires fame made it difficult for him to campaign as a conventional candidate Cruz for example visited all of Iowas 99 counties appearing in coffee shops and community centersTrump visited the four corners of Iowa but it wasnt realistic to do all 99 counties because there werent enough venues large enough to accommodate his crowds said Mr Zaun in an interview outside Trumps postcaucus eventIn his speech to supporters Monday night Trump won praise for his gracious remarks as he congratulated Cruz But now the real estate magnate heads into the next contest the New Hampshire primary on Feb 9 needing a comeback victory to get his winning narrative back on trackTrump leads in New Hampshire with an average of 33 percent of the vote well ahead of the rest of the pack But postIowa its not clear how likely Republican primary voters will react to the bursting of the Trump bubble Before Iowa some analysts predicted a profound impactIf Cruz wins Iowa for New Hampshire it will be like taking a deck of cards and throwing them in the air said New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett head of American Research Group last week Trumps whole campaign is predicated on being a winnerAnother winner Monday in Iowa was Sen Marco Rubio R of Florida who beat expectations with a solid thirdplace showing of 23 percent  well ahead of his precaucus average in the polls of 17 percent The rest of the large GOP field scored in single digitsBut the playing field in New Hampshire will be considerably different Cruzs extensive outreach to evangelicals played well with Iowa Republicans but in New Hampshire the religiously minded are a much smaller audienceIt may make sense for Cruz to skip New Hampshire and focus on South Carolina and the Southern states of Super Tuesday March 1 some analysts suggest But Cruz seeking to show that his Iowa success isnt just proof that hes a good niche candidate like the last two winners of the Iowa caucuses may opt to play hard in the Granite State His pitch isnt just to the faithful its also as a rocksolid conservative known for his aversion to compromiseIf Cruz does fight hard in New Hampshire he will face not only Trumps big early lead but also stiff competition from candidates who mostly gave Iowa a pass and have focused hard on a GOP electorate in New Hampshire that is more establishmentfriendly Ohio Gov John Kasich New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush are all lying in waitSo is Rubio who has played in both lanes courting both teapartyoriented Evangelicals and more mainstream Republicans Rubios strongerthanexpected showing in Iowa should give him momentum heading into New Hampshire with hopes that voters there give him a second or first lookThe dynamic on the Democratic side is completely different The race is now a pure headtohead matchup between Clinton and Sanders following former Maryland Gov Martin OMalleys decision to drop out after a poor showing Monday nightThe ClintonSanders smackdown represents a stark choice for Democratic voters Clinton is the ultimate establishment figure former first lady former US senator and former secretary of State Both Clinton and Sanders have spent decades in politics but Sanderss record comes with a big difference Hes never been a member of the Democratic Party marching to his own drummer as a champion of the lower and middle classes fighting income inequality Wall Street and big money in campaignsThe conventional wisdom has long been that Sanderss high point in the campaign would be Iowa and New Hampshire two states with large white liberal populations and that Clinton would nail down the Democratic nomination through her deep ties to minority communities Her firewall would be in the SouthBut after Sanderss nearcoup in Iowa Sanderss campaign manager Jeff Weaver sees a new dynamicAs happens always in the Democratic primary process early success has an influence on later states Mr Weaver said in an interview I think people are going to look at this tremendous victory tonight and see that credibility and viability of Senator Sanders as a presidential candidate Youre going to see people in later states moving toward himAs for Clintons early lead in superdelegates the Democratic officials who make up an important part of the overall delegate count Weaver also predicts that many of the superdelegates now supporting Clinton will give Sanders another lookA lot of people jumped on the Senator Clinton bandwagon before this race had even started to develop he saysAnalysts still believe Sanders faces an uphill battle in his effort to deny Clinton the nomination as Obama did eight years ago But its now clear that Clinton the early prohibitive favorite will not waltz to her partys nominationBoth parties it appears are headed for a long grinditout primary season
