Donald Trumps criticism of a MuslimAmerican family that lost a son in Iraq has been called a potentially pivotal moment in the election But for a host of reasons such events are very very rareKhizr Khan father of fallen US Army Capt Humayun Khan speaks while his wife Ghazala Khan looks on during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Thursday In Election 2016 it could be called the questionIt has been repeated from the moment Donald Trump entered the race calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists And it has been raised again this weekend after Mr Trump criticized the parents of a fallen MuslimAmerican soldierHas Trump gone too far and materially damaged his chances for the presidencyThe reality is voters dont usually make up their minds that way political scientists say Single events rarely decide elections and the constant attempts to forecast Trumps demise speak both to the medias continuing befuddlement over his popularity as well as a penchant toward hyperboleThe failed Iran hostage rescue mission in 1980 doomed Jimmy Carters campaign perhaps The stock market collapse in 2008 gave John McCain an almost impossible obstacle as the perceived heir of the Bush legacyBut Trumps comments about the family of Capt Humayun Khan while perhaps more damaging than other past comments probably wont determine the winner in NovemberA real  gamechanger is very very rare says Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics But you wouldnt know that from watching televisionThe events began at the Democratic National Convention where Khizr Khan whose son died in Iraq sharply criticized Trump Trump responded by implying that the fallen soldiers mother had been silenced by equating his sacrifices in building a successful business with the Khans loss and by trying to refocus the conversation on terrorismSome pundits have called it a pivotal moment in the campaignBut at a moment when the American electorate is increasingly polarized there is a question of whether gamechanging moments can even happen this election Though polls show that Trump and Hillary Clinton are the two most disliked presidential candidates of the past quarter century that dislike can freeze voters in concrete  they dont like their candidate but theyre definitely not going to vote for the other oneOver the course of the campaign Trumps comments have often only hardened each sides resolve instead of swaying undecided votersLarge majorities are in concrete about their party and presidential choice says Professor Sabato The game is over for the vast majority of votersBut others say that polls do show scope for some movement Between 5 and 25 percent of voters are not choosing either Trump or Mrs ClintonThis means there is still fluidity there says Gary Nordlinger president of a political consulting firm and adjunct professor at George Washington Universitys school of political managementAnd despite the high unfavorable ratings for each candidate some voters could still switch allegiances suggests Tobe Berkovitz a political media consultant and chair of Boston Universitys department of mass communicationI dont think the cake is baked at this point More important than the undecideds are the persuadables  he says They say they are voting for one or the other now but they can be pulled away Its a real holdyournose election They are voting because this one is worse than that oneThe Khan episode could have an influenceThis could have teeth compared with Trumps other controversial remarks says Jennifer Lawless director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University There were multiple facets that people found offensive the mother remarks that the speech wasnt heartfelt questions as to whether the soldier was a hero Take your pick Most people found part of the discussion distastefulThe effect will only become apparent after a couple weeks of polling she saysOne thing is for sure however The media are a poor judge of gamechanging momentsThe phrase game changer was used at least 19600 times during the 2012 presidential campaign according to research by Tim Murphy a reporter with Mother Jones magazine All three presidential debates were deemed gamechangers as were multiple monthly jobs reports and varying endorsementsIts in the medias interest to make everything seem like a big deal  thats what the media does and its a selffulfilling prophecy for everyone but the voters says Professor Berkovitz at Boston UniversityAs John Sides and Lynn Vavreck point out in their 2012 book The Gamble gamechangers are emphasized by the media  not presidential campaignsThe continual search for gamechangers treats a campaign like a boxing match where the momentum may be shifting back and forth with every punch and the knockout blow could come at any moment In reality there are few knockout punches and most gamechangers do not really change the game that muchAdded Mr Murphy of Mother Jones The moral of the story is that were still really bad at predicting the future
