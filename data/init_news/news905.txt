Donald Trump said in an interview that economic conditions are so perilous that the country is headed for a very massive recession and that its a terrible time right now to invest in the stock market embracing a distinctly gloomy view of the economy that counters mainstream economic forecastsThe New York billionaire dismissed concern that his comments  which are exceedingly unusual if not unprecedented for a major party frontrunner  could potentially affect financial marketsI know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them said Trump who has misfired on such predictions in the past I dont need themTrumps goitalone instincts were a consistent refrain  Im the Lone Ranger he said at one point  during a 96minute interview Thursday in which he talked candidly about his aggressive style of campaigning and offered new details about what he would do as presidentThe real estate mogul top aides and his son Don Jr gathered over lunch at a makeshift conference table set amid construction debris at Trumps soontobefinished hotel five blocks from the White House Just before he had met there with his foreignpolicy advisers and just after he visited officials at the Republican National Committee  signs that in spite of his Trumpknowsbest manner the political novice is making efforts to build a more wellrounded bidRead the full transcript of the Trump interviewOver the course of the discussion the candidate made clear that he would govern in the same nontraditional way that he has campaigned tossing aside decades of American policy and custom in favor of a new Trumpian approach to the worldIn his first 100 days Trump said he would cut taxes renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals including altering the US role in the North Atlantic Treaty OrganizationHe insisted that he would be able to get rid of the nations more than 19trillion national debt over a period of eight yearsMost economists would consider this impossible because it could require taking more than 2 trillion a year out of the annual 4 trillion budget to pay off holders of the debtTrump vehemently disagrees Im renegotiating all of our deals the big trade deals that were doing so badly on With China 505 billion this year in trade He said that economic growth he foresees as a consequence of renegotiated deals would enable the United States to pay down the debt  although many economists have said the exact opposite that a trade war would be crippling to the US economyTrump also said that the United States has lost its standing in the world and that he would make people respect our country I want them to respect our leader Asked how he would do so Trump cited an aura of personalityAs a group of world leaders attended President Obamas Nuclear Security Summit less than a mile away Trump said that like Obama he would support fullscale nuclear disarmament but quickly added I love that But from a practical standpoint not going to happenWere he to be elected president Trump said he would want highlevel employees of the federal government to sign legally binding nondisclosure agreements so that staffers couldnt write insider accounts of what its like inside a Trump White HouseWhen people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal I dont like that Trump saidBut first Trump must get elected and his campaign is struggling through one of its most challenging stretches In the past week his campaign manager has been charged with battery for grabbing a reporter Trump has been criticized for mocking the looks of an opponents wife as compared with those of his own spouse and he has backtracked from comments about abortion that offended many in his own partyTrump said that everyone close to him  family friends Republican leaders  has been urging him to tone down his attacks and reach out to former rivals both to reassure wary voters and to begin the difficult process of unifying a party in which many have sworn to never back him Trump does not intend to take the advice He said such overtures are overratedI think the first thing I have to do is win he said Winning solves a lot of problems And I have two people left his two remaining Republican rivals Sen Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov John KasichSometimes you have to break an egg Trump said and Cruz and Kasich were the two remaining eggsTrump did offer some concessions to the realities of being a political novice saying that he would not pick an outsider like himself as a vicepresidential running mate but rather somebody that can walk into the Senate and whos been friendly with these guys for 25 years and people for 25 years And can get things done So I would 95percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outsideIn another unprecedented move Trump said he plans to announce a list of 10 to 12 judges from which he would pick to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court to allay concerns from conservatives that he wouldnt choose someone to their likingIm getting names The Federalist people Some very good people The Heritage Foundation Trump said Im going to announce that these are the judges in no particular order that Im going to put up And Im going to guarantee it Im going to tell people Because people are worried that oh maybe hell put the wrong judge inAnd after a series of violent incidents at his rallies between supporters and protesters Trump acknowledged that at least for a little while he has tried to calm things downWeve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week he said You know weve gone into small venues and were turning away thousands and thousands of people which I hate but we didnt want to have the protest You know when you have a room of 2000 people you can pretty much keep it without the protestersThe question posed to Trump about his decision to run Where do you start the movieA wry smile spread over his face as he repeated the question about the moment when he decided to turn what had long been a flirtation with running for the presidency into something realAsked who he talked to about this critical decision Trump answered To myselfTo my family but to myselfSo it was an interior dialogueThis is thought process And Im saying to myself you know look they put me in these polls Im number oneTrump said his interest really started to pick up in the summer of 2014 when he was still busy with his hit NBC reality show The Apprentice He kept his ambition mostly to himself slowly thinking it through into early last year when he hired political advisers months before he formally jumped inTrump said his experience throughout the last two years wasnt like 1987 when he first made a speech in New Hampshire that he forgot about soon after delivering it This time as he read the daily newspapers printedout online articles his preferred method of reading and kept tabs on cable news he felt the pullI said You know this is something I really would like to do I think Id do it really well Obviously the public seems to like me Trump recalledIll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes Because it was a monetary moment also    There was a moment in I would say February of last year so that would be four months three four months before I announced when Steve Burke great guy of Comcast    came to see me with the top people at NBC And they wanted to extend my contractTrump told them he was going to run for president insteadI just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country Trump said of his thinking at the time He was frustrated with what he saw as the stupidity of trade deals and Iran nuclear negotiations that were terrible and dominated by Persians being great negotiatorsTrumps wife Melania heard most of his complaints but was not enthused about him becoming a candidate She said We have such a great life Why do you want to do thisI said I sort of have to do it I think I really have to do it  I could do such a great jobLater Melania said I hope you dont do it but if you run youll win according to TrumpNow more than a year later and with the Republican nomination in sight Trumps family is giving him different advice My family said to me  and Don Jr has said this and Ivanka and my wife has said this  Be more presidentialTrump said he is getting similar guidance from close friends He had a story to share A couple weeks ago a friend a famous athlete called This was right after Trump beat Sen Marco Rubio in Florida the senators home state That was a big beating Dont forget he was the face of the Republican Party He was the future of the Republican Party So the athlete called me up And he said Hey Donald could you do us all a favor We love you Dont kill everybody Because you may need them on the way backBut Trump doesnt see it that way at least not yet I think you have to break the egg initially he said adding that he has to beat his opponents and secure the nomination before he is willing to consider reaching out or easing off in any wayWhen it was suggested that he seems comfortable being the Lone Ranger  the famous oldtime TV and radio masked vigilante who fought for good outside the law  Trump immediately concurredI am he said Because I understand life And I understand how life works Im the Lone RangerAsked how he would build a coalition for the general election Trump responded that he hasnt focused on Hillary Clinton yet  an implication that once he starts attacking her voters would rally to his sidePressed on whether it is incumbent on him to tame the anger within his party Trump said it was but also I bring rage out I do bring rage out I always have I think it was I dont know if thats an asset or a liability but whatever it is I do I also bring great unity out ultimately Ive had many occasions like this where people have hated me more than any human being theyve ever met And after its all over they end up being my friends And I see that happening hereNot with everyone though Trump acknowledged that he has been rough and nasty in debates  so much so that some relationships with his former rivals are likely beyond repair One of the problems I have is that when I hit people I hit them harder maybe than is necessary he said And its almost impossible to reel them backLike Rubio and former Florida governor Jeb Bush Some of the people that I was competing against Im not sure they can ever go back to me Trump said I was very rough on Jeb It was Jeb Low energy Little Marco Names that were devastatingTrump seemed unsure whether Cruz would ultimately fit that category Trump noted that they had gotten along quite well for many months and suggested they could again but he was also ambivalent about potentially reaching out to Cruz if he beats the senator from Texas for the nominationIll never have to call him to get his help and support Trump said adding that if Cruz did reach out he would congratulate him Because out of 17 people you beat 16 Okay Which is pretty goodStill Trump admitted that he needed to do more outreach Honestly a lot of people are calling me but I should be calling them he said Because to a certain extent I should be calling them they shouldnt have to be calling meTrump noted that two of his former rivals Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie are supporting him As for some others They will be loved At the right time they will be lovedAsked specifically at this uncertain moment in his campaign whether all politics all successful politics is about coalition building he responded Its trueI do Trump said his arms folded across his familiar dark suit white shirt and red tie as he sat in what he hopes will be his newest trophy hotel I agree I agreePressed on when that coalition building might begin he turned to stories about boxing great Muhammad Ali and football coaching icon Vince LombardiAli he said earned respect through having the goods You know so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine Hes a good guy Ive watched many people over the years Muhammad Ali would get in the ring and hed talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear and this that  you know And then hed win And respect is about winning We dont win anymore I see it in my  we dont win anymore And hed win Ive seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali in terms of talking Ive seen guys that were so beautiful so flamboyant theyd get into the ring  and then theyd get knocked out And guess what Its all goneThe coalition building for me will be when I win Vince Lombardi I saw this He was not a big man And I was sitting in a place with some very very tough football players Big strong football players He came in  these are tough cookies  he came in years ago  and Ill never forget it I was a young man He came in screaming into this place And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him literally And very physical grabbing him by the shirt Now this guy couldve whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds This guy  the player  was shaking A friend of mine There were four players and Vince Lombardi walked in He was angry And he grabbed  I was a young guy  he grabbed him by the shirt screaming at him and the guy was literally  And I said wow And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he wonTrump has for months contended that the US economy is in trouble because of what he sees as an overvalued stock market but his view has grown more pessimistic of late and he is now bearish on investing to the point of warning Americans against doing soI think were sitting on an economic bubble A financial bubble Trump said He made clear that he was not specifying a sector of the economy but the economy at large and asserted that more bullish forecasts were based on skewed employment numbers and an inflated stock marketFirst of all were not at 5 percent unemployment Were at a number thats probably into the twenties if you look at the real number Trump said That was a number that was devised statistically devised to make politicians  and in particular presidents  look good And I wouldnt be getting the kind of massive crowds that Im getting if the number was a real numberThe bizarre optimism in Donald Trumps theory of the economyTrumps assertion does not match data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Its analysis of joblessness beyond the unemployed  such as marginally attached workers and those who have dropped out of the labor force  was under 10 percent nationally last monthTrumps view also runs counter to that of most economists whose rough consensus is that the US economy has about a 20 percent chance of slipping into recession this year largely because growth remains weak across the world according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists in MarchMost economists arent overly worried about an imminent downturn because job creation remains strong workers are starting to see their wages grow and the Federal Reserve remains cautious about shifting away from the lowinterestrate stance that has helped stimulate the economyAny number of Trumps predictions havent worked out In 2012 for instance he predicted that if Obama were reelected oil and gas prices would go through the roof like never beforeIn 2011 Trump said that when Obamas healthcare law took effect national unemployment would go even higher than 9 percent He was also bullish on real estate investments in the runup to the housing bustNonetheless Trump said its precarious times Part of the reason its precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries We are being ripped so badly by China It just never ends Nobodys ever going to stop it And the reason theyre not going to stop it is one of two Theyre either living in a world of the makebelieve or theyre totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interestsIm pessimistic Trump said Unless changes are made Changes could be madeBy Trump for instance I can fix it I can fix it pretty quicklyTrump firmly believes that a turnaround on trade would be the necessary beginning of a solution to any looming recessionHe mentions the TransPacific Partnership as one pact he would immediately seek to renegotiate putting him at odds with congressional Republicans who supported giving the president fasttrack trade authority last yearCoupled with his push on trade would be a very big tax cut which Trump unveiled last September That proposal increases taxes on the very rich but reduces taxes for most taxpayers and would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent To woo companies back to the United States he would offer an incentive of a deeply discounted rate and would no longer allow corporations to defer taxes on income earned overseasIn the center of Washington on Thursday world leaders were attending a summit focused on reducing nuclear stockpiles around the world A day earlier Trump had made headlines for saying at an MSNBC forum that he would possibly use a nuclear weapon as president Less than a week before in an interview with the New York Times Trump had suggested that Japan and South Korea should consider acquiring nuclear arms as a way of disengaging the United States from its role as a military protector  a proposal that the Obama White House promptly called catastrophicTold that Obama had said in 2010 that his greatest worry is a nuclear device exploding in an American city Trump at first took a dig at the presidentIts funny Its very interesting Im surprised he said that because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming which I totally disagree with Okay Trump saidBut after mocking Trump turned solemn on the topic calling the nuclear threat the single greatest problem for global peace You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand he said shaking his headTrump said if other countries would agree to do so simultaneously he would be open to eliminating nuclear weapons held by the United States If its done on an equal basis absolutely he saidBut Trump added a caveat He said as much as he supports the idea of eliminating nuclear weapons it may not be feasible in the current climate and with countries such as Russia and Pakistan perhaps unwilling to relinquish their arms since they are spending a tremendous amount of moneyThats something that in an ideal world is wonderful but I think its not going to happen very easily I would love to see a nuclearfree world Will that happen Trump said Look Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on redoing their entire nuclear arsenalTurning to Russias leader Vladimir Putin Trump said he continues to appreciate praise from Putin even though his humanrights record and incursions into Ukraine and elsewhere have alarmed many I want Putin to respect our country okay Trump said I think he respects strength Okay I think Putin respects strength And Ive said it before I think I will get along well with Putin Now you never know I dont say that  only a fool would say I will but I feel that I will get along well with PutinAfter talk of Putin and strength Trump was read a few lines from Jeffrey Goldbergs interview with Obama in the Atlantic which quotes Obama as saying Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violenceTrump listened carefully and said Well I think theres a certain truth to that I think theres a certain truth to that Real power is through respect Real power is I dont even want to use the word fear But you know our military is very sadly depleted You look at whats going on with respect to our military and its depleted from all of the cuts Trump said noting that he frequently sees advertisements for former US military bases being available for purchaseI dont want people to be afraid I want them to respect our country he said Right now they dont respect our countryTrump said the United States should not retreat from the world but should reevaluate its relationships and role in many international groups and alliances including NATOFirst of all its obsolete he said Our big threat today is terrorism Okay And NATOs not really set up for terrorism NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else And now you dont have the Soviet UnionBut for Trump NATO Putin nuclear weapons all of that is for later For now against mounting calls from friends loved ones and fellow Republicans remains the fightMy natural inclination is to win Trump said And after I win I will be so presidential that you wont even recognize me Youll be falling asleep youll be so boredJim
