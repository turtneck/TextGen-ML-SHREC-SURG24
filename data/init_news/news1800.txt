Maria Herrera a 62yearold retired casino housekeeper feels no affinity for Marco Rubio even as he aims to make history as the first Hispanic president of the United States As she explained Hes Cuban Im MexicanRubio says things that are not good for Mexicans Herrera said adding that she supports Hillary Clinton I would never vote for him just because hes LatinoRubio whose parents are from Cuba and Ted Cruz whose father was born in Cuba are competing to be the first Hispanic in the White House  and casting unprecedented attention on the nations growing Hispanic voteBut in several key swing states  Nevada Colorado Florida and Virginia  most Latinos are not Cuban Most lean Democratic  and identify more with their country of origin than with the broader terms Hispanic or Latino for those from Spanishspeaking countries Most also oppose both Rubios and Cruzs positions on immigration reform All of that in addition to longstanding tensions between Cuban and Mexican immigrants could dash the GOPs hopes that Cruz or Rubio could do what few Republicans have been able to do in a presidential election attract significant Hispanic supportRubios cousin a Democrat says Marco has his love but not his voteMexicans account for nearly twothirds of the Latinos in the United States  about 35million people Cubans are the thirdlargest group after Puerto Ricans with just 2million people or only 37percent of the Latino vote according to the Pew Research CenterIn interviews in wedding chapels and casinos all around this city of stretch limos slot machines and neon signs Mexicans who make up so much of the workforce said it would be far more meaningful to elect the first Mexican American president than the first Latino Many said they would vote for a nonLatino over a Cuban AmericanIn two days of interviews not a single Mexican said he or she supported Rubio or Cruz and even some Cubans said they dont plan to support either Cuban American candidatePart of the friction between Mexicans and Cubans comes from the starkly different reception they get when they arrive in the United States Cubans who reach US shores are almost automatically granted residency and eligibility for food stamps and other welfare benefits because of a special policy for those coming from the communist island  many arriving through Mexico Mexicans who enter without legal papers live under the threat of deportationThere are cultural distinctions too They speak with different accents celebrate different customs and eat different foods Mexico is soccerobsessed while Cuba loves baseballExcept for the fact that they both speak Spanish everything else is totally different said Carlos Artiles 50 a bartender at the Florida Caf Cuban Bar  Grill where the eggs come with stuffed potatoes and fried plaintains Artiles a Cuban quickly became a citizen but he sees firsthand how Mexicans including his wife try unsuccessfully for years and pay thousands of dollars to attorneys to help Its completely unfairNo way will Mexicans rally around presidential candidates just because they are Cuban he saidLike oil and water is how Alejandro Carrillo a Mexican salesman describes Mexicans and Cubans He said he believes that Cubans have it easier in the United States and often act as though they are better than Mexicans As he shopped in Moda Latina looking at cowboy boots and hats Carrillo said the differences between Cubans and Mexicans extend right down to how they dress I never once saw a Cuban who wore bootsAbout 30percent of Nevadas population and 20percent of its electorate is Latino Mexicans far outnumber any Latino group here but Cubans command an outsize influenceCuba had a thriving casino business when Fidel Castro seized control in 1959 and many Cuban casino workers fled the island and moved to this gambling mecca For decades Cubans have been influential in business Spanishlanguage media and politics  just as they are in South Florida home to the greatest concentration of CubansOtto Merida a prominent Cuban here who ran the Latin Chamber of Commerce for 40years said It would be a dream to have a Cuban American in the White House and he likes RubioBut early on Merida signed up to support former Florida Gov Jeb Bush If he could catch fire Bush would do very well with Mexican Americans because he is married to a woman born in Mexico he saidAndres Ramirez a Democratic strategist in Nevada said that despite differences many Cubans and Mexicans get along Some Hispanics  no matter the nationality  will vote for a candidate just because theyre a Latino just like some people will vote for a woman because she is woman  but that is not the majoritySurnames can matter but people vote on policy and platforms Ramirez saidRubio whose wife is the daughter of immigrants from Colombia has shown more ability to win over nonCuban Hispanics in Florida than Cruz has in Texas when they ran their Senate races according to exit polls Rubio campaigns in both English and fluent Spanish about being the son of immigrants who came to America for a better life for their childrenBut Fernand Amandi managing partner of Bendixen  Amandi International which frequently surveys the Hispanic community said that in a presidential election Rubio will face much more intense opposition because Democrats will highlight the fact that he yanked his support for comprehensive immigration reform Cruz unequivocally  today tomorrow forever  opposes giving citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants a great number of whom are MexicanNot all Mexicans interviewed were in the country legally and some have legal status but not citizenship and so they are not eligible to vote But those Mexicans who are citizens such as Herrera who was washing her clothes in a laundromat said they plan to vote for Clinton TheRepublicans and Democrats are holding caucuses in Nevada next month in the first primaryseason voting in the West right after Iowa and New HampshireHerrera said she was more interested in having the first female president than the first Latino president What Clinton says is more appealing to her than what she hears from Rubio or Cruz she saidMany Cubans lavished praise on Rubio who lived in Las Vegas as a child while his father worked as a hotel bartender and his mother as a maid A few said they like Cruz but not enough to consider voting for himAnd several Cubans said they support Trump the candidate most despised by Mexicans Trump has referred to some Mexicans as rapists and promised to build a gigantic wall on the border to keep Mexicans outTrump says what others wont He fears nothing said Elizabeth Abad 46 who left Cuba a decade ago became a US citizen and works at the Florida Caf I like his toughnessSergio Perez 47 owner of the Florida Caf and the Havana Grill where Rubio recently held a big rally also thinks Trump is the best candidate in these difficult times Perez said people are anxious and cannot afford the same life  not even the same amount of groceries  they once had Nobody felt good this Christmas he said adding that Trump a businessman knows how to build things and put people to workIts a dream to have a Cuban guy as president he said about Rubio whom he called a beautiful guy smart charming He could be a great vice presidentBut dont expect Mexicans to vote for him because Perez said Eighty percent of the Mexicans dont like the Cuban people
