CNN Federal investigators tried to warn the Democratic National Committee about a potential intrusion in their computer network months before the party moved to try to fix the problem US officials briefed on the probe tell CNNThe revelation raises questions about whether the DNC could have done more to limit the damage done by hackers suspected of working for Russian intelligenceThe DNC brought in consultants from the private security firm CrowdStrike in April And by the time suspected Russian hackers were kicked out of the DNC network in June the hackers had been inside for about a yearA person briefed on the DNCs response says the warning from the FBI and other agencies wasnt specific and that the extent of the problem wasnt clear when the initial warnings came DNC officials hired outside help after additional indications surfaced that their systems were compromisedThe DNC breach occurred around the same time as breaches of US government systems at the State Department and the White House Analysts from the National Security Agency found signatures in those breaches that led them to suspect there were other intrusions outside the government including at the DNCI talked to the general counsel of the DNC today and he assures me that every step along the way when we were notified of these issues that we changed systems changed procedures said DNC vice chairwoman Donna Brazile to CNNs Wolf Blitzer But these hackers are so sophisticated that they changed procedures So yes it went on for more than a year but at no time did we ignore the warning from the FBI or any other federal officialsEarlier on Monday the FBI confirmed it was investigating a hack into the DNC the first acknowledgment from the agency that they are probing the incident which US officials suspect came from a Russian cyber attackFallout over the emails led DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to announce her resignation SundayThe FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter the agency said in a statement A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspaceThe FBI has sent experts to meet with the Republican National Committee as well as the major campaigns to discuss their security measures the officials say No similar intrusions have so far been detected at the RNC or the campaigns of the two major party candidates the officials sayI dont think its coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here and I think thats disturbing he saidTrumps son Donald Trump Jr denied that his fathers campaign had anything to do with encouraging Russians to hack the DNCI cant think of bigger lies but that exactly goes to show you what the DNC and what the Clinton camp will do Trump told Tapper on State of the UnionEven before the emails were posted on Wikileaks the White House convened a security meeting to review what was known US officials told CNNDemocrats including some in Congress are trying to pressure the White House to publicly name Russia as the perpetrator in the way the government named North Korea in the Sony hack and China for hacking various US companies The Obama administration has resisted publicly naming Russia despite evidence gathered by US government investigators showing Russian behind cyberattacks on US government agencies and even the public release in 2014 of a hacked phone call between US diplomats in Ukraine that was caused embarrassment for the USAt the State Department Monday spokesman John Kirby refused to say Russia was responsible citing the ongoing investigationIt goes without saying that issues of cyber security will be a topic of discussion between us and our Russian interlocutors on a continuous basis I dont have any specific conversations to speak to and nor would I as this matters under investigation by the FBI Kirby said I think we need to let the FBI do their work before we try to form any conclusions here in terms of what happened and what the motivation was behind it The FBIs spoken to this Were going to respect that processJames Trainor assistant director for FBIs cyber division told CNN in a recent interview that the bureau has been working with political organizations and think tanks to put more resources into the security of their computer networks He wouldnt discuss the DNC or the role of Russia but spoke generally about the increased number of such intrusionsTheres been aggressive targeting of that sector the various campaigns think tanks in the Washington DC area Trainor saidThe targeting of any candidate or any party that has political intelligence Trainor said Theres value in information there if youre a nation state actor so it shouldnt be surprisingPrivatesector cyber security investigators hired by the DNC concluded that hackers working for the Russian government were behind the yearlong breach of the DNC The investigation found intrusions by two Russian hacking groupsRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov however dismissed claims When asked by a reporter What do you say of the US accusations that Russia hacked the Democratic Party emails Lavrov replied Well I dont want to use fourletter wordsAt least one of the DNC intruders is believed to be behind other breaches of nonclassified US government systems at the White House State Department and other agencies security experts believe based on an analysis of malicious software in the breachesThe FBI and other US agencies involved havent yet officially attributed the DNC attack to Russian government hackers But evidence gathered by the FBI so far points to groups that are known to US counterintelligence for carrying out intrusions for the Russian government the officials briefed on the probe sayThe release of the emails over the weekend however raised new questions among government and private sector security officialsIts possible that other hackers took advantage of the DNCs vulnerabilities and also stole information US officials said But the intrusion so far appears to bear the hallmarks of a Russian intelligence operationForeign spy agencies routinely try to collect information on US elections and there were some cyber attacks against political campaigns detected during the 2012 election cycleTypically spy agencies collect such information to try to better inform their governments about US politics US spy agencies do the same overseasRussian spy agencies have published embarrassing information to try to influence political events in countries they consider part of their sphere of influence But to publicly release vast troves of stolen data to try to influence a US election is beyond the scale of what US counterintelligence officials have seenWhether Russian intelligence agencies provided the stolen information to Wikileaks either directly or through middlemen is now a top issue for US investigators to resolve the US officials briefed on the probe say The answer wont likely come until well after the electionThe impact of the release of the DNC hacked emails was almost immediate prompting the ouster of the head of one of the two major political partiesSince the hackers were in the DNC systems for about a year US officials expect more data releases
