In todays 25th Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails one of the notable highlights is a March 2 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says On another matterand not to sound like Lanny but we are going to have to dump all those emails The email which may indicate intent  was sent just days before the NYT story revealing the existence of Hillarys email server and Hillarys press conference addressing what was at the time the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account and server in her homeMills response Think you just got your new nick nameIt is unclear which Lanny is referred to the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail or more likely Lanny Davis  special counsel to President Bill Clinton and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaignfinance investigations and other legal issuesIt is also unclear for now which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread but Podesta adds better to do so sooner than later We can hope that a subsequent response yet to be leaked by Wikileaks will provide more colorIf the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted personal emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI investigationThis is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emailsAnd in a separate email sent out just days later by Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didnt know Hillary was using a private email addressSuggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric They know POTUS and HRC emailed  Josh has been asked about that Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email so his answer to press was that he would not commentconfirm I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinets email addressesPerhaps while the DOJFBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedins emails it can also take a repeat look at some of these especially the ones involving POTUS Delivered by The Daily Sheeple We encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  Click for details  Contributed by Zero Hedge of wwwzerohedgecom
