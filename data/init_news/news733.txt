 Bernie Sanders BernieSanders October 27 2016 If you dont have the guts to run for office on your ideas realDonaldTrump  then you shouldnt run for office at all  Bernie Sanders BernieSanders October 27 2016 Sen Sanders was correct Elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future However the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts and hopes for visions Trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office The media will never say it but real candidates for office dont try to win by discouraging people from voting The best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process Bernie Sanders gets it Donald Trump never will
