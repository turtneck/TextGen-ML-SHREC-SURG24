I hope you realize the irony of what shes doing Paul Czisny a Wisconsin delegate for Bernie Sanders said nodding his head backward at a young woman in the stands a piece of white tape across her mouth that said in stark black letters SILENCED Periodically she stood up and photographers rushed over camera shutters whirring to snap her admittedly very dramatic portraitShes able to vote shes able to get elected as a delegate shes able to come here Czisny rolled his eyes Hes as pissed off as anyone about the business of the Democratic National Committee emailsit just feeds the frustrations of the Bernie peoplebut he was frustrated with people like that young woman Unfortunately all theyre doing is aiding the Trump camp he said Virtually no one heremeaning the Bernie delegatesis going to vote for Trump but will they stay home Will they vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party I find this maddening because weve seen this movie before and if we think Bush was a disaster Trump will be an even bigger disasterLike the other Bernie supporters in the Wisconsin delegation he doesnt love Hillary Clinton but he would do the adult thing and vote for her come November Because Im not selfish says 22yearold Bernie activist Hailey Storsved who led the student movement for Sanders at her university Its kind of like saying Im taking my ball and going homeMonday nights Democratic National Convention felt at times like an unsettled argumenta restive Sanders contingent looking for opportunities to boo the primary opponent hed been railing against for months and boo everyone shed invited to support her But a big part of the argument was underway within the Sanders camp itself How long to hold out against your own partys nominee This is politics after all At what point did principle become a kind of vanityI tried to talk to the young woman with the tape over her mouth but she refused to communicate silenced as she was Instead she showed me a Facebook post she wrote The DNC is threatening that they might pull my credentials if I dont take this off she wrote of her mouth tape Her name is Angie Aker They want to truly silence me They dont even want me to have this much free speechA followup question about who she was and why she felt silenced resulted in her showing me her screen another Facebook post FOR THE MEDIA LOOKING FOR CONTEXT ON MY SILENCED CRY FOR HELP the establishment wants us to lie for them and say we are behind Hillary when its clear there hasnt even been a fair primary she wrote Im desperate to show somehow its not trueThen she ran out of Facebook posts to show me and commandeered my notepad to scribble me notes like a modern Beethoven Everyone has to vote their conscience she wrote echoing Ted Cruz at last weeks Republican convention I dont know who Ill vote for But I know I wont cast my vote out of fear anymoreWere talking about the political maturation of leftwing politics said Peter Rickman a young man leading the Wisconsin delegation a longtime leftwing activist and a Sanders supporter He was going to get behind Clinton rallying fellow Bernieites to her side because as he said We dont need to love Hillary but we need to mobilize so that after November were fighting for a progressive agenda under a Clinton White House and not being on the defensive in a protofascist regime When I asked him about the silenced woman in his delegation he too rolled his eyes at Aker He leaned in conspiratorially She runs Upworthy he said referring to the social media site Soon someone is going to put two and two together that shes just doing this to get personal attention Aker actually works in video licensing for the siteThere was a periodic booing from behind the very polite and very pragmatic Wisconsin delegation most of whom seemed at peace with the need to vote for Clinton in the fall Oh thats not us one of them told me Thats New MexicoUp a few rows was the New Mexico delegation which was in the thick of a civil warNo never said a young man named Rusty Pearce a Sanders delegate from the state This is a political revolution and a political revolution doesnt just stopWe will continue to work to elect progressives up and down the ticket said a freckled middleaged woman named Nicole Renee Peters She also wasnt voting for Hillary Im not for Hillary and Im not for Trump she said defiantly I will never vote for Hillary Most of their state delegation they both told me confidently was for Sanders and felt the same wayUnfortunately thats not true chimed in an older woman named Theresa Trujeque standing next to me with a Hillary sign The majority is for Hillary Twentyfour delegates out of 43 were for HillaryThats with the superdelegates Peters and Pearce interjectedAfter some squabbling and eyerolling at meCan you believe her Can you believe these twothey agreed that there were 18 delegates for Hillary and 16 for BernieTheyve been telling us to shut up all day Peters complained to meTheyve been fighting and booing all day Trujeque complained to meTheyve been fighting with the poor delegates with Indiana Trujeque scolded Its not respectableWell I dont find it respectable that Hillary Clinton lied under oathIve been involved in the Democratic Party for years and theres no fraud no corruption we take care of everyone Some people have never been involvedIve been involved for many yearsThats because Ive lived in New Mexico for almost a whole yearWell then dont try to change us New MexicansThe Bernie people told me elaborate tales of how the DNC outfoxed and cheated them at every turnand there were very many turns so many we had to keep going over them for clarity until they pointed defiantly to a young man the communications director for the New Mexico delegation eyeing them nervously Hes going to take our credentials away as soon as this interview is over one of them said It was the first the young man named Joe Kaburek heard of it We need to do a better job of talking to them he said diplomaticallyIn Cleveland a Cruz underground refused to concede and get behind the partys nominee and their candidate gave them the satisfaction of a principled last stand He refused to endorse a man they loathed with every fiber of their being In Philadelphia the Bernie holdouts had no such luck Their man endorsed a woman they loathe with every fiber of their being and asked them to vote for her in November Instead of getting booed like Cruz they were the ones doing the booing They booed Lilly Ledbetter they booed Cory Booker and they managed to refrain from booing Michelle Obama When Elizabeth Warren spoke the Bernie holdouts of Michigan sat there in grim anger arms crossed fake birds pinned to their hats They liked Warren but didnt like that she was selling out to Hillary Not for sale some of them yelledWhen Bernie emerged on stage they screamed his name and his slogansThis is what democracy looks like Many of them cried and refused to believe it was over Its not over some of them shouted Nooooo others hollered Up and down this Midwestern section Bernie supporters who so reviled superdelegates were praying for them to see the light and switch to Bernies side Tuesday thereby annulling the popular vote of the Democratic primary which had not been in their favor You never know how many people have turned since WikiLeaks one Michigan delegate told the correspondent of Michigan Radio She held out hope that Tuesdays vote would tilt toward BernieAre you going to vote for Hillary in November the reporter asked herIm voting for Bernie tomorrow she said defiantly He asked us to vote for him tomorrowHe also asked for you to vote for Hillary in November the reporter pressedNearby a schoolteacher named Tammy Lewis sat weeping softly Well never have a chance like this again she said dabbing her dark eyes with a white tissue Her husband she said was a NAFTA victim and she wasnt about to let TPP destroy her family a second time But she was at a loss after Bernies speech Hes doing what he has to do she said with a melancholy admiration He knows he has to stop Trump Hes a good manIm voting for Bernie tomorrow thats what I came here to do she said with a quiet sadness Would she vote for Hillary in the fall as Bernie had asked of her Maybe she said lost I dont know I know I have to stop Trump too But the choice is either I press the pause button or go back in time with Trump She rose to leave and wiped her eyesIts not what I wanted she said and left the hall
