There is no denying it Climatechange deniers are in retreatWhat began as a subtle shift away from the claim that manmade global warming is not a threat to the planet has lately turned into a stampede The latest attempt to deny denial comes from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council a powerful group that pushes for states to pass laws that are often drafted by industry As my Post colleagues Tom Hamburger Joby Warrick and Chris Mooney report ALEC is not only insisting that it doesnt deny climate change  its threatening to sue those who suggest otherwiseThe group which suffered the highly visible defection of Google because of its globalwarming stance and an exodus of other top corporate members sent letters to Common Cause and the League of Conservation Voters instructing them to remove all false or misleading material alleging ALEC questions globalwarming theoryThe problem for ALEC is that as recently as 2013 it was still reaffirming model legislation calling on states to consider legitimate and scientifically defensible alternative hypotheses to the mainstream scientific positions on climate The proposed legislation states that there is a great deal of scientific uncertainty about the matter and suggests states treat possible beneficial effects of carbon in an evenhanded mannerThe turnabout at ALEC follows an aboutface at the Heartland Institute a libertarian outfit that embraces a description of it as the worlds most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about manmade climate changeBut on Christmas Eve Justin Haskins a blogger and editor at Heartland penned an article for the conservative journal Human Events declaring The real debate is not whether man is in some way contributing to climate change its true that the science is settled on that point in favor of the alarmistsHaskins called it a rather extreme position to say that we ought to allow dangerous pollutants to destroy the only planet we know of that can completely sustain human life and he suggested work on technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions without destroying whole economiesTo be sure this is a tactical retreat and you shouldnt expect conservative groups to start lining up in favor of a carbon tax Rather theyre resorting to more defensible arguments that dont make them sound like flatearthers My Post colleagues quoted energy lobbyist Scott Segal saying that the science issue just isnt as salient as it once was Instead Segal talks about the cost and viability of proposed regulationsIts likely no coincidence that the shift is occurring as the Obama administration approaches a June target to finalize rules on powerplant emissions Those who oppose regulation are wise to abandon a position that holds little public appeal a healthy majority of Americans accept that global warming is real and a New York Times poll earlier this year found that even half of Republicans support government action to address itMore and more conservative officeholders are embracing the I am not a scientist agnosticism on climate change rather than skepticism Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell House Speaker John Boehner and presidential candidates Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio have adopted this response and Rubio has joined Mitt Romney and Chuck Grassley in embracing the less assailable position that US efforts to restrict carbon are pointless without similar efforts across the globeCertainly figures such as Senate Environment Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe who calls manmade warming a hoax and presidential candidate Ted Cruz who fancies himself a modernday Galileo opposing the globalwarming alarmists are not about to change But as corporations abandon the untenable position of denial ideologues will be forced to do the sameAs my Post colleagues noted Southern Co an operator of coalfired power plants decided to drop funding for a Smithsonian scientist who challenged climatechange theory but failed to disclose that his work was funded by fossilfuel interests ALECs declining skepticism also comes as even oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and BP quit the groupAt ALECs December meeting a climatechange contrarian got applause for declaring in his presentation that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant It is a benefit It is the very elixir of lifeFor politicians and climatedenial groups the elixir of life is money Now that corporations are becoming reluctant to bankroll crazy theories the surrender of climatechange deniers will followRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
