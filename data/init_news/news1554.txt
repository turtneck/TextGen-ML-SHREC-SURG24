 Russophobia War Party PropagandaThe worlds most reactionary regime the headchopping terrorsponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council while Russia has been kicked out The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the USled war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria The War Party is on the march to the cheers of corporate media  and Hillary hasnt even been elected yetBy Margaret Kimberley All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the US and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian peopleNovember 06 2016  Information Clearing House    BAR   Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion Is Russia entering its 20th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rightsThe dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against RussiaNearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration It isnt clear if Clinton and the rest of the wouldbe warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contraryThe unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity The usual suspects are helping out eagerly The corporate media led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post  are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victimRussia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500000 Syrian deaths The Saudis are causing dislocation death and starvation in Yemen too but they are American allies so there is little opposition to their misdeedsThe openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more usefulThe United States and its allies are the cause of Syrias destruction Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years They even made overtures to negotiate Assads fate with the United States All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the US and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldnt know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population The bloodshed was made in the US and could end if this government wanted it toThe antiRussian propaganda effort has worked to perfection NATO is massing troops on Russias borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hellThere is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more muscular foreign policy That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless warsThe United States is the most dangerous country in the world If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency If the role of villain is cast on the world stage she is the star of the showMargaret Kimberleys
