Orlando Florida CNN They get the bronze medal every four years in what is really a twoperson raceThats what it must feel like to be a thirdparty candidate in a twoparty countryBut between Donald Trumps abrupt takeover of the GOP and Bernie Sanders climb from longshot Democratic candidacy to head of a national progressive movement 2016 has been a year for party outsiders And Libertarians hope that could give them an openingWhat gives them hopeThe likely Democratic and Republican nominees each have historically high unfavorable numbers  Media attention for the party both the national committee chairman and the partys political director say is at unprecedented levelsSo it is with an air of opportunity to break out of obscurity that Libertarians members of the countrys most prominent third party have gathered for their national convention in Orlando Florida this weekend to officially pick a candidate to pitch to angry votersMany expect former New Mexico Gov Gary Johnson the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2012 to leave Orlando Sunday evening once again his partys standardbearerSince last week Johnson has made the rounds touting his newly minted alliance with former Massachusetts Gov Bill Weld who is seeking the partys vice presidential nomination The two former governors who both also happen to be exRepublicans are fielding a ticket of sorts although the Libertarians elect their nominees separately and no formal ticket will exist at the convention until the party selects its presidential and vice presidential nomineesBut Johnson and Weld first have to navigate an openly hostile convention characterized by its insular proceedings and unwelcome to moderatesWeld will have to overcome meaningful differences between his demonstrated policy preferences particularly past support for gun control measures and his willingness to support Republican politicians Just this year the colorful former governor endorsed Ohio Gov John Kasich for presidentHis supposed transgressions from Libertarian orthodoxy have earned him outright disdain from many of the partys attendees He received loud boos at his introduction to the partys vice presidential debate where he stuck to reciting his conservative bona fides and applauded his opponents on stageWe are not Republicanlight Larry Sharpe a vicepresidential candidate said in a takedown of the JohnsonWeld ticket mere inches away from the former Massachusetts governorAsked after the debate Weld said he thought such attacks were not an issue one way or anotherDespite his bruising reception Johnson said he would strongly prefer not to continue his bid without Weld arguing they were arguably the two most Libertarian governors that ever servedWeld doubled down on this kind of rhetoric at the convention saying that should Trump win the presidency We will be the rogue nation We will be the North KoreaJohnson meanwhile has several serious challengers gunning for the top spot on the thirdparty ticketAmong them is Austin Petersen a young hardcore party advocate with strong backing in Libertarian Internet circles He recently announced the endorsement of Mary Matalin and Erick Erickson vocal antiTrump conservativesPetersen rolled through the convention gladhanding delegates and circling back to his opendoor suite filled with meatballs and alcohol for supporters He belted out insults for Trump calling him Cheetosfaced and fascist as his supporters who he called freedom ninjas hollered in supportHowever in a party that generally swings liberal on social issues Petersen is unabashedly antiabortion He is also 35 years oldAlso expected to post significant support is notorious entrepreneur John McAfee a man who has forged an international identity after becoming a pioneer in the field of cybersecurity Last fall McAfee launched a presidential bid under the banner of his newly formed political organization the Cyber Party As the fall continued McAfee declared his intention to seek the nomination of the Libertarian PartyBuilding off of his name his intense personality and his sweeping command of Libertarian sweet spots McAfee has made a serious bid for the top of the ticketAlthough McAfee has little history with the party and no experience governing his controversies  including going into hiding following the shooting death of a businessman near his island compound in Belize  and his lack of political experience may actually make up for it In an election cycle dominated by a brash billionaire and reality TV star McAfees libidinous shadowy drugfueled history and cavalier demeanor occasionally might not hurt much in a party built on opposing government controlThe primary has become somewhat contentious and McAfee has repeatedly said that he will not support Johnson if the former New Mexico becomes the nomineePetersen said he would pull it for Gary if the former New Mexico governor won the nomination Weld said he wasnt sure what hed do if Johnson was not the nomineeIm in this because of Gary Johnson Weld saidThe Libertarian nominee will appear in ballots in 50 states butOf course securing the nomination is only one step  and an extremely easy one relatively speaking  on the path to a Libertarian presidencyThe eventual nominee whoever it is will have to compete in the general election where the odds of victory for the Libertarian Party stand at roughly zeroIf that performance repeats itself in the 2016 general election it will mark the 12th cycle in a row where no third party has earned a single vote in the Electoral CollegeCompared to other years and other third parties however the Libertarians have plenty to feel good about The Libertarian Party has navigated the multitude of onerous requirements for ballot access in all 50 states a task unaccomplished by any other third partyPut more simply the Libertarian nominee will be the only name outside of the mainstream choices on the presidential ballot in all 50 states on November 8On the ballot but not the debate stageJohnson echoing many other thirdparty candidates regularly stresses the Libertarian Partys need to join the presidential debates Inclusion in the presidential debates requires strong poll performance which of course requires inclusion in the polls themselvesFrom the Never Trump crowd to the nascent Bernie or bust movement the eventual Libertarian nominee might have room to grow a base and shake up the already volatile presidential race
