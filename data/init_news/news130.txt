Two days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in remote West Texas a former DC homicide commander is raising questions about how the death was handled by local and federal authoritiesAs a former homicide commander I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia William O Ritchieformer head of criminal investigations for DC police wrotein a post on Facebook on SundayThe death of Antonin Scalia Chaos confusion and conflicting reportsScalia was found dead in his room at a luxury hunting resort in the states Big Bend region by the resorts owner It took hours for authorities to find a justice of the peace When they did Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body  which is permissible under Texas law  and without ordering an autopsyOn Sunday the US Marshals Service which provides security for Supreme Court justices said that Scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch so marshals were not present when he died When the marshals were notified deputy marshals from the Western District of Texas went to the scene the service said in a statementGuevara said she declared Scalia dead based on information from law enforcement officials on the scene who assured her that there were no signs of foul play She also spoke to Scalias doctor who told her that the justice had been to see him Wednesday and Thursday last week for a shoulder injury and that hehad ordered an MRI for Scalia according toWFAATV in DallasThe 79yearold justice also suffered from several chronic conditions Guevara saidShe said she was awaiting a statement from the physicianto complete Scaliasdeath certificateThe manager of the El Paso funeral home that handled Scalias body said Scalias family insisted on not having an autopsy done But the decision has spawned a host of conspiracy theories online as well as skeptical questions from law enforcement experts such asRitchieYou have a Supreme Court Justice who died not in attendance of a physician he wrote You have a nonhomicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction Why not a cerebral hemorrhageIn an interview with The Washington Post Guevara has said she rebutted a report by a Dallas TV station that Scalia had died of myocardial infarction She said she meant only that his heart had stoppedRitchie also raised questions about the marshals actionsHow can the Marshal say without a thorough post mortem that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack Did the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in TexasA spokesman for the marshals service said Monday that the marshals did not make a formal determination of death He directed questions to the county judge who made the callScalias physicianBrian Monahan is a US Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the US Congress and Supreme Court He declined to comment on Scalias health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in MarylandPatient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject he saidWhen asked whetherhe planned to make public the statement hes preparing for Guevara Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporterEva Ruth Moravec in Austin contributed to this reportThis post has been updatedWhy blocking Obamas pick could backfire on RepublicansSupreme Court nomination process sure to be epic debate
