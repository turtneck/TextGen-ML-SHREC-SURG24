For months Hillary Rodham Clintons presidential campaign labored listlessly under a cloud of doubt after revelations that she had a private email server during her time as secretary of stateThen Republicans as they so often do overreached on their Clinton attacks and handed the Democratic frontrunner a message and momentum that she had struggled mightily to build on her ownFirst Rep Kevin McCarthy RCalif went on Fox News and floundering to prove his conservative bona fides to be speaker of the House said this to Fox News host Sean Hannity Everybody thought that Hillary Clinton was unbeatable right But we put together a Benghazi special committee a select committee What are her numbers today Her numbers are droppingThen there was the hearing last week  more than two years in the making Clinton last testified before Congress on Benghazi in January 2013  that flopped mightily for Republicans Eleven hours worth of questions left the GOP looking small and Clinton looking calm cool and collected Even Rep Trey Gowdy RSC chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi admitted in the hearings wake I dont know that Clinton testified that much differently today than she has the previous time she testifiedFor longtime Clinton watchers  and I count myself in that category  the pattern was remarkably familiar Republicans handed a potent issue and the controversy over Clintons private email server is one try to knock the Clintons out and instead swing miss and fall on their collective faceThink back to the late 1990s when after admitting to an extramarital affair with a White House intern Bill Clinton found himself more popular than ever  particularly among Democrats  after congressional Republicans tried to impeach him despite the publics skepticism about whether such a punishment was warrantedEerie similarities echo between that moment and this one for Republicans in Congress Unquestionably the revelation that Clinton exclusively used a private email address and server while she was the nations top diplomat had damaged her frontrunning campaign for the Democratic nomination Her lead over Sen Bernie Sanders IVt had shrunk and large majorities of the public said she was neither honest nor trustworthyMost important for Clinton was that establishment Democrats began to openly fret that perhaps she simply wasnt up to the race and that someone else  such as Vice President Biden  needed to step into the breachMcCarthys comments provided Clinton with overwhelming proof at least to Democrats that the Benghazi committee was effectively political theater designed to damage her chances of winning in 2016The hearing itself allowed Clinton a platform that was perfectly suited to her strengths  preparation and a remarkable tirelessness  and on which she unsurprisingly shined Clinton looked in control poised and smart The majority of her Republican interrogators looked outmatchedDemocrats noticed The hour after the end of the committee hearing  9pm to 10pm Eastern time Thursday  was the most lucrative 60 minutes of fundraising in Clintons campaignAnd suddenly Clinton wasnt the boring candidate of the status quo anymore She was the target of  wait for it  a vast rightwing conspiracy aimed at yet again playing politics in hopes of hurting her chances of being elected to officeThe campaign is  and this is so obvious that it is probably not worth saying  far from over The Iowa caucuses arent for about 100 more days and the general election is a year away Lots can and will changeIt is also obvious that the past two weeks have been the best two weeks of Clintons campaign She has gone from flagging frontrunner to rejuvenated fighter  a much better look if you want to you know winNot all of the Clinton renaissance can be credited to or blamed on Republicans Her strong performance in the first Democratic presidential debate was all her doing and Bidens decision not to run seems only tangentially tied to her strengthening of lateBut the Clintons have always been at their best when under fire from the other side Hillary Clinton in particular is a better counterpuncher than a firststrike playerFor some reason Republicans have never learned that lesson Over the past month they have pulled off a trick that Clinton never could seem to do herself They have turned her into a sympathetic and more appealing figure for Democrats and lots of independents  whom she will need in a general electionIf she wins the White House in November 2016 Clinton should send thankyou notes to McCarthy Gowdy and the rest of the House Republicans They may have saved her candidacy
