Print It looks like the vaunted air space coordination between the US and Russia in Syria isnt producing a safe flying environment US officials said Friday that a Russian fighter flew dangerously close to a US warplane in eastern Syria on 17 October  something that cant possibly be unavoidable in light of the prior agreement by Russia and the US in 2015 to deconflict air operations there The AFP report provides this description The near miss occurred late on October 17 when a Russian jet that was escorting a larger spy plane manoeuvred in the vicinity of an American warplane Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigan said The Russian jet came to inside of half a mile he added Another US military official speaking on condition of anonymity said the American pilot could feel the turbulence produced by the Russian jets engines It was close enough you could feel the jet wash of the plane passing by the official said It appeared the Russian pilot had simply not seen the US jet as it was dark and the planes were flying without lights I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together Harrigan said One is tempted to go heavy on the sarcasm in response to that But OK AFP offers a bit of analysis The incident raises serious questions about the extent to which pilots are able to track the complex airspace they operate in Well sort of Basically there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space  and thats your problem right there Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that US systems can interpret and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia Looking at the air commandcontrol assets that seem to be available for operations there shouldnt have to be a safety or awareness issue at least not during planned air strike and air support operations When they have aircraft operating both coalitions Russian and US have the technical means to maintain good finegrain air pictures in the area in question The general area the encounter occurred in can be inferred from where the US coalition conducted air strikes on 17 October  See map Locations of coalition air strikes in Syria on 17 Oct 2016 The locations at Ayn Isa Abu Kamal Al Shaddadi and possibly Palmyra could qualify as eastern Syria the region reported for the close air encounter If the Russian fighter was escorting the Tu214R the night Russian commanders expected to see ISIS fighters making their way into Syria the easternmost area where AlShaddadi and Abu Kamal  or AlBukamal  are located would be the most likely Google map author annotation The Russians have their S300 and S400 radars and command vehicles along with the radars and command center of the Syrian national system Russia has also operated the A50 Mainstay AWACS over Syria since December 2015 although theres no way to know if it was operating on 17 October The A50 isnt forwardbased in Syria but rather operates out of Mozdok in southern Russia It may well have been operating that night given the other things going on The US coalition has E2C Hawkeyes from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower CVN69 airwing which come up from the Persian Gulf to support operations in both northern Iraq and eastern Syria VAW123 Screwtops tighten up an E2C Hawkeye to support OperationInherentResolve

which has been in the Eastern Mediterranean  and flying its airwing over Syria since September Its not clear where Charles de Gaulle s E2Cs are flying but they are capable of providing interlocking air space coverage with Ike s E2Cs when both are airborne French carrier FS Charles de Gaulle File image via Le Parisien Working with de Gaulle on 17 October were also two destroyers USS Ross DDG71 and FS Chevalier Paul  one or both of which would have been able to track Russian aircraft to some distance inland over Syria Their moreconstant but less extensive air pictures would complement and enhance that of the airborne Hawkeyes These operationallevel assets keeping up an area air picture supplement the onscene information an individual aircraft has from its own radar system as well as enabling the air defense commandcontrol platform to keep each aircraft under combat direction At the time of the encounter US and French systems had the ability to know where Russian aircraft were even if the Russians had to be identified by default rather than by positive confirmation from Identification Friend or Foe IFF The Russians recall up in the Baltic have been going out of their way to not squawk IFF in good faith where NATO systems can detect it They presumably reserve the right to behave the same way over Syria From what US officials have sometimes been careful not to say it sounds to me like thats what theyre doing That said there arent so darn many unidentified aircraft zorching around over Syria at 500 knots that it would have to take very long to know youve got either a Russian or a Syrian jet fighter Russian systems also had the ability to know where US coalition aircraft were on 17 October Its not credible to claim that they had no awareness And they probably had the IFF codes of those aircraft and knew whose they were since the coalition is presumably squawking as per normal The incredibility of the claim that the Russian aircraft couldnt see the US warplane is compounded by the fact that the Russian fighter was said to be escorting a large spy plane This was probably the Tu214R  Russias newest uniquely capable airborne ISR platform with a sensor suite somewhat similar to the US E8 JSTARS If the Russian fighter escort really didnt know that a US fighter was within weapons range of the spy plane the fighter pilots head should have been delivered on a platter 15 minutes after he got back on the ground The search sector of his radar isnt an issue Hes getting paid to make it comprehensive maneuvering as necessary while hes up their escorting a highvalue asset The fighter plane was probably an Su30SM using a Bars N011M series radar system incidentally So it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe that the close encounter the night of 17 October occurred because of any inadequacy in system capability The dangerously inadequate coordination arrangements the US is tolerating are the real issue I suspect A couple of points about those arrangements One lets review the assessment from earlier again Basically there are two separate networks exercising command and control over the same air space  and thats your problem right there Add to it the likelihood that the Russians are not squawking IFF in a way that US systems can interpret and you have the potential for a nice fecal focaccia This is the situation when two hostile forces are operating in the same air space Another word for that is combat Theres no political will for combat between the two forces in question of course But the mechanical arrangements of military operations in the battle space dont reflect that Its an incredibly stupid situation Two the close encounter occurred at an interesting time ie the second night of the ground assault on Mosul  which started on Sunday 16 October The US had been striking targets around Mosul for about three days at that point and had started pounding ISIS positions on the outskirts of Mosul with artillery late Saturday or early Sunday according to local sources Russia at the time was playing up a noncredible report that the US planned to let thousands of ISIS fighters leave Mosul and move into Syria  implicitly to fight Syrian regime forces and thwart the intentions of the Russian coalition Trying to track such a stream of guerrilla evacuees if the Russians really believed their own hype would have been an ideal mission for the Tu214R spy plane One more significant thing was happening at exactly the same time A NATO AWACS contingent was deploying to Turkey to support the US coalition in Syria and Iraq Russia opposes that move Although the NATO AWACS hadnt flown a mission yet its first mission was three days later on 20 October The Russians knew it was there in Turkey setting up for operations In other theaters Russia has been signaling dissatisfaction through dangerous unsafe military encounters for many months now We can conclude with strong confidence that thats what has happened in Syria We can expect it to happen again
