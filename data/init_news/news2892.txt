One might have expected the Great Whitebread Hope to be a little better prepared  or at least be politically skilled enough  not to come right out and say Im going to punt on that one It was amateur hour to say the least Still he may have been more skilled than people gave him credit for Walker showed that he understands the Republican base far better than the likes of George Will who said on Fox News last week that press questions about evolution are a standard way of trying to embarrass Republicans  We should be able to come to terms with the fact when asked about evolution you say yes And if one syllable of one word is not enough say Paleontology Everything says evolution is a fact Get over itThe sad fact is that polling shows fewer and fewer Republicans believe in evolutionEvolution has become the religion of the elite Its a religion to the level of fanaticism of what they would say was the people at the Scopes monkey trial the Christians waving their Bibles who were not really thinking through the facts they were just outraged because it was against Gods law The truth of the matter is that the evolutionists like George Will waving their evolutionary theory have become as rabid and unreasoned as what they accuse the Scopes monkey religionists of doing to Darwin during that time It has become a religion Science has disproven so much of evolution These guys are wrong Scott Walker is rightIts unclear to what shes referring when she asserts that science has disproved evolution but its a clever idea that explains how Scott Walkers followup comments on Twitter might make sense to the creationist base of the GOPBut whats politically important here isnt the science vs faith issue Its what Rios says about elitism Laura Ingraham explained it best in her 2004 bookShut Up and SingIt was Southern religiosity that led to one of the most vicious literary assaults on any single group in American History HL Mencken became a hero to generations of elites through his newspaper reporting on the Scopes Monkey Trial Uninterested in the subtleties of the debate over evolution  completely indifferent to the concerns of those who felt their traditional religious teaching to be in danger from teachers who despised them and their culture  Mencken gleefully seized upon the case to mock and ridicule everything he could find in the South We owe the popularization of the phrase white trash to Mencken He also coined the phrase Bible Belt to describe the bigoted South In true elite fashion Mencken approved of the elitist antebellum South of the slaveholders but couldnt stand the postwar South where power had devolved to the despised white trashBelieving in evolution therefore is an outgrowth of reverse racism against saltoftheearth white Southerners and a sign of liberal solidarity with the elite antebellum slaveholders You have to give her credit for pulling that bizarre rationale for rejecting evolution together After all its not really religion that holds the GOP base together its a sense of victimization And this thesis weaves a number of important strands into a colorful if ahistorical tapestryIt presents a bit of a problem for conservative leaders however As you can see from Rios unhappiness at George Wills forthright support for evolution people who actually believe in science as its understood by scientists anyway are considered traitors to the cause And most of them are less willing than Will to buck the victimization creedGeorge W Bush famously equivocatedby saying the jury is still out adding Id make it a goal to make sure that local folks got to make the decision as to whether or not they said creationism has been a part of our history and whether or not people ought to be exposed to different theories as to how the world was formedA few years back Ben Adler at the New Republicquizzed a group of leading conservative intellectualsand commentators about evolution and their fevered dance of denial was worthy of Katy Perrys dancing shark troupe at the 2015 Super Bowl Here are a few examples Whether he personally believes in evolution I dont discuss personal opinions  Im familiar with whats obviously true about it as well as whats problematic  Im not a scientist  Its like me asking you whether you believe in the Big Bang How evolution should be taught in public schools I managed to have my children go through the Fairfax Virginia schools without ever looking at one of their science textbooks Whether he personally believes in evolution Ive never understood how an eye evolves What he thinks of intelligent design Put me down for the intelligent design people How evolution should be taught in public schools The real problem here is that you shouldnt have governmentrun schools  Given that we have to spend all our time crushing the capital gains tax I dont have much time for this issue Whether he personally believes in evolution I do believe in evolution What he thinks of intelligent design If intelligent design means that evolution occurs under some divine guidance I believe that How evolution should be taught in public schools I dont believe that anything that offends ninetenths of the American public should be taught in public schools  Christianity is the faith of ninetenths of the American public  I dont believe that public schools should embark on teaching anything that offends Christian principle Whether he personally believes in evolution Its impossible to answer that question with a simple yes or no Whether he personally believes in evolution Do I believe in absolute evolution No I dont believe that evolution can explain the creation of matter  Do I believe in Darwinian evolution The answer is no  Evolution has been so powerful a theory in Western history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and often a malevolent forceits been used by nonChristians and antiChristians to justify polices which have been horrendous I do believe that every American student should be introduced to the idea and its effects on society But I dont think it ought to be taught as fact It ought to be taught as theory  How do you answer a kid who says Where did we all come from Do you say We all evolved I think thats a theory  Now the biblical story of creation should be taught to children not as dogma but every child should know first of all the famous biblical stories because they have had a tremendous influence as well  I dont think it should be taught as religion to kids who dont wanna learn it  I think in biology that honest teachers gotta say Look the universe exhibits betrays the idea that there is a first mover that there is intelligent design  You should leave the teaching of religion to a voluntary classes in my judgment and only those who wish to attend If a Republican politician wants to go straight to the rightwing heart on this issue he would say what presidential hopefulMike Huckabee saidwith just the right amount of smug insider wingnut humor If you want to believe that you and your family came from apes thats fine Ill accept that I just dont happen to think that I did Thats the kind of statement that will elicit cheers from your GOP base and make the likes of Laura Ingraham applaud wildly Unfortunately it wont carry much beyond Menckens loathed Bible Belt or rightwing radioIt needs to be massaged into something much more anodyne with a dog whistle embedded within it And once he was briefed by his handlers Walker toed the required line quite well Its a sign of his familiarity with social conservative language that he understands if nobody in the punditocracy does that its better to punt than get it wrong He knows hell never get past Iowa if he does
