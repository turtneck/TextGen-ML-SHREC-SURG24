11 Stupid Things Voxcoms Matthew Yglesias Has Said By Aaron Bandler October 26 2016 Matt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30000 tweets yesterday Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations Fortunately the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly Here are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 1 Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare That is until he didnt  mattyglesias Obamacare marker  which was solid as of 15 minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercoma0EyXImI8g  Omri Ceren cerenomri October 26 2016 His 2013 piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when Obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten In other words Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent 2 Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal R In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted Yglesias wrote Is Bobby Jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping Yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting Oh fun Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode Eventually Yglesias backed down tweeting For the record now that I know more about Jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff The irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter Good thing you dont say dumb stuff MT mattyglesias Its clear that Jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon June 18 2013 3 Yglesias once ranted against dumb Jewish politicians The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled Dumb Jewish Politicians in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait who wrote in the New Republic that thenSen Joe Lieberman ICT had to be stupid for not supporting the public option I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers Chait wrote Trust me its not true If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot With Lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan I think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn Yglesias agreed Ive long held a related theory about Eric Cantor Anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend Theres a whole bunchBoxer Cardin Feingold Feinstein Franken Kohl Lautenberg Levin Lieberman Sanders Schumer Specter and Wyden Its a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted 4 Yglesias advocated for ending time zones Seriously In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled The case against time zones Theyre impractical  outdated Yglesias pontificated Northern Idaho is connected via I90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west but not to Boise to its south so the Couer dAlene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time Yet while these zigzags and 30minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones The need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois Central Time rather than Indianapolis Eastern Time But the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations Its to shift the world to one giant time zone Ygleasias then called for One time to rule them alla phrase that prompted JRR Tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy If the whole world used a single GMTbased time schedules would still vary In general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out So at 2300 most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office But of course Londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap The difference from today is that if you were putting together a LondonLA conference call at 2100 thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal A flight that leaves New York at 1400 and lands in Paris at 2000 is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones If your appointment is in El Paso at 1130 you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of Texas Pejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesiass time zone piece was writing at Ricochet  I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them Dont the people at Vox have anything better to write about Apparently they dont 5 Yglesias doesnt understand Floridas geography very well Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007 in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami Id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know Yglesias said People immediately pointed the obvious answer Miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is The Everglades National Parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish Yes yes commenters I know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in Florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update Except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  Maybe Yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 6 Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government For better or for worse thats politics Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress  On Twitter Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes And yet Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter Yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch22 when he told the Daily Caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident 7 Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate The Federalist s Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was producing the highest quality care in the country Their turnaround points the way toward solving Americas healthcare crisis Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013 Will Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans This tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the VA has caused 307000 veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 8 Yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the Senate Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009 per the Guardian  If you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska one from South Dakota one from New Hampshire two from Maine two from Idaho two from Nebraska one from Nevada two from Utah two from Kansas two from Mississippi one from Iowa two from Oklahoma two from Kentucky one from Louisiana two from South Carolina and two from Alabama the 28 of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator 1198 percent of the American population Meanwhile Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 1195 percent of the American population Now of course Texas is also a big state though at 781 percent of the population its a lot smaller than California and there are small states like Vermont and North Dakota that have two Democratic Senators So the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just 34 Senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain 6915 percent of the population The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them In three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 9 Yglesias doesnt understand Americas financial system Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were 6891 at the time Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 1 They are poorly managed You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes This doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys It gets worse And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDICensured depositors nobody is watching the store In effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones The dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on Wall Streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems 2 They cant be regulated Since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations And once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation 3 They cant compete If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition Having a large share of Americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance Davis debunked Yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in 2013 Yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks You guys the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America arent the problem Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem Dont worry about the facts Just go with it Davis wrote in The Federalist  Im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 10 Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon After reading a review of a Booker T Washington biography Yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post Its only extremely recently that the idea of an AfricanAmerican aligning himself  la Clarence Thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible But even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist This is patently false as Damon Root explained in Reason  Actually the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuylerwho was known as the black HL Menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene including Schuylers unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen Robert A Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDRs New Deal 11 Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died Following Breitbarts death Yglesias tweeted  Conventions around dead people are ridiculous The world outlook is slightly improved with AndrewBrietbart sic dead This tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible And Slate defended Yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion Apparently Slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities
