Conservative and liberal advocacy groups are gearing up for a ferocious political brawl over President Obamas pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the weekend death of Justice Antonin Scalia and already the battle is spilling from the presidential campaign into some of the nations most hotly contested Senate racesWhite House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz repeated Monday that the president intends to fulfill his constitutional responsibility by nominating a new justice and predicted that Senate Republicans despite their current loud opposition will ultimately hold a confirmation hearing and vote for the nomineeThis is not the first time the Republicans have come out with a lot of bluster only to have reality sink in Schultz said We need a fully staffed Supreme CourtSchultz quoted President Ronald Reagan who pressed for a vote on his Supreme Court nominee Anthony M Kennedy who was confirmed in 1988 Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the peoples business in that crucially important bodyBut across the board Republicans have argued that Obama should allow his successor to make the pick and that they would block any attempt to confirm a new justice this yearWhy blocking Obamas pick could cost Republicans the SenateOne consideration that may force Republicans to recalibrate their strategy is the prospect of political damage to some of the embattled Senate incumbents up for reelection this fall Sens Kelly Ayotte NH Ron Johnson Wis and Rob Portman Ohio all Republicans in swing states have called for the Senate to disregard any Obama nominee Other Republicans in tight races have remained silent so farDemocrats see a potential confirmation battle as an opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive and as a wedge issue that could help them retake control of the Senate In Ohio former Democratic governor Ted Strickland who is vying for his partys nomination to challenge Portman said Monday that by opposing an Obama nominee Portman was failing to do his job shirking his responsibilities to our nation jeopardizing the institutions of our democracy and engaging in exactly the kind of dysfunctional behavior that frustrates Ohioans about CongressPG Sittenfeld a Cincinnati City Council member running against Strickland in the Democratic primary declared Monday that Portman was advocating actions that would put the Senate in violation of both historical precedent and the clear language of the Constitution itselfPortman responded in a statement Monday that the next president should choose Scalias replacement With the election less than nine months away I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations he saidConservative activists are drawing up plans to mobilize support and pressure lawmakers to reject any nomineeFreedomWorks a group that pledges to promote smaller government lower taxes free markets personal liberty and the rule of law said it would wage a grassroots campaign to oppose Democrats who would ram liberal judicial nominees through the Senate  occasionally with the help of unprincipled big government RepublicansCarrie Severino chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas said conservatives are still mourning Scalia But she added if the president tries to pack the court as it is apparent he may then JCN will be leading the charge to delay a Senate vote until the American people decide the next presidentLiberal groups are working hard to undercut the prevailing Republican argument that it is inappropriate for Obama to nominate a Supreme Court justice at this late stage of his presidencyAmericans United for Change a group closely allied with the White House is trumpeting an article written by nowSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy in 1970 McConnell wrote that the Senate should discount the philosophy of the nominee and that the president is presumably elected by the people to carry out a program and altering the ideological direction of the Supreme Court would seem to be a perfectly legitimate part of a presidential platformNan Aron president of the Alliance for Justice said the sudden Supreme Court vacancy has mobilized progressive groups and broadened the coalition usually assembled for nomination fightsWhats unusual about this moment and this effort is that the community as a whole is coming together said Aron whose group focuses on federal judicial nominations In addition to organizations focused on judicial selections others that arent realize whats at stake and are weighing in alreadyMoveOnorg and CREDO Action liberal advocacy groups have launched petitions calling on the Senate to fill Scalias seat As of Monday evening each petition had garnered more than 100000 signaturesPeople close to the administration expect that Obamas choice this time will resemble his earlier onesI think the best way to think about who the president might appoint is to look at who he has appointed said Caroline Fredrickson president of the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy He has picked people who are qualified beyond question and with an eye toward making the court more diverse I think those will be the main touchstonesA person close to the administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect those relationships said the pick is likely to be someone superqualified who had been confirmed by overwhelming majorities of currently sitting Republicans that would make it difficult for the GOP to argue that the nominee is unqualifiedMeanwhile a wall of silence went up Monday around Scalias final hours and the confusion after his death Local officials in rural West Texas where he died spent hours trying to locate a justice of peace after his body was discovered The justice who was eventually found Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead without seeing his body  which is permissible under Texas law  and declined to order an autopsy A second justice has said that one should have been performedScalias family opposed an autopsy and Guevara said Sunday that she determined by telephone that Scalia died of natural causes because he was having health issues She cited information from federal officials at the scene and a conversation she had with Scalias physician She said she was awaiting a statement from the physician to complete the death certificateScalias physician Brian Monahan declined to divulge any details about Scalias health when reached by telephone at his home in Maryland on Monday Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject he said before hanging upJerry Markon Sari Horwitz Lena Sun and Alice Crites in Washington and Eva Ruth Moravec in Austin contributed to this report
