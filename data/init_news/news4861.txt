One thing I often hear in the wake of theseendless mass shootings is Surely this will convince those gun people Surely the carnage and suffering are bad enough now that theyll feel compelled to support some gun controlThis betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the cognitive and emotional dynamics at work It presumes that mass shootings constitute an argument against guns to be weighed against arguments in their favor But to gun enthusiasts mass shootings are not arguments against guns but for them The rise in mass shootings is only convincing both sides that theyre right causing them to dig in furtherIts not even clear that opinions on guns and gun violence remain amenable to argument Over the past few decades gun ownership in the US has evolved from a practical issue for rural homeowners and hunters to a kind of gesture of tribal solidarity an act of defiance toward Obama the left and all the changes they represent The gun lobby has become more hardened and uncompromising pushing guns intoschoolschurches anduniversitiesThis has taken place in the context of abroader and deeper polarization of the country as Red America and Blue America have become more ideologically homogeneous and distant from one another The two sides are now composed of people who quite literally think and feel differently  and are less and less able to communicate The gun issue is a salient example but far from the only oneThis suggests that if the status quo on guns in the US is to change it will be through overwhelming political force not through evidence and argument Guns have now ascended to the level of worldview and identity areas largely beyond the reach of persuasionFor years an accumulating body of psychological and social scientific research has shown that as Chris Mooney summarized in an article last year liberals and conservatives disagree about politics in part because they are different people at the level of personality psychology and even traits like physiology and genetics Mooney later gathered that research in his somewhat unfortunately titled book The Republican BrainMooney quotes psychologistJohn Jost and colleagues writing in Behavioral and Brain SciencesSo different howJost and colleagues were responding positively to this paper by the University of Nebraskas John Hibbing which argues based on a series of experiments that conservatives display a strong negativity biasOther research has traced this effect in part to the physiological level finding that conservatives have larger right amygdalae The amygdala is a cluster of neurons in the brains medial temporal lobe thought to regulate basic pleasure and fear responses many psychological conditions including anxiety and PTSD have been traced to abnormal functioning of the amygdalaHeightened sensitivity to negative stimuli can mean a propensity for anxiety fear and occasionally alarm If fear threatens loss of control many traits common to conservatives can be seen as efforts to reassert control As Jost and colleagues summarize Research consistently finds that conservatism is positively associated with heightened epistemic concerns for order structure closure certainty consistency simplicity and familiarity as well as existential concerns such as perceptions of danger sensitivity to threat and death anxietyAnother way of framing the differences is in terms of the fivefactor model a set of five core personality traits many psychologists use for assessment openness to experience conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticismAs Mark Mellman wrote earlier this week liberals and conservatives consistently differ on a few of these traits Liberals are more open to new experiences novelty and disruption conservatives prefer stability and the status quo Liberals are more tolerant of mess ambiguity and uncertainty conservatives prefer tidiness clarity and certaintyYet another way to frame the difference Yale psychologist Dan Kahan whosecultural cognition work Ezra haswritten about before divides worldviews along two dimensions hierarchical vs egalitarian and individualist vs communitarian This creates a fourquadrant space conservatives are hierarchicalindividualistsThese differences can help inform our understanding of current US politics but first we should head off a few misunderstandingsTalking about deep personality differences is a sensitive business and inevitably draws some anger So its worth clarifying a few thingsAll these conservative tendencies put together and pushed to the extreme amount to authoritarianism The liberal inverse amounts to a kind of drifting libertinism In practice very few people lie at the far ends of the bellcurve distribution Most people are somewhere closer to the middle an idiosyncratic mixWhats more different aspects of personality can be elicited by different circumstances at different times around different people In times of peace and growth theres a drift toward liberalism Fear and crisis tend to push everyone the other direction to shrink boundaries of concern and heighten ingroupoutgroup sensitivity So liberal and conservative traits are not static at the group level or within an individualEveryone is unique No individual is predicted or explained by this research These are general tendencies heuristics fluid and contextsensitiveWhichever of these personality traits or clusters of traits you might prefer the research itself does not characterize any as better or worse Its easy to imagine circumstances in which sensitivity to threat and commitment to stability are valuable and others in which risktaking and innovation are valuable And its likely valuable to have a mix a balance no matter the circumstancesAs Mooney is at pains to emphasize in his book personality does not dictate ideology Theres no law of nature that conservatives are confined to the political right The 20th century offers no shortage of authoritarian leftists When the political left dominates the political order those prone to defending the status quo will tend to be leftistsThere was a period in the mid20th century US when liberals and conservatives were somewhat more evenly distributed across the parties  there were conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans But the past four or five decades have seen a slow lately accelerating process of polarization Americans have sorted themselves Almost all liberals are now Democrats almost all conservatives are now Republicans In Congress the leftmost Republican is to the right of the rightmost DemocratLet us imagine then a conservative gun owner  an older white gentleman lets say in his 50s living in the Rust Belt somewhere When he was growing up there was living memory of a familiar order men working in honorable trade or manufacturing jobs women tending home and children Sundays at church hard work yielding a steady rise up the ladder to a wellearned house yard and carThat order was crumbling just as our gun owner inherited it The honorable jobs are gone or going Its hell to find work benefits are for shit and there isnt much put aside for retirement The kids are struggling with debt and lowpaying jobs They know and our gun owner knows that they probably arent going to have a better life than he did  that the very core of the American promise has proven false for them for the first time in generationsIts a bitter helpless feeling And for someone naturally attuned to order structure closure certainty consistency simplicity and familiarity its scary The role he thought he was meant to play in the world the privileges and respect that came along with it have been thrown into doubt Everything is shifting under his feetOver the last few years our gun owner has found a whole network of TV channels radio shows books blogs and Facebook groups that speak directly to his unease They understand the world he heard about from his father and grandfather the world thats being lost they understand the urgency of saving whats left of itMost of all with his already heightened sensitivity to threat further aggravated by economic uncertainty they finally help him see whos to blame They show him the immigrants crowding in using up jobs and benefits that were promised to American workers They show him minorities demanding handouts that are paid for with his taxes even as they riot even as they kill each other and the police The show him terrorists making a mockery of weak American leadership They show him elitist liberals professors and entertainers disdaining his values and mocking his religionAnd it is such a relief to finally put a face to all the ambient dread to have some clarity again to know who the good guys and bad guys are Our gun owner is a good guy thankfully from the kind of selfreliant stock that settled this countryIt seems like Americas decline is a done deal that the tide of liberal rot is unstoppable But the one place he knows he can draw the line is at his door on his private property because he has a gun He can defend his own If the minorities riot again or immigrant criminals move in nearby or terrorists attack or some wackjob goes on a shooting spree or Obama comes for his guns  well thats what the guns are for Hes given up a lot but he wont give up his autonomy or the safety of his family Hell defend that to the endTo our gun owner another mass shooting is not an argument for getting rid of guns Its a confirmation of his every instinct another sign of moral and societal decay another reason to arm himself and defend what hes got leftYou can tell him about Canada and Australia until youre blue in the face  the lower rate of gun deaths the hunting exemptions the seemingly intact freedoms You can cite high popular support for restrictions on gun and ammunition sales You can tell him that not every incremental tightening of standards is a slippery slope that no one wants to confiscate his gunsBut youre just another selfrighteous liberal on another selfrighteous crusade too blind or stupid to see how governments always use people like you to disarm their citizenry Youve taken enough  of his taxes his freedoms his culture He wont give you any moreA cherished myth of American politics indeed of democracy generally is that its fundamentally about persuasion the contest of ideas But in a political system already biased against action in which members of both parties are becoming more ideologically and even psychologically distant persuasion on issues that activate tribal identities is all but impossible Our gun owner is not going to change his mind everything gun control proponents consider evidence for their side he considers evidence for his The differences run deeper than evidenceIf there are ever to be gun laws passed in the US any kind of policy response to the rising tide of mass shootings it will be because the people who want it amass the political power to overwhelm the power of the gun lobby It will be because they organize and deploy more intensity money and votes than their opponents More mass shootings are not going to do the job for them
