But even though it is ultimately an egalitarian ruler wreaking havoc on the old young good and bad alike Time seems to hold a special grudge against Loretta Lynch the woman who after an unprecedented delay was finally sworn in on Monday as the 83rd attorney general in the history of the United StatesThe first indication that Time has it in for Lynch was also the most obvious the Senates 167daylong dawdle But while it was obviously wrong to make the first AfricanAmerican woman ever nominated for the post wait so absurdly long to be confirmed only two of Lynchs 82 predecessors waited longer Im hesitant to throw the fault entirely on Times shoulders The attack was launched by Republicans after all Time was merely their weaponBut the second piece of evidence that Time may be holding a particular grudge against the attorney general was more palpable the riots that convulsed Baltimore this weekendand paralyzed the city on Monday Because although Lynch obviously had nothing to do with the disorder the riots fires show with blinding clarity that Lynchs first goal  which is improving police morale according to the Times  is entirely premature The wanton destruction of property cannot be legitimated but simply criticizing anarchy and praising law enforcement wont bring the mayhem to an end And it wont provide justiceIn many ways the chaos in Baltimore is just the latest iteration of one of Americas saddest and longestrunning stories It is another example of what Martin Luther King once called the language of the unheard King was speaking then of the riots that traumatized much of the country during the summer of 1966 But the social ills he described as kindling for the riots fire  poverty police brutality and malign neglect  are despite the nearly 49 years that followed still powerful forces in America todayFor this particular moment though its Baltimore Police Departmentsdocumented history of lawless violence thats been identified as the riots inspiration Protestors and rioters  who its worth noting are usually not the same  cite as their catalyst the death of Freddie Gray a 25yearold AfricanAmerican man and Baltimorean On April 12 Gray was arrested by officers from the BPD When police detained Gray and put him in a van for transportation he was walking by the time the trip was over he had a broken neck He died on April 19thNo one yet knows for sure exactly what happened to Gray during that trip and in that van There are reports that he was taken out at one point and beaten but an autopsy showed no injuries except for those to his spinal cord and neck The BPD has already admitted that its officers did not provide Gray with the necessary medical care But the main question  Why was he able to run from the police in the morning but struggling to breathe by nightfall  has gone unanswered though an increasing number suspect the widespread grotesque practice of giving a rough ride is to blameYet the fact that such a thing could happen and only become a major story after the activism of peaceful protesters and the destructive hijacking of violent rioters is exactly the problem The fact that the BPDs reputation is such that many Baltimoreans heard Grays story with weary outrage rather than shock or indignation is exactly the problem The fact that the BPD rankandfile evidently feels so comfortable with extralegal brutality and are so accustomed to wielding it that demands for accountability has left them panicking  that too is exactly the problem Im quite certain that at least to some extent Attorney General Lynch would agree But thats why its so unfortunate that news of her interest in finding common ground between law enforcement and minority communities came when it did Because once the last stone is thrown the fires are put out and the state of emergency in Maryland is lifted what Baltimore and the countless places in the US like it will need is not another conversation And finding common ground wont be what America needs from its attorney general or its Department of Justice What will be needed instead is for the authorities in Baltimore Maryland and DC to stop pandering to the police unions who demand carte blanche in the field and an endless line of officials singing about their valor What will be needed instead are signs that the authorities take fears of the rise of the warrior cop and police militarization seriously and that they will no longer see the deaths of people like Gray as tragic Because theyre not cosmic acts of injustice theyre crimes To suspend with paythe officers who may be responsible is not enough  and Lynch needs to make clear that she understands that and that her predecessors groundbreaking report on Ferguson Missouri was no aberration What will be needed in short is for the people most apt to use the language of the unheard to feel that someone who matters is finally listening And that those in public office prove with actions that they believe it when they say an AfricanAmerican life is worth no less than a cops Now is not the time for Lynch to focus on making law enforcement happy Now is the time for her to promote equal justice Improving police morale can wait
