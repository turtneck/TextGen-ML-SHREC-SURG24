Many sexual assault activists worry that fallout from the Rolling Stone story will put a chill on the coverage of sex crimes But transparency and thoroughness in reporting can lead to better outcomes media experts and others sayRolling Stone is pledging to review its editorial practices after a leading journalism school issued a blistering critique of how it reported and edited a discredited article about an alleged gang rape at the University of VirginiaThe report from the Columbia Journalism School on the discredited Rolling Stone article about an alleged campus rape at the University of Virginia reads like a treatise on how not to conduct journalism The journalistic failure encompassed reporting editing editorial supervision and factchecking says the Columbia report which was commissioned by Rolling StoneAs fallout from the story continues on Monday the fraternity at the heart of the discredited rape allegations announced plans to pursue legal action against Rolling Stone many sexualassault activists worry that it will put a chill on the coverage of sex crimes  journalism that activists say is crucial to bringing rape out of the shadows and addressing itI think the worstcase scenario would be that journalists dont want to cover this topic says Tracy Cox communications director for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center NSVRCBut the authors of the Columbia report itself say they hope their critique of the Rolling Stone story is taken as a lesson to reporters and editors about how to do better rather than as a discouragement to journalists against wading into such a fraught topicMs Cox and media experts urge reporters to take the time needed to gather an array of facts and talk to a range of individuals And they emphasize the importance of transparency  which includes disclosures about what reporters dont know and why Also no matter how sensitive journalists may be to a source they cant suspend all skepticism media observers sayIt would be a really unfortunate outcome if journalists backed away from doing this kind of reporting as a result of this highly visible failure because this is important work And its hard work said Steve Coll dean of the Columbia Journalism School and one of the authors of the report in a press conference Monday This kind of reporting environment this kind of subject  its a new frontier for serious accountability journalism This is an area where we have got to have a conversation amongst ourselves about how to get betterThe Columbia report cites numerous instances where appropriate journalistic procedures should have raised red flags with the Rolling Stone story A prime example Editors should have insisted that reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely contact the three friends whom Jackie said she met with after the alleged rapeWe want journalists to see that despite the complexities and difficulties in reporting about sexual assault it can be done well can be done accurately and can have widespread positive impacts Cox says Through their reporting theyre telling victims stories They can help to contribute to widespread societal changeCox and media experts agree that there are many ways reporters can step into the murky territory of sexualassault reporting  where reporters may be relying on nonadjudicated testimony and trying to find a delicate balance between being sympathetic to someone dealing with trauma while still exercising due diligence  and still avoid the mistakes that Rolling Stone made The NSVRC has worked with the Poynter Institute in St Petersburg Fla which teaches writing and media ethics to develop a free online course for journalists who write about sexual assaultIf a story isnt quite where it needs to be its OK to hold it and flush out those facts and do more interviews says Cox Its better to have the right story than go with something thats wrong and in the end causes more harm than goodOne major problem with Ms Erdelys story note the authors of the Columbia report may simply have been the way she approached it initially  her determination to find an illustrative example that corroborated the story she wanted to tell and her decision to go with the one that seemed the most lurid and shocking even though other more verifiable accounts existedWhen journalists write stories they usually start looking for one or two things when looking for examples or anecdotes One of the things we look for is the thing that represents a larger reality You cant just pick out the easiest one to report says Roy Peter Clark vice president and senior scholar at Poynter Reporting about something like campus rape or how institutions respond may indeed call for occasional anecdotes to illustrate the story he adds but I think it also calls for tools now available to us like data analysisThe Columbia report also talks about the problem with the reliance on pseudonyms  something Rolling Stone did for Jackie as well as the three friends and the date who she claimed instigated the gang rapePseudonyms are inherently undesirable in journalism They introduce fiction and ask readers to trust that this is the only instance in which a publication is inventing details at its discretion says the report which goes on to suggest that Rolling Stone consider banning them or allowing them only in very rare instancesTheres this tremendous tension now between anonymity and verifiability And this particular example of journalism malpractice has made it a lot harder Mr Clark saysClark isnt convinced that granting automatic anonymity to sexual assault victims  which many media outlets routinely do  is a best practice either for journalism or for addressing sexual assaultAre you going to try to humanize the victim by giving her or him a false name Are you doing that to protect their privacy If you do that will you be tempted to change other details to create a disguise that protects the person he asks All these moves we make to protect the vulnerable are a kind of form of the journalistic equivalent of witness protection but theyre also a gateway drug for fabrication or exaggerationCox at the NSVRC disagrees noting that privacy is a huge issue for many victims and a reason they may not come forward and that some fear for their safety I dont think abolishing all pseudonyms is the answer I think you have to do it on a casebycase basis she saysUltimately media observers say a lot of the Rolling Stone problems can be avoided with proper transparencyIn certain cases it may be impossible for some details to be corroborated  but when thats the case the lack of corroboration should be made clear the Columbia report saysTransparency is a more important virtue than ever in journalism says Clark I think there was so little transparency in the Rolling Stone story that it should be a harsh reminder of what happens when were unwilling to tell our readers what we know how we know it and even more importantly what we dont know And why we dont know it
