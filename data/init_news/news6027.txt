Donald Trumps twoweekold campaign has been pretty good at sticking to two core points defending the candidates antiimmigrant remarks at his announcement and pretending that the companies that responded to those comments by ending their business relationships with him were instead rejected by him firstAs a result weve gotten a wonderful look at the unassailable way in which Trumps mind works Hes always right until hes not in which case he was never wrong You wereTake the statements that started all of Trumps troubles they came within the first few minutes of his campaign kickoff after he rambled for a bit about the crowd and the Islamic State and JapanWhen Mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best he said Theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us Theyre bringing drugs Theyre bringing crime Theyre rapistsWith all of the furor that resulted its worth noting the two hallmarks of classic Donald Trump that emerged from his response First he unfailingly stood by the comments despite the fallout And second heswrongOn CNN on Wednesday night he offered a defense to anchor Don LemonIf you look at the statistics of people coming  I didnt say about Mexico I say the illegal immigrants if you look at the statistics on rape on crime on everything coming in illegally to the country theyre mindboggling he told LemonEvery part of that is incorrect He did say his comments about Mexico  explicitly And data show that new immigrants  including illegal immigrants  are actuallyless likely to commit crime not moreForeignborn individuals exhibit remarkably low levels of involvement in crime across their life course Bianca Bersani University of Massachusetts 2014 Published in Justice QuarterlyCiting Bersanis work Pew Research created this graph showing crime rates among the immigrant communityThe crime rate among firstgeneration immigrants  those who came to this country from somewhere else  is significantly lower than the overall crime rate and that of the second generation they writeSince undocumented immigrants are more than a quarter of the immigrant population its nearly impossible that the overallimmigrant crime rate could be so much lower if the undocumentedimmigrant crime rate were significantly higher Theres essentially no correlation between immigrants and violent crime Jrg Spenkuch Northwestern University 2014 Published by the university He did find a small correlation between immigration and property crime but only a slight one Immigrants are underrepresented in California prisons compared to their representation in the overall population In fact USborn adult men are incarcerated at a rate over twoandahalf times greater than that of foreignborn men Public Policy Institute of California 2008 Data from the census and a wide range of other empirical studies show that for every ethnic group without exception incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants even those who are the least educated This holds true especially for the Mexicans Salvadorans and Guatemalans who make up the bulk of the undocumented population Ruben Rumbaut University of California 2008 Published by the Police Foundation Analyses of data collected from four Southwest states and the US Census show that the perceived size of the undocumented immigrant population more so than the actual size of the immigrant population and economic conditions is positively associated with perceptions of undocumented immigrants as a criminal threat Xia Wang Arizona State University 2014 Published in CriminologyHow did Trump get a simple point so wrong Consider the response he offered Lemon on his most contentious assertion Trump offers a sort of ontological rationalization for the rapists claim People are being raped ergo its the immigrants faultTrump citedan article from Fusion Eighty percent of the women coming in   he says trailing off You have to take a look at these stories  Its unbelievable when you look at whats going on All Im doing is telling the truthLemon correctly points out that the story was about immigrant women being raped Well Trump replies someones doing the raping Don In apparent disbelief Trump adds How can you say such a thingAnd there you go Trump completely misreads a media story turns it into a mushy stat in his head and uses that as an excuse to bash immigrants without cause The stat is nowhere near accurate but that doesnt matter When hes presented with accurate data he offers a weird rationale  and then criticizes his critic PerfectIn the wake of his announcement we dubbed Trump to be unfactcheckablefor the simple reason that he so often operates outside the bounds of logical discourse Same here Trump has septupled down on his bad argument  assuming as has happened so many times before that it will all go awayIt probably wont until almost invariably his candidacy does
