Donald Trump said this week if he went out on Fifth Avenue in New York and shot someone he probably wouldnt lose any votesHe chose a pretty big someone  Fox News whose offices are one block over from FifthTune in to Thursday nights Republican debate on Fox 9 pm EST in Iowa the last one before Mondays caucuses and youll notice one very big elephant not in the room  Trump The man who helped Fox to a record 24 million viewers in the first primary debate of this campaign season wont be thereHe pulled out of the debate after getting into what Trumpendorser Sarah Palin might call a squirmish with Fox over its insistence on keeping anchor Megyn Kelly as a moderator Trump thought Kelly treated him unfairly in the first debate Fox didnt budge and then mocked Trump saying in a statement the network had learned from a back channel that Irans and Russias leaders were intent on treating Trump unfairly if he became president and that Trump was planning on using his Twitter followers to see if he should go to Cabinet meetingsThat was enough for Trump He bailed but upped the showmanship Hes holding his own alternative event  at the same time and just 3 miles away  a benefit for veterans So while Fox News hosts its debate every other cable news network  which wont have broadcasting rights to the debate  will probably be airing the Trump eventNo this is not an Ambien Dream as Karl Zahn a New Hampshire standup comic and Trump supporter wondered aloud to New Hampshire Public Radios Josh Rogers this week of Trumps campaignThis is very much real life Here are some questions ahead of tonights SplitScreen Squirmish1 How much does Trump talk about the debate Fox News and the GOPThis isnt what the Republican Party wanted when it began sanctioning and limiting debates following the 2012 presidential election And it certainly didnt expect a blowup like this with Fox News of all the networks The Republican National Committee wanted to control the message and protect its candidates and brand but that hasnt worked out so well Trump as it turns out has been a bigger force and commands a louder megaphone than anyone else in the party Just how much will he use it Thursday night at his veterans event2 Who exactly will Trumps event benefit  and how much will be raisedCharity events like this arent exactly things that can be slapped together in 24 to 48 hours very efficiently What will the energy be like And who exactly will the money be going to Trump has said maybe it should go to Wounded Warriors the Wounded Warrior Project  the subject of controversy over its spending habits but the press release just said a Special Event to Benefit Veterans Organizations3 What about the debate  how much will Trump come upTrump wont even be at the debate but hes already the dominant topic There are two sides to this  the moderators and the candidates Youd have to guess the moderators would have to say something about Trumps absence And no there wont be an empty lectern RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on CNN WednesdayAnd certainly a few candidates would like a free shot at Trump especially his closest rival Ted Cruz The Texas senator even challenged Trump to a debate at a college in western Iowa on Saturday evening And you know what they say about candidates who are asking for debates Hint It comes as Cruzs poll numbers are slipping in the Hawkeye State4 Who grabs the spotlight insteadThere are still lots of storylines to play out at this debate Cruz will now be in the center of the stage and that means he might be the one everyone winds up going after In earlier debates Cruz held back In the last debate he showed why he was a champion college debater But whos his foil without Trump on the stageOthers need to break through too Florida Sen Marco Rubio has quietly remained in third in Iowa and in the top three in New Hampshire but his path is still hard to see Rubio has had plenty of differences on these stages with other candidates Cruz New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush for example Can he show why Democrats seem to fear a Rubio nomination more than any other candidateThis has been an election dominated by the outsiders thanks to more hardline conservatives fed up with the system In years past the party has gotten that out of its system in Iowa and establishment picks have eventually emerged This year is pointing in a different direction but there are still others trying to be viable in that establishment lane Ohio Gov John Kasich is the latest to have some momentum in New Hampshire This debate may be in Iowa but its being broadcast to a national audience And you can bet Kasichs target will be some 1300 miles east On caucus night hell already be in the Granite State not Iowa Bush has been on his last legs for a while but he was more relaxed in the last debate He has certainly taken on Trump and hell likely do so again even if Trumps not on the stage Christie had a solid performance in his last debate Hell probably mix it up again6 Is Trump really the Teflon Don of this raceTheres some risk for Trump in not going to the debate He can look presumptuous entitled and untouchable Maybe he really is the Teflon Don of this race Its certainly not what a typical frontrunner would do That candidate would play it safe have a good debate and position himself to win the first two contestsBut thats not Trumps style He doesnt just play it big He plays it HUGE And thats what hes doing again So will Iowans feel snubbed Or more precisely will Iowans who have been supporting him to big numbers suddenly start to peel off Thats pretty unlikely He can argue hes not snubbing Iowa hes snubbing Fox which in and of itself is pretty remarkable considering the role Fox plays in Republican politics and conservative circlesSome candidate might figure out a way to use Trumps absence as an opportunity But the likelihood again is Trump will spin this into a win as the other candidates are forced to participate in a game without the star player whom everyone came to see
