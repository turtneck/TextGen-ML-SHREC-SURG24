Sen Cory Booker acknowledges that the Senates criminal justice bill is not perfect But he doesnt hesitate to point out that its in my lifetime the first reversal of mass incarceration in the federal levelThe legislation contains some big compromises It keeps many mandatory minimum sentences does not shorten sentences for violent offenders and adds a new mandatory sentencing enhancement for fentanyl a powerful opioid when its present in trafficked heroin Booker said that if it were only up to him the legislation would have gone much further in rolling back punishments and it wouldnt have added the mandatory enhancement for fentanylBut he argued that at the end of the day the bill would be progress leading to fewer people in federal prisons It would reduce some mandatory minimum sentences  retroactively for nonviolent offenders It would give judges the power to downgrade 10year mandatory minimum sentences for firsttime drug offenders And it would let people currently in prison take steps to reduce the length of their sentences through special programs as long they demonstrate they no longer pose a threat to societyBooker argued this is enough to make the law a net good And as a progressive senator he said people should get on boardHeres my conversation with Booker edited for length and clarityGerman Lopez Since we last talked the criminal justice reform bill was introduced and changed and its now definitely safe to say its a compromise How do you view the legislation now that its closer to final formCory Booker Its never been the totality of what I wanted Its never been as bold as I wanted it to be But it is a significant bill in the sense that it is stopping this drift that weve seen over the last 20 30 years toward massive hyperincarceration And in fact its the first major federal bill thats going to begin to unwind or move the pendulum back toward the sanity that we as a nation should be so urgently demandingSo the compromises at the end of the day  and some people are making them out to be far worse than they actually are  dont undermine the truth of the bill This is going to take our serious problem of overincarceration and begin to reduce it give judges more discretion give people with these long unnecessary sentences avenues to earn their time down and get more early release and affect people as they come out of prison in a way that will empower them to be more successful All those things are good thingsGL In terms of the bills specifics one of the compromises that stuck out to me as someone who covers drug policy is the addition of the fentanyl mandatory penalty It just seems kind of strange to me  and Ive heard this from readers too  that a bill thats supposed to reform and move away from mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses would add this kind of penalty Whats your view on itCB Well first of all I obviously wouldnt want that in thereBut its important for your readers to understand that it is not a mandatory minimum Theres a big difference between telling a judge that you have to give this person five years in prison or more versus what this is which is a sentencing enhancement which says to the judge You got to give this person some kind of enhancement but the full discretion is to you You could literally give 12 hours one day or more time if you want toSo for me what I reject is three strikes youre out 10year mandatory minimums that take all the discretion out of the judges hands and put it all in the legislatures hands Thats one of the ways weve gone awryThe last thing thats really important is that in fiscal year 2014 the US Department of Justice only prosecuted 12 heroin cases involving fentanyl nationwide So this means 12 cases the judge would have the ability to add more on but would have the discretion not to do thatSo number one this provision affects a small amount of people Number two its not a mandatory minimum Number three if this is one of the compromises we had to make to get the other major pulldowns of mandatory minimums that could affect thousands of people that is a small small compromise for the big big gains were going to be getting in reducing mass incarceration through the billGL What are some of the things the bill does that you dont likeCB Ill tell you I fought hard to get the end of juvenile solitary confinement and Im upset  though I understood I had to take what we got  that its only for juveniles that have been tried as juveniles as opposed to a 16yearold whos been tried as an adult Hes still eligible for that solitary confinement Thats problematic to me Its a 16yearold child  and again its a small number but theyre still in the system We want the ban on solitary confinement for themThat a 16yearold whose brain is still under development when theyre so vulnerable can still be placed in solitary confinement thats something I dont like in the billWe worked hard to get the expungement for juveniles and Im worried that thats not in the House provision right now So thats a provision thats vulnerableAs soon as this one passes Im back to negotiating and fighting for the next bill that can go further than thisWe were able to get 10year mandatory minimums and above into the judges discretion but we were not able to get the fiveyear mandatory minimums In other words with a 10year the judge can actually disregard the mandatory minimum according to the bill Thats a massive redirecting of power back toward judges We won that for 10year but we did not win it for fiveyear mandatory minimumsIf you want more I could obviously give you a small dissertation on the bill Cory Booker would have wanted versus that one we got In my opinion I would have liked to just have gotten rid of the mandatory minimums altogether and made our judicial system about judges juries prosecutors and defendants again and not legislators who know nothing about the particular circumstances of a case So theres a lot of things that are in the bill that arent the things that I really want but it is a result of a compromiseLook as a result of this compromise weve gotten Sen Mark Kirk Sen Thad Cochran Sen Steve Daines and Sen Dan Sullivan onto the bill which gives us all the more chances of it getting passedAgain its not my dream bill And as soon as this one passes Im back to negotiating and fighting for the next bill that can go further than this And the more guys like you frankly and others are awakening the public to what I think is one of the greatest cancers in our country on the soul of our democracy the more people will be pressing for other and further reformsGL The reason I asked that is to gauge the costbenefit analysis that youre doing in your head in terms of what makes this bill good and what would make it too bad to pass It seems like youre saying that this pushes the ball forward a bit and reduces incarceration overall and that makes it worth passing But how do you gauge thatCB The Sentencing Commission numbers are clear This is going to have a significant benefit to reducing incarceration Elements of this bill will have a significant benefitTheres some benefits that I know are huge that we cant measure like giving judges that discretion back We cant measure that But I know federal judges whove spoken to the fact that they feel like their hands are tied literally grieving that they have to put down sentences that they know are inappropriate Well now for those 10year mandatory minimums those judges have that discretion and I think its going to be used a lot Those are the things we cant measureBut we have some good numbers on the sentencing reformThis will move the ball on the field a good number away and will affect thousands upon thousands of Americans who are unnecessarily potentially even unjustly forced to serve very very long terms This bill will do goodIt wont do as much good as I would want but theres no costbenefit analysis The choice is this or nothing in this Congress Nothing leaves a lot of people wallowing in prison facing harsh judgments that are not necessary My thinking is lets put these points on the board and commit ourselves to understanding the games not over yetGL Are you worried that passing this bill would make it harder to get more reform since people would feel like they at least did something Or do you think theres so much movement for reform that it will still happenCB Im a new legislator so that question you asked me Ive asked so many veterans around this place on both sides of the Capitol That was a common question I asked for a while  until I heard the same answer from enough senior Democrats that I stopped asking itSo what everyone who has experience legislating has told me  Dick Durbin was the first person to spell it out for me  is that if you have a chance to pass a bill that does a lot of good do it because you never know whats going to happen next year or what the sentiment is going to be next political cycle Take what you can off the table You may not get the whole loaf but take the loaf that you can get  and then go back to fighting againIve been convinced by that argument from enough senior senators Ill take as much as I canAnd then by the way the coalition that weve helped foster around this issue it isnt going away either Conversations with Mark Holden with the Koch brothers with Newt Gingrich with others  everybody knows that theres more work to do So I dont think youre going to get any diminution in commitment from a lot of these interest groups advocacy groups and justice groupsBut again you never know what can happen  whos going to win the presidential election whos going to win the Senate who will be elected in the House So I think the right thing to do is to get a bill that may not go as far as we want to But its in my lifetime the first reversal of mass incarceration in the federal levelGL So the bill received some big changes recently after it was released last year due to fears about some of the measures benefiting violent offenders But I know that a lot of reformers and experts actually liked those portions they think its important to acknowledge that sentences are too long not just for drug offenders but for everyone in general Where do you stand on that and is it something you intend to work on moving forwardCB Ive spoken about this publicly a lot And I dont have unanimity in my own caucus about this But we have an issue with violent crime in the sense that everybody makes a stark difference between violent offenders and nonviolent offendersBut for people in the criminal justice working world that is a gray line at best You could have someone whos in a car driving a boyfriend and the boyfriend decides to jump out pull a gun out rob somebody jumps back in the car and she keeps driving  and now shes a violent criminalSo we need to start having a better conversation about the many people who are languishing in prison for very long terms when their crime was not showing the right sense and stopping the car and exiting the car as a driver or what have youI still think we have disproportionate punishments for people who are socalled violent criminals but dont necessarily involve any direct actions of violenceIn addition to that the circumstances to violent crime Ill give you an example on an assault charge If you and I got into a bar fight and you punched me and I fell backward and I hit my head and I died thats a horrible crime  but there are circumstances within that Does that person deserve life imprisonmentI just think theres a fear to have a candid conversation about proportionality when it comes to things that are labeled as violent crimesGL Even for people who have done truly violent or horrible things there are also some questions about whether they truly deserve the long sentences theyre getting especially if they can prove that theyve rehabilitated or have aged out of crime In those kinds of cases what do you think should be doneCB Lets look at the statistical reality When people are in prison maybe they commit a crime in their 20s and now theyre in their 50s 60s and 70s and were still holding them in prison there is so much data that shows that you hit a point in your age that your chances of committing another crime have gone down dramaticallyThere comes a point where you really have to ask yourself if we have achieved the societal end in keeping these people in prison for so long Is the societal cost and expenditure worth it to keep somebody whos older  higher medical costs and the like  in prison This is a conversation this country really needs to haveBy the way I think what youre getting at also is that we are different than most places on the planet Earth in terms of the lengths of our sentences even for violent crimesGL One example that comes to mind is Norways system where prison terms are capped at 21 years but perhaps a judge can add a few years at the end of the term It seems like something the US could move toCB Even with our bill what a lot of people dont understand is that people who are earning time out in our bill theyre not just getting it and then its like Hey its time to get out They have to go for reviews before the prosecutor before the judge So were not just opening doors for people to leave without any checks whatsoever In fact the checks are in my opinion very justifiably burdensome for someone to exit prisonSo a system in which someone who serves 40 years on a sentence and is now a senior citizen a system that says they should now be able to go through a process and the victims are notified where prosecutors are there where the chance for redemption is open to them not given to them I think we should have a system that allows a chance for redemption for people who are well past the point in their lives where theyre any statistical threat to this countryGL If this bill passes are there any particular ideas youre thinking about specifically in terms of criminal justice reformCB I dont know my communications director will want me to say this but Hell yesLets start with the great bill to ban the box Thats a nobrainer in my opinion And it has wide bipartisan support And it would deal with this other problem that you and I havent talked about yet Folks who get out of prison  maybe they only serve a year maybe they only serve a month  now they cant get a jobThere is across the board so much more work to be done in this area Should this bill get done and sent to the presidents office before the ink is dry Im going to start talking about the many more things that we have to do to bring justice back to our justice systemGL Thats one thing the bill leaves out addressing all these collateral consequences You mentioned ban the box but it also applies to other stuff like voting rights and welfare benefits I know some of this is done at the state level but stillCB Im on a bill about voting rights States may be able to do what they want on the state level but on federal offices heck yes thats our jurisdiction And its outrageous that African Americans are four times more likely to be convicted of drug crimes even though they have no difference in committing drug crimes And guess what as a result of that Black Americans are about four times more likely to lose their voting rightsIm already involved on legislation on a whole bunch of these issues  really good bills that Im not giving up on fighting for And when this sentencing bill is done Im going to be part of introducing new sentencing bills around mandatory minimums because I think the momentum and history is on our side And we can continue to chip away at this problem
