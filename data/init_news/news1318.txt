CNN The Republican candidates for president gathered Thursday in North Charleston South Carolina for their sixth debate and CNNs Reality Check Team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the testThe team of reporters researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them True Mostly True True but Misleading False or Its ComplicatedIn discussing foreign challenges in the Middle East former Florida Gov Jeb Bush said As it relates to Iran we need to confront ambitions across the board reimpose sanctions They already violated sanctions after the agreement was signed by testing mediumrange missilesThe agreement Bush was referring to was the deal reached last year between Iran the United States and five other countries that seeks to roll back Irans ability to obtain a nuclear weaponSince the signing of that agreement Iran has indeed tested missile technology The test violated sanctions not covered by the new deal but rather in contravention of existing UN Security Council resolutions Last month a panel at the United Nations said Iran violated existing resolutions when it tested a ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead in OctoberBut under the terms of the agreement reached in Vienna last year over Irans nuclear program the missile tests while violating existing resolutions are actually not a violation of the new agreement because that accord is focused on restricting Irans path to a nuclear weaponIn fact the October ballistic missile test violation would not contravene the nuclear agreement brokered with Iran once it goes into effect which the Obama administration believes will happen soon Under the new nuclear deal Iran will be able to conduct ballistic missile tests  a concession to Iran included in the deal  meaning Iran could have simply waited until after implementation of the deal to do the testVerdict True  Iran violated the sanctions but not the nuclear weapons agreementSen Marco Rubio of Florida claimed that Sen Ted Cruz of Texas flipped on his support for ethanol just one attack in a rapidfire succession of them but also the one that could matter the most in Iowa which is a leading corn producerCruz has always opposed the Renewable Fuel Standard the fuel mandate supported by the states ethanol interests calling it an example of corporate welfare pushed by lobbyists and Democrats Its an issue that Cruz has taken flak over all across Iowa with voters frequently questioning him at town halls and retail stops concerned about his viewCruz admits that he did cosponsor a 2013 bill that wouldve ended the RFS immediately But his current position as outlined in a 2014 comprehensive energy bill he introduced in the Senate is to phase it out over five years with his policy as of now to end the RFS by 2022The ethanol lobby sending negative mailers about Cruzs record says that he did flip but Cruz denies that pointing to his bill instead of the one he cosponsored Cruzs personal preference however has always been for a fiveyear phaseoutRubio said that Obamacare is a certified job killerIn fact Obamacare is not a job killer according to the 2015 Kaiser Family FoundationHealth Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015The report showed that only 4 of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to parttime hours so they wouldnt qualify for health care and another 4 said they were reducing the number of fulltime employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits In fact that study showed that 10 of employers reported that they were changing workers from parttime to fulltime status to enable them to obtain coverageOne reason may be that the economy has been improving Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their parttimers hours to retain talent and reduce training costsAs to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare its nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs The number of people who can only find parttime jobs has declined in recent years signifying companies are hiring more fulltime workersSen Marco Rubio took a swipe at Chris Christie when he said the New Jersey governor backed President Barack Obamas nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009 Christie hastily denied the accusationWhile Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability competence and ability Christie said at the time I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nominationVerdict Rubios claim is true and Christies is falseRubio also accused Christie of donating to Planned Parenthood a highly contentious allegation especially considering the effort among conservatives to strip the organization of its federal fundsSo its true that Christie once said he donated to Planned Parenthood and Rubio and his allies are holding that article up as proof But Christie claims the quote was inaccurate So given the he said he said situation its difficult to know for sure where the truth liesReality Check Trump says Paris has the strictest nogun policy of any city anywhere in the worldDonald Trump said the terrorist attacks in Paris last year happened despite the city having the strictest nogun policy of any city anywhere in the worldHowever in France private gun ownership while heavily regulated is permittedWhile French laws are restrictive the gun laws in the UK are even more so After a series of mass shootings in the 1980s and 1990s the UK passed a law effectively banning the private ownership of all handgunsIn defending his questioning of Sen Ted Cruzs eligibility for the presidency Donald Trump cited Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe who Trump claimed is raising a serious question to whether or not Ted can do thisAlthough Tribe has weighed in on Cruzs eligibility he has not outright questioned whether Cruz  who was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father  would be considered a natural born citizen the definition of which Tribe says is completely unsettledWhat Tribe has questioned is whether Cruzs own originalist judicial theories  expressed when the senator was a student in his Harvard Law class and again on the campaign trail when speaking about potential judicial nominations  would render himself eligible for the White HouseIronically the kind of justices he says he wants are the ones that say hes not eligible to run for president Tribe argued on CNN this week This is important because the way this guy plays fast and loose with the Constitution hes a fairweather originalistNo real court is likely to keep Cruz off the ballot much less remove him from the White House if he were to win  Bush v Gore isnt likely to get a return engagement over this issue he wroteBut soon after the debate concluded Tribe went further telling CNNs Anderson Cooper that the issue is a serious cloud over Cruz and saying he can see a challenge going to the Supreme CourtIf some secretary of state refuses to put his name on the ballot if hes the nominee theres no way out of it other than to have Cruz or the Republican National Committee sue the secretary of state And that issue would then have to go all the way to the Supreme Court Tribe said But the fact is you know its a serious cloud It has to be taken seriously Its not just a matter of coming up with great talking points or winning some debate I think he does a disservice to the Constitution and the country when he thinks he can slide his way slip slide his way around this serious constitutional issue Tribe saidVerdict True Editors note We changed the verdict from false because Tribes comments after the debate suggested a legal fight was much more likelyReality Check Cruz on the US sending 100 billion to IranSen Ted Cruz of Texas said President Obama is preparing to send 100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khomeini I will tell you it was heartbreaking In 2011 and 2012 the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran that included freezing some Iranian assets overseas With the announcement of a deal in 2015 those same assets stand to be released creating a pool of money that will be newly available to the Iranian government The total amount of those assets is not known but as a deal with Iran seemed imminent some estimated that the number was as high as 150 billionIn late July at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the deal House Speaker John Boehner just as Cruz said claimed that more than 100 billion in unfrozen assets would be available to IranBoth the Treasury Department and the White House have disputed these estimatesIn Treasury Secretary Jacob Lews July testimony to the Senate he estimated that after sanctions relief Iran will only be able to access about 50 billion in unfrozen assets He noted that another large portion  about 20 billion  was tied up in projects with China and tens of billions comprise nonperforming loans to Iranian energy and banking interestsThe money already belongs to Iran but has been frozen so the United States is not sending this money from its coffers to the Iranian government Additionally none of the parties with access to the assets have substantiated an estimate close to the figure that Cruz suggestedAsked whether Americas economy is as strong as President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address Sen Ted Cruz said We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977Last month 595 of Americans age 16 and older were employed according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Thats higher than it was in 1977 when it ranged from 57 to 587The share of Americans employed during Obamas terms has ranged from as low as 582 in mid2011 to as high as 606 when Obama took office in January 2009Since 1977 the highest share of Americans were employed in April 2000 when 647 had a jobHowever the overall percentage of adults who are working isnt the best measure since the number of retirees is growing as the nation ages So lets look at the share of prime working age adults age 25 to 54 who are employed Some 774 of these Americans were employed in December compared to between 71 and 728 in 1977By no measure is the share of Americans employed at its lowest point since 1977Reality Check Cruz on Dianne Feinstein taking away all gunsDuring a discussion of proposed reforms to gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings Cruz claimed California senator Democratic Sen Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr America and Mrs America give me your guns Im rounding them up she wouldFeinstein did say something to that effect  21 years ago And she was referring specifically to assault rifles not all firearmsCruz exhumed the comment from a 1995 episode of 60 Minutes during which Feinstein discussed the limitations of the assault weapons ban She talked about loopholes in the law that allowed dealers to sell assault rifles weapons at gun showsIf I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr and Mrs America turn them all in I would have done it Feinstein said I could not do that The votes werent hereBecause Feinsteins comments were only about assault weapons and made 21 years ago not as part of Obamas current initiative we rate his claim true but misleadingCruz explaining his attack on Donald Trumps New York values asserted there are not a lot of conservatives coming out of ManhattanTheres no doubt New York Citys thirdmostpopulous borough is known more for liberal urbanites than as a bastion of conservatism But the island is not without its RepublicansVoter registration records indicate there are 83970 active Republicans on the rolls in Manhattan  only about 10 of the total number registered but not an insignificant portionSome of those Republicans carry outsized influence on the national political stage The latest federal campaign finance filings show Manhattan donors contributed 29 million to Republican presidential candidates the secondhighest concentration of donations in the country behind HoustonCruz himself has taken in 135588 from Manhattans ZIP codes this cycle behind his rivals Jeb Bush and Chris Christie but still more than many other Republicans in the race While those numbers are far behind the campaign cash taken in by Democrats in Manhattan the borough clearly remains a magnet for politicians of all stripes looking to raise fundsThe federal filings also dont account for contributions to outside groups like super PACs which raise enormous amounts of money from wealthy Manhattan donors One of the most prolific conservative political donors David Koch is a resident of Park AvenueCruzs claim that not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan is based on pure voter registration numbers true But the influence of the Republicans that do reside there extends well beyond the East and Hudson riversDuring the Fox Business Network undercard debate Carly Fiorina claimed that this Obama administration has told us they dont even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out whos pledging allegiance to jihadists We can do better than this citizens We need to take our country backOn December 16 Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that the department has in fact been examining social media when reviewing visa applications since early 2015Under my leadership as secretary we in fact began to consult social media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this he added Any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply falseJohnson did acknowledge that there were some restrictions on looking at an applicants social media account before 2015 but said that there was no current policy prohibiting the check of an applicants social mediaWe had policies in place regarding consulting social media which in my judgment particularly in this current environment were too restrictive Johnson saidMany have criticized immigration officials for not checking the social media accounts of Tashfeen Malik one of the San Bernardino California shooters after there were reports that she advocated jihad in messages on social media Her comments were made under a pseudonym and with strict privacy settings that did not allow people outside a small group of friends to see them US law enforcement officials told CNNFBI Director James Comey said that neither Malik or her husband and fellow shooter posted publicly on social media about supporting jihadHowever they did show signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom in private messages according to Comey The comments were private communications both by phone and social media and the US government was not monitoring them because they had no reason to The couple were not on any terrorist watch lists and Malik made her comments under a fake name behind many privacy settings that would have required a warrant to access themEven if immigration officials had looked at Maliks social media accounts they would not have had access to her private communicationsA US official told CNN that the United States only recently began routinely reviewing the social media activity of visa applications from certain countries The exact date that these types of reviews began is not clear but it was after Maliks application was considered the source saidWhile the policy changed only a year ago Fiorinas claim that immigration officials dont bother looking at visa applicants social media has been untrue for more a yearReality Check Fiorina on record numbers of men out of workWe have record numbers of men out of work we have record numbers of women living in poverty we have young people who no longer believe that that the American Dream applies to them Fiorina saidThere were 421 million men who were not working in December just below the record 429 million set in October 2013 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics This includes men who were not in the labor force as well as those who are unemployed To be included in the labor force you have to be working or actively looking for a jobWhile Fiorinas comment is true it is misleading because the vast majority of men who are not in the labor force are not looking for work They include students retirees and those whove just given up trying to find a jobThat said there is an employment crisis among workingage men these days The labor force participation rate  which includes those who are working or have looked for a job in the past four weeks  is near record lows The share of men ages 25 to 54 in the labor force now hovers near a record low of 88 It stood at nearly 97 in 1965The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties and rules that apply in times of armed conflict and also seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilitiesIn a briefing with reporters on Thursday State Department spokesman John Kirby said The Geneva Conventions apply for wartime were not at war with Iran So its a moot questionLegal experts with whom CNN spoke tend to agree with that assertionWe dont have a state of declared war or actual armed conflict between the US and Iran therefore the application of the Geneva Conventions does not come into play Allen Weiner the director of Stanfords Program in International and Comparative Law told CNN Both sides have said it was an inadvertent crossing into territorial waters where Iran is entitled to exercise criminal jurisdiction Weiner addedSteven Vladeck a professor at American University School of Law in Washington and a CNN contributor told CNN that Common Article 2 of Geneva is clear on this and only applies in a state of war or armed conflictThere is a whole lot of daylight between animosity and armed conflict Vladeck said adding other legal mechanisms applying to international human rights law or governing the law of the sea but the absence of direct armed conflict between the two countries negates the application of the Geneva Conventions in this caseBut legal experts said there are relevant legal provisions that Iran could be in violation of based on what occurredSome experts CNN spoke to did indicate that the Iranian actions may have violated customary maritime law In a situation where a ship enters territory waters due to a technical problem or damage a country would have the right to verify the problem but not use force to detain the sailors according to Craig Allen a professor of marine and environmental affairs at the University of WashingtonRick Santorum said that President Barack Obamas policies have hurt the manufacturing sector creating dwindling employment opportunities for the 74 of Americans who dont have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65The former senator a Penn State alum who once called the President a snob for promoting higher education needs to check his numbers againAccording to 2014 census data the most recent stats available 67 of Americans between 25 and 64 have not graduated from college The total number of people in that age bracket is 1648 million and 552 million of them have not attained a bachelors degree or higherSantorum wasnt a math major at Penn State so he can be forgiven for the miscalculation but he should have stuck with his original estimate For that reason our verdict is false
