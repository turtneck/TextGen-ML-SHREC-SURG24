Less than six weeks on his powerful Capitol Hill perch Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy is on the verge of watching one of his most important promises  to never again shut down the government  go up in smokeLawmakers on Friday began a 10day hiatus leaving them just four days when they return to pass funding for the Department of Homeland Security to avoid the shutdown of a key federal agency The DHS budget fight follows an effort among GOP conservatives to roll back President Obamas recent executive orders on immigrationConservatives are adamant that the security agency should be funded only if the legislation also overrules Obamas orders which prevent the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants But Senate Democrats even the few who oppose Obamas moves have blocked the Housepassed legislation with repeated filibustersThat has left McConnell trapped inside a legislative box that he had vowed to avoid  and one that for the previous four years his close ally House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio frequently wandered into without an exit strategyMcConnell was determined not to repeat those mistakesLet me make it clear There will be no government shutdowns McConnell said the day after he won reelection and a Republican rout gave his party the Senate majorityBut this week McConnell declared the Senate stuck and in need of Boehners help The speaker was not in a helping mood Boehner said he has no interest in passing legislation through the House that could draw Democratic support in the SenateThe House has done its job Boehner told reporters Thursday Weve spoken And now its up to the Senate to do their jobA shutdown of one agency would not cause nearly the same disruptions as the October 2013 shutdown of the federal government which resulted in national parks closing furloughs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and a general sense of disgust with Washington dysfunction If no deal is reached the Department of Homeland Security would deem many workers essential  particularly those overseeing border security airline safety disaster responses and domestic terror assessments  but even those federal workers would be going without an assurance of being paidMany Republicans fear that public reaction would mirror October 2013 when Republicans tried to force Obama to accept a funding plan that would have gutted his landmark healthcare law That shutdown cratered public support for Republicans leaving them in a hole that took them almost a year to climb out of and McConnell adamant about not repeating the mistakeIn an interview just before he formally took over as majority leader McConnell said his biggest political goal was a productive governance that was not scary to the public He said his aim was to boost the Republican 2016 presidential nominees chances Some Republicans fear that Democrats would win a DHSshutdown fight by portraying the GOP majority as recklessly endangering national security over a political fight with ObamaI dont think a shutdown of the department whose purpose is to secure our homeland is a good idea for anybody Sen Bob Corker RTenn the most outspoken critic of the 2013 strategy that led to a 16day shutdown said ThursdaySome McConnell advisers suggest that a brief lapse in funding for one federal agency would not break his noshutdowns promise McConnell made no public mention of the DHS showdown sticking to his comments that Boehner will have to make the next moveI think its clear we cant go forward in the Senate unless you all have heard something I havent McConnell said And so the next move obviously is up to the HouseThe yearend funding showdown in December was built around the principle of avoiding this kind of brinkmanship with Boehner and McConnell scuttling the possibility of a broad shutdown by agreeing to pass 11 of the 12 annual bills that fund the federal agenciesThe DHS was left out because of opposition to the executive action Obama announced deferring deportations of millions of illegal immigrants The DHS the agency in charge of immigration and border policy was given a shortterm extension of funds until Feb 27 buying time for McConnell and Boehner to come up with an escape plan  one that has yet to appearI have every confidence we will meet the deadline one way or the other said Sen John Cornyn RTex McConnells top lieutenant on the leadership team Just how I cant tell you right this minuteDemocrats said even a smallscale shutdown so soon on McConnells watch would hurt him politically They believe it would set a precedent with the far right wing pushing him around in the same manner that House conservatives have backed Boehner into corners he wanted to avoidI think its a big problem said Sen Richard J Durbin Ill the secondranking Democrat in the chamber They said Were going to show we can run the trains on time and we are quote not scary So if they start off by jeopardizing funding for the premier agency for Americas defense against terrorism  not a good startThere is time to avert a shutdown but it almost certainly involves capitulation to the DemocratsOne possibility is to remove the language on immigration and pass a clean funding bill which would probably prompt the biggest revolt from conservative activists A second option is to pass another shortterm extension of DHS funding for a few more weeks or monthsThe latter idea more palatable to conservatives puts off for another day the same predicament the leadership finds itself in nowA third option is to dig in for a fight and let funding dry up for an agency that is seen as essential to protecting the nationAlthough that is anathema to many Republicans the idea has gained traction among leading establishment conservativesBoth sides run a risk here Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC said He argued that Republicans should leave in place Obamas order that protected children from deportation but instead dig in against the more expansive 2014 order that extended the protections to several million adult illegal immigrants even if it means a lapse in funding for DHSThe Democrats are wrong here to say Im not going to fund DHS because I insist that President Obama get all he wants when it comes to executive amnesty Graham said I think that is a huge mistakeMcConnell stoic in public is the same way in private senators say He has not betrayed any worry about the pending deadlineI think everybodys worried about it said Sen Orrin G Hatch RUtah who is the longestserving member of the GOP caucus and has served with McConnell for 30 years McConnells a pro He doesnt show his feelingsSen Joe Manchin III WVa the conservative Democrat who opposes Obamas immigration orders said McConnell needs to convince Boehner that they have to pass the funding bill without any of the policy conditions and instead send over a discrete piece of legislation that would repeal the presidential ordersIf they dont have me where do they go said Manchin the Democrat who most frequently partners with RepublicansThe bottom line he said is they could probably clean this up very quickly
