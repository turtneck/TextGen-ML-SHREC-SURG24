I dont think it is good for anybody Huckabee Sanders told CNNs Erin Burnett on OutFront when asked about Trump and Florida Sen Marco Rubios rhetoric on the campaign trail I think its unfortunate the nature of politics seems to create this type of tension I think the person it ultimately and sadly ends up at times being good for is Hillary ClintonTrump and Rubio engaged in a war of words Friday with Trump calling his opponent a choker lightweight and clown and Rubio labeling the billionaire as a con artistI keep hearing all these pundits and people from the media and other politicians talking about how bad Donald Trump is for America and in particular how bad people are that support Donald Trump My thing is that theyre not bad for America they are AmericaShe added that Trump supporters are from the heartland and heart and soul of America They are hardworking Godfearing people who are sick and tired of the government stepping all over them and they want someone to help just clear the path and get government out of the way Huckabee Sanders went on to criticize Texas Sen Ted Cruzs attempts to attack Trump for having New York values She claimed that the bulk of Cruzs campaign is being funded by New York donors and that you need to follow the money in this case and certainly Ted Cruz doesnt have a lot of credibility to attack on that front As for why she joined Trumps campaign  Huckabee Sanders said Washington is being controlled by donors and special interests and believes Trump is the only presidential candidate who can go there and fix it
