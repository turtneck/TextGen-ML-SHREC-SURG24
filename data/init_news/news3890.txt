NYT Members of the Bush and Christie campaigns have communicated about their mutual desire to halt Mr Rubios rise in the polls according to Republican operatives familiar with the conversations While emails texts and phone calls between operatives in rival campaigns are not uncommon in the tightknit world of political strategists the contact among senior aides in the two campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow Mr Rubio the operatives said In a sign of a budding alliance the aides have for example exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for Mr Rubio There is no formal coordination the operatives stressed but rather a recognition of a shared agenda We do have similar goals an adviser to Mr Christie said  The

conservation of one species requires the elimination of another The New Yorker brings us the tale of the Channel Island Turkeys which were eradicated from the islands to save the native foxes but the story goes deeper than that The sheep on Santa Cruz Island off the coast of Southern California were the first to go They had been imported by schooner in the midnineteenth century and beginning in the early nineteeneighties tens of thousands of their feral descendants were eradicated Later it was the hogs turn to face the gun Between 2005 and 2006 more than five thousand were killed By the

Democratic debate between presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton and her rival socialist Sen Bernie Sanders IVt foreshadowed a long ugly march to victory for Clinton And a new poll out today shows just how long it might be  The Quinnipiac University national poll shows Clintons support has collapsed since the last survey in December losing nearly 20 points to fall into a statistical tie with Sanders Clinton is still popular with Democrats but hard sentiment seems to be growing Some 22 percent of Democrats hold unfavorable views of Clinton more than double Sanders The Vermont senator also holds the highest overall favorability among any candidate in either party at 44 percent and performs better in the general election matchup against all Republicans than Clinton Thats strong evidence that her electability argument isnt working  Clintons battering of Sanders in Thursdays debate suggests she is aware of her predicament But she likely worsened her plight as she not only went scorched earth after Sanders but also made several headscratching claims including that she was not part of the Democratic establishment  She can still be considered a lock for the nomination but it is almost as if her preparations for a long ugly process was a prediction rather than a precaution  Dan Balz was ringside for fight night at the University of New Hampshire Read his blowbyblow account here
