The OilGas War Over Syria in Maps Eric Zuesse Turkeys Anadolu News Agency though governmentrun is providing remarkably clear and reliable diagrammatic descriptions of the current status of the USandfundamentalistSunni versus RussiaandShiaandNONfundamentalistSunni sides in the current oilandgas war in the Middle East for control over territory in Syria for construction of oilandgas pipelines through Syria supplying fuel into the worlds largest energymarket Europe Russia is now the dominant supplier of both oil and gas but its ally Iran is a Shiite gaspowerhouse that wants to share the market there and Russia has no objection Qatar is a Sunni gaspowerhouse and wants to become the main supplier of gas there and Saudi Arabia is a Sunni oilpowerhouse which wants to become the major supplier of oil but Saudi oil and Qatari gas would be pipelined through secularcontrolled Assads Syria and this is why the US and its fundamentalistSunni allies the Sauds and Qataris are using Al Qaeda and other jihadists to conquer enough of a strip through Syria so that US companies such as Halliburton will be able safely to place pipelines there to be marketed in Europe by US firms such as Exxon Iran also wants to pipeline its gas through Syria and this is one reason why Iran is defending Syrias government against the USSaudiQatarijihadist invasion which is trying to overthrow and replace Assad Here are the mostinformative of Anadolus warmaps The first presents the effort by many countries to eliminate ISIS control over the large Iraqi city of Mosul A remarkably frank remark made in this map is An escape corridor into Syria will be left for Daesh ISIS so they can vacate Mosul an admission that the USSaudiQatari team want the ISIS jihadists who are in Mosul to relocate into Syria to assist the USSaudiQatari effort there to overthrow and replace the Assad government The second is about the Egyptian governments trying to assist the Syrian governments defense against the SaudiUSQatari invasion of Syria at Aleppo where Syrias Al Qaeda branch is trying to retain its current control over part of that large city The Saud family are punishing the Egyptian government for that Here is Russias proposed gaspipeline which would enable Russia to reduce its dependence upon Ukraine through which Russia currently pipelines its gas into Europe Obama conquered and took over Ukraine in February 2014 via his coup that overthrew the democratically elected neutralist Ukrainian President there  In addition there is the following map from oilpricecom  That map shows the competing Shia Russiabacked and Sunni USbacked gaspipelines into Europe  the central issue in the invasion and defense of Syria On 21 September 2016 Gareth Porter headlined The War Against the Assad Regime Is Not a Pipeline War and he pointed out some errors in Robert F Kennedy Jrs account that had been published under the headline Syria Another Pipeline War  Porter argued Its easy to understand why that explanation would be accepted by many antiwar activists it is in line with the widely accepted theory that all the US wars in the Middle East have been oil wars  about getting control of the petroleum resources of the region and denying them to Americas enemies But the pipeline war theory is based on false history and it represents a distraction from the real problem of US policy in the Middle East  the US war states determination to hold onto its military posture in the region Porter ignored the key question there as to why the US war state has a determination to hold onto its military posture in the region Opening and protecting potential oilgaspipeline routes are important reasons why Clearly Kennedys documentation that the CIA was trying as early as 1949 to overthrow Syrias secular government so as to allow to the Sauds a means of cheaply transporting their oil through Syria into Europe remains unaffected by any of the objections that Porter raised to Kennedys article The recent portion of Kennedys timeline is affected but not his basic argument Furthermore any military strategist knows that the US war state is intimately connected to the US oilandgas industries including pipelines oilfield services as well as marketing Exxon etc And Porter got entirely wrong what that connection which he ignored actually consists of it consists of US government taxpayerfunded killers for those US international corporations Here is how Barack Obama put it  when addressing graduating cadets at West Point Americas premier militarytraining institution Russias aggression toward former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe while Chinas economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors From Brazil to India rising middle classes compete with us and governments seek a greater say in global forums And even as developing nations embrace democracy and market economies 24hour news and social media makes it impossible to ignore the continuation of sectarian conflicts and failing states and popular uprisings that might have received only passing notice a generation ago It will be your generations task to respond to this new world The question we face the question each of you will face is not whether America will lead but how we will lead  not just to secure our peace and prosperity but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe He was saying there that Americas military is in service to USbased international corporations in their competition against those of Russia Brazil China India and anywhere else in which rising middle classes compete with us Those places are what Gareth Porter referred to as Americas enemies Economic competitors are enemies Obama thinks that way and even a progressive journalist such as Porter doesnt place into a skeptical singlequotationmarksurround the phrase Americas enemies when that phrase is used in this equational context On both the right Obama and the left Porter the equation of a government and of the international corporations that headquarter in its nation  the treatment of the military as being an enforcementarm for the nations international corporations  is simply taken for granted not questioned not challenged RFK Jr was correct notwithstanding some recent timelineerrors Syria is Another Pipeline War and Obama is merely intensifying it On 9 November 2015 I offered a different account than RFK Jr provided of the recent history  the Obama portion  of the longstanding US aggression against Syria and it links back to Jonathan Marshalls excellent articles on that and to other wellsourced articles in addition to primary sources none of which contradict RFK Jrs basic view Syria Another Pipeline War Another portion of Porters commentary is however quite accurate Americas Defense or masskillingabroad industries such as Lockheed Martin are not merely servants of the US government but are also served by the US government the US war states determination to hold onto its military posture in the region is protection of the major market  the Middle Eastern market  for US Defense products and services Its not only Americas firms in the oil gas and pipelines industries which benefit from Americas military it is also Americas firms in the masskilling industries that do To the extent that the public here including Barack Obama and Gareth Porter do not condemn the presumption that the business of America is business or that a valid function of UStaxpayerfunded military and other foreignaffairs operations is to serve the stockholders of US international corporations the hell such as in Syria will continue Gareth Porter got lost among the trees because he failed to see and to point to that forest
