I did not watch the Benghazi hearings unlike many others in hopes of catching Secretary Clinton out with my ears perked up for some admission that could sink her presidential ambitionsSecretary Clinton did not disappoint in her performance on ThursdayShe admitted to no wrongdoing nor to breaking any lawsMistakes were made by others the fault lies elsewhereShe put up with hours and hours of questions and no one laid a glove on her  Secretary Clinton was far more adept at bobbing and weaving than the members of Congress who questioned her were at pinning her downShe brushed off blame by saying security decisions were handled at lower levels of the State Department professional staff not by the secretaryShe didnt receive Ambassador Stevens requests for more security  implying that if only she had things might have turned out differentlyIt was a masterful performance She showed enormous discipline and nearly superhuman staminaShe let nothing slip But in the end she let everything slip She got a perfect score but failed the testShe didnt mean to but she showed us a glimpse into her soulIt was chilling  We now know that when Secretary Clinton met the plane carrying the bodies of the four Americans who died at Benghazi that the Obama administration had intially lied about what happenedShe stood over the flagdraped coffins of four dead Americans knowing that the first narrative blamed their deaths on an Internet video which caused a demonstration outside the consulate to turn into a deadly attack when she already knew the truthShe looked into the eyes of the families of the fallen heroes knowing all about thatShe always knew they died from a planned terrorist attack from an Al Qaedalike group Thats what she told her family and foreign leaders according to newly released emailsSo why support the false narrative at the start Because the Obama administration had an election to win eight weeks later and a terrorist attack that killed four Americans didnt fit into that plan  President Obama asked voters to reelect him because he had killed Usama bin Laden Al Qaeda was on the ropes Qaddafi was dead and the Libyan war a success The wave of war was a receding President George W Bushs War on Terror was over because Obama and Clinton had won it  A terrorist attack that killed Americans at Benghazi did not fit into that campaign narrative so it had to be retold and spun into a different story It wasnt radical Islamist terrorists but a spontaneous demonstration that got out of control in reaction to an obscure Internet video  In the end the Benghazi hearings probably didnt change many mindsSecretary Clintons supporters will say it was a waste of time a politically motivated witchhuntSecretary Clintons detractors will say she never answered the questionsBut for me it wasnt the questions or the answers that matteredIt wasnt about negligence or criminality or incompetenceInstead it was  and still is  about character And Secretary Clinton has been found wantingThe even greater tragedy is Secretary Clinton doesnt think she did anything wrong In todays Washington integrity and truth telling  even to mourning families  take a backseat to the relentless pursuit of powerNo wonder the rest of the country wants to throw all the bums outKathleen Troia KT McFarland is a Fox News National Security Analyst and host of FoxNewscoms DefCon 3 She served in national security posts in the Nixon Ford and Reagan administrations
