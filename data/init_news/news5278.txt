If theyd known the 2016 Republican contest would end up this way  a monument to one billionaires ego  CNN and its GOP partners could have switched Wednesdays presidential debate from the Reagan Library to a more appropriate venue Hearst Castle just up the California coastAfter all William Randolph Hearst and Donald Trump have this much in common Each ran for president Hearst as a Democrat in 1904 Neither was a fan of those whohabla espaolHearst cheerleading for the SpanishAmerican War Both plutocrats would have you believe they cared about ordinary folks Hearsts slogan the people who work for a livingHearst turned out to be a political flop And Trump Itll take a few more GOP debates to see what fate has in store for the man who builds not castles but towers and resorts bearing his nameThere were three threshold questions going into Wednesday nights festivities1 Could the GOPs troika of nonpoliticians  Trump Dr Ben Carson and business executive Carly Fiorina  show theyre more than a protest vote2 Could former Florida Gov Jeb Bush put forward a passion and wit that his friends insist he possesses but he seems loath to display3 Could Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker a hot commodity earlier this summer breath new life into a campaign thats stalled in the earlyprimary statesThe answers to those questions1 Trump showed no growth  same old Donald same vagaries about domestic and foreign policy Carson spoke only when spoken to a startling lowkey alternative to other attentionstarved debaters maybe its part of Carsons strategy that social media trumps television Well get to Fiorina in a moment2 Bush showed improvement over his performance in the Cleveland Fox News debate granted a low bar to clear Two moments to remember when he stood up to Trump and stood up for his brother he kept us safe at the end of the debate when he chose Eveready as his Secret Service name its very high energy Donald That should quell his nervous financial base  for now3 Another rough night for Walker already not popular in California GOP circles for bailing on the state partys convention Back to Wisconsin for the governor and figuring what to do in IowaIf we can call two occurrences a trend then heres a big problem with the GOP debates thus far Instead of a level playing field for the candidates imagine a radial spoke with Trump at the center of the scheme For the nonDonalds the closeup moments tend to be Trumprelated  and in a bad way Bush for example asked to respond to Trumps comments about his wifes Mexican heritage Is this because what Trump has to say is all that compelling or are the moderators trying to keep the big audiences from clicking their remotesAnd that leads us to Carly Fiorina the star of the Reagan Library debateFive weeks ago I wrotethis columnabout the former HewlettPackard executive after her bravura performance at the first of the two debates in Cleveland Her performance that night jumpstarted her campaign bumped her poll numbers and with the candidates persistent shaming of CNN landed her a spot in prime timeOn Wednesday in Simi Valley as in Cleveland she aced it No other GOP hopeful could match Fiorinas depth and clear conciseness on defense strategy missile defense strengthen the 6thFleetNo one was tougher on Hillary Clinton who else could get away with repeatedly calling her a liar Fiorina had the good sense to handle the Trump faceslap with dignity  saying in effect that voters are smart enough to know what the man intended Trumps feeble attempt to close out that segment by saying he thought she was attractive Maybe his flattest moment of the nightBonus points for Fiorina she was the only one of the bunch who didnt pander to the question about a new face on the 10 bill spinning it into a call for women to be recognized as equals not an interest groupTrump in fact had several flat moments  taking a swipe at Rand Pauls hair saying he didnt mean to slur Columba Bush then refusing to apologize to her in person Most disturbing of all the ideas cupboard is still lightly stockedDoes this mean weve reached the end of Trump Fever One doubts it The GOP is headed for an uncomfortable stretch during which the party will be at odds with itself over government shutdowns Planned Parenthood funding and fallout from the Iran deal Thats fuel for the fire for an antipolitician like Trump it might also give Texas Sen Ted Cruz a needed boostBesides Trump is good for ratings which might be why CNN began the debate with an uncomfortable Donaldrelated question as did Fox News in its debate But CNN took matters a step further clumping the candidates close together keeping them on the stage for long stretches between bathroom breaks preventing candidates from speaking for long stretches  all ways to elevate tensionMaybe Trump isnt going away anytime soon But on Wednesday night there were signs that the acts beginning to wear thinAnd Carly Fiorina On the debate stage she wears it wellBill Whalen
