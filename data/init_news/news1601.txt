To its critics President Obamas strategy to combat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is weak and incoherent Even some of the staunchest US allies and partners in the fight worry that the time for what they see as the administrations incremental approach has long since passedThe White House maintains that its strategy is comprehensive and that its working Sharp increases in airstrikes and Obamas recent decision to deploy Special Operations troops officials say are part of a fundamental change in the militarys mission developed this fall along with a new diplomatic push to end the distraction of Syrias civil warIn his Sundaynight address to the nation following last weeks San Bernardino Calif shooting Obama outlined the elements of the strategy assuring Americans that there is a viable plan underway to decimate the Islamic State where it lives We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us he said using an alternative name for the militantsBut the White House is clearly frustrated by its failure to communicate the elements of that plan and what it believes has been accomplishedYes there is a strategy Secretary of State John F Kerry snapped in a speech Saturday I know the criticism We all hear them  But that doesnt mean its wisdomThe administrations insistence that its prudence and patience will pay off  vs charges of too little too late  have been the two opposing narratives of the 18month battle against the Islamic State and the fouryear Syrian war it has now overshadowedAn examination of the recent course of events on the military and diplomatic fronts and interviews with a broad range of stakeholders and experts provide fuel for both argumentsFor more than a year after the Islamic State blitzkrieg swept across Syria and through Iraq to the Baghdad suburbs in the early summer of 2014 US military operations including airstrikes and training of local ground troops were in what a coalition spokesman Col Steve Warren called crisis mode just trying to keep the barbarians off the gateThe Iraqi army had fallen apart In Syria as civil war raged in the west the militants consolidated their control over the northcentral and eastern areas of the country with virtually free access to Syrias border with Turkey to infiltrate tens of thousands of foreign fighters and equipmentAirstrikes begun by the United States and its coalition partners  Europeans in Iraq and Arab states in Syria  were tactical focused on targets of opportunity and the need to prevent collapse While domestic critics and allies in the region called for more strikes more support for Syrian rebels more US boots on the ground and nofly zones the administration demurredIn a broad assessment in August the Pentagon determined it had succeeded in its initial goals of stopping further Islamic State expansion and reestablishing the foundations of a viable Iraqi military Amid repeated failures in Syria to organize and arm a rebel force to fight against the militants in Syria it found hope in the establishment of a Syrian Kurdish and Arab force that has driven the militants from much of the Turkish borderAdoption of what the military says is its first real operational strategy following the chaos of the initial year was marked by Septembers change of command of the Baghdadbased headquarters of the USled coalition against the Islamic State You have done what was necessary US Central Command Gen Lloyd J Austin III told departing Lt Gen James L TerryThe new commander Lt Gen Sean MacFarland was charged with operationalizing the mission Warren saidWe always wanted to get into a position where we could apply multiple points of pressure at once across the whole battle space said a senior administration official Were now in position to actually do it Its not going to be perfect its not going to be linear its going to be extremely hardMilitary and administration officials most speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal decisionmaking listed the elements of the comprehensive offensive against core ISIL on the ground in both Syria and IraqIn Iraq the focus has been on cutting Islamic State supply lines into Mosul the militant bastion in the northwest in preparation for an eventual ground assault and applying simultaneous pressure along militant front lines stretching south to the city of Ramadi 70miles west of Baghdad These are not blitzkrieg gains Warren said but painstaking incremental work against a dugin enemy now made more effective with the ability to integrate airstrikes with a more organized and robust ground forceObama has authorized a new Iraqbased Special Operations task force to conduct ground raids against Islamic State leadership targets in both Iraq and Syria Administration officials have described a snowballing cycle in which more raids will take more leaders off the battlefield and provide more intelligence to plan still more raids But it is unclear when the force initially to number about 100 will be deployedSyria with its separate wars against the Islamic State and between forces of President Bashar alAssad and rebels seeking to unseat him is far more complicatedRegional allies such as Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Jordan who once flew strike missions along with US warplanes have largely dropped out an absence the United States hopes to make up with new agreements with France and BritainThe whole battle space concept includes simultaneous airstrikes along the eastern border with Iraq to further cut militant supply lines on Islamic Statecontrolled oil fields and in the northcentral area where Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces who have captured a wide swath of territory along the border from the militants are organizing to attack the de facto militant capital of RaqqaObama has authorized the deployment of 50 Special Operations troops the first official US boots on the ground in Syria to join those forces to assess their readiness and help develop tactical plans although the Americans are not expected to arrive for several months defense officials saidIn southern Syria antiAssad rebels have met with significant success against government forces but the Islamic State sensing an opening has begun moving into the area The United States is sending more money and equipment including heavy longrange artillery to Jordan both to protect its own border and to engage militant targets inside SyriaBut given the new threat to the homeland the administrations claims of incremental success have left scornful critics asking why it does not do more Asked on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday what he hoped to hear in Obamas speech presidential hopeful Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC replied That hes going to change his strategy and come up with a regional army to go in destroy the caliphate in Raqqa  The president doesnt have a strategyMutual frustration has also been ongoing between the United States as coalition leader and regional allies with some calling for a more aggressive US policy The United Arab Emirates said last week that it was willing to send ground forces into Syria  something Obama has consistently refused  if others would do the same as part of an international forceBut the regions governments including Turkey are also deeply divided among themselves leaving the administration as both whipping boy for their complaints and mediator for their disagreements as it tries to implement a broad strategy In recent weeks as Kerry has launched a diplomatic effort to bring the civil war to an end in order to shift attention to the counterterrorism fight Obama himself has intervened in a series of conversations with regional leaders including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi King SalmanNowhere is the dissention more acute than in northwest Syria where rebel groups separately backed by the United States and Europe the Persian Gulf Arab states and Turkey are locked in a melange of battles often beside forces of alQaeda affiliate Jabhat alNusra against Assads militaryThe entry of Russian warplanes and Iranian troops on Assads side in western Syria has further complicated the situation increasing the conundrum of how to take back the nearby remaining 60mile strip of the SyriaTurkey border in Islamic State handsThe coalition has said it is ready to launch an allout air offensive to drive the militants out of the area located north of Aleppo Syrias mostpopulous city but not until there are opposition forces on the ground ready to occupy the terrain And the more the rebels are engaged in the Russianaided fight against Assad the less willing they are to switch their attention to the borderUS officials say that a small force of opposition fighters in the area including about 130 Syrians trained by the Americans in Jordan who are in direct communication with US forces have had some success But their operations are still rudimentary To delineate their lines from those of the Islamic State and avoid their own casualties from coalition airstrikes they light tires on fire and warn pilots to avoid the smoke
