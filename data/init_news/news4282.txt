OK theoretically everything will go according to plan and Donald Trump will be the next presidentBut technically the selection hasnt really taken place yetPresidential electors of the mystified electoral college must still actually vote for the president and there isnt anything to keep them from voting their conscience and choosing someone other than Donald TrumpMoreover it appears that there is an active effort to flip the electoral college to deny Trump the presidency and toss the White House to either Hillary or a GOP loyalistThe NeverTrump crowd and plenty of bitter Hillary supporters are still hoping for a coup though even they admit it is a long shot  completely unprecedented and anything but likelyAccording to the Blaze Donald Trump may have won the electoral votes necessary to win the White House but he hes likely going to lose the popular vote to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton And now two electors have launched a lastminute effort to convince their colleagues to abandon the presidentelect This is a long shot Its a hail Mary Bret Chiafolo a Washington state elector who previously pledged not to vote for Clinton told Politico Monday However I do see situations where  when weve already had two or three Republican electors state publicly they didnt want to vote for Trump How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in privateChiafolo along with Colorado elector Micheal Baca have launched what they call a moral electors movement in hopes of convincing 37 of their Republican colleagues to deny Trump their votes Should they succeed in their radical effort the presidential decision would be thrown to the Republicancontrolled House of RepresentativesThe Electoral College consists of 538 members who are expected to convene in their respective state capitals on Dec 19 to formally vote for the next president Baca said he hopes the move launches a serious national discussion about abolishing the Electoral College  which would require either a constitutional amendment or legislation in several statesThe speculation is that if this maneuver were to be successful the GOPled Congress could be persuaded not to choose Hillary but to writein a selection for a party loyalist  like Mitt Romney or John Kasich maybe even a BushOf course there have also been reports that Team Hillary has been hard at work attempting to persuade electors to switch their votes in the hope however desperate that they can still flip the election and take the White HouseOn December 19 the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots If they all vote the way their states voted Donald Trump will win However they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose Even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton Why Mr Trump is unfit to serveThe larger issue here is that the system is badly broken the people are harshly divided along demographic and political lines and the future is gambling on extreme versions of itself  larger than life candidates and bizarre backdoor maneuvers in attempt to hack the system and bend it in one direction or anotherTrump has taken his place on the stage in a thunderous revolt of the people but his legacy will be tested out the gates by the heavy pressures of Washington lobbyists intrigue on the part of political insiders and the cults of opposition that are springing up in response to his controversial journey to the White HouseThe entire political establishment have been knocked off their perch though their hold on power has not necessarily been loosenedA whole new era is born and it remains to be seen how it will play outRead more Its Not Over Yet They Are Probably Still Trying To Steal The Election  Calls For Electoral College To Ignore Will Of People Clinton Insider Confesses Trump Protests Are Just More PrePaid Soros Riots to Stir Unrest Beware of the Shadow Government Ron Paul Advises PresidentElect Trump Surrounded By Bankers Wall St Insiders Banging on the Door to Get In Draining the Swamp Violent Revolution If Trump Lets Them Down People Remain Poised for Angry Revolt  Roberts
