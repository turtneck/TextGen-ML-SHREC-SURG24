Pope Francis making historys first papal address to the US Congress on Thursday implored Americas leaders to accept those born in other countries as their own children urging lawmakers to set aside political differences and embrace people who travel north in search of a better lifeThe pope wrapped traditional Catholic teachings into a celebration of American icons including Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr drawing lessons from their work to gently but firmly push Congress to move beyond the partisan paralysis that has blocked progress on immigration reform climate change and other issuesEach son or daughter of a given country has a mission a personal and social responsibility the 78yearold pontiff said in heavily accented English Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country by your legislative activity to grow as a nationPresident Obama watched the speech on television according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest Pope Francis made the appropriate observation for the United States to live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves Earnest saidLIVE UPDATES The latest on Pope Francis in AmericaThe Capitol Hill call to action kicked off a second full day of gleeful crowds and emotional visits to Catholic institutions The faithful gathered at the Apostolic Nunciature or Vatican embassy to greet the pope when he emerged More lined the streets as his motorcade traveled to the Capitol where thousands waited on the Mall to watch his speech on giant screensAfter his address to Congress the pope went directly from the grandeur of Capitol Hill to the spare St Patricks Catholic Church in a neighborhood that has flipped over the past decade from marginalized to magnet He prayed with people who variously wore suits and torn Tshirts and he blessed the meals of more than 300 homeless peopleUpon arrival at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York the pope traveled by helicopter and motorcade to a very different St Patricks the soaring cathedral on Manhattans Fifth Avenue for an evening serviceThere the pontiff began his homily by expressing my sentiments of closeness with Muslims after the tragic stampede that killed more than 700 pilgrims near Mecca on Thursday the first day of Eid alAdha one of the holiest Muslim holidays I unite myself with all prayers to Almighty God the merciful he saidHe spoke directly to nuns and women in the church saying What would the church be without you He also referenced the clergy sex scandal for the second time on this visit lamenting the shame caused by brothers who harmed and scandalized the church in the most vulnerable of her membersThe pontiff will carry his message to world leaders Friday when he speaks at a meeting of the United Nations General AssemblyIn his speech to Congress Francis crafted an address saturated in American references with special praise for the nations role as a land which has inspired so many people to dreamHe was pointed at times urging the abolition of the death penalty and the end of arms trading and warning of the dangers of religious extremism worldwide And he was oblique at points never directly mentioning abortion or the United States rapid embrace of samesex marriage saying only that the family is being threatened and that fundamental relationships are being called into question as is the very basis of marriage and the familyHe saved his most specific prescription for combating climate change a cause on which he said the United States has a special obligation to leadI call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity the pope said I am convinced that we can make a difference  Im sure And I have no doubt that the United States  and this Congress  have an important role to play Now is the time for courageous actions and strategiesThe pope who helped broker a diplomatic opening with Cuba offered himself and his example as a pastoral link between opposing points of view It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women in any way possible to do the same he said A good political leader is one who with the interests of all in mind seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatismAlthough members of Congress largely avoided the ostentatious displays of partisan cheering that have come to characterize the presidents annual State of the Union addresses an ideological divide was apparent at times In response to Franciss passage about climate change Democrats mostly stood and cheered while some Republicans stayed seated and applauded mildly if at allBut the response to the popes passionate words about embracing immigrants seemed to strike a bipartisan chord Sen Marco Rubio RFla a presidential candidate and son of Cuban immigrants wiped away tears as the pope called himself the son of immigrantsPope Francis I always was interested in politicsPope Francis tempered his call for action with a statement of support for the role that business plays in society calling it a noble vocation directed to producing wealth and improving the worldThe creation and distribution of wealth he said is a vital element in the fight against poverty and climate changeThose looking for signs of this popes political direction could find evidence in the speechs repeated references to a pantheon of liberal heroes from Dorothy Day who dedicated her life to a battle against poverty and war to Thomas Merton whose Letters to a White Liberal written in 1963 urged Christians to follow their faith and join the fight for civil rights for black AmericansThe pope praised King for his focus on liberty in plurality and nonexclusion Day for social justice and Merton for dialogue and openness to God6 reasons the popes speech could be awkward for some lawmakersFrancis implored Congress to reject a mindset of hostility and embrace the immigrants who come to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedomThe pope noting that many in Congress are also children of people who made the risky journey to America said the nation must follow the golden rule and treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treatedWe must not be taken aback by their numbers he said but rather view them as persons seeing their faces and listening to their stories trying to respond as best we can to their situationFranciss emphasis on immigrants is a matter of selfinterest for a US church that is rapidly becoming majority Latino Parishes across the white Northeast are shuttered while many in the West and South are bursting with Spanishlanguage MassesThat focus also dovetails with the major theme of his American trip so far a series of reminders that his papacy is very much about renewing the churchs focus on the poor and the powerless The pope this year opened a 30bedroom homeless shelter just steps from the Vatican He had showers set up for homeless people in St Peters Square and he invited about 150 homeless people to a private viewing of the Sistine ChapelIn New York he will get a direct look at innercity Catholic education when he visits a school in East Harlem and meets with immigrants and refugees In Philadelphia where he will end his US visit the pope will visit a prison to meet with inmates In Washington his visit at St Patricks immediately  and pointedly  followed his hour in the majestic House chamber The plain sanctuary of the 220yearold downtown church was filled with people who need basic life services But as Francis noted In prayer there is no first or second classI need your prayers your support the pontiff said standing at a simple wooden podium before a reverentially silent flock Would you like to pray togetherThe hush broke like the uncorking of a bottle YesAmericans are largely supportive of the popes engagement on economic social and environmental issues But American Catholics who make up about onefifth of the US electorate remain deeply divided over their churchs directivesPoll Americans love this pope His church Not as muchOne Catholic congressman Rep Paul A Gosar RAriz skipped the popes appearance to protest Franciss advocacy for strong action against global climate change and what Gosar sees as the popes failure to speak out with moral authority against violent IslamThe many lawmakers who were inside the chamber on Thursday emerged with bipartisan agreement that the popes central message was simple Just get alongOn the Capitol lawn many of those who watched the popes congressional address on giant video screens came away convinced that Congress should  but probably wont  take his message to heartI was not expecting him to address the bipartisan divide said Emily Warn 62 a writer from Seattle Its as if he was trying to heal CongressIn a country where the oldline Catholic population is diminishing because many families are having fewer children  though a wave of Hispanic immigrants is partly making up for that decline in numbers  the pope spoke to young Catholics especially those who are disoriented and aimless trapped in a hopeless maze of violence abuse and despairThey will have children he said only if the nation provides them with a greater sense of possibilities for the futureAfter the address Francis walked through the Capitols second floor to Statuary Hall and paused at the statue of Junpero Serra the California missionary whom he had canonized on WednesdayThe pontiff then joined Vice President Biden House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio and other congressional leaders on the speakers balcony overlooking the West Front of the Capitol greeting an enthusiastic crowd that numbered in the thousands He said a few words of thanks in Spanish and then to great cheers switched to English Thank you very much and God bless AmericaSarah Pulliam Bailey DeNeen L Brown Pamela Constable Jessica Contrera Ed
