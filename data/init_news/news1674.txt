Pinterest Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is clearly not in good health and for a couple of campaign events she actually managed to do we have more video of her failing health which the liberal mainstream media tries to sweep under the rug  On Thursday Clinton struggled to climb the steps of her campaign plane on her way to a rally in Winston Salem North Carolina The rainy day had Clinton holding an umbrella as she labored her way up the stairs Live Satellite News posted the video and noted that Clinton appeared to be mumbling to herself Clinton almost missed a stair and as The American Mirror pointed out from the time she left her motorcade all the way up the plane stairs Clinton seemed wobbly and unsteady Watch the video below yourself where Clinton appeared to be pained as she climbed the campaign plane stairs The American Mirror posted another video this time from The Last Stand in which Clinton couldnt tackle an approximately 18inch step without assistance The title of the video referenced Clintons Stronger Together campaign slogan  one that she apparently has taken literally thanks to her clearly failing health As you can see in the second video the man who assisted Clinton didnt just happen to be there and thought it would be nice to extend a hand to the elderly woman No he bounded over to Clinton when she neared the step He stood nearby in what looked like an effort to be ready to help her descend the single step or steady her on the platform Now some who havent followed the campaign closely may think that this is nitpicky but it isnt Its a little odd on its own but when you add it to the mountain of evidence over the years of Clintons failing health it says a great deal Can you imagine the media uproar if Donald Trump exhibited a tenth of the issues Clinton has on the campaign trail You dont have to  just this week Trump took 90 minutes off of the campaign trail to open his new Washington hotel Washington Trump International and CNNs Dana Bash managed to ask a question that served as a dig For people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this Bash asked Trump with his hectic schedule that more than puts Clinton to shame wasnt having it For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps Yet youll ask me that question Hes right There have been numerous examples of Clintons failing health that have barely gained media attention aside from her collapse at a Sept 11 memorial this year that forced the biased media to reluctantly cover it The media is in the bag for Clinton theres no doubt about it  They may not note her clear health issues that she refuses to disclose the public but we will
