By Christina SarichJordan  Youve already heard of solar panels that can sustainably provide energy but what about an ultrahigh tech solar panel that can provide doublypure twice distilled water for a family of four out of thin airA new start up company called Zero Mass Water that wont rely on outdated municipal water with decaying pipes full of lead to deliver water to the middle billion and underserved people lacking clean drinking water in the world It will create it with solar panels and a technology that capitalizes on moisture in the airThe companys tag line is drinking water democratized and it certainly seems to stand for the exact opposite world view of say Nestle  which has been stealing water from people and San Bernardino National Forest reserves and then selling it back to people in plastic water bottles Zero Mass Water can deliver clean water to people in the poorest nations with no need for piping or complicated water plants The solar panel itself is smaller than a traditional air conditioner and can be placed in remote areas with easeThe United Nations claims that more than 783 million people currently lack clean drinking water and more than 6 million people die annually from waterborne disease They also claim that with population growth we can expect a 50 percent increase in water demand but they havent accounted for simple technologies which can make use of millions of gallons of water using clean sustainable and even simple technologies The demand for water could also easily be met by practicing better water harvesting catchment and filteringZero Mass Water joins other breakthrough technologies like the Drinkable Book and experimental wastewater filters  which are trying to bring water to every corner of the worldA blog post from Duke Energy a partner in Zero Masss project claims the water purification system doesnt need an outside source of energy so it can be placed were infrastructure is damaged or nonexistentAt a recent installation in the coastal city of Guayaquil Ecuador a medical clinic was able to enjoy clean water for the first time without having to haul it in with trucks  an expensive endeavor Though it rains frequently in Ecuador there is little potable water The project has targeted an even larger area for humanitarian aid  watergenerating solar panels are being placed in Jordan The company claims the panels will help Syrian refugees in the country possibly aiding 200000 people who currently have no access to clean drinking waterIf Zero Mass Water is successful in a wartorn area their solar panels might also be perfect for the 5300 cities across the US who have been drinking leadcontaminated water due to crumbling infrastructure and a political elite who have been unwilling to replace old pipes with new ones along with expensive water filters on municipal suppliesWhen the sun can bring you energy and drinking water there is little need for poverty illhealth and reliance upon aging government and corporate structures  This invention truly could democratize water for the planetThis article  These New Solar Panels Use Sunlight to Create Clean Drinking Water from the Air  is free and open source You have permission to republish this article under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Christina Sarich and UndergroundReporterorg  If you spot a typo please email the error and the name of the article to undergroundreporter2016gmailcom  Image credit Pexels
