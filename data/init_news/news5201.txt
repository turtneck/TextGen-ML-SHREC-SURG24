DES MOINES Iowa Trueblue Democratic activists at a party fundraising dinner Friday night were positively giddy to have two possible presidential contenders there live and in person  Martin OMalley and Jim Webb  and their frontrunner Hillary Clinton ready to dive into the raceBut theyve got plenty of questions on their minds for Clinton who kicked off her campaign Sunday and her potential challengers for the Democratic nomination Heres what they had to say in interviews with The Des Moines Register at the Polk County Democrats Spring Dinner1 WILL CLINTON START TO STAND FOR SOMETHINGIt has been nearly eight years since Clinton campaigned here and no one knows what to expect said many of the activists gathered at a labor union hall in Des MoinesTheyre wondering Has she grown into a more conservative Democrat over the years Or will she take cues from ultraleft heartthrob Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and have the guts to stand tall on progressive issues Will she have what it takes to capture the aspirations of the peopleIm a Hillary supporter but I havent closed my mind to say Its Hillary or nobody said Joan Thorup a Des Moines Beaverdale resident who has already met OMalley three times Things may have changed since the last time I saw her on the campaign trailSeveral union members taking a smoke break outside the United Auto Workers hall where the dinner was held said the last time they heard Clinton speak at the Harkin Steak Fry in September she said nothing substantiveAsked how she can reignite a blaze of passion in Iowa Earl Agan Jr answered I dont think she can Hes business manager for the Operative Plasterers  Cement Masons International Association Local No 21 and Area 561 Iowa Weve had too many Clintons and Bushes I wont vote for herAgan blanches at news reports about Clintons family foundation accepting millions of dollars from Middle Eastern countries known for violence against women sex discrimination and other human rights abuses It doesnt play well he saidBut several of Agans fellow labor activists said if Clinton gives some homerun speeches detailing how shed deal with income inequality she could win allegianceOther Iowa Democrats said theyre confident that the corporate marketing geniuses who have taken leaves of absence from their highpowered jobs to help the Clinton campaign will know how to refresh an older brand2 WHAT WILL THE DIVIDING LINES BEWhat tack can possible Democratic challengers like former Maryland governor Martin OMalley and former senator Jim Webb of Virginia take to successfully pry Iowa voters away from ClintonIm not sure how theyll draw distinctions Patty Judge a former lieutenant governor said after listening to both mens speeches Theyre both great guys and they both have a great story to tell but how theyre going to distinguish themselves I dont knowSeveral Democrats describing the economy and personal prosperity as base issues said the dividing line will be ideas for championing the middle class Some have voiced misgivings about Clintons corporate connections said Rick Smith an Urbandalebased Democrat known as a superactivistOther Democrats said theyll be hunting for the contender whos most fierce on climate changeAnother likely litmus test will be the Iraq war and what Clinton says about dealing with the Islamic State and the instability it has spawned Some antiwar Iowans will never forgive Clinton for her yes vote 12 years ago in favor of going to war in Iraq several activists saidAnd the general election may well turn on foreign policy Smith predictedIn Webbs Iowa speech Friday night his refrain was that he took principled stances It wasnt easy to be one of the earliest to say the Iraq war was wrong he said But five months before the vote he wrote a guest piece for the Washington Post saying the war was going to be a strategic blunder he said3 WILL ANY LABORERS MIGRATE TO THE GOPA moderate GOP presidential candidate who supports construction of projects like the Keystone XL and Bakken pipelines could attract Democratic building trades workers tired of the Big Environmental lobby blocking projects that could put Iowa laborers to workSeveral union members told the Register that the reality is that the United States isnt going to divest from oil and they believe the country can have pipelines and a clean environment at the same timeOMalley opposes the Keystone line and told the Register he didnt know details about the Bakken line which would cross Iowa but likely opposes it Clinton has yet to fully explain her position on the Keystone pipeline Webb is a proponent of itIowa activists are also worried that Republicans will outDemocrat the Democrats with compelling populist ideas Republicans will argue that the GOP can best help working people improve their livesI often hear people say theres no difference in the parties I try not to get mad but say Can we talk Smith told the dinner audience4 WILL CLINTON ENGAGE IN A REAL BATTLE WITH FELLOW DEMOCRATSEvery activist the Register interviewed at the dinner proclaimed joy that OMalley and Webb appear on the cusp of presidential bids They also still hope Warren and Vermont US Sen Bernie Sanders run partly to pull Clinton to the leftIm open to them all said Desmund Adams a Clive businessman I dont think the passion is connected to the candidate The passion is connected to the politicsFolks want to see a Democrat win Thats what pays the bills said Adams who has launched an exploratory committee as he considers running for Congress in Iowas 3rd DistrictSeveral Democrats said they will be watching to see whether Clinton engages in a real battle with her challengers rather than ignoring them or pussyfooting around them with kind words5 WILL CLINTON SHOUT DOWN THE GOPNot only do Iowa Democrats want a vigorous DemocratonDemocrat fight for the caucuses they want to see their presidential contenders play hard with the GOP hitting back with satisfying quotable onelinersWe cannot let them get away with these misstatements these constant misstatements of the facts Smith saidDes Moines Democrat Sophia Douglas noted Republicans furor over Clinton using a private email server as secretary of State which has thwarted public scrutiny of her messages After dealing with plenty of faux scandals like that she said The Clintons should know better by nowDouglas said the GOP battle cry over the Benghazi Libya terrorist attacks that killed four Americans didnt seem to rattle Clinton I loved how she was looking at them like I can eat you for breakfast lunch and dinner Douglas said She knows how to throw a punch and she knows how to take a punchWhen Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker goes on his antilabor rants the Iowa activists said they want their candidates to stand up to him and explain to Iowans how repugnant that isAnd theyre fed up with the GOP contenders dominating the newspaper headlines and airwavesIt drives me crazy said Jerry Tormey an Urbandale Democrat Were not getting equal time and theyre saying such ludicrous stuff So we need HillaryAnd we need Martin OMalley Tormey added And we need Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders
