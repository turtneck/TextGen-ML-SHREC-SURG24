Go to Article The people have the power all we have to do is awaken that power in the people The people are unaware Theyre not educated to realize that they have power The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything We are the government  John Lennon How do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being tasered  teargassed peppersprayed  hit with batons shot with rubber bullets and real bullets blasted with sound cannons  detained in cages and kennels  sicced by police dogs arrested and jailed for challenging the governments excesses abuses and powergrabs Politics wont fix a system that is broken beyond repair No matter who sits in the White House the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes Relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile Indeed with every ruling handed down it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice with government courts largely lacking in vision and scope rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law This is true at all levels of the judiciary but especially so in the highest court of the land the US Supreme Court which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution Even so justice matters It matters whether youre a rancher protesting a federal landgrab by the Bureau of Land Management a Native American protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies or an AfricanAmerican taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen Unfortunately protests and populist movements havent done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries dumb to our troubles blind to our needs and accountable to no one It doesnt matter who the activists are environmentalists peaceniks Native Americans Black Lives Matter Occupy or the Bundys and their followers or what the source of the discontent is endless wars abroad police shootings contaminated drinking water government landgrabs the governments modus operandi has remained the same shut down the protests using all means available prosecute First Amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities labelling dissidents as extremists or terrorists and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root Thus if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws tactics and policies that are illegitimate egregious or blatantly unconstitutional Just recently in fact an Oregon jury rejected the governments attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a sixweek armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge In finding the defendants not guiltyof conspiracy to impede federal officers of possession of firearms in a federal facility and of stealing a governmentowned truckthe jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case justice matters The Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility their lawyers argued the guns were as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks thereby preventing workers from performing their duties as the Washington Post points out this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist leftwingers and Earth First protesters  Many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the Malheur Refuge so what made the difference here The jury made all the difference These seven Oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them common sense compassion and the power of the jury box Jury nullification works As law professor Ilya Somin explains jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive  According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler the doctrine of jury nullification is premised on the idea that ordinary citizens not government officials should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished Imagine that a world where the citizenrynot the government or its corporate controllersactually calls the shots and determines what is just In a world of  rampant overcriminalization  where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day jury nullification acts as  a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry Indeed Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises  If you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case I recommend that you vote not guilty  even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot or sold it to another consenting adult As a juror you have this power under the Bill of Rights  if you exercise it you become part of a proud tradition of American jurors who helped make our laws fairer In other words its we the people who can and should be determining what laws are just what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes Not only should the punishment fit the crime but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profitdriven priorities of Corporate America This is where the power of jury nullification is so critical to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profitdriven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime Of course the powersthatbe dont want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all They would prefer that we remain clueless about the governments many illicit activities ignorant about our constitutional rights and powerless to bring about any real change In an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoingpolice officers elected officials etcare treated with general leniency while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law jury nullification is a powerful reminder that as the Constitution tells us we the people are the government For too long weve allowed our socalled representatives to call the shots Now its time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic as the masters not the servants Nullification is one way of doing so Various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to  claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded  Where nullification can be particularly powerful however is in the hands of the juror The reality with which we must contend is that justice in America is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail For the rest of us who are dependent on the fairness of the system there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day Police misconduct Prosecutorial misconduct Judicial bias Inadequate defense Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice Judges who care more about what is legal than what is just Jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about lifeanddeath decisions And an overwhelming body of laws statutes and ordinances that render the average American a criminal no matter how lawabiding they might think themselves If youre to have any hope of remaining freeand I use that word looselyyour best bet remains in your fellow citizens Your fellow citizens may not know what the Constitution says studies have shown Americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights they may not know what the laws are there are so many on the books that the average American breaks three laws a day without knowing it and they may not even believe in your innocence but if youre lucky those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand Thats ultimately what jury nullification is all about restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice Its the best protection for we the people against the oppression and tyranny of the government and God knows we can use all the protection we can get Its a powerful way to remind the governmentall of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge jury and jailer over all that we are have and dothat were the ones who set the rules We could transform this nation if only Americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent Unfortunately the governments divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm Despite the laundry list of grievances that should unite we the people in common cause against the government the nation is more divided than ever by politics by socioeconomics by race by religion and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences The real and manufactured events of recent yearsthe invasive surveillance the extremism reports the civil unrest the protests the shootings the bombings the military exercises and active shooter drills the colorcoded alerts and threat assessments the fusion centers the transformation of local police into extensions of the military the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakershave all conjoined to create an environment in which we the people are more divided more distrustful and fearful of each other What we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government were all the same In other words when its time for the government to crack downand that time is comingit wont matter whether we supported Hillary or Trump whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed BLM or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent When the government cracks down well all suffer Heres the thing the government wants a civil war The objective compliance and control Its strategy destabilize the economy through endless wars escalate racial tensions polarize the populace heighten tensions through a show of force intensify the use of violence and then when all hell breaks loose clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation The government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now Those protests in Ferguson  Baltimore and Baton Rouge to protest police brutality The militarized police  clad in Kevlar vests helmets and camouflage armed with pistols shotguns automatic rifles and tear gas  turning towns into war zones The kenneling of pipeline protesters in North Dakota Those were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest They were also previews of whats in store if we continue to challenge the powersthatbe After all its hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution prosecution and a oneway trip to the morgue And when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusionthe government always winsit can seem pointless even foolhardy to dare to challenge the system So how do you not only push back against the police states bureaucracy corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means You start by changing the rules and engaging in some nonviolent guerilla tactics Employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience  which Martin Luther King Jr used to great effect through the use of sitins boycotts and marches Take part in grassroots activism which takes a trickleup approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level in other words think nationally but act locally And then as I explain in more detail in my book Battlefield America The War on the American People  nullify everything Nullify the court cases Nullify the laws Nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate egregious or blatantly unconstitutional
