Americans tend to assume that polarization is bad for democracy It is supposed to undermine compromise and contribute to gridlock Its furthermore thought to be linked to growing inequalityBut when we talk about polarization we are usually talking about Congressand political elites Ordinary citizensshow verylittle polarizationIn a new article we argue that this lack of polarization among the public isnt necessarily a good thing Indeed it might be a sign of serious democratic failureWhy does polarization decrease when theres more economic inequalityFirst take a look at this puzzling graph If we look at advanced democracies we find that income inequality has a negative relationship with polarization which we measure as the share of the population who think of themselves as being noncentrist on a scale of left to right In general as inequality increases polarization decreases and viceversaThis is surprising When income inequality is higher we would expect people to disagree more about issues such as government spending and redistribution which we know are closely associated with whether people view themselves as being on the left or on the rightLooking at the data more closely shows that the median member of the public tends to be further to the right when income is more unequal Again this is unexpected Because the distribution of income favors the rich everywhere the mean income is higher than the median it is pulled up by those with very high incomes If the majority arewellinformed and selfinterested you would expect them towant more redistribution when inequality rises Just the opposite is true WhyWe think its because most people dontexamine public policies closely  and so drift to the center by defaultWe argue that the answer to these puzzles involves information People are often not wellinformed about politics and they few have reason to be Public policies affect large numbers of people but as individuals we dont have much power to change these policies so why spend valuable time acquiring information about themAs it turns out this simple fact sometimes called rational ignorance has implications for polarization The reason is that uninformed voters tend to place themselves in the center of the political space which they see as safe compared to more extreme optionsImagine that a voter can pick a left center or right party but doesnt have enough information to know which has the best economic policy given her interests She just assumes that theres an equal chance that each of these parties has the best policy The best strategy if she doesnt have much information is to pick the center party since it may actually have the best policy and even it doesnt its policy is more likely to be closer to the best policy than either of the other two because its located between them for a stepbystep derivation see the original paper This logic also applies to ideological selfplacement and we refer to it as the centrist biasThe more people know the less centrist they becomeThe centrist bias dissipates as people acquire information Those whose interests would dispose them to identify with the center will still do so but those who we might expect to identify with the left or the right will move away from the center Information breeds polarization So one way to think about why some countries have more noncentrist voters is to ask how and why voters acquire political informationMost people get information through groups and networks  like unions families or coworkersWe argue that most people get information through the groups and networks they belong to One such group is unions although unions like other formal groups have declined in importance in most societies Unions often expose their members to political messages and they also sometimes engage their members in political discussionWhen discussion is involved  say when a union official brings up political issues around the workplace lunch table  it pushespeople to look forinformation from papers TV the Internet and so onThis logic also applies to political discussion in social networks of family friends neighbors and coworkers People are more likely to acquire political information when others around them care about such information and are evaluating them in part based on whether they seem well informed Needless to say it is easier for welleducated people to acquire political information so educated people tend to respond more effectively to such social incentivesSo who tends to be wellinformedThis has partisan implications Those with higher incomes tend to have better education and be better integrated into social networks with a lot of political discussion These people are the natural constituents of centerright parties which means that the centrist bias is less pronounced for the rightYet the extent to which this is true varies across time and space Many different factors  union membership membership in social networks with political discussion and education  are associated with higher levels of information and therefore also with ideological polarizationIn countries with strong unions the centrist and right biases are less pronounced The same is true in countries with good public education systems and more pervasive informal discussion networks The figure belowshows the relationship between the frequency of political discussion in social networks and ideological polarization The political discussion taking place at Parisian street cafes really does matter and so does a blog like this We should not be surprisedSome public policies can lead to more or less general knowledge and public discussion  and therefore whether theres an informed leftThis implies that countries with certain institutions and policies  strong unions heavy investment in public education and extensive social networks  end up with more politically informed electorates which are also more ideologically polarized and leftleaning than countries where these institutions are less well developedAt the same time unions public education and network integration promote income equality for reasons that are well understood in economicsTogether this provides a plausible explanation for the pattern showed in our first graph where there is a negative relationship between inequality and polarizationBecause governments of the left and right affect the income distribution though public policies  most obviously through redistribution and public education  these relationships may be selfreinforcing producing distinct varieties of democracies From this perspective polarization may in fact be a sign of a wellfunctioning democracy  one that has wellinformed electorates and governments that support the majoritys interests in pushing back against rising inequalityTorben Iversen is theHarold Hitchings Burbank Professor of Political Economy in the department of government at Harvard UniversityDavid
