Peter Bergen is CNNs national security analyst a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University He is the author of Manhunt The TenYear Search for bin Laden  From 911 to Abbottabad David Sterman is a program associate at New America a Washingtonbased think tankCNN On Thursday morning four US Marines were killed in Chattanooga Tennessee when a gunman shot at two separate military facilities a military recruiting center and a Navy training reserve centerThe suspected shooter is 24yearold Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez who also is dead according to the FBIThe shooters motivations are as yet unclear US Attorney Bill Killian told reporters that the investigation is being treated as act of domestic terrorismOne likely reason why investigators are treating the shooting as a potential domestic terrorist attack is that there are multiple cases of jihadist extremists plotting to attack military facilities and recruiting centers in the United StatesMilitary facilities and personnel are a common target in jihadist plots to conduct violence within the United States Nearly a third of the 119 Americans accused of plotting an attack inside the United States since 911 were alleged to have plotted to attack US military targets according to data collected by New AmericaThursdays shooting would not be the first jihadist attack on a US military recruitment office nor even the first one with a connection to TennesseeOn November 18 2008 Bledsoe was arrested in Yemen for possessing a fake Somali identification card The fake identity card was part of Bledsoes illconceived plan to travel to Somalia to wage jihad When he was arrested Bledsoe was found to possess manuals about how to make bombs and gun silencers On his cell phone were contacts for militants who were wanted in Saudi ArabiaThe FBI interviewed Bledsoe after his arrest in Yemen and he eventually returned to the United States In a letter to the judge in his case Bledsoe claimed to have been sent by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula AQAP and portrayed the Little Rock shooting as a jihadist attack  though there is no evidence that he was actually sent or directed by AQAPThe Fort Hood attack helps illustrate the particular role of military targets for jihadists who see themselves as engaged in a war with the United States and soldiers as legitimate targetsHasans only real confidant in Texas was Duane Reasoner Jr an 18yearold covert from Catholicism who attended his mosque Hasan told Reasoner he didnt want to be deployed to Afghanistan At their final dinner together on November 4 Hasan told Reasoner that what he really wanted was to quit the military because anyone fighting against fellow Muslims was likely to go to hellThe next day the 467th Combat Stress Control Detachment to which Hasan was assigned was due to report at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood  the last stop before the unit shipped out to Afghanistan This was the day that Hasan selected to conduct his deadly attackEarlier this year an alleged plot inspired by ISIS to attack a military base was foiled in Illinois On March 25 Hasan Edmonds  a 22yearold US citizen and his cousin Jonas Edmonds a 29yearold US citizen were arrested The two allegedly plotted for Hasan a member of the Illinois National Guard to travel to Syria to fight with ISIS while Jonas would carry out an attack on a military facility The two were monitored by an undercover officerAnother potential reason to consider jihadist terrorism as a motivation in the Chattanooga shooting is that the incident comes amid a spike in terrorism cases this year driven in large part by the threat posed by individuals inspired by ISIS and a law enforcement crackdown on potential plottersAlready less than seven months into 2015 more Americans have been charged in jihadist terrorism related cases than in any other year since 911 according to data collected by New AmericaMoreover the timing of the Chattanooga shooting on the final night of Ramadan raises another flag ISIS called for its supporters to unleash a month of disaster during the holy celebration of Ramadan which ends FridayRegardless of the shooters motivation it is essential to investigate all possibilities and not jump to conclusionsOn September 16 2013 Aaron Alexis killed 12 people in a shooting at the Washington Navy Yard Though the attack came on the heels of the anniversary of 911 occurred in the nations capital targeted a military facility and had other characteristics that superficially suggested it might be jihadist terrorism Alexis turned out to not be a terrorist but a mass shooter with a history of mental health problemsEven though Alexis was not a jihadist terrorist his shooting at the Navy Yard demonstrated in the words of a Department of the Navy report on the shooting that there were critical performance gaps in the Navy Yards capabilities against a wide range of threats and that the Naval Support Activity Washingtons Antiterrorism Program was deficient in several areasAn issue laid bare by Thursdays shootings is the challenge of securing military recruiting offices from attacksWhile US military bases tend to have high levels of security military recruiting offices do not Since these offices have been the scenes of two attacks in the past six years the Pentagon should consider how to make them harder targets
