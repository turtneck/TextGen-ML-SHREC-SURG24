Beauty products that claim to be organic or natural are far from it Credit Wise Geek When it comes to the term organic theres actually not as much regulation surrounding use of the word as consumers would like The US Department of Agriculture regulates organic claims in farm products but its the controversial Federal Drug Administration that has control over cosmetics Though the USDA has strict standards for organic food products the FDA does not even have an official definition for the term organic On their website the question Does FDA have a definition for the term organic is met with this answer No FDA regulates cosmetics under the authority of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act FPLA The term organic is not defined in either of these laws or the regulations that FDA enforces under their authority The FDA does have some regulations that are overseen by the USDA via the National Organic Program but the policing efforts when it comes to cosmetics are seriously lacking By looking at EWGs Skin Deep database it was determined that over 5000 products use the word organic in their brand name product name product label or list of ingredients Depending on the placement of the word certain regulations can be bypassed  and thats why most of these products are actually horrible and receive the lowest Skin Deep score possible despite claiming to be organic The use of chemicals is still allowed even in these seemingly wholesome products and some of these chemicals are so poor for your skin that they are banned in many countries When a beauty product claims to be made with 100 organic or natural ingredients it can be misleading because they are often referring to a single ingredient that is organic or naturallyderived rather than all of their ingredients Other tactics used to confuse consumers include using the terms like ecofriendly or vegan both of which are even less regulated than using organic on a label Unless there is a thirdparty company that you trust backing these claims they are likely a farce and have no substance Since there is so much confusion surrounding these loaded words consumers should be wary when they encounter products that make bold claims like this Instead of taking their labels at face value simply take a look at the ingredients and research a few to see what they really are If the majority of them are things you cannot pronounce its likely that most are made with synthetic chemicals and far from being natural or organic What are your thoughts on this news Please share like and comment on this article This article  Thousands Of Organic Beauty Products Found Containing Banned Chemicals  is free and open source You have permission to republish this article under a Creative Commons license with attribution to the author and TrueActivistcom Do you like our independent  investigative news Then please check these two settings on Facebook to guarantee you dont miss our posts
