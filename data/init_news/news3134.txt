October 26 2016 Knesset Speaker asks Vatican to join battle against UNESCOs denial of history The resolution the Speaker wrote is an assault on history and is deeply offensive to both Christianity and Judaism The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body The outrageous repudiation of the millenniaold bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history he added The annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes Edelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions a city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of Gd was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets Education Minister Naftali Bennett called UNESCOs decision a denial of history and history will erase the embarrassing decision
