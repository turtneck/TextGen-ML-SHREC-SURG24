Ben Carson pitched a tax plan with numbers that didnt add up Donald Trump boasted that hes paying his own way in the campaign but he isnt Chris Christie accused the government of stealing Social Security money that it has actually borrowed  and has been paying back with interestEven the price of hamburger got a bad rap in the latest Republican presidential debate thanks to Ted CruzA look at some of the claims Wednesday night and how they compare with the factsCRUZ If you look at a single mom buying groceries she sees hamburger prices have gone up nearly 40 percent She sees her cost of electricity going up She sees her health insurance going up And loose money is one of the major problemsTHE FACTS Americans may be facing many economic challenges but rising inflation isnt one of them And loose money a way of describing the Federal Reserves low interest rate policies isnt to blame for expensive hamburgersBeef prices rose 21 percent in January of this year compared with a year earlier That reflected a Midwest drought that had caused some cattle ranchers to cull their herds Beef prices have since settled down and were up just 1 percent in September from a year earlierElectricity costs have actually fallen 04 percent during that period Those are national averages so some local areas will have different figures Overall inflation has remained below even the Feds 2 percent target for the past three years In fact the governments primary inflation measure the Consumer Price Index has actually been unchanged in the past 12 monthsCARSON His proposed flatrate tax which would have everyone pay an income tax rate of about 15 percent works out very well in budget terms because it would spark enough economic growth to offset the lower rateTHE FACTS Carson says his proposed tax would not increase the budget deficit because he would tax the entire economic output of the US  the gross domestic product  plus corporate income and capital gainsCarson has not laid out a detailed plan so it is difficult to measure how it would affect revenues or the economy But based on what he said hes doublecounting because corporate revenues are part of the GDPA tax rate of 15 percent would be a huge tax cut for the wealthy The top income tax rate for individuals is now 396 percent The corporate tax rate for corporations is 35 percentTo help offset the rate cuts Carson said he would get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes Thats a bold proposal considering how popular many tax breaks are including deductions for interest on home mortgages and charitable contributions as well as exemptions for health insurance and retirement savingsCHRISTIE FBI Director James Comey said police officers are holding back because of a lack of support from politicians like the president of the United StatesTHE FACTS Thats not what Comey saidIn a speech last week about an alarming rise in crime Comey said some officers feel under siege because of the spread of viral videos taken by young people with cell phones Comey said hed heard about one police official who told his force their political leadership has no tolerance for a viral videoBut Comey never mentioned Obama or blamed politicians for failing to support police And Comey made clear he didnt have data to back up his gut impressionChristie also said when Obama was asked to speak about the issue he declined to support police In fact Obama gave a firm defense of police Tuesday telling a police chiefs convention that this country is safer because of your effortsTRUMP Im putting up 100 percent of my own moneyTHE FACTS No hes notOf 39 million raised for his campaign in the latest fundraising quarter only 100000 came from his own pocket That was one major revelation from the latest batch of presidential fundraising reports filed Oct 15 with the Federal Election CommissionThats a drastic shift from his springtime fundraising report when he loaned his campaign nearly all of the 19 million it hadBUSH Marco when you signed up for this this was a sixyear term and you should be showing up for workRUBIO Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes when running for president while he was in the SenateTHE FACTS Bush correctly cited Rubios spotty attendance record in the Senate since running for president but ignored the fact that this is common when someone in public office runs a White House campaign and previous candidates were absent far more often Bush himself is free to run for president as he pleases because he doesnt have a day job from which to be absentFor his part Rubio didnt offer a fair comparison when comparing his Senate voting rate with ObamasFrom Oct 27 2014 to Oct 26 2015 Rubio was absent for 26 percent of Senate votes a worse attendance record than other senators running for president according to an analysis by GovTrackus which tracks congressional voting recordsBut in a comparable period in the 2008 race  from Oct 23 2006 to Oct 22 2007  Obama was absent for 29 percent of votes a bit more than Rubios absences but not as much more as Rubio charged Republican John McCain was absent for 51 percent of Senate votes in that periodBoth Obama and McCain went on to miss an even bigger share of Senate votes as the election progressed  an expected development bound to be seen again in 2016CHRISTIE The federal government has stolen the Social Security taxes paid by workers and spent it on other things It isnt their money any more  It got stolen from them Its not theirs anymore The government stole it and spent it a long time agoTHE FACTS The money is not stolen its borrowedOver the past 30 years Social Security has collected about 27 trillion more in payroll taxes than it has paid in benefits By law the Treasury Department has invested the surplus in US Treasury bondsOver that same time period the federal government has run budget deficits in all but a few years To finance the deficits the government has borrowed money from other government agencies as well as public debt marketsThe money from Social Security has been spent but Social Security holds Treasury bonds worth 27 trillion backed by the full faith and credit of the US government Saying the money has been stolen assumes that the federal government will not honor the bondsSocial Security has been paying out more in benefits than it collects in taxes since 2010 The program has been able to pay full benefits because the federal government has honored the bondsTRUMP Asked about his criticism of Rubio for his support for increasing the number of highskilled foreign workers given visas to work in the US  calling Rubio Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburgs personal senator  Trump denied ever making the comment I never said that I never said that he saidTHE FACTS He did say it on his own website Trumps immigration policy calls for a different approach  raising the prevailing wage for the jobs that attract highskilled foreign workers in hopes that theyll be filled by more AmericansTrumps policy statement said doing that will improve the number of black Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H1B program Mark Zuckerbergs personal Senator Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H1Bs that would decimate women and minoritiesSEN RAND PAUL The new budget agreement will explode the deficit it will allow President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of moneyTHE FACTS The agreement allows 80 billion more spending over the next two years which is only a small addition to the 367 trillion the government spends every year The governments annual budget deficit has declined to 439 billion about 25 percent of GDP below the average for the past 40 yearsOverall whatever its faults most economists have responded to this weeks budget deal between Congress and the White House with a sigh of relief The agreement approved by the House earlier Wednesday sets funding levels and extends the governments borrowing limit for two more years thereby taking the threat of a government shutdown and debt default off the tableA 2013 budget fight led to a 16day partial government shutdown that was widely blamed by most economists for sharp drops in consumer and business confidence that dragged on the economyGEORGE PATAKI Hillary Clinton put a server an unsecure server in her home as secretary of state We have no doubt that that was hacked and that state secrets are out there to the Iranians the Russians the Chinese and othersTHE FACTS The former New York governor speaking in the undercard debate exaggerated whats actually known about what happened to the emails of Clinton the Democratic frontrunner for her partys presidential nomination While Clintons email server was poorly configured and therefore more susceptible to hacking there is no evidence of intrusionThe FBI is studying the server which was subjected to a phishing attack by Russianlinked hackers while she was secretary of state Its not known whether she clicked on any attachments which would have exposed her account Her account was also apparently the subject of cyberattacks originating in China South Korea and Germany after she left office in early 2013 Determining whether a hack was sponsored by a nation rather than just originating from that country is notoriously difficult
