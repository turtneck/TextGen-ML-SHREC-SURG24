Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell thought he could use Sundays Patriot Act deadline to get senators in line It didnt work thanks in large part to Sen Rand PaulMysterious gap in the fourlegged fossil record might not be a gap at allSenate Majority Leader Sen Mitch McConnell of Ky walks to his office on Capitol Hill in Washington May 5 2015 Key Patriot Act antiterror provisions including bulk collection of Americans phone records were set to expire at midnight SundayAs promised by Sen Rand Paul the federal governments massive gathering of Americans phone records went dark atmidnightSunday dealing a blow to the programs advocates  including Senator Pauls fellow Republican from Kentucky Senate majority leader Mitch McConnellThe expiration of the program and other antiterrorism surveillance provisions under the Patriot Act although expected to be only temporary is Sen McConnells first serious defeat as majority leader It shows just how difficult it can be to keep his own members in line  particularly when they are running for president as is PaulAnd it shows that sometimes the longtime strategy of using deadlines to force consensus in Congress just doesnt work Sometimes they work sometimes they dont said Sen Orrin Hatch R of Utah Its tough to lead this bunch he addedEspecially Paul The libertarian has made ending the data gathering program his signature issue and has featured his spirited Senate fight in campaign ads and fundraising appealsIn the wee hours of May 24 and again in an unusual Senate sessionon Sunday Paul used parliamentary rules to disrupt floor action on the issue A vote on a House compromise known as the USA Freedom Act is not expected until later this weekThis is exactly what McConnell was trying to avoidThe House bill passed overwhelmingly and has President Obamas support It leaves the job of data gathering to phone companies rather than the government and requires the government to get a search warrant to access itMcConnell worked hard to build opposition to the House bill which he has criticized as a hurdle to intelligence gathering But he lost supporters as senators coalesced around the House bill 77 to 17 in a procedural voteto advance the bill onSunday The leader had wanted to simply extend the provisions of the Patriot Act but Paul  eight days ago andon Sunday blocked even shortterm extensionsIm sure were not going to let the whole program lapse but because Senator Paul is taking advantage of the rules of the Senate we will delay and there will be an interim period where the nation is less secure Sen John McCain R of Arizona saidon SundayDemocrats see things differently Minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada faulted McConnell blaming him for a manufactured crisis by waiting to bring up the Patriot Act provisions until just before the Senates Memorial Day recess  a week before their expirationWhen he was majority leader Reid also used deadlines to forge consensus Its a common floor management technique But Reid would never have stacked this many bills together against a deadline without a clear path forward his spokesman Adam Jentleson saidin an email Mr Jentleson was referring to trade and highway bills that also were voted on shortly before the Senate broke for recess just over a week agoCould this have been avoidedIts difficult to know said Sen Susan Collins R of Maine Perhaps we should have stayed in last week rather than going on recess until the issue was resolvedOn the other hand she said when McConnell offered shortterm extensions to work out compromise legislation just before the recess I dont think it was anticipated that Paul and some Democratic allies would objectNow she said all of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high and coming at us from so many different directions
