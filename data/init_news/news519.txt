The percentage selecting Muslim is notably higher than inotherpollsconductedon this topic This difference likely depends on how the question is phrased Previous survey questions about Obamas religion tend to sound like a pop quiz  such as do you happen to know the religious faith of Barack Obama But by asking what Obama believes deep down I was intentionally granting respondents license to stray from the pesidents selfreported Christian faith This reveals a prevalent willingness to distrust this pesident or categorize him as the other in terms of religion Of course respondents could also be cheerleading  using a survey question to express their general dislike of Obama rather than a genuine view about his religious faith But if these results were largely driven by antiObama cheerleading we should expect more respondents especially Republicans to choose thevery unpopular categoryof atheist Relatively few do soPrevious ruminations on the ObamaisasecretMuslim theme have suggested various sources for it ignorance Fox News racism too muchWorld Net Dailyin your dietTheodoridis post was inspired by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walkers remarks that he didnt know whether Obama is a Christian But do other elected Republicans suggest that Obama is not only not a Christian but a Muslim I ran a search in the Congressional Record for recent floor speeches in which the word Islam or Islamic and the President appear This is snapshot of course and the number of constituents who actually listen to these speeches is infinitesimalBut if elected Republicans arent afraid to question Obamas religious commitments for the permanent record think of what they might say to constituents in smaller settings or the well that they are drawing from when they make remarks in Congressional sessions for which they receive no pushback and in fact receive encouragementRepublicans drew fromrecentconservative complaints that Obama refuses to say that Islamic State and other terrorist groups are Islamic that he doesnt take the threat of terrorism seriously and he is insufficiently protective of American exceptionalismOn February 24 2015 Rep Mark Walker RNC said on the House floor that his constituents shared with me their frustration at the ambiguous language from this administration in describing the evils of radical Islamist terrorism and that he himself has grown weary at the timidity of Obama who continues to be defensive at best He went onAt first glance the silence appears to be passive or poor leadership But I am inclined to believe that the Presidents posture is not one of weakness but rather an intentional directive in both rhetoric and action It appears that his promise to take our country in a fundamentally new direction is being played out in realtime Instead of defending our liberty and our way of life which is the most charitable in the world our President seems to scoff at the belief that our country has been uniquely blessed by God I would be remiss today if I did not pause and remember our Egyptian Christian brothers in the recent barbaric attacks in Libya ISIS murdered innocent husbands and fathers who clearly died for their faith and their beliefs Just this morning we hear further reports out of Syria that Islamic State militants have abducted dozens of Christians including women and children Weeks prior the President chastised the Christian community for getting on their judgmental high horses Yet in describing our martyred brothers from Egypt the President refused to even utter the word Christian The undermining of our beliefs has become an issue with this PresidentContrary to Walkers statement which echoes a claim circulating in conservative circles that Obama did not identify the Coptic victims of the Islamic State massacre as Christians at last weeks summit on countering religious extremism Obama noted that that Islamic States slaughter of EgyptianChristiansin Libya has shocked the world Notice in Walkers speech the juxtaposition of the statement that Obama seems to scoff at the belief that our country has been uniquely blessed by God ie hes not a Christian with his own remembrance of the murdered Egyptian Christians who clearly died for their faith and their beliefsSome of the floor statements come from ardent Christian supporters of Israel who contrast Obama negatively with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu In a February 5 2015floor speech Rep Trent Franks RAZ called Netanyahu one of the most prescient voices that we have in the entire world to address some of the subjects and some of the dangers that face the UnitedStates of America In contrast Franks claimed Obama chooses to listen to thesemysterious voices of those who did not vote in our Nations election yet has sought to go after and silence Netanyahu He did not specify whose mysterious voices were whispering in Obamas ear Franks questioned whether Obama is so naive or worse so arrogantas to believe that we can have any type of credible diplomaticagreement with Iran Rep Ted Poe RTX in February 2 2015 floor remarksasked this administration also refuses to say that we are at war with radical Islam There is so much sensitivity in the White House over its statements that one is puzzled to wonder Why are they sensitive about calling terrorists terrorists The next day in afloor speech Rep Louie Gohmert RTX after describing atrocities committed by terrorists added I guess if you are part of this administration you shouldnt consider that to be all that radical because this administration under their watch with Commander in Chief Barack Obama had orders given to remove crosses from the chapels on our military installations Gohmert repeats this claim despite it having beendebunkedin 2013 the militaryaccording to FactCheckorg has a longstanding policy against permanent religious symbols being attached to military chapels In the speech two days before the National Prayer Breakfast Gohmert noted Obamas upcoming appearance adding I am greatly appreciative of the Presidentsespousedfaith emphasis mine In a January 14 2015stemwinder after laying out a litany of Obamas alleged sins in failing to recognizing that radical Islam is a threat to our very existence and way of life Gohmert delivered a brief lecture on how Christians are supposed to act and govern I have Christian friends that say Yes but as Christians we are supposed to turn the other cheek That is as individuals Individual Christians should live out the beatitudes as Christ gave them But the government has a different role If you do evil you should be afraid because the government within the bounds of ChristianityRomans 134is supposed to punish the evil eliminate the evils and protect your people I dont try to convert anybody using my position in government but for those who misunderstand Christian teaching you need to read Romans 13 Romans 13 is about submission to governmental authority and the particular verse Gohmert cited reads For the one in authority is Gods servant for your good But if you do wrong be afraid for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason They are Gods servants agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer In other words Obama isnt punishing purportedly Islamic wrongdoers he therefore doesnt understand what Gohmert believes to be biblical imperatives for governingDraw your own conclusions Of course Poe Franks and Gohmert represent the far right flank of their party but their fellow Republicans dont dispute them AsTheodoridis theorizes Scott Walker is a moderate on the spectrum of misrepresenting Obamas religionbecause he merely said he didnt know whether Obama is a Christian But you could argue that Poe Franks and Gohmert never explicitly said Obama is a Muslim Yet according to Theodoridis research a majority of Republicans think he is
