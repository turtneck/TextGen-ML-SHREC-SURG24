Share on Twitter On October 21 2016 father of two Billy Flynn woke up early He bought his exwife a bouquet of flowers a card and a gift and he helped their kids make their mom breakfast for her birthday Flynn was questioned about why he doing something nice for his exwife This he says on Facebook annoys him Warning Graphic Language Loading Facebook Post He writes in part Im going to break it down for you all Im raising two little men The example I set for how I treat their mom is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women and affect their perception of relationships Now dont get Flynn wrong it hasnt always been this easy In fact he tells Independent Journal Review that it took him and his exwife a while to create a mutually respectful relationship But as Flynn points out when a divorce involves children the wellbeing of those children is much more important than how the adults feel about each other The proud father credits their two boys with inspiring them to work hard on their new relationship It definitely wasnt easy up front Id say it took us a good year to get it right Divorce is hard and I think we all do and say some things that really arent our best selves But we always put the kids first and honestly I think that focus helped us repair our relationship into one of mutual respect over time and our kids win as a result Flynn tells Independent Journal Review that he believes it is extremely important for parents to show care and respect for one another especially when they are around their kids Loading Facebook Post He explains Im not advocating that everyone can or should do what we do for each other to model for the kids But I believe it is extremely important for parents to show each other respect and care in front of the kids If your ex doesnt have a new significant other you got to make sure those kids have Mothers and Fathers Day cards birthday gifts etc Kids want to care for their parents by nature but they cant do it alone Its our job to facilitate that So even if your ex is a terrible person in your eyes you need to set it aside and realize your kids love this person Seeing you mistreat someone they love is traumatic whether you want to own it or not So focus on the kids make a pact and I think youll be surprised to find that your mutual focus on the kids will actually benefit your postdivorce relationship because it takes the spotlight off your individual hurts and anger and resentment As Flynn says on Facebook if others in a similar situations arent modeling good relationship behavior then he suggests they wise up and be an example for their children Some may say its impossible but Flynn couldnt disagree more He tells Independent Journal Review that while establishing a mutual understanding with his exwife was hard it was possible And he knows that if he did it you can do it too By being able to rise above all the drama coparenting will turn into raising good men and strong women which as Flynn says is something we need now more than ever
