US politicians rarely acknowledge this odious past  let alone acknowledge that such policies continue well into the present dayIn the second Democratic presidential debate however candidate Bernie Sanders condemned a longstanding government policy his peers rarely admit existsI think we have a disagreement Sanders said of fellow presidential candidate Hillary Clinton And the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq If you look at history you will find that regime change  whether it was in the early 50s in Iran whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile or whether it was overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when  these invasions these toppling of governments regime changes have unintended consequences I would say that on this issue Im a little bit more conservative than the secretaryI am not a great fan of regime changes Sanders addedRegime change is not a phrase you hear discussed honestly much in Washington yet it is a common practice in and defining feature of US foreign policy for well over a century For many decades leaders from both sides of the aisle Republicans and Democrats have pursued a bipartisan strategy of violently overthrowing democratically elected foreign governments that do not kowtow to US ordersIn the debate Sanders addressed three examples of US regime change There are scores of examples of American regime change yet these are perhaps the most infamous instancesIran was once a secular democracy You would not know this from contemporary discussions of the much demonized country in US politics and mediaWhat happened to Irans democracy The US overthrew it in 1953 with the help of the UK Why For oilMohammad Mosaddegh may be the most popular leader in Irans long history He was also Irans only democratically elected head of stateIn 1951 Mosaddegh was elected prime minister of Iran He was not a socialist and certainly not a communist  on the contrary he repressed Iranian communists  but he pursued many progressive social democratic policies Mosaddegh pushed for land reform established rent control and created a social security system while working to separate powers in the democratic governmentIn the Cold War however a leader who deviated in any way from freemarket orthodoxy and the Washington Consensus was deemed a threat When Mossaddegh nationalized Irans large oil reserves he crossed a line that Western capitalist nations would not tolerateThe New York Times ran an article in 1951 titled British Warn Iran of Serious Result if She Seizes Oil The piece which is full of orientalist language refers to Iranian oil as British oil properties failing to acknowledge that Britain which had previously occupied Iran had seized that oil and claimed it as its own administering it under the auspices of the AngloPersian Oil Company which later became the AngloIranian Oil Company and eventually British Petroleum and modern BPThe Times article noted that the US shares with Britain the gravest concern about the possibility that Iranian oil the biggest supply now available in the Near East might be lost to the Western powers The British government is quoted making a thinly veiled threatThis threat came into fruition in August 1953 InOperation Ajax the CIA working with its British equivalent MI6 carried out a coup overthrowing the elected government of Iran and reinstalling the monarchy The shah would remain a faithful Western ally until 1979 when the monarchy was abolished in the Iranian RevolutionLess than a year after overthrowing Irans first democratically elected prime minister the US pursued a similar regime change policy in Guatemala toppling the elected leader Jacobo rbenzIn 1944 Guatemalans waged a revolution toppling the USbacked rightwing dictator Jorge Ubico who had ruled the country with an iron fist since 1931 Ubico who fancied himself the 20thcentury Napoleon gave rich landowners and the US corporation the United Fruit Company which would later become Chiquita free reign over Guatemalas natural resources and used the military to violently crush labor organizersJuan Jos Arvalo was elected into office in 1944 A liberal he pursued very moderate policies but the US wanted a rightwing puppet regime that would allow US corporations the same privileges granted to them by Ubico In 1949 the US backed an attempted coup yet it failedIn 1951 rbenz was elected into office Slightly to the left of Arvalo rbenz was still decidedly moderate The US claimed rbenz was close to Guatemalas communists and warned he could ally with the Soviet Union In reality the opposite was true rbenz actually persecuted Guatemalan communists At most rbenz was a social democrat not even a socialistYet rbenz likeMosaddegh firmly believed that Guatemalans themselves and not multinational corporations should benefit from their countrys resources He pursued land reform policies that would break up the control rich families and the United Fruit Company exercised over the country  and for that reason he was overthrownPresident Truman originally authorized a first coup attempt Operation PBFORTUNE in 1952 Yet details about the operation were leaked to the public and the plan was abandoned In 1954 in Operation PBSUCCESS the CIA and US State Department under the Dulles Brothers bombed Guatemala City and carried out a coup that violently toppled Guatemalas democratic governmentThe US put into power rightwing tyrant Carlos Castillo Armas For the next more than 50 years until the end of the Guatemalan Civil War in 1996 Guatemala was ruled by a serious of authoritarian rightwing leaders who brutally repressed leftwing dissidents and carried out a campaign of genocide against the indigenous people of the countrySeptember 11 has permanently seared itself into the memory of Americans The date has also been indelibly imprinted in the public consciousness of Chileans because it was on this same day in 1973 that the US backed a coup that violently overthrew Chiles democracyIn 1970 Marxist leader Salvador Allende was democratically elected president of Chile Immediately after he was elected the US government poured resources into rightwing opposition groups and gave millions of dollars to Chiles conservative media outlets The CIA deputy director of plans wrote in a 1970 memo It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG US government and American hand be well hidden President Nixon subsequently ordered the CIA to make the economy scream in Chile to prevent Allende from coming to power or to unseat him Allendes democratic government was violently overthrown on September 11 1973 He died in the coup just after making an emotional speech in which he declared he would give his life to defend Chilean democracy and sovereignty Farright dictator Augusto Pinochet who combined fascistic police state repression with hypercapitalist freemarket economic policies was put into power Under Pinochets farright dictatorship tens of thousands of Chilean leftists labor organizers and journalists werekilled disappeared and tortured Hundreds of thousands more people were forced into exile One of the most prevailing myths of the Cold War is that socialism was an unpopular system imposed on populations with brute force Chile serves as a prime historical example of how the exact opposite was true The masses of impoverished and oppressed people elected many socialist governments yet these governments were often violently overthrown by the US and other Western allies The overthrow of Allende was a turning point for many socialists in the Global South Before he was overthrown some leftists thought popular Marxist movements could gain state power through democratic elections as was the case in Chile Yet when they saw how the US violently toppled Allendes elected government they became suspicious of the prospects of electoral politics and turned to guerrilla warfare and other tactics These are just a small sample of the great many regime changes the US government has been involved in More recent examples which were supported by Hillary Clinton as Sanders implied include the US governments overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Qadhafi in Libya In these cases the US was overthrowing dictators not democratically elected leaders  but as Sanders pointed out the results of these regime changes have been nothing short of catastrophic The US is also still engaging in regime change when it comes to democratically elected governments In the January 2011 revolution Egyptians toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak a close US ally who ruled Egypt with an iron fist for almost 30 years In July 2013 Egypts first democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi was overthrown in a military coup We now know that the US supported and bankrolled the opposition forces that overthrew the democratically elected president Today Abdel Fattah elSisi a brutal despot who is widely recognized as even worse than Mubarak reigns over Egypt In August 2013 Sisi oversaw a slaughter of more than 800 peaceful Egyptian activists at Rabaa Square His regime continues to shoot peaceful protesters in the street An estimated 40000 political prisoners languish in Sisis jails including journalists In spite of his obscene human rights abuses Sisi remains a close ally of the US and Israel  much much closer than was the democratically elected President Morsi In the second Democratic presidential debate when Sanders called Clinton out on her hawkish proregime change policies she tried to blame the disasters in the aftermath in countries like Iraq and Libya on the complexity of the Middle East As an example of this putative complexity Clinton cited Egypt We saw a dictator overthrown we saw Muslim Brotherhood president installed and then we saw him ousted and the army back she said Clinton failed to mention two crucial factors One that the US backed Mubarak until the last moment and two that the US also supported the coup that overthrew Egypts first and only democratically elected head of state There are scores of other examples of USled regime change In 1964 the US backed a coup in Brazil toppling leftwing President Joo Goulart In 1976 the US supported a military coup in Argentina that replaced President Isabel Pern with General Jorge Rafael Videla In 2002 the US backed a coup that overthrew democratically elected Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez Chvez was so popular however that Venezuelans filled the street and demanded him back In 2004 the US overthrew Haitis first democratically elected president JeanBertrand Aristide In 2009 UStrained farright forces overthrew the democratically elected government of Honduras with tacit support from Washington Latin America given its proximity to the US and the strength of leftwing movements in the region tends to endure the largest number of US regime changes yet the Middle East and many parts of Africa have seen their democratic governments overthrown as well From 1898 to 1994 Harvard University historian John Coatsworth documented at least 41 US interventions in Latin America  an average of one every 28 months for an entire century Numerous Latin American military dictators were trained at the School of the Americas a US Department of Defense Institute in Fort Benning Georgia The School of the Americas Watch an activist organization that pushes for the closing of the SOA has documented many of these regime changes which have been carried out by both Republicans and Democrats Diplomatic cables released by whistleblowing journalism outlet WikiLeaks show the US still maintains a systematic campaign of trying to overthrow Latin Americas leftwing governments By not just acknowledging the bloody and ignominious history of US regime change but also condemning it Sen Sanders was intrepidly trekking into controversial political territory into which few of his peers would dare to tread Others would do well to learn from Bernies example
