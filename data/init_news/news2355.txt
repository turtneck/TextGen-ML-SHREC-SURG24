Language can obscure as much as it reveals Its important now more than ever to be clear to call things by their proper name to do otherwise is to risk confusion where none exists What happened in Charleston was terrorism Period And terrorism whatever else it is is not senseless its precisely the oppositeTerror is a tactic not a cause This is a crucially important distinction Terrorists are calculating they do what they do in order to inspire fear If Dylann Roof had decided on a whim to gun down the first people he encountered  that would be senseless But Dylann Roof was no nihilist He believed in something He was a racist And he was propelled by specific ideas  about history about black people about white supremacy and about various other cultural mythologies You rape our women and youre taking over our country and you have to go he remarked just before filling that church and those bodies with holes These are not the words of a mentally ill person committing a senseless act they are the cold clear thoughts of a man on a mission a man who knows exactly what hes doing and why hes doing it And this is why Dylann Roof is a terroristIts been troubling to watch the media vacillate in their coverage of this story Was it a hate crime Was it terrorism If theres clarity about anything at all here its about the motivations of the killer Hes a terrorist and he told us so He wanted to send a message Was he motivated by hate Sure But the act itself was terroristic by any measureAs many have pointed out the media is unsure about what constitutes terrorism only when white people are the perpetrators White men with guns are lone wolves or mentally ill or depraved criminals Brown men with bombs are very obviously terrorists This is a double standard with consequences Terrorism is a word that resonates it inspires urgency and collective action both of which are needed if were to deal with the underlying problems If white people cant by definition be terrorists then the term has no practical meaning its about the actor not the act If terrorism is something only brown people do then we should be honest and admit that We should say that terrorism is about the color of the criminal not the intent of the crimeEquivocating about the nature of the crime has an additional consequence It diminishes the role of ideas We can think of the human brain as a piece of hardware and of ideas as software motivating behavior Rather than focusing on the mental state of the murderer we should be talking about the ideas that inspired the murders Dylann Roof believed his country was under assault by black people He walked into that church and killed those people under the delusion that he was a soldier in a war The question is why did he think this Where did he get this ideaWe cant know for sure but heres what we do know Everyone saw this coming In 2013 theDHS released a reportwarning of a growing danger from rightwing extremists Indeedofficials believed domestic terrorismto be a greater threat than Islamic militants Echoing this theme theSouthern Poverty Law Centerfound that domestic hate groups often under the guise of patriot groups have increased significantly since 2008 the year Obama was elected I dont know whether Dylann Roof was an active member of any of these groups but its clear that he believed in and espoused their ideology These findings ought to have inspired concern from the political and media establishment However because of the confusion about what terrorism is and who terrorists are there was nothing but outrage on the right House Republican LeaderJohn Boehner dismissed the report as offensive and unacceptable Republican RepGus Bilirakiscalled it political and ideological profiling Conservative commentatorMichelle Malkinwrote that it was one of the most embarrassingly shoddy pieces of propaganda Id ever read These people failed us They failed in part because they were too consumed with foreign enemies to notice the presence of internal ones They failed because they refused to see what was right in front of their faces And they failed because they remained blind to the power of ideas of rhetoric For years rightwing demagogues have propagated this myth that the country was under siege by black people and immigrants and communists and radical liberals and so on Much of the Tea Party movement was motivated by this ideology Conservative leaders decided for political reasons to indulge this to capitalize on it Perhaps that was wise as a political strategy but there are consequences You whip people into a frenzy for long enough someone eventually is going to cross that line Dylann Roof crossed that line He was a homegrown terrorist And he was the product of a nativist ideology of white supremacy the flag of which flies still over the state capitol of South Carolina Perhaps now we can reckon with the roots of this truth That starts with calling it what it is raciallymotivated terrorism
