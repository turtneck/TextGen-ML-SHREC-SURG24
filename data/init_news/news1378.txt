Top Five Clinton Donors Are Jewish  How AntiSemitic Is This Fact Published October 29 2016 Source Moon of Alabama Top five Clinton donors Are Jewish campaign tally shows Something is wrong with the above statement Isnt it antisemitic Did Trump say that Readers of that statement may assume somewhat reasonably that there is a club of rich Jewish people controlling the Clinton campaign and maybe Clinton herself That sounds like it was taken from the fake Protocols of the Elders of Zion It clearly must be antisemitic It is also true  Facts have no bias They cant be antisemitic or can they But while facts as such can not have a racialreligious bias openly stating them surely can Thus the above statement is antisemitic The fact itself isnt bad reporting it publicly is bad bad bad Who but an altright rag would report such at all And for what purpose if not for spreading antisemitism Well  quot licet jovi  Jewish papers are of course allowed to report such a fact That isnt antisemitic It is solely to brag about Jewish powers Within the club that is not only allowed but welcome Thus Haaretz writes sourced to the the Jewish Telegraph Agency under the identity defining headline at the top of this post Haim Saban George Soros and others stand at the head of a list of wealthy donors who contributed mainly via super PACs The Washington Post analysis posted October 24 named the top donors who are contributing 1 of every 17 of the over 1 billion amassed for the Democratic nominees presidential run They are Donald Sussman a hedge fund manager JB Pritzker a venture capitalist and his wife MK Haim Saban the IsraeliAmerican entertainment mogul and his wife Cheryl George Soros another hedge funder and a major backer of liberal causes and Daniel Abraham a backer of liberal proIsrael causes and the founder of SlimFast Many of the big Clinton campaign donors also give to the Clinton Foundation which at times is a washing machine to put money into the Clintons private accounts It is kind of difficult to understand where Clinton Inc begins and where it ends Campaign funds Clinton foundation speech fees private accounts  does it even matter Surely those who pay to whatever Clinton entity expect a service in return Given the Clintons occupations as Senator Secretary of State and President the ask in return is unlikely to be commercial It will be political And here is why it matters that the five top donors to Clintons campaign are Jewish and all big supporters of Israel Haim Saban Im a oneissue guy and my issue is Israel They surely will ask for political favors in the interest of the Zionist entity This is also the reason why Haaretz an Israeli paper finds the strong racialreligious bias at the top Clinton campaign tally newsworthy Big money paid to a Clinton entity can directly effect US policies towards Israel It buys its acquiescence to Israeli escapades even when those are not consistent US interests Clintons positions towards Syria Iran and Russia which limits Israels freedom of action are surely not independent of Israeli interests But that is of course antisemitic speculation
