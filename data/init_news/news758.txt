Any idea that the Republican Party would vote on and pass reforms to immigration law apparently evaporated when voters in Virginia ousted thenMajority Leader Eric Cantor RVa in early June But even before Cantor lost there wasnt a lot of political incentive for Republicans to move on policy this year as The Upshot blog of the New York Times pointed out on Monday Looking at it cynically most of the closely contested races this year are in states that have very small Hispanic populationsBut compared to the 2016 primary season 2014 is practically a bonanza of diversity If the metric is how much will this help me win my next election theres very little incentive for the next Republican nominee to embrace reform until he or she has already accepted the partys nominationWell start at the beginning According to data from the Census Bureau Iowa and New Hampshire the first two states to weigh in on nominees both had relatively small percentage of the voting age population that was Hispanic 52 and 28 percent respectively Extrapolating out from 2008 to 2016 those numbers will grow slightly  but only slightly In the 2012 Iowa Republican caucus a negligible percentage of voters  essentially zero  were Hispanicaccording to entrance polls In New Hampshire it was about the sameJosh Putnam visiting assistant professor of political science at Davidson College in North Carolina is tracking likely primary dates for 2016 For the most part they havent yet been set as states jockey for influence Using his list as a guide we can roughly game out the rest of primary process beyond Iowa and New HampshireIts certain that voting will take place in Nevada and South Carolina at the front end of the calendar South Carolinas got a similarly small percentage of votingage Hispanics as New Hampshire and sure enough it had a similarly tiny percentage of Hispanic voters in 2012Nevada is interesting According to that Census data Hispanics comprised about 228 percent of the voting age population in 2012  and if the trend from 2008 continues will top 25 percent in 2016 Which is where we get into the other limiting factor the type of election Data from the George Mason Universitys United States Election Project indicates that about 571 percent of people of voting age in the state voted in the 2012 general election But in picking the nominees That dropped to 19 percent  because Nevada like so many other states has a caucus system which tends to limit involvement from all but the diehards Only 5 percent of those who voted in Nevadas 2012 Republican caucus were Hispanic  vastly underrepresented as a share of the populationThe next states on Putnams schedule are Colorado Minnesota and Utah They might try to jump ahead of South Carolina and Nevada Colorado which The Upshot notes is the only state that is both important in 2014 and has a decentsized Hispanic population will likely see Hispanics as about 20 percent of the population in 2016 and 12 percent of the voters  in the general election Colorado too has a caucus system in 2012 according to the George Mason project one voter participated in the caucus for every 39 that voted in November As for the other two Minnesotas votingage Hispanic population is small  likely under 4 percent of the total such population in 2016 Utahs should be bigger nearly 17 percent But only 7 percent of the people that come out to vote in the 2016 general in Utah will be Hispanic if the trend holdsThe next three states per Putnam will likely be North Carolina Arizona and Michigan Arizona is the most heavily Hispanic and its primary had about 12 percent turnout of the voting age population in 2012 But despite that population being about 17 percent Hispanic exit polls showed that only about 8 percent of Republican primary voters were HispanicThere are two reasons for that lower turnout in the primary process The first is that Hispanic turnout has been lower than the general public consistently in general elections Theres no reason to suspect that this is different in primariesThe second reason for reduced turnout in Republican primaries in particular is that Hispanic voters tend to vote Democratic In the 2012 general Hispanic voters went for President Obama 7127 with the older population trending slightly more toward Romney This is the vicious political cycle the Republicans had hoped to escape lower support among Hispanics because Republicans oppose immigration reform but Republicans opposing comprehensive immigration reform in part because their base is so heavily nonHispanicThis map shows the expected percentage of the votingage population of each state that will be Hispanic in 2016 again assuming trends holdThe highest percentage of 2012 turnout from Hispanic voters was in those states in the southwest Texas California Arizona and New Mexico California and New Mexico are slated to vote in June  at the very end of the process Arizona we mentioned above Which leaves TexasIn 2012 you mightremember Texass governor Rick Perry R ran for president Perry scolded critics of instate tuition for the children of illegal immigrants telling the criticsI dont think you have a heart For a variety of reasons  that position included  voters in Iowa and New Hampshire didnt reward Perry and he dropped out before South CarolinaBut it reinforces the operative point that you have to make it through a lot of very white states before Hispanic voters are a substantial part of the electorate Perry didnt dropping out long before Texas even voted
