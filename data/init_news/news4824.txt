A bipartisan bill aimed at combating human sex trafficking has hit a major snag after Senate Democrats  who unanimously voted to move the bill out of committee  hit the brakes upon discovering a Republicanbacked abortion provisionThough the relatively modest 68page bill has been available for nearly two months it wasnt until this week that Senate Democrats said they noticed the language and subsequently threatened to block the billAs drafted the legislation would crack down on what lawmakers in both parties agree is a seamy underworld of drugs and human sex trafficking akin to modernday slavery Fines paid by those convicted of the sextrafficking crimes would go into a fund to help victimsBut Democrats now are balking because the legislation also contains a Republicaninserted provision that bars the use of fines to pay for abortions except in cases of rape incest or when the life of the pregnant woman is in jeopardyDemocrats believe that divisive issues like this should be kept off what is otherwise a broadly bipartisan bill a spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said adding that theyre trying to find a path forwardRepublicans cast this as a routine extension of the socalled Hyde Amendment which bans the use of federal funds for abortions except in limited circumstances But Democrats said the legislation would mark a significant expansion since it applies to personal funds paid in fines They also noted the restriction against the use of fine money would be permanent while the one that applies to federal funds would lapse unless renewed on a yearbyyear basisReid said in remarks on the Senate floor that a number of people feel that it was by sleightofhand that the provision was included in the measure while others say staff should have seen it was in the bill A day earlier others in his party had said flatly that no one on their side of the aisle had been informedBut Sen John Cornyn RTexas said Democrats had in fact known of the abortionrelated provision that Republicans backed citing discussion among aides of both partiesRepublicans ripped Democrats for stalling over this issueThis is really not an honorable time or a laudable time in the history of the United States Senate said Sen John McCain RArizThe events presented a difficult challenge for Democrats forcing them to decide if their support for abortion rights justified blocking passage of a sex trafficking measure designed to help children and women They privately conceded they lacked the votes to strip out the abortion portion of the bill they oppose although they expressed confidence they had enough support to prevent passage of the entire measureAt the same time they were forced to consider whether their aides had failed to read the bill closely enough to discover the provision when the bill was made public in January or when it was approved unanimously in the Senate Judiciary Committee late last monthA statement released by a spokeswoman for the Democrats on the panel said Sen Patrick Leahy the partys senior committee member did not know in advance that the abortionrelated provision had been included nor did his aidesA spokesman for Sen Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota the bills leading Democratic supporter said the lawmaker first learned of it Monday Democrats also circulated an email written by a Republican aide summarizing a list of changes that had been made in the legislation from an earlier version written last year It contained no mention of abortionThe Associated Press contributed to this report
