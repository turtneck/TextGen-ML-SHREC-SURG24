Updated at 2 pm ETOver and over as Republican voters spoke of the presidential race  and of Donald Trump in particular  one word kept coming up strongThe nation needs a strong leader said the 12 voters gathered Tuesday night in St Louis for a focus group Thats hardly a surprising conclusion especially following the deadly terror attacks by the Islamic State in Brussels earlier in the day And Mr Trump the GOP presidential frontrunner projects strength they saidAfterTuesdaysnominating contests in which Trump gained more delegates than his top rival Texas Sen Ted Cruz the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat winning the Republican presidential nomination as a political novice while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues from trade to entitlements to the USs role in the world to Planned ParenthoodSome in the group expressed reservations about Trump He needs a filter two of the women said He needs to turn the noise down just a tad said another Be a bit more humble said one of the menTwo of the 12 voters in the focus group  organized by veteran pollster Peter Hart with reporters watching via live stream said they would vote for Trump in November only as a last resortSo why do some voters see Trump as strongBecause hes direct and outspoken and uses language that they understand and relate to Mr Hart told the Monitor Wednesday I dont want to say the swear words but the way in which he approaches it its not political speak Its straight talk and he gets credit for itHart describes Trumps style as authoritarian In fact recent academic research shows that Trump supporters are united by one common trait  not income education level or race but an inclination toward authoritarian leadership That finding could have profound implications for the Democrats come November if Trump is the Republican nomineeBecause of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate among Democrats as well as Republicans its very possible that Trumps fan base will continue to grow wrote Matthew MacWilliams the author of the study and a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Politico last DecemberPlacing Trump in the American historical context is tricky In many ways the real estate mogulreality TV starTwitter maven has no historical precedent But in his ability to project strength at least Hart sees a hint of Ronald ReaganIf you were looking for the one link between President Reagan and Trump it is the clear straightforward declarative language says Hart The difference is Reagan was always the smiling face with an upbeat sunny message of morning in America and Trump is obviously stern and tough And while he says he will make America great again essentially his language is much more negative and harsherAfter Tuesdays nominating contests in which Trump gained more delegates than his top rival Texas Sen Ted Cruz the billionaire is one step closer to accomplishing an extraordinary feat winning the Republican presidential nomination as a political novice while bucking party orthodoxy on a range of issues from trade to entitlements to the USs role in the world to Planned ParenthoodBut ultimately if Trump wins the Republican nomination only one said they would never vote for him That result flies in the face of polls that show major reservations about Trump by Republican voters One recent survey shows more than a third of Republican voters in the never Trump campOn TuesdayTrump and Senator Cruz performed as expected Trump won the Arizona primary and all 58 delegates at stake with 47 percent of the vote Senator Cruz won the Utah caucuses and all 40 of the states delegates with 69 percent of the vote A contested GOP convention in July remains a possibility but Trump still has potential to lock up the nomination before thenIn Arizona about half of the voting took place before Tuesday and the attacks in Brussels Among those who voted on primary day its not clear how the terror attack might have affected voters choicesBut Brussels certainly weighed heavily on the focus group voters in St Louis When asked for the one thing theyre looking for in the next president voters named a range of qualities including ability to get things done high moral character and toughnessYouve got to be strong said Trump supporter Kevin Rotellio a restaurant manager in his 40s We cant be weak or we might be the next terror attackAt another point when the discussion turned to leadership style one participant brought up a world leader whom Trump has said he admiresThis business about Trumps being outspoken and harsh and all that  isnt Putin the same way And he seems to be doing OK so I dont know that thats bad said Joseph Glass a retired engineer who voted for Ohio Gov John Kasich in the Missouri primaryThe biggest reservations over Trump were voiced by women  a reflection of polling that shows women are more concerned than men by Trumps manner and an overall gender gap When the group was asked by Mr Hart if Trump would be different as president than he has been as a candidate some expressed hope that that would be the caseIf he surrounds himself with reasonable people he will be different said Joyce Reinitz a teacher who lists her party affiliation as not strong Republican Hell still be opinionated But he will have perhaps some of the social filters built in as personalities that will try to calm him downAnother woman homemaker Gabrielle Ritter also hoped for the calming influence of advisers if Trump is elected Ms Ritter an independent who voted for Cruz in the primary and came into the focus group with a very unfavorable view of Trump wished he could just come across more reasonableIm concerned about him discussing deals with Putin or Iraq or the Middle East or Mexico she said Im concerned because of how he is portrayed in the media right now how he is going to handle those situations so that we dont end up in a worse international situation I think that the best decision that he could make is to choose a good cabinet of advisers to help himCherri Crenshaw another independent woman who voted for Cruz said she is looking for a president who is strong plus respectful When asked to elaborate she responded Its the opposite of Donald Trump I think he is very strong but I think he comes across as a bully I dont think you can lead the country when youre demeaning people in such blatant waysAnd yet of the 12 only one focus group participant said they could never vote for Trump And when asked if they had reservations about Trumps understanding of foreign policy only one person raised their handDissatisfaction with the status quo is that high  high enough to put a foreign policy novice in the Oval Office Frustration over the Obama years and the inability to get things done burns hot And Republican voters at least most of these voters are prepared to bet on someone who is untested in government  even someone they dont much like They dismissed the concerns of the GOP establishment as Washington politicians who have nobody but themselves to blame for the rise of TrumpFocus groups are an imperfect way to gauge public sentiment Though it must be noted that Hart as moderator with the sponsorship of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania is considered the gold standard Sometimes a form of group think can set inThat may have been the case with this group when all but one said theyd vote for Trump if hes the nominee But exasperation with the Obama administration and the state of the country may be so high by November that the vast majority of Republicans would be willing to pull the lever for Trump despite the polls today
