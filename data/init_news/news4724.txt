The House voted 239186 today to repeal the Affordable Care Act the latest effort by the Republicancontrolled chamber to scrap the lawThe measure also would direct panels to come up with a replacement for the healthcare law  though it doesnt provide a timeline on any new legislation or what provisions it may containThe Houseapproved measure likely will be defeated in the Senate where the GOP has a smaller majority President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation that rips up his signature achievementThe Associated Press notes the House has voted more than 50 times in the past two years to repeal the law What was different about todays vote NPRs SV Date writes in our Its All Politics blog What makes today a milestone is that for the first time House Republicans plan to vote on whether to actually take health coverage away from millions of Americans who now have itTodays vote came after Obama met with 10 Americans that the White House said wrote the president letters about how they benefited from the lawIt was maybe plausible to be opposed to the Affordable Care Act before it was implemented but now it is being implemented and it is working Obama said at the meetingBut as NPRs Ron Elving notes though no one expects todays vote to kill the law these issues are important to many who voted for Republican candidates in the 2014 election and expect campaign promises to be honored
