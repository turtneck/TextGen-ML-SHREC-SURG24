Darwin also didnt have anything to say about how life got started in the first place  which still leaves a mighty big role for God to play for those who are so inclined But that could be about to change andthings could get a whole lot worse for creationists because of Jeremy England a young MIT professor whos proposed a theory based in thermodynamics showing that the emergence of life was not accidental but necessary Under certain conditions matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life he was quoted as saying in an article in Quanta magazine early in 2014 thats since been republished by Scientific American and more recently by Business Insider In essence hes saying life itself evolved out of simpler nonliving systemsThe notion of an evolutionary process broader than life itself is not entirely new Indeed theres evidence recounted by Eric Havelock in The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics that it was held by the preSocratic natural philosophers who also first gave us the concept of the atom among many other things But unlike them or other earlier precursors England has a specific unifying testable evolutionary mechanism in mindQuanta fleshed things out a bit more like thisFrom the standpoint of physics there is one essential difference between living things and inanimate clumps of carbon atoms The former tend to be much better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heatJeremy England a 31yearold assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has derived a mathematical formula that he believes explains this capacity The formula based on established physics indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy like the sun or chemical fuel and surrounded by a heat bath like the ocean or atmosphere it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy This could mean that under certain conditions matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with lifeIt doesnt mean we should expect life everywhere in the universe  lack of a decent atmosphere or being too far from the sun still makes most of our solar system inhospitable for life with or without Englands perspective But it does mean that under certain conditions where life is possible as it is here on Earth obviously  it is also quite probable if not ultimately inevitable Indeed life on Earth could well have developed multiple times independently of each other or all at once or both The first truly living organism could have had hundreds perhaps thousands of siblings all born not from a single physical parent but from a physical system literally pregnant with the possibility of producing life And similar multiple births of life could have happened repeatedly at different points in timeThat also means that Earthlike planets circling other suns would have a much higher likelihood of carrying life as well Were fortunate to have substantial oceans as well as an atmosphere  the heat baths referred to above  but Englands theory suggests we could get life with just one of them  and even with much smaller versions given enough time Giordano Bruno who was burnt at the stake for heresy in 1600 was perhaps the first to take Copernicanism to its logical extension speculating that stars were other suns circled by other worlds populated by beings like ourselves His extreme minority view in his own time now looks better than ever thanks to EnglandIf Englands theory works out it will obviously be an epochal scientific advance But on a lighter note it will also be a fitting rebuke to pseudoscientific creationists who have long mistakenly claimed that thermodynamics disproves evolution here for example the exact opposite of what Englands work is designed to show  that thermodynamics drives evolution starting even before life itself first appears with a physicsbased logic that applies equally to living and nonliving matterMost important in this regard is the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states that in any closed process there is an increase in the total entropy roughly speaking a measure of disorder The increase in disorder is the opposite of increasing order due to evolution the creationists reason ergo a contradictionOverlooking the crucial word closed of course There are various equivalent ways of stating the law one of which is that energy cannot pass from a cooler to a warmer body without extra work being done Ginsbergs theorem as in poet Allen Ginsberg puts it like this You cant win You cant break even You cant even get out of the game Although creationists have long mistakenly believed that evolution is a violation of the Second Law actual scientists have not For example physicist Stephen G Brush writing for the American Physical Society in 2000 in Creationism Versus Physical Science noted As Ludwig Boltzmann noted more than a century ago thermodynamics correctly interpreted does not just allow Darwinian evolution it favors itA simple explanation of this comes from a document in the thermodynamics FAQ subsection of TalkOrigins Archive the first and foremost online repository of reliable information on the creationevolution controversy which in part explains Creationists thus misinterpret the 2nd law to say that things invariably progress from order to disorder However they neglect the fact that life is not a closed system The sun provides more than enough energy to drive things If a mature tomato plant can have more usable energy than the seed it grew from why should anyone expect that the next generation of tomatoes cant have more usable energy still That passage goes right to the heart of the matter Evolution is no more a violation of the Second Law than life itself is A more extensive lighthearted nontechnical treatment of the creationists misunderstanding and whats really going on can be found here The driving flow of energy  whether from the sun or some other source  can give rise to what are known as dissipative structures which are selforganized by the process of dissipating the energy that flows through them Russianborn Belgian physical chemist Ilya Prigogine won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work developing the concept All living things are dissipative structures as are many nonliving things as well  cyclones hurricanes and tornados for example Without explicitly using the term dissipative structures the passage above went on to invoke them thus Snowflakes sand dunes tornadoes stalactites graded river beds and lightning are just a few examples of order coming from disorder in nature none require an intelligent program to achieve that order In any nontrivial system with lots of energy flowing through it you are almost certain to find order arising somewhere in the system If order from disorder is supposed to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics why is it ubiquitous in nature In a very real sense Prigogines work laid the foundations for what England is doing today which is why it might be overstated to credit England with originating this theory as several commentators at Quanta pointed out noting other progenitors as well here here and here among others But already England appears to have assembled a collection of analytical tools along with a sophisticated multidisciplinary theoretical approach which promises to do much more than simply propound a theory but to generate a whole new research agenda giving detailed meaning to that theoretical conjecture And that research agenda is already starting to produce results See his research group home page for more Its the development of this sort of detailed body of specific mutually interrelated results that will distinguish Englands articulation of his theory from other earlier formulations that have not yet been translated into successful theorytesting research agendas Above all as described on the home page mentioned above England is involved in knitting together the understanding of life and various stages of lifelike processes combining the perspectives of biology and physics Living things are good at collecting information about their surroundings and at putting that information to use through the ways they interact with their environment so as to survive and replicate themselves Thus talking about biology inevitably leads to talking about decision purpose and function At the same time living things are also made of atoms that in and of themselves have no particular function Rather molecules and the atoms from which they are built exhibit welldefined physical properties having to do with how they bounce off of stick to and combine with each other across space and over time Making sense of life at the molecular level is all about building a bridge between these two different ways of looking at the world If that sounds intriguing you might enjoy this hourlong presentation of his work with splashes of local Swedish color  especially but not only if youre a science nerd Whether or not Englands theory proves out in the end hes already doing quite a lot to build that bridge between worldviews and inspire others to make similar efforts Science is not just about making new discoveries but about seeing the world in new ways  which then makes new discoveries almost inevitable And England has already succeeded in that As the Quanta article explained Englands theoretical results are generally considered valid It is his interpretation  that his formula represents the driving force behind a class of phenomena in nature that includes life  that remains unproven But already there are ideas about how to test that interpretation in the lab Hes trying something radically different said Mara Prentiss a professor of physics at Harvard who is contemplating such an experiment after learning about Englands work As an organizing lens I think he has a fabulous idea Right or wrong its going to be very much worth the investigation Creationists often cast themselves as humble servants of God and paint scientists as arrogant knowitall rebels against him But unsurprisingly theyve got it all backwards once again Englands work reminds us that its scientists willingness to admit our own ignorance and confront it head on  rather than papering over it  that unlocks the great storehouse of wonders we live in and gives us our most challenging satisfying quests
