Republicans on Monday blasted Secretary of State John Kerry for suggesting in a letter to his Iranian counterpart that the administration could help the country get around new visa restrictions passed by CongressInstead of bending over backwards to try to placate the Iranian regime the White House needs to be holding it accountable for its recent missile tests its continued support for terrorism and its wrongful imprisonment of Americans House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce RCalif said in a statement to FoxNewscomAt issue are tightened security requirements for Americas visa waiver program which allows citizens of 38 countries to travel to the US without visas Under changes in the newly signed spending bill people from those countries who have traveled to Iran Iraq Syria and Sudan in the past five years must now obtain visas to enter the USTop Tehran officials however complained the changes violate the terms of the nuclear deal which says the US and other world powers will refrain from any policy intended to adversely affect normalization of trade and economic relations with IranKerry responded to these concerns in a Dec 19 letter to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif  and suggested the administration could simply bypass the rules for IranI am also confident that the recent changes in visa requirements passed in Congress which the Administration has the authority to waive will not in any way prevent us from meeting our nuclear deal commitments and that we will implement them so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of Iran he saidKerrys letter to Zarif assured that the US would adhere to the full measure of our commitments As for changes to the visa program Kerry floated several alternative options for easing any impact on Iran  including waiving the new requirementsTo this end we have a number of potential tools available to us including multiple entry tenyear business visas programs for expediting business visas and the waiver authority provided under the new legislation he wroteThe legislation indeed includes a provision allowing the Homeland Security secretary to waive the requirements if the secretary determines this is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United StatesBut House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif voiced concern on Monday that Kerry was proposing a blanket waiver to accommodate Irans complaints He said that is not Congress intentContrary to what the Secretary of State seems to be saying to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif it was not and has never been Congresss intent to allow the Administration to grant a blanket waiver to travellers from Iran in order to facilitate the implementation of the Iran deal he said in a statementMcCarthy said the point of the legislation was to strengthen security and keep the American people safe from terrorism and from foreign travelers who potentially pose a threat to our homelandKerrys assurances also raised concerns that the US may be backing down to Irans complaints while at the same time reluctant to punish Tehran for its own potential violationsInstead of undermining Congressional intent regarding the visa waiver program the White House should instead focus on Irans repeated violations of the UN Security Councils bans on missile tests McCarthy said Irans unwillingness to follow these international agreements should be a red flag that the Iran nuclear deal isnt worth the paper it is written onOmri Ceren with the Washington DCbased Israel Project also told The Washington Free Beacon According to the Obama administrations latest interpretation the nuclear deal allows Iran to test ballistic missiles in violation of international law but does not allow Congress to prevent terrorists from coming into the United StatesThe same article noted that the State Department official in charge of implementing the nuclear agreement warned Congress last week that the new visa rules could have a very negative impact on the dealIndeed Kerrys letter came as topranking Iranian officials accused the US of flouting the nuclear agreementIrans Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Sunday that the change contradicts the nuclear dealDefinitely this law adversely affects economic cultural scientific and tourism relations Araghchi was quoted by state TV as sayingAsked about Kerrys assurances at Mondays daily briefing State Department spokesman John Kirby said the secretary made clear they would implement this new legislation so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests of IranKirby said the law would be followed but there are a number of potential tools to ensure this does not violate the nuclear deal As for the DHS waiver authority he said its too soon to say if and when that might be usedThe Kerry letter initially was obtained and published by the National Iranian American CouncilThe State Department confirmed the documents authenticity on
