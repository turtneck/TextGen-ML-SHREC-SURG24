The first nine months of 2013 have convinced us of one thing Rand Paul acts and the rest of the potential 2016 Republican presidential field reactsOn drones the senator from Kentucky led a 13hour filibuster that drew Sen Marco Rubio RFla among others to the floor in support On Syria Paul was out front in his opposition to a military strike  a position that more than two dozen of his Republican Senate colleagues came to sharePaul in short seems to be a step or two in front of the ongoing transformation of the Republican Party from a hawkish conservatism to a sort of populist libertarianismThats not to say of course that significant strains of resistance to the vision of the Republican Party that Paul is offering dont remain They do And it remains to be seen whether the establishment such as it is  elected officials and major donors primarily  can unite to keep Paul from the nomination in favor of a politically safer choice such as Rubio or New Jersey Gov Chris ChristieAnd Paul as he showed with his civil rights comments during his 2010 Senate campaign in Kentucky holds some controversial views that can  and will  get him into trouble in the glare of the national spotlightBut anyone who laughs at Paul as a serious contender dismisses him as just a carbon copy of his father  former representative Ron Paul RTex  or otherwise writes him off would do well to study the year in politics so far No one in the GOP has had a better year than Paul And its not all that closeBelow are our rankings of the 10 candidates with the best chance of winding up as the Republican presidential nominee While this should go without saying making predictions in 2013 about 2016 is something short of purely scientific10 Mike Pence The Indiana governor is flying way under the radar at the moment but he has the makings of a potential 2016 dark horse Social and fiscal conservatives like him hes a charismatic communicator and perhaps most important he doesnt work in Washington9 John Kasich The Ohio governors poll numbers have recovered remarkably well from his first few years in office and he now looks like a modest favorite for reelection against muchtouted Democratic nominee Ed FitzGerald If Kasich wins in 2014 he has a case to make as a swingstate Midwestern governor who previously served as the chairman of the House Budget Committee and who ran albeit briefly for president in 20008 Bobby Jindal We believe that Jindals stock was probably a bit too high a year ago and is now a bit too low His numbers in Louisiana still arent great but they are better than earlier this year Jindals decision to reject Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act will be a feather in his cap among conservative presidentialprimary voters7 Scott Walker  The Wisconsin governor may have a bit more of a reelection race on his hands than he originally thought with wealthy former Trek executive Mary Burke running for the Democratic nomination And we hear from reliable Wisconsin sources that Rep Paul Ryan RWis is more interested in running than we believed If Ryan runs its hard to see Walker also getting in6 Ted Cruz  Cruz is the biggest attraction among rankandfile Republicans at the moment He evokes genuine passion among the base  and thats not ever to be underestimated But its also worth remembering that Rep Michele Bachmann RMinn held that title once upon a time and she held it much closer to the time when people were actually set to cast votes for president5 Jeb Bush This is our holdingpattern ranking for the former Florida governor If he announces that hes running or even that hes moving toward running  heck wed take a Bush trip to Iowa New Hampshire or South Carolina  then he is probably our No1 on the list4 Paul Ryan See the note above about our previous underestimating of Ryans interest in running The coming fights over the government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling are readymade for Ryan and will reincrease his profile nationally We still are skeptical that he has the political chops to run a twoyearplus campaign for the Republican nomination though3 Marco Rubio Rubios frontrunner status has clearly come into question in the aftermath of his work to pass comprehensive immigration reform through the Senate The bills fate remains decidedly uncertain in the GOPcontrolled House and is still not popular among the partys grass roots For those who write off Rubio because of immigration however go back and watch his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention He is someone of considerable political talent2 Chris Christie Yes Christie has something of a base problem given the false idea that he somehow cost Mitt Romney the 2012 election because of his embrace of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy But Christies regularguy populism is a nice fit for the times1 Rand Paul Hes not a clear frontrunner But if you are looking for a candidate who can a raise the money b has a clear and compelling message and c has an obvious edge in an early state Iowa then Paul is the only person in the top three who checks all three boxes We repeat what we said above Underestimate him at your peril
