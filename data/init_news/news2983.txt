status in the GOP presidential raceRomneys move appeared to not just be a sign of concern that Trump  after defying pundits and political logic since he launched his outsider campaign last summer  could actually go on to claim the Republican nominationIt was also a sign of skittishness about the damage the Democrats will try to inflict on Trump who has a long and sometimes controversial business record in a general election if he does indeed emerge as the GOP nomineeThey were all over me for my taxes Romney told FoxWhile Cruz and Rubio have yet to release their tax returns this campaign season years of tax returns from both candidates are already publicly available from the time when they ran for SenateReid ignited a firestorm in the 2012 presidential race by claiming on the Senate floor without presenting any evidence that the words out that he hasnt paid any taxes in 10 years His attack was part of a fierce effort by the Obama reelection campaign to portray Romney as an out of touch and heartless businessman unable to understand the economic problems afflicting the middle class Reid later told CNN that he did not regret his move noting archly that Romney did not win the electionThe irony of the moment was not lost on ReidAll I know I cant imagine Romney having the gall coming after anybodys returns the Senate minority leader told CNN on Thursday Lets look at hisIt also struck one key member of Obamas reelection campaignDid Mitt Romney just do to Donald Trump on tax returns what he was so mad at Harry Reid for doing to him said former Obama political adviser and current CNN commentator Dan Pfeiffer on TwitterUnder intense pressure Romney did finally release his tax returns during the campaign but when it emerged that he had paid around 14 taxes on his 2010 return there was political uproar that played into the hands of the Obama campaignThe former Massachusetts governor was taking advantage of rules in the tax code under which income derived from dividends and capital gains is taxed at lower rates than traditional wagesTrump last summer released his personal financial disclosure shortly after announcing his presidential run and has consistently touted the fact that he released his financial numbers ahead of scheduleTrump said he was worth 8 billion a figure he and his accountants later revised to 10 billion when he officially released his personal financial disclosure Forbes has estimated Trumps net worth at 45 billion a figure Trump has disputedOn Wednesday Trump also stressed that his tax returns are extremely complex which Romney has rejected given that Trump would only need to publish several years of past tax returns which he has already filedTrump stressed as he has in the past that he pays as little as possible because its an expense and its not one Im happy paying because frankly the United States government wastes a lot of money
