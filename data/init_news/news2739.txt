New York Times  by Mike Isaac SAN FRANCISCO  The futurists of Silicon Valley may not have seen this one coming The first commercial delivery made by a selfdriving truck was 2000 cases of Budweiser beer On Tuesday Otto  the Uberowned selfdriving vehicle operation announced the completion of its first commercial delivery having delivered its beer load from Fort Collins Colo to Colorado Springs a roughly 120mile trip on Interstate 25 In recent years Uber has predicted a future in which you can ride in a selfdriving car that will take you where you want to go no driver necessary But the idea that commercial trucking could be done by robot is a relatively new idea  and a potentially controversial one given the possibility that robots could one day replace human drivers We think this technology is inching closer to commercial availability Lior Ron cofounder of Otto said in an interview In August Uber acquired Otto a San Francisco startup run by a number of veterans of Googles longrunning autonomous vehicle research Though largely symbolic the beer delivery marks the first commercial partnership for Otto which was founded less than a year ago Terms of the deal between Otto and AnheuserBusch InBev  which owns the Budweiser brand were not disclosed Weve tested with trailers of course but theres nothing like actually doing the real thing end to end Mr Ron said The delivery was indicative of Ubers larger ambitions to become an enormous transportation network one in which the company is responsible for moving anything like people hot meals or cases of beer around the globe at all hours and as efficiently as possible Travis Kalanick Ubers chief executive has said he envisions a future in which transportation will occur in different ways using both manned and unmanned vehicles Otto is a particularly large bet for Uber which paid nearly 700 million for the startup only a few months after the company started publicly discussing its selfdrivingtruck ambitions Since backing down from its moneyburning effort to dominate the Chinese ridehailing market in August Uber has invested more time and resources to focus on breaking into the trucking market Annual trucking industry revenue topped 720 billion in 2015 according to American Trucking Association estimates A good part of that total came from top brands that rely heavily on the trucking industry to transport their goods AnheuserBusch for example delivers more than a million truckloads of beer domestically every year We view selfdriving trucks as the future and we want to be a part of that said James Sembrot senior director of logistics strategy at AnheuserBusch Though the delivery went smoothly the two companies did not indicate whether there would be any further deals For this initial delivery Ottos truck departed AnheuserBuschs facility in Loveland Colo in the early morning before reaching the interstate in Fort Collins The truck drove through Denver  alongside regular passenger car traffic  and navigated to its destination in Colorado Springs without incident Otto said a trained driver was in the cabin of the truck at all times to monitor the vehicles progress and take over if necessary At no point was the driver required to intervene the company said Future expansion of the pilot program will allow Otto to test for more types of road and weather conditions a major factor in autonomous vehicle route plotting
