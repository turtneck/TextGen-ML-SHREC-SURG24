Whos Winning The 2016 Race  On Facebook And TwitterWhile the 2016 presidential hopefuls are hitting the road in places like Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina the race is also taking off on social mediaLets start with Twitter With nearly 3 million Twitter followers Hillary Clinton is way ahead of the other potential candidatesClinton only started tweeting in June 2013 and she tweets sparingly  though she seems to be ramping up this week Its a calculated mix of her opinions on political news photos from her travels and work to empower women and girls as well as family photosIt was on Twitter that she finally posted a longanticipated response to her recent email debacle on March 4 I want the public to see my email I asked State to release them They said they will review them for release as soon as possible That tweet received more than 10000 favorites This week she got more political weighing in on the House Republicans budget and expressing frustration that the Senate is stuck on a bill that would create a fund for human trafficking victims and is continuing to block Loretta Lynchs confirmation as attorney generalSen Rand Paul of Kentucky is taking the lead on Facebook Pauls politician page has 19 million likes and 228537 people were talking about him as of TuesdayIn his Facebook posts he can be seen behind podiums and on political trips He also links to articles and video clips hes featured in and infographics that express his views on topics from legalizing marijuana to Loretta Lynch He also denounces his potential future competitionBut it seems Clinton isnt even in the game on Facebook She doesnt have a verified Facebook page just a topic page with more than 400000 likes Thats still more than Jeb Bushs 163000 even though he appears to be doing all the right things  using hashtags tagging friends like Benjamin Netanyahu and posting selfies baby pictures and vintage photos of his mom Barbara Bush and his wife ColumbaWhile verified public pages could not be found for some  Vice President Joe Biden former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley or former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum  many had more than one verified account For example Sen Elizabeth Warren who has said she will not run has two Twitter handles senwarren and elizabethforma one is her official Twitter account as senator of Massachusetts and the other is her official personal account in which she describes herself as senator In one photo she wears a pink blazer and in the other a blue blazer The difference in looks is subtle but she divides the content  on one account she tweets politics and on the other she cheers on the PatriotsAll the numbers so far pale in comparison to accounts that are making big waves on Facebook or Twitter see Katy Perrys 66 million or President Obamas 56 million followers But the 2016 race is still technically anybodys game  so the next great social candidate might just be one good tweet or selfie away
