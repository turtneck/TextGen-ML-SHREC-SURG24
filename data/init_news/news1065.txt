There were a couple of notsoverysubtle signals here inside of Hofstra University that Donald Trump lost Monday nights highlyanticipated debate against Hillary Clinton and badlyThe first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters picked up by my attentive colleague Steve Shepard inside the debate hall as Trump meandered selfdefensively through a succession of answers against a very focused very energized and very wellrehearsed Hillary ClintonAnother tell After the 90minute sparring match finished Clintons team practically bounded into the spin room  more in glassyeyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected The GOP nominees people by contrast dribbled into the media pen like surly seventhgraders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation Fk lets do this a prominent Trump surrogate said before diving into a scrumTrump and his newish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the Oval Office But this bestlaid plan unraveled on Monday  amid Clintons steely assault and the dignified interrogation of NBCs Lester Holt who struck a deft balance between facilitator BS detector and lion tamerWithin minutes of the opening bell Clintons attacks forced domesticated Donald to go feral  he bellowed interrupted her repeatedly grunted and toward the bedraggled end became muted and poutyIt was bizarre said Barack Obamas campaign manager David Plouffe who like many Clinton allies seemed visibly relieved He was clearly rattled and clearly focused on defending himself which Im told narcissists are prone to do and he clearly faded at the end Its not like shes going to jump out to a 10point lead but this was goodWhether or not this reverses Trumps momentum or reestablishes Clintons control of the race is an open question Who won is not Here are five takeawaysTrump was wimpy when defensive He is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most It doesnt take a Jung or even Dr Phil after a couple of Bud Lights to figure out that the GOP nominee  who boasts like a barfly  just might be overcompensating Hence Clinton who started the debate a little tentatively quickly launched into a carefully planned program of Freudian mindgames contrasting her own middleclass businessman dad who had his own issues with Trumps imperious largerthanlife father Fred who launched his sons business career but also was said to be extremely tough on himFirst she started in with a paean to her fathers running a small printing business in Chicago This might be the first time a candidate has described in detail the silkscreen squeegee process on a debate stage  then she pivoted to mocking supposedly selfmade Trumps start in the real estate business You know Donald was very fortunate in his life and thats all to his benefit He started his business with 14 million borrowed from his father she said icilyMy father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars he responded weakly  and so it went on a range of topicsWhether it was because Clinton was so well prepped and Trump was so breezily unprepared  or had a simple case of opening night jitters  the bullyboy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat answering an attack with a harsher one She went right for Trumps ego  questioning his questionable 11 billion net worth his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting ISISIn 2007 preparing for a primary race shed eventually lose Clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacks werent about exploiting someones weaknesses but challenging an opponents perceived strengths When confronted with that assault Trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his Republicans wincing It was a draw former Massachusetts Sen Scott Brown said But he was on the defensive far too much Thats a direct result of his inexperienceWhat about the Clinton Foundation The former secretarys debate team including longtime aide Phillippe Reines who snapped a predebate photo in a Trump circledfinger pose expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her familys foundation They were worried about it While he hammered her eversobriefly on emails he was so engaged in selfjustification he flatout forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousyHis 30 years attack worked  and hell use it again Trump may have lost the first debate but hes proven to be a fast learner and is likely to come back stronger in early October for the second debate a town hall style affair in St Louis And there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra  the most valuable an assault demonstrable and factcheckerfriendly on Clintons effectiveness in 25plus years of public lifeThe beentherenotdonethat argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on Bill Clintons passage of the increasingly unpopular NAFTA agreement from the 1990s and Hillary Clintons electionyear flipflop from TPP booster to opponentWhen she started talking about this it was really very recently Trump said of her opposition to the trade deal Shes been doing this for 30 years And why hasnt she made the agreements better The NAFTA agreement is defective Just because of the tax and many other reasons but just because of the factWhen Clinton claimed that she planned to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs He scoffed and shot back But you havent done it in 30 years or 26 yearsClinton effectively attacked his business career Trumps attempt to head off debatenight questions about his fiveyear campaign promoting the birther slander against Barack Obama was a humbling faceplant His attempt to pin the origin of the charge against Clinton associate Sid Blumenthal was semieffective with the political press but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an AfricanAmerican moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation Trump offered neither  and suggested Obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard because its now been resoundingly put to restPolitically his tortured explanation helps energize black voters  who already oppose him in historic numbers But later in the debate Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among everelusive white workingclass voters and independents Trumps failure to turn over his tax returns Clinton went there with a vengeance  engaging in a little Trumpesque factfree speculation about the motives of the billionaire developerturnedreality TV starSo youve got to ask yourself why wont he release his tax returns Clinton mused with relish And I think there may be a couple of reasons First maybe hes not as rich as he says he is Second maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be Third we dont know all of his business dealings Or maybe he doesnt want the American people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didnt pay any federal income taxTrumps answer did more harm than goodThat makes me smart he said  referring to his business not his political acumenHer most effective attack  and his worst answer If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years Again Clinton brought it back to her father describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his billIve met dishwashers painters architects marble installers drapery installers who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do Clinton said delivering a carefully scripted attack We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses Its a beautiful facility It immediately was put to use And you wouldnt pay what the man needed to be paid what he was charging you to doThis is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class  and his flippant response yet again gave comfort to his enemiesMaybe he didnt do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work Trump quipped
