Monday night was shaky The Bernie delegates made sure their voices were heard Most of them were amicable some were aggressive While uncomfortable at times it never veered into chaos and it wasnt the orgy of Hillary hate some feared But it was impossible to ignore the tension in the roomAbout an hour before the prime time speeches began I walked the convention floor hoping to engage a few of the Bernie delegates What followed was a halfdozen conversations with Sanders supporters and several other brief interactions I wanted to hear from the most fervent the most disappointed I wanted to know what they thought and why they thought it What I heard was mostly encouraging and always illuminatingEdgar Deleon a Nebraska delegate was the only Bernieorbuster I encountered He told me he was 100 percent for Sanders and that he refused to support Clinton in November Why I asked Bernie Sanders is one of the most sincere authentic public servants Ive seen in my lifetime he told me Hillary Clinton is a confirmed fraudeverything wrong and corrupt with our political system is what she stands for I asked him what he would do if reduced to a choice between Trump and Clinton and he said Picking the lesser of two evils is still evil Come November my ballot will say Bernie Sanders no matter whatMira Bowin a young and insightful delegate from New York was more measured Asked if she planned to vote for Hillary in November she said Its not November yet and right now Im supporting Berniebut I have to say Im not feeling very moved by her choice for VP or what theyve done with TPP and the platform Im not feeling very courted and I have reservations She added that shes grateful to live in New York which isnt a swing state so I feel free to support who I want To the question of Clinton or Trump she answered resolutely Fascism is fascism and fascism has to be stopped She may have reservations about Clintons record but shes aware of the dangers posed by TrumpAnother New York delegate who wished to remain anonymous told me she was committed to writingin Bernie Like many shes suspicious of the process particularly after the DNC emails were released by WikiLeaks Im not comfortable with the way this entire process has unfolded Im seeing this machine take overthis has been forced on us by the elites I asked her if she considered herself a Democrat or an independent 53 years Ive been a Democrat she told me I dont remember not voting for a Democratic presidential candidate She never admitted it but my sense was that shed vote for Clinton if she lived in battleground stateAs I left the floor I noticed a tall exuberant man waving a Sanders sign near the press gallery I approached him confident he had something to say John Sasso he told me Im from California One of several Sanders delegates Sasso was here to support Sanders and no one else My biggest fear is that Hillary will lose in November he said Bernie brought this enthusiasm to the party not ClintonI think shell lose to Trump After sparring a bit over the latest polling data I asked him if he had any loyalties to the Democratic Party Im a lifelong Democrat Ive always voted for Democrats But this year feltdifferent Although he wasnt ready to say hed vote for Clinton he told me he definitely wouldnt vote for TrumpAnd this was a common sentiment There was no ambivalence on the Trump question An odious quack Trump is a living rejection of everything progressives stand for Bernie voters are skeptical of Clinton for a hundred different reasons  her hawkish foreign policy her centrist capitulations her history of distortions etc But no one I met in that convention hall wants him to be president If you cut through the caricatures and listen to the delegates heres what you learn Most of them got a glimpse of what the Democratic Party could be what it should be and then they watched it slip away They understand that Sanders won concessions on the platform They realize he pulled Clinton  and the party  to the left But the delegates I spoke with see most of this as cosmeticTheres a bit of unreason here What after all did they expect A year ago Sanders was an afterthought his nomination was unfathomable And yet he nearly defeated Clinton while putting his stamp on the Democratic Party in a way no one thought possible He changed the conversation on the left Thats an extraordinary contribution one most of his supporters fail to appreciate Besides if we ask whats possible not whats ideal a Clinton administration is hardly a disaster for progressives Given the systemic constraints there are limits to what a president can do Sanders supporters often glide past the reality of a recalcitrant Congress and Sanders himself could not muster an intelligible reply to the critical question But how will you pass all of this For all her faults Clinton knows how to navigate the legislative swamp Will she fight for every plank of Bernies platform No But she and Sanders are aligned on most issues and shes competent enough to deliver In other words a Clinton presidency is not the end of the republic Nor is it a death blow to the progressive movement This is lost on many Sanders supporters In the end though theyll come around Much of the festering frustration is just that  frustration It will pass Sanders is a uniquely honest politician He spoke to issues progressives care about in a way no candidate in recent memory has Its tough to see him get so close and lose But worry not Democrats Nearly every Bernie delegate I spoke to hinted that theyll support Clinton in November and those who said they wont conceded that a Trump administration is a nightmare Will there be some who abstain Perhaps But not enough to matter And the majority of delegates vowing to writein Sanders or vote for a third party candidate are doing so because they live in nonswing states And that ought to comfort panicked Democrats
