Shame to waste Corbyn on a snap election says May 041116 THERESA May does not want a snap general election because it would be a waste of Jeremy Corbyn she has confirmed The Conservative leader still has lots of policies she wants to pursue while she has an entirely ineffectual opposition and has no intention of rushing anything She said You dont throw away your Get Out of Jail Free card at the first opportunity You save it for when you really need it And when its castiron boltedon that youll win the next election at a walk no matter what you do to the NHS or the public finances or whatever then you take your time The Brexit court thing is annoying  I have dinner plans for April 2019 I dont want to change  but the last thing I need is the Labour party coming to their senses and getting in my way Ive got free licence to do whatever I want to Britain for the next nine years and I cant do any of it without Jeremy Hes not going anywhere until 2020 Corbyn said Thank Christ for that I thought I was going to be out of a job Share
