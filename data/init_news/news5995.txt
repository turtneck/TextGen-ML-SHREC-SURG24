NEW YORK  Donald Trump seemed to help his case after meeting with hundreds of evangelical leaders in Times Square on Tuesday Hes going to need that crucial voting bloc to have a real shot at winning the presidencyFrom megachurch pastors to longtime stalwarts they heard Trump speak out about defending religious liberty including his desire to get rid of IRS restrictions that muzzlepolitical talk from the pulpit Trump said a repeal may be my biggest contribution to Christianity  In that room among the 900 or so evangelical leaders there were quite a few who were not for Trump going into the meeting After the meeting some minds seemed to change  The ball has moved forward a little bit And I appreciate Mr Trumps willingness to reach out to the evangelical community said Matt Barber founder and editorin chief of BarbWirecom  After hearing him today I will prayerfully consider it as a possibility in light of the alternative reflected Barber  That alternative is Hillary Clinton Trump made clear his Supreme Court picks would make them proud unlike what Clinton might bring to the tableTrump also talked about how evangelicals need to band together because their rights and values are under attackWhat pleased some attendees was that Trump didnt appear to make any major mistakes or give reason for pause  I cant remember any time during the several hours this morning that his answer disappointed or that there was chagrin about it recalled Gary Bauer president of American Values  Trumps senior adviser Sarah Huckabee also attended the event  He did something that most Republican nominees in the past have refused to do and thats walk into this room and be willing to sit down take their questions and really interact with them in a very big way Huckabee told CBN News  With some evangelicals still wary the brash outsider will need more outreach but for now at least it seems to be working  As it pertains to the evangelical vote and the candidacy of Donald J Trump todays meeting may very well be a tipping point predicted Rev Samuel Rodriguez president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference   A profamily leader Rodriguez says he knew plenty of pastors who were skeptical before the meeting but inside something changed he said  After hearing his commitment his very welldefined articulated commitment to religious liberty and life the Supreme Court especially I think you saw a number of the same pastors walk out going thats what I needed to hear Rodriguez said  And thats something the Trump campaign needed to hear after a rough few weeks of headlinesIt will be important for them to build on any progress here by getting evangelicals to move beyond words and work actively for Trump among their flocks
