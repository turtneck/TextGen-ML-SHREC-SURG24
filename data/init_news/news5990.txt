White HouseTesla under Trump How will electric cars fare under the next presidentRepublican presidential candidate Sen Marco Rubio RFla answers a question as Republican presidential candidate businessman Donald Trump listens during a Republican presidential primary debate hosted by ABC News at the St Anselm College Saturday Feb 6 2016 in Manchester NHMarco Rubios uneven debate performance just days before Tuesdays New Hampshire primary has emboldened a trio of governors seeking to stem his rise in the Republican race for president But if Rubios rivals can slow him in New Hampshire they are likely to leave the GOP with a muddled mix of establishment contenders and no clear favorite to challenge Donald Trump and Ted CruzAt the heart of the battle between Rubio and Chris Christie John Kasich and Jeb Bush is whether the freshman Florida senator has the experience and policy depth to serve as president  or whether hes simply a wellspoken lightweight Christie unleashed withering attacks against Rubio in Saturdays debate and the New Jersey governor tripped up Rubio by calling him out in realtime for his reliance on rehearsed talking pointsThe morning after Christie declared the Republican contest a changed raceThere was a march amongst some in the chattering class to anoint Sen Rubio Christie said on CNNs State of the Union I think after last night thats overChristie and his fellow governors need that to be the case given that theyve staked their White House hopes on New Hampshire Without a strong showing each will face enormous pressure to drop out from Republican Party leaders eager to rally around a single candidate who can challenge Cruz and Trump the toptwo finishers in the leadoff Iowa caucusesTrump has held a commanding lead in New Hampshire preference polls for months Cruz is in the mix with Rubio and the governors though his campaign is more focused on the Southern states that follow later in the primary calendarThe prospect of Trump or Cruz winning the GOP nomination has set many Republican leaders on edge and that anxiousness is only likely to increase should New Hampshire voters leave Rubio and the governors clustered together in the primary results failing to anoint one as their preferred challenger to the frontrunnersA Monmouth University survey released Sunday still shows Trump with a commanding doubledigit lead over his Republican rivals with 30 percent of likely Republican primary voters saying they would vote for him But theres a cluster of candidates statistically tied for second place Kasich has 14 percent of would be voters Rubio came in with 13 percent former Florida Gov Jeb Bush also had 13 percent and Cruz had 12 percent supportWhile most candidates remained unchanged in their polling numbers from last months Monmouth survey Bush jumped nine points since January The Monmouth survey indicated that just 9 percent of NH Republican voters are undecidedThe poll was taken before Saturdays debate but no other Republican candidates had double digit supportRubio emerged from Iowa looking as though he was that candidate with a thirdplace finish in Iowa that was stronger than expected Rival campaigns conceded privately in the days leading up to the debate that he was pulling away from the governorsBut the Florida senator stumbled in Saturdays debate when challenged about his qualifications repeatedly falling back on a retort meant to distinguish himself from President Barack Obama who also won the White House as a firstterm senatorFor Barbara OBrien an undecided voter who had been considering voting for Rubio it was enough to convince her he wasnt the right choiceHe kept saying the same thing over and over again said OBrien a 67yearold from Manchester who is one of New Hampshires many registered independents He didnt look presidentialGOP voter Judy McKenna 66 had been leaning toward Rubio but said she was disappointed in his debate performanceThe governors all made great points about experience especially Christie and Rubio did not have any answer to counter that argument McKenna saidRubio acknowledged the criticism during a rally in Londonderry on Sunday morning He then proceeded to repeat the same line that put him in Christies crosshairsIm going to say it again he told the audience of more than 800 gathered in a school cafeteria The reason why these things are troubling is because Barack Obama is the first president at least in my lifetime that wants to change the country Change the country not fix itRubio senior adviser Todd Harris said the candidates repetition underscores his laser focus on upending the Obama administrations agendaWere going to continue to attack Barack Obamas record over and over and over again Harris said I dont think there is any Republican primary voter who was watching that debate who was saying I wish he would lay off of Barack ObamaSeeking to counter the notion of a misstep Rubios campaign said it raised 600000 during the debate three times more than it has brought in during previous debates The fundraising numbers were unverifiableThe senators crowds remained large and enthusiastic on Sunday and some of the many undecided voters who attended his events said they were more bothered by Christies aggressive demeanorIt was tiresome Ive heard it before said Katherine Bringhurst a 66yearold retired office manager Shes undecided heading into Tuesdays election but leaning toward RubioMaria Tourlitis an independent from Hudson decided to vote for Rubio after hearing him speak in her hometown on Saturday As she greeted the senator after the event she leaned in and said At the next debate please stand up to ChristieIf Christies aggressive attacks on Rubio result in his own standing tumbling it could benefit Bush the former governor of Florida and Kasich the current governor of Ohio Both stepped back in the debate to allow Christie to take the lead in targeting Rubio though they were happy to relish in the afterglowHes a great speaker Bush said of Rubio his onetime political protg on Fox News Sunday But he came across as totally scripted and kind of roboticKasich has prided himself on avoiding direct criticism of his rivals during the campaign and kept up that strategy both in the debate and as he campaigned SundayWouldnt it be great if we could win being positive Kasich said on
