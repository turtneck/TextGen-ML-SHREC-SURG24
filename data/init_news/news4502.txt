  Recipient Email  Theres playing with fire and theres dousing yourself with gasoline and jumping into a flaming pit I do the latter in a piece for SCMPs This Week in Asia magazine The British Forgery at the Heart of India and Chinas Tibetan Border Dispute  My proposed title Uncle Sam Plays the Great Game in Arunachal Pradesh didnt make the cut In my piece I take the visit of the US Ambassador to India Richard Verma as an opportunity to unpack the history and significance of the 1914 Simla Convention between Great Britain Tibet and China an imperial episode which also saw the birth of the notorious McMahon Line The McMahon Line is notorious since India unilaterallyand with some help from the United States and zero agreement from the PRCasserts that the McMahon Line is the indisputable boundary between India and the PRC in Indias Northeast The McMahon Line is a hotbutton issue for Tibetan nationalists as well since Great Britain negotiated it directly with the government of Tibet so supporting the McMahon Line delivers the dual benefits of supporting the narrative of the existence of a recognized independent Tibetan government and giving aid and comfort to the Tibetan diasporas Indian patron The actual situation and significant consequence of the McMahon Line is complicated but I believe accessible thanks to some deft historical research by several scholars and despite some litigating by Indian and Tibetan partisans Having said that I welcome correction and instruction so in this post Im going to lay out the arguments behind the assertions in my SCMP piece in greater detail For sourcing I lean on Neville Maxwell Indias China War Maxwell was the Times of London s India correspondent during the 1962 war and a key figure in revisionist analysis of the roots of the war and an unpublished dissertation by Dr Heather Spence British policy and the development of Tibet 19121933 that I found very informative on the diplomatic and geopolitical context of the Great BritainTibet relationship preandpostSimla The story of the McMahon Line is inseparable frombut not identical withthe story of the Simla Convention negotiations between Great Britainrepresented by Henry McMahonChina and Tibet at the hill town of Simla in India in 1914 First off the key and most interesting aspects of the Simla Convention are both the de facto independence of Tibet which had expelled the Chinese by 1914 and had a government in Lhasa under the Dalai Lama with effective control over much of the area of Tibetand Great Britains consistent and overriding interest in denying de jure independence for Tibet Great Britain was obsessed perhaps unhealthily so with playing the Great Game forestalling the southern creep of Russian influence in Asia toward India In Indias northeast this translated into the desire to establish Tibet as a buffer state that was proBritish and secure ProBritish was not an issue in 1914 since the Dalai Lama at the time was an ardent Anglophile who had spent several years of exile in the sympathetic company of the British administrator Charles Bell Secure was the problem The Raj had no interest in rolling the geopolitical dice by endorsing Tibetan independence and with it the possibility that a hostile new regime and adverse set of circumstances might bring the Chinese or Russians into Tibet and up to Indias doorstep but it also lacked the will or capacity to assert and enforce a unilateral protectorate over Tibet It was deemed necessary that if and when China emerged from the chaos of the 1911 Revolution as a powerprojecting state it would acquiesce to the existence of an autonomous Tibetan government that had a special relationship with Great Britain So Henry McMahon summoned Tibetan and Chinese representatives to Simla to order the relations between Tibet and China and between Tibet and Great Britain The Tibetans were eager to attend the Chinese were compelled by McMahons threat that he would conclude a bilateral agreement with Tibet if they didnt show up One can speculateand I willthat the Chinese showed up primarily to stall and throw a spanner in the works Simla acknowledged Chinas roleand also gave China the chance to act as the spoiler by participating in the negotiations but refusing to endorse the outcome The core of the British agenda at Simla was to partition Tibet into Inner and Outer Tibet as the Russians had just done with Inner and Outer Mongolia Inner Tibet the parts abutting Sichuan in which Chinese control was stronger would be incorporated into China Outer Tibetthe big part the strategic part the highlands run out of Lhasa by the Dalai Lamawould not become independent it would be an autonomous government lacking control over its foreign affairs Autonomy but autonomy of a specific type was preferred McMahon came up with the idea of suzerainty Suzerainty served multiple purposes By invoking a Chinese aegis suzerainty was a legal fig leaf providing diplomatic cover to Great Britain which had concluded an agreement with Russia in 1907 that promised neither state would conduct direct negotiations with the Tibetan government At the same time suzerainty was intended to forestall any claims from Russia and other nations that Outer Tibet was part of China and therefore subject to the Open Door policy declaring that the rights and access of one state in China were to be enjoyed by all But most importantly suzerainty was used to assert that by Chinas leave Tibet would be autonomous but still conduct its foreign affairs independently with respect to only to one and only one country Great Britain So in essence the Simla Convention was designed to secure a special relationship between Great Britain and Tibet with Chinese endorsement to compensate for the fact that Great Britain lacked the resolve to secure Tibet as a formal British protectorate The Chinese however did not endorse The Chinese representative initialed the draft agreement but the Chinese government withheld authorization to sign To explain its refusal the Chinese government placed the onus on the issue of boundary delimitation The Chinese foreign affairs office formally notified Great Britain that This Government has several times stated that it gives its support to the majority of the articles of the Convention The part which it is unable to agree to is that dealing with the question of boundary Spence pg 36 I expect it was McMahons fallback plan from the gitgo to try to take in the bilateral what China refused to cede in the trilateral McMahon had been instructed by London not to sign bilaterally with just Tibet but he decided to exceed his instructions concluding an agreement with Tibet that finessed the Chinese nonparticipation in the Simla Convention with a declaration that China by not signing had simply forfeited the privileges for China negotiated in the Convention According to this formula Great Britain and Tibet would execute the parts of the Convention that pertained to themmainly diplomatic Tibet would not enter into agreements with any other foreign power without Britains OK and trade The agreement waived all tariffs between British India and Tibet a piece of freetrade maneuvering that advantaged the Raj but caused no small fiscal problems and resentment of the Tibetan government which had relied on taxing exports of wool to India for a significant part of its revenue in the 1920s At Simla the Chinese representative Ivan Chen was excluded from these discussions unaware of the content of the bilateral undertakings and invited to go to a separate room while British and Tibetan representatives signed them Unsurprisingly he declared the Chinese government would not recognize any agreement concluded bilaterally between Great Britain and Tibet a declaration that was repeated by the Chinese Minister in London No one regarded the gains of the bilateral track as an adequate replacement for a trilateral pact It was understood by all concernedGreat Britain India Tibet China indeed McMahon himselfSimla was a bust McMahon reported to London It is with great regret that I leave India without having secured the formal adherence of the Chinese Government to a Tripartite AgreementThe fact is that the negotiations at Simlabroke down Maxwell 49 Mindful that without Chinas formal participation the agreement at Simla was in conflict with the 1907 convention with Russia Great Britain did not publish the Simla Convention Instead it belatedly took notice of the negotiations in its official compendium Aitchisons Treaties and Sanads 1929 Edition Volume XIV  with the terse remark The convention was initialled and sealed on 3 July 1914 As this Convention was not signed and ratified by all three parties the current Chinese Government does not consider itself bound by the terms of this convention As for the McMahon Line it was a separate bilateral sideshow to the main issue of trying to demarcate a border between Tibet and China aka Inner and Outer Tibet trilaterally at Simla Prior to and contemporaneously with the tripartite negotiations on the Simla Convention the British and Tibetan teams had conducted bilateral discussions in Delhi and Simla as to the position of the boundary between India and Tibet Since Great Britain regarded Tibet as de facto autonomous in its dealings with Great Britain and presumably hopeful the special relationship would be shortly confirmed at Simla as de jure   no effort was made during the negotiations to involve China with rather disastrous implications for the future In 1962 India would be facing not the Tibetan government across the McMahon Line but the Peoples Republic of China which with very good reason considered itself in no way bound as a successor to any previous border negotiations With equally disastrous consequences for Nehru and India in 1962 McMahon instead of drawing the boundary in the foothills of the Himalayas drew it along the crestline in easy reach of attackers from the north but virtually indefensible from the south The key horsetrading occurred in the matter of the Tawang Tract Tawang was an indisputable locus of Tibetan control with a big monastery dominating a fertile valley at the southern reaches of the Tibetan plateau and also dominating in a less than admirable way a local population of ethnic Manpo serfs exploited in the most dire fashion By virtue of its riverine topography Tawang straddled an important trade route between Lhasa and northern India and was therefore seen as a potential military threatpower point that the Raj wished to control In the bilateral BritishTibetan boundary discussions the western terminus of McMahons line crept north until it included all of Tawang The Tibetan delegation was apparently not happy about this state of affairs but accepted it as the price of British support and with the reassurance that they could continue to tax Tawang despite its inclusion into British India The IndianTibetan boundary agreement was enshrined in an 8 mile to the inch map and held in two copies one by the British and one in Lhasa The McMahon Line was introduced into the Simla negotiations through the back door as it were by presenting it as a fait accompli on the largescale map intended for attachment to the Simla Convention as a continuation of the crucial line defining the boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet which had indeed been the subject of genuine tripartite negotiations Interestingly the British and Tibetans also bilaterally extended the boundary to enclose Aksai Chin a barren waste to the west of Tibet as Tibetan not Indian territory in order to give Tibet the incentive or responsibility to keep the Russians out of that sensitive strategic area Ivan Chen initialed the treaty and mapthe sole shaky basis for Indias subsequent insistence that China had accepted the McMahon Linebut was rebuked by Peking for exceeding his instructions and as noted above declined to sign the final Convention At the time as recorded in Aitchison it was universally understood that China had rejected the Simla Convention and that this was a problem that overshadowed whatever informal gains had accrued to Britain through the bilateral agreements with Tibet We know this thanks to documents demonstrating that both the Tibetans and Great Britain clung to the Simla suzerainty gambit and that they labored fruitlessly for decades to get China back to the negotiating table to validate the policy The key concern was that China by refusing to sign the tripartite Simla Convention had refused to countenance the InnerOuter Tibet arrangement that would have fixed the SinoTibetan border assured the autonomy and security of the government in Lhasa and justified to Lhasa Great Britains extensive unique and increasingly onerous diplomatic and trading privileges in Outer Tibet Immediately subsequent to the Simla negotiations 1915 internal British correspondence characterized the Simla Convention as invalid Spence pg 59 and in the context of the Great War without basis as an obligation for arming Lhasa to forestall Chinese mischief In 1919 the Tibetan chief minister evocatively expressed his concern that Tibet would find itself abandoned like tiny fledglings on an open plain Spence pg 48 As for China instead of returning to negotiations and acquiescing to suzerainity over a virtually independent Tibetan arrangement it was perhaps only pretending to countenance before it backed out at Simla when China was flat on its back and the Raj was at its zenithit preferred to mass troops on Tibets Sichuan frontier and agitate for direct engagement with Lhasa It soon became apparent that China was shall we say the rising power in the Himalayan regions the British were the declining power and it became a matter of considerable anxiety in Lhasa that China was piling up troops in the eastern marches and the Tibetan government was being forced to confront these forces without any significant military or diplomatic support from Great Britain Faced with niggardly and tardy provision of guns and ammunition by Great Britain Lhasa began playing footsie with Russia and Japan via Mongolia to pursue the supply of arms amazingly Great Britain was able to veto these initiatives thanks to the special position in Tibetan security affairs it had negotiated bilaterally at Simla The Tibetan government came to understand that the Simla Convention and the idea that Britain had the sincerity and capacity to protect Tibet against China were at best on life support By 1936 a British political officer reported on the mood in Lhasa as follows They regarded the adjustment of the TibetIndian boundary as part and parcel of the general adjustment and determination of boundaries contemplated in the 1914 Convention If they could with our help secure a definite SinoTibetan boundary they would of course be glad to observe the IndoTibetan border as defined in 1914 Maxwell 59 With Simla moribund the McMahon Line was never demarcated on the ground and as a result it never acquired any customary force as a precedent Notably there were no serious efforts to assert effective British rule in the remote tribal reaches of the McMahon line or even over Tawang until the 1930s Then with the Japanese menace replacing Russia as the focus of the Great Britains anxieties concerning northern encroachment the Raj adopted a policy which might be characterized as Fck Tibet unilaterally extending British control northwards without reference to the original and unrealized vision of backing Tibet in return for the trade and territorial privileges that Great Britain had negotiated two decades before At this point Olaf Caroe enters the picture Caroe was a key official in the British Raj and an enthusiastic geopolitical strategist In 1935 Tibetan authorities in Tawang arrested a British spybotanist and the government in Lhasa made the decision unwise in retrospect to issue a protest to the British authorities and thereby bring Lhasas claims to Tawang to Caroes attention In response Caroe pulled off a rather notorious subterfuge in order to buttress the British claim to Tawang he published the Simla Convention for the first time in 1938 with a note misrepresenting that it had included settlement of the border and alienation of Tawang and he arranged for the publication of official Survey of India maps that for the first time showed the McMahon Line as the official boundary To advance the narrative he also corresponded with commercial atlas publishers to put the McMahon Line on their maps as well In a telling indication of Caroes jiggerypokery to avoid the awkward question of why he was first publishing the Simla Convention twentyfour years after the fact in 1938 he instead arranged for the surreptitious printing of a spurious backdated edition of Aitchison  deleting the original note about the Chinese governments nonsignature and replacing it with a lengthy note stating quite falsely that The Simla Convention included a definition of boundaries Since 1 the McMahon Line had been concluded in secret bilateral negotiations between Tibet and Great Britain outside the Convention and 2 the Chinese had officially refused to recognize any bilateral agreement boundary or otherwise between Tibet and Great Britain and 3 had declined to sign the Simla Convention itself and 4 had notified Great Britain in 1914 that the specific sticking point was the boundaries this was hoohah The replacement copy was distributed to various libraries with instructions to withdraw and destroy the original edition The subterfuge was only discovered in 1963 when JA Addis a British diplomat discovered a surviving copy of the original edition at Harvard and compared it to Caroes version That was too late for Nehru who apparently sincerely accepted Caroes maps as holy writ ie the accurate depiction of borders that had been trilaterally negotiated at Simla published openly acknowledged and a moral imperative and worthy object of Indian military defense in 1962 It was also too late for Harvards own John Kenneth Galbraith who as ambassador to India successfully lobbied President Kennedy to declare the McMahon Line as Indias recognized border apparently as part of his campaign to support India and elevate the PRCIndia conflict beyond the mundane sphere of clash over disputed border to Chicom aggression against India In response to Galbraiths urgings President Kennedy overrode the concerns of the State Department and the vociferous objections of Chiang Kaishek on Taiwan the government of China in 1962 as far as the US was concerned to give Galbraith the leeway to announce The McMahon Line is the accepted international border and is sanctioned by modern usage Accordingly we regard it as the northern border of the North East Frontier Agency region Well accepted international border sanctioned by modern usage is something of a stretch As noted above not only the Chinese but the Tibetan government of the 1930s itself to be extinguished by the Chinese in 1959 regarded the McMahon Line as a dead letter In discussions with Nehru in the 1950s Zhou Enlai had made the rather telling statement that he had never heard of the McMahon Line The Chinese government only understood the full extent of the boundary understandings between the Tibetan and British governments in 1914 after the PLA seized documents in the Potala Palace during the 1959 invasion and Zhou subsequently declared the McMahon Line a piece of imperial fraud Imperial historiansAddis Maxwell and Lambhad the opportunity to examine British records a few years later when the fiftyyear embargo on government records expired and agreed with Zhou The revelation of these contacts made a good case for de facto Tibetan independence between the two world wars unfortunately they also at the same time clearly demonstrated that the Chinese government had never been party to them or to the McMahon Line Much has been made in Indian and Tibetan nationalist circles of Zhou Enlais willingness to use the McMahon Line as the basis for a border settlement between India and the PRC However this had nothing to do with any acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the line which after all had never been demarcated in the field and perhaps had something to do with the fact that as the 1962 war demonstrated the task of defending the McMahon Line on the edge of the Tibetan plateau is a tremendous strategic burden for India The truth about the legal and military aspects of the 1962 SinoIndian War are I would venture still a matter of denial and disinformation especially in India The HendersonBrooks Report which details the strategic and operational failings of the Indian military establishment in 1962 has never been declassified despite Prime Minister Modis previous promises in that regard only portions of it are in the public domain thanks to Neville Maxwell who somehow got his hands on a copy Asserting the purported sanctity of the McMahon Line and Chinese perfidy in refusing to honor it is a staple of the patriotic narrative In its combination of nationalist posturing and pseudohistorical bullsht the Indian position on the McMahon Line bookends the PRCs claims in the South China Sea in interesting ways And of course the United States as part of its proIndiaantiChina tilt is more interested in enabling the myths of the McMahon Line than supporting resolution of the SinoIndian border
