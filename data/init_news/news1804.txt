Boston magazine has a long take on William Weld former Massachusetts governor currently Libertarian vice presidential candidateThe main takeaway after some of the usual slightly sneery scenesetting about weirdo libertarians reported from Julys FreedomFest in Las Vegas and the lovely color detail of the patrician Weld being amazed hes staying in a New York hotel whose price is three digits beginning with oneThat while Weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time hes also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark like writing novels and hates being bored and likes being in the political mixAn unnamed former adviser says Theres nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody elses dime flying first class and talking to political reporters all day Another unnamed former staffer says of Weld He is old money white and fucking brilliantEverybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office and he always embraced them and made them his ownReason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between Weld and libertarianism as most define it despite Welds longtime affection for that selfidentification and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the WeldLibertarian storyThe profile by Simon van ZuylenWood sums up that conflictWelds strategy isnt to try to defend libertarian ideas Instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear When Johnson suggests abolishing the Internal Revenue Service Weld raises an eyebrow and clarifies that he wouldnt go that far When asked about gun control Weld suggests the formationcue a million Libertarians choking on their dinnerof a massive new FBI task force  I ask him at random about climate change He advocates pragmatic mainstream and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius These arent ideas his freemarket brethren take kindly to He smiles He doesnt care Im running as myselfWeld to Reason TV in May on why Libertarians can trust him
