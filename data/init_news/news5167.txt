Republican legislators have repeatedly tried to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood  questioning why the nonprofit gets money from the government in the first placeIn the wake ofsting videos taped inside Planned Parenthood clinics Sen Rand Paul RKYpromised to use all legislative vehicles at his disposal to force a vote defunding the organization Sen Ted Cruz RTX made similar promises to file an amendment that would according to the Hill eliminate all federal funding for Planned ParenthoodPlanned Parenthood receives more than 500 million annually in government funding mostly through Medicaid and grants Most of this money goes toward providing lowincome women with family planning services like STD screening and contraceptive coverage Planned Parenthood is without a doubt one of the largest providers in this space Of the 67 million women who rely on public programs to pay for contraceptives 24 million of them  36 percent  do so at Planned Parenthoods 817 clinics across the countryIf Congress did defund Planned Parenthood it would be a huge blow to the group About 40 percent of its budget comes from government grants and much of that spending gets done on the federal level Because Planned Parenthood is such a large provider in this space its hard to see other clinics stepping in to fill the gap that it would leaveJust over 40 percent of Planned Parenthoods budget comes from government grants and reimbursements the organizations most recent budget report shows Between June 2013 and 2014 Planned Parenthood received 5284 million in public funding a big chunk of its 13 billion national budgetThat 5284 million figure covers both state and federal funding and Planned Parenthood does not publicly break out how much money it gets just from federal funding The best estimate arguably comes from the Government Accountability Office which estimated that Planned Parenthood received 105 million in federal funding in 2012There are two main ways Planned Parenthood receives public funds One is through Medicaid the public health insurance program that covers 71 million lowincome Americans Whenever a Medicaid patient has an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic the nonprofit will bill the health plan for whatever services the patient usesThe other source of funding is grants largely through the Title X Family Planning Program  the only domestic grant program dedicated to family planning Organizations like Planned Parenthood often use Title X grants to subsidize birth control STD screenings and other reproductive health services for lowincome patients who may lack health insurance coveragePlanned Parenthood receives Title X funds both directly from the federal government and from states which will sometimes make the nonprofits health center a subgrantee for the dollars they receive from the federal governmentBoth Title X and Medicaid provide low to middleincome women with financial assistance to cover family planning costs Medicaid might for example reimburse Planned Parenthood when it provides a patient with an HPV vaccine And a Planned Parenthood clinic could use Title X grants to subsidize the placement of an IUD which can cost upward of 500 for an uninsured patientThe exact family planning benefits that Medicaid covers varies from state to state But generally many states will cover contraceptives STD screenings HPV vaccines and cancer screenings as well as sterilization and reversal procedures  and will reimburse Planned Parenthood when it is the providerThirtytwo states and the District of Columbia have Medicaid programs that will pay for abortions although those health plans are barred from using federal dollars  and have to use the states share of funding to pay for the procedureTitle X often covers the same type of services as Medicaid except for women who are not on the public program One important difference Title X funds are never available to be used for abortions even in states where the Medicaid program covers the procedureFederal law expressly prohibits the use of Title X funds to pay for abortions  while abortion providers like Planned Parenthood can qualify for grants the government requires that no federal dollars go toward the termination of pregnanciesNo legislation to defund Planned Parenthood has ever passed so its a bit hard to know  and even how exactly Planned Parenthood would lose its fund varies in different legislative proposalsHistorically when congressional Republicans have talked about defunding Planned Parenthood theyve meant barring the group from receiving Title X fundsThis is the type of bill the House passed in 2011 It would have disallowed any abortion providers  Planned Parenthood clinics or otherwise  from getting Title X grant fundsThat type of bill would put a dent in Planned Parenthoods budget but it would be far from ending the groups federal funding They would still receive funding through Medicaid a much larger program than Title X  and near certainly a bigger chunk of Planned Parenthoods budgetPlanned Parenthood does not provide a breakdown of its government funding but separate data suggests it almost certainly gets way more public revenue from the Medicaid patients it sees One analysis from the Guttmacher Institute shows that Medicaid a program jointly funded by states and the federal government pays for 75 percent of publicly funded family planning services in the United States  while Title X covers 10 percentIn order to fully defund Planned Parenthood Congress would need to pass a law that bars Medicaid from reimbursing its clinics for patient visits there This type of amendment hasnt historically come up in congressional debates about cutting Planned Parenthoods budget perhaps because its a much more drastic move than proposing cuts to Planned Parenthoods Title X funding
