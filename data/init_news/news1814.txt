was referencing how in the runup to the 911 attacks top law enforcement and intelligence agencies including the CIA and the FBI werent coordinating as closely as they do nowFormer Florida Gov Jeb Bush one of Trumps rivals for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination said during the last Republican debate that his brother the former president kept us safe Trump on Friday reopened that feud and challenged that assertionHow pathetic for realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 911 We were attacked  my brother kept us safe he tweetedTrump even suggested Monday that the Bush administration knew in advance the US would be attackedCIA Director George Tenet knew in advance that there was going to be an attack Trump saidHe knew in advance that there was going to be an attackWhile Tenet did go to the White House two months before 911 with intelligence reports suggesting alQaeda was plotting a terrorist attack on the US Tenet did not know when or how those attacks would unfold and he did not know how reliable the intercepted chatter wasFormer Trump political aide Roger Stone who is also a wellknown conspiracy theorist pushed a similar line hours before Trump called into Fox News tweeting that Tenet admitted he had 60 day advance warning of attack on Americaand did nothingStone also tweeted two days before that realDonaldTrump is right  Bush Admin knew of attack on America 60 days in advance did nothingTrump also said Monday that tougher immigration policies like the ones he would implement if he became president would have thwarted the 911 terrorist

brash billionaire Bush has in recent months taken Trump on directly and forcefully this weekend explaining on CNNs State of the Union that he has grave doubts about Trumps preparedness to handle the responsibilities of president of the United States Bush also linked Trumps candidacy to the antics of Trumps reality show The ApprenticeBut Trumps criticism of the two Bushes is doing more than just dragging the former Florida governor and onetime establishment favorite for the nomination into a mud fight Its also provoking Jeb Bush into repeated impassioned defenses of his brothers tenure as president which remains contentiousJeb Bush struggled early in the campaign to call his brothers decision to invade Iraq a mistake  a judgment that today has broad consensus  as he almost reflexively defended his brotherAnd Jeb Bush did it again this weekend in the face of Trumps latest attack over 911My brother responded to a crisis and he did it as you would hope a president would do He united the country he organized our country and he kept us safe And theres no denying that The great majority of Americans believe that Bush said
