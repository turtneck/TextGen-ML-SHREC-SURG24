The Republican Partys identity crisis keeps getting worse Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump the presumptive GOP nominee 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor saying that he was dismayed by the state of American politics and that he wished for better choices for candidates who unfortunately do not exist anymoreWhile Romney ruled out the possibility of a thirdparty candidacy during a QA at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the GOP that he could not support Trump in good conscience nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary ClintonI see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that well see more greatness he said according to the Washington ExaminerEarlier this year Romney championed the Never Trump movement attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race and John Kasich soon after but that didnt stop Romney from sticking to his convictionsI happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world so I am dismayed at where we are now he said I wish we had better choices and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better and I just dont see an easy answer from where we areRomney also praised Ryan his former running mate who recently took on Trump He is where he needs to be he explained saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House GOP to work together Id love to see him run for president but having a Speaker of the House at this stage where we dont know whats going to happen on the presidential race having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging I have hopes that hell remain SpeakerRomney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the partys nomineethat honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse who quickly argued that an adult step in and run for president on a thirdparty ticketbut he is by far the most prominent So far there have been rumblings within an embarrassed GOP that they could never support Trump both George HW Bush and his son George W Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his reelection chances in Arizona a Latinoheavy state that borders Mexico And as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an email blast that sentiment isnt limited to highprofile Republicans either dozens of other GOP congressional representatives governors and major political figures are all quickly boarding the antiTrump trainor at the very least refusing to comment
