Region Russia in the World More bang for the buck is the most apt description when we compare spending of the United States Government with that of the Government of the Russian Federation on its defense sector and military technology development A closer look at the two budgets reveals the huge fault line that cuts across the entire US economy today It also mirrors the true collapse of the American hegemon as a world power It need not have been In the official Fiscal Year 2017 the US Department of Defense officially requested 5239 billion in what they call discretionary funding as in we use it as we please no independent audit allowed Another 588 billion was requested for socalled Overseas Contingency Operations typical Pentagonspeak for wars everywhere from Afghanistan to Syria to military operations around the South China sea That made an official total of 583 billion requested and granted by a docile Congress  On October 13 the Russian wireservice Tassru reported that the Russian government is set to spend 94859 billion rubles on national defense in 2017 according to the draft federal budget posted It sounds like a lot almost one trillion rubles If we convert at the current dollar exchange rate this translates into a mere 15 billion Of that 79379 billion rubles or 127 billion is planned to be spent on the Russian Armed Forces In 2015 the Russian Federation spent 26 billion on the state militaryindustrial complex development program will reach 167 trillion rubles  That total for military industry investment and maintaining Russias armed forces some 49 billion equals 84  of the dollar amount the United States Defense Department plays with annually  To that must be added the separate amount of 400 billion for modernization of Russian armed forces military capabilities by 2020 Thats roughly another 80 billion a year Now the relevant question at a time when Washingtonled NATO forces are aggressively moving to the borders of the Russian Federation when US Pentagon Special Forces and mercenaries like Blackwater aka Academi are mucking around Ukraine causing mischief destruction and murder is which country is getting better defense or military capacities for every dollar spent Astonishing performance The answer came following the September 30 2015 Russian announcement that it had agreed to respond with military support to the call of the legitimate government of Syria What Russian military efforts have accomplished with meager resources has astonished most western military experts Far from being the dilapidated technologically obsolescent Sovietera military that many US planners reckon Russias armed forces have undergone a quiet and impressive modernization ever since it became clear around 2007 that Washington was intent on pushing NATO to Moscows front door in Ukraine and Georgia as well as threatening with US missile defense in Poland Czech Republic and now also in Bulgaria Romania and Turkey Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shiogu is a remarkable organizer who is known for reorganizing large Russian government departments Before becoming Defense Minister he was head of the large Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations responsible for emergency situations such as floods earthquakes and acts of terrorism The result of Russias military modernization partly demonstrated in the military intervention in Syria has been a strategic shift in the global military balance of power that Washingtons neoconservatives none of whom have served in active duty military theatres did not reckon with Russian science and engineering have accomplished astonishing results with minimum investment Just a select glance at what is being developed is instructive Hypersonic nuclear missile On October 25 the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau published the first image of the newest heavy intercontinental ballistic missile the RS28 Sarmat known under NATOs reporting name SSX30 It will replace its predecessor the R36M2 Voyevoda or NATO reporting name SS18 Satan It is now in test phase and will enter service at the end of 2018 The SSX30 will replace the worlds most powerful strategic missile the SS18 Satan One reason Washington pursued the Start1 strategic arms reduction treaty with Moscow was because the Pentagon estimated that the SS18 with its multiple warhead consisting of ten independently targetable reentry vehicles each having a yield of 750 kilotons was a serious threat Now the new successor SSX30 according to Tass military analyst Viktor Litovkin is far more threatening While specific details are top secret according to Litovkin the new ICBM will evade any missile defense arrays Washington can install It has far smaller liftoff mass and a greater range of flight up to 17000 kilometers able to reach virtually any target in the Continental USA It is designed to go on flight paths crossing the South Pole from where they are leastexpected and where no missile shields are being created Each missile will carry between 1015 independently targetable nuclear warheads in a grape cluster able to separate from the cluster one by one when a preloaded program issues the order to attack the selected target Litovkin adds  He says that the SSX30 reentry vehicle called by Russian media Yu71 and by its developer object 4202 or Aeroballistic Hypersonic Warhead will fly at hypersonic speeds of Mach 17 roughly 43 miles 7km per second with flight paths altitude and direction constantly changing all the time making it immune to any missile defenses the Pentagon has deployed in Poland or South Korea even those relying on spacebased elements For the SSX30 it makes no difference if there is a missile defense or if there is none It will slip through unnoticed says Litovkin  The new missile is capable of wiping out a country the size of France with nuclear explosions 2000 times more powerful than the bomb used at Hiroshima in 1945 by Washington  Pentagon bucks go to waste The SSX30 development is but one of numerous gamechanging weapons technologies Russia has been combat testing in Syria Another is the cuttingedge Russian T14 Armata tank that has no western competitor Russian fighter jets have demonstrated their value in Syria and Russian antimissile Contrast this with the colossal waste of US defense budget spending Washington is used to fight wars like the school classroom bully only against tiny unequipped enemies like Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi in Libya Granted US defense giants like Boeing or Lockheed Martin are working on hypersonic jets and other classified new weapons However the efficiency of every dollar spent on US military hardware is overshadowed by the effective of Russian defense spending A recent US Defense Department report stated that the budget controls of the pentagon are nonexistent Alone the US Department of the Army cannot provide an audit trail for a cumulative 65 trillion of expenses  There are deep cultural and historical reasons why Russia has responded to the actions of Washington and NATO since 2007 as they have They are deadly serious about defending the Russian Motherland as they term it Washington politicians regardless who is President would do well to take this into their calculations when they egg on European NATO partners to provoke Russia in every way imaginable Europeans would also do well to reconsider whether being Washingtons front line in NATO is worth the price of possible nuclear pulverization I think not personally F William Engdahl is strategic risk consultant and lecturer
