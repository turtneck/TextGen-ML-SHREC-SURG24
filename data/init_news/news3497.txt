Mitt Romney the 2012 Republican nominee won the state by nearly 50 points Republicans hold the states governors office both of its US Senate seats and all four of its US House seats The party holds 84 of the states House of Representatives and 79 of the state SenateYet Donald Trump has a very real Utah problem And its largely because of one relatively unknown candidate independent Evan McMullinIn a year where thirdparty candidates like Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein have made waves its McMullin  a candidate who fell far short of even qualifying for the ballot in all 50 states  who stands the best chance of having a quantifiable impact on the raceThats because McMullin according to a raft of recent polling in the Utah is surging in the statePeople like to say that Utah is a Republican state or a deep red state I say its a principled conservative state McMullin said in an interview Friday in his Salt Lake City campaign headquartersMcMullins campaign is far from a powerhouse operation  its leanly staffed and leanly financed it had less than 5000 in the bank at the start of October according to federal filingsOur campaign is a threemonth presidential campaign which let me be clear to everyone is not ideal McMullin who launched his campaign in August says with a knowing laughYet driven largely by its digital operation and about 300000 in small dollar donations the Provo Utahborn McMullin and his running mate Mindy Finn have been bobbing back and forth ahead or within a couple of points of Trump in the stateTo put a potential McMullinFinn victory in perspective it has been 48 years since a thirdparty candidate secured any electoral votes Its been 52 years since Utah supported any nominee but the Republican PartysFor Trump Utahs emergence as a potential GOP hole couldnt come at a worse time Facing an exceedingly narrow path to victory as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her team continue to flip potential swing states into their column the loss of the west states six electoral votes is equal parts unthinkable and devastatingFor their part Trumps advisers dont appear publicly concerned about the state Theres been no rash deployment of resources either in terms of field staff or television advertising to try and cut down McMullins rise Indiana Gov Mike Pence Trumps running mate stopped in the state in September but otherwise bigname surrogates have been absentMcMullins team says it hasnt identified any broad effort to undercut his support or credentials short of the standard line that supporting anyone but Trump equals tacit support for a Clinton presidency In other words the Trump campaign is either confident that Utahns will revert to form or supremely unaware of what both McMullin and Clinton campaign advisers say is happening on the ground in the stateMcMullins team points to the release of Trumps lewd Access Hollywood tape as the moment where gradual momentum turned into tangible numbers The campaign saw digital engagement grow by 2000 in the wake of the videoWhat they tell us says Finn a veteran GOP campaign hand and outspoken Trump critic from the start of his campaign is youve been offering a glimmer of light in what has been a sea of darkness in this 2016 electionThat message of principled alternative to Trump appeared to take on new meaning in a state where Trump already wasnt exactly welcomed with open armsIn fact the root of Trumps problem in the state has been clear for much of the year Mormon voters seem to want no part of his candidacy In a state where Mormons make up more than 60 of the population thats a big problem  one exacerbated by top state officials many sharing the faith either outright rejecting Trumps candidacy or pulling their endorsementsThat list includes the states governor Gary Herbert who called Trumps hot mic video despicable former Gov Jon Huntsman who called on Trump to step aside junior Sen Mike Lee long critical of Trump and even more so in the wake of the video as well as one of the states highestprofile congressmen Jason Chaffetz who pulled his endorsement of the GOP nomineeOn top of all of that in an unprecedented action the editorial board of the Salt Lake City newspaper The Deseret News which is owned by the Church of LatterDay Saints called on Trump to step down from his pursuit of the American presidencyWhat oozes from this audio is evil the editors wroteFor his part McMullin downplays the role his faith plays in his riseIts sort of like saying President Obama became president because he had the support of AfricanAmericans McMullin says Every candidate has people who are like them in some way who may find it easier to understand who the candidate is and therefore maybe theres a heightened chance that theyll be supportive of that candidate But the reality is that its much more than thatTheres no question the tone of the race  and the major party candidates  appear to be driving people McMullins way more so than his faith A former CIA officer Goldman Sachs banker and US House staffer McMullin touts a strong resume and firmly conservative message as his major selling pointsAnd while a handful of Utah state political officials have endorsed McMullin the states biggest boldest names have not But just as Obama wouldnt have won the White House without the overwhelming support of black voters McMullin is the clear beneficiary of Mormon voters who cant come to grips with Trump has a candidateBemused is probably the best way to describe the Clinton campaigns view of the current state of play in Utah They put more effort in here than traditional Democratic campaigns  a campaign office was opened a field staffer was deployed and Clinton officials have repeatedly made themselves available to local media But they also acknowledge that there is a ceiling of sorts for a Democratic candidate statewide  particularly one who holds the skyhigh unfavorable ratings of Clinton But their fight to gain ground in the state has helped create the unlikely dynamic that now existsDriving through the neighborhoods in and around Salt Lake City with just over two weeks left until Election Day pockets of political signs protrude in block after block yard after yard Blue and orange and green big bold letters touting candidates for a variety of political officesThat is exactly the kind of opening McMullin and his team have seized on  and one that puts them in position to make a bit of history even if that means contributing to the loss of the GOP nomineeWere saying even in that case stand on principle stand for what you know is right stand for what kind of leadership you actually want to see in this country and lets build from there McMullin says
