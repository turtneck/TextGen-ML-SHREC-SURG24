Bill Clinton spent 13 minutes yesterday forcefully responding to Black Lives Matter activists who were heckling him Speaking in an overwhelmingly African American neighborhood of Philadelphia the city that will host this summers Democratic National Convention the former president offered a spirited defense of his record on civil rights his signature crime bill and his wifeOne of the protesters held a sign that declared Black youth are not super predators Thats a reference to when Hillary Clinton spoke in 1996 of the kinds of kids that are called superpredators and said we have to bring them to heelClinton pointed to the signs This is whats the matter he said I dont know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13yearolds hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African American children Maybe you thought they were good citizens She didnt  You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter Tell the truth You are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take gunsThe 69yearoldwent on an extended riff about why he and his wife are the ones who have really fought to make black lives matterBecause of that crimebill we had a 25year low in crime a 30year low in the murder rate and because of that and the backgroundcheck law a 46year low in deaths of lives by gun violence he said And who do you think those lives were that mattered Whose lives were saved that matteredBill noted that Hillary unlike Bernie Sanders did not vote for the crime bill She was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids he said Who were they And their lives matterHe also highlighted the Democratic frontrunnerswork for the Childrens Defense Fund as a young attorney in Alabama and her work to stop the spread of HIV in Africa as secretary of state Ill tell you another story about a place where black lives matter Africa he said In a year when the drama has mostly been on the Republican side it made for great political theater And it gave Bill Clinton another unforgettable Sister Souljah Moment In May 1992 the hiphop artist suggested that killing white cops might not be so bad in the wake of the Los Angeles riots Speaking at a convention organized by Jesse Jacksons Rainbow Coalition the thengovernor of Arkansas ripped into her If you took the words white and black and reversed them you might think David Duke was giving that speech he said We have an obligation all of us to call attention to prejudice whenever we see it CSPANs archive has the videoCalling her out became legendary and helped Clinton pivot from the Democratic nominating contest he was wrapping up when he needed base voters to the general election when he needed independentsTwentyfour years later we are at a very similar phase in the campaign cycle Yesterdays showdown in Philadelphia quickly became a Rorschach Test Republicans and liberal activists inclined to dislike WJC called it evidence of him being out of touch and over the hill while Clinton loyalists said it was the Big Dog at his best The majority of the crowd of 400 cheered Clinton as he made the protesters his foils Mostmainstream media outlets arecoveringthe comments as another offmessage embarrassment for his wifes campaignbutlets dispenseonce and for all with thefiction that Bill Clinton does not know what hes doing He knows exactly what hes doing A year ago most DC pundits would have bet that the 2016 general election would pit Hillary versus Jeb and that Democrats could win by making the campaign about whether voters wanted to give Bill or W a third term The Bushes are now long gone Indeed both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz criticize the former president to varying degrees Because the Democratic primaries turned out to be more competitive than anticipated its been hard for the Clintons to lean on nostalgia for the 1990s Instead the former president and first lady have been pressed constantly from the left on everything from NAFTA to DOMA Bills comments about the Black Lives Matter movement suggest that a major pivot in the campaigns messaging is on the waySmarting from the 2008 defections of African Americans to Barack Obama and recognizing that securing the Democratic nomination this time would depend on running up the score among minority voters the Clintons set out in the spring of 2015 to inoculate themselves from criticism over the crime billWe overshot the mark Bill wrote in the foreword to a book on mass incarceration that came out exactly one year ago The same month Hillary gave a speech at Columbia University  in the wake of the Baltimore riots  to promise that criminal justice reform to end sentencing disparities  which were made worse by her husbands bill  would be a top priority as presidentLast July the former president told the NAACP convention that he deeply regretted sending minor criminals to prison for way too long I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it he saidYesterday the former president instead blamed congressional Republicans for the parts of the law that have increased mass incarceration He said thenSen Joe Biden told him it could not pass if the toughoncrime provisions were not added inAfter Hillary was confronted this February by a protester about the super predator comment she expressed regret Looking back I shouldnt have used those words and I wouldnt use them today she said in a statement Now as the general election looms polls show that his wife is badly underperforming with white voters in key battleground statescompared to 2008 But Bills strategy is not without risk Hillary needs high African American turnout to beat Bernie in New York on April 19 and in the Pennsylvania and Maryland primaries on April 26 She also needs to keep the Obama coalition activated through NovemberWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING Bernie Sanders is going to speak at the Vatican next week John Wagner scoopsHell leave forRome

expanded role to veteran strategist Paul J ManafortFromKarenTumulty and Dan BalzManafort who joined the Trump operation on March 29 as its convention manager will now have broader responsibilities and will oversee manage and be responsible for all activities that pertain to Mr Trumps delegate process and the Cleveland convention the campaign said in its announcementManafort working from a new DC campaign office will also be in charge of outreach efforts to members of Congress the Republican National Committee and think tanksWhile the campaign insisted there had been no reduction in the role of embattled campaign manager Corey Lewandowski it was nonetheless seen that way in Republican circles Manaforts new portfolio is the operation that could be most crucial to Trumps success in the coming monthsSaid one GOP strategist who has worked with Manafort and who declined to be identified I can assure you that Lewandowski should be looking for new employment at this point Hes half wiped out alreadyTrump is not a dumb man Chris Cillizza writes He didnt get to where he is  by not grasping when things are slipping away from him  The writing appears to be on the wall Manafort will run things going forward Smart frame  The strategist vs the showman Cruz and Trump run very different campaigns by Katie Zezima Cruz is the disciplined strategist who stays relentlessly on message and runs a bythebook organization filled with aides and state chairs  Trump by contrast runs what amounts to a DIY presidential campaign  While the approach has left Trump with little established infrastructure as the race turns into a brawl for delegates it has also allowed him to be nimble  Cruzs advance work will be on display this weekend in Colorado one of five states that leave it up to party members to elect the states 37 delegates to the national convention Organizers said much of the work has been done with little input from Cruz headquarters in Houston There are 50 different states with 50 different speeds said Ken Buck the senators Colorado state chairman Trump and Cruz face their first test in the Virginia delegate fighttomorrow A few hundred Republicans are set to gather in Wytheville a town of 8000 in the states southwest corner to elect three delegates to the Republican convention the AP reports At first glance the 9th Congressional Districts local convention appears to be fertile ground for Trump  But the Cruz campaign is counting on a superior advantage with party insiders both in Virginia and around the country to get its preferred delegates elected Political watchers say these types of party insiders who take the time to register for and attend regional party meetings are more likely to back Cruz The issue is who is going to these convention said Terry Kilgore a Republican state House delegate  The Cruz people understand the game a little bit better Trump leads Cruz by 7 points in California according to the Field Poll The frontrunner has 39 percent with Cruz at 32 percent and Kasich at 18 percent Trump leads in the Bay Area and in the Southern California region outside of Los Angeles Cruz is preferred over Trump in LA properand among voters in theCentral Valley and Sierra mountainswhereas supporters for Kasich are somewhat evenly dispersed across the stateThe primary in June will award delegates by congressional districts Former

Cleveland by Politicos Kyle Cheney Every aspect of the Republican National Convention is a potential tripwire that motivated antiTrump forces could deploy to waylay the mogul Five tactics Cruz could use to try denying Trump the nomination Ben Carson proved again to be a terrible Trump surrogate When asked on CNNif Lewandowski should be running the show after being charged with battery he respondedthat alot of people have been charged with various things  Youve probably been charged with things The interviewer replied that he has not Jeff Sessions Trumps only supporter in the Senate

doing lasting damage to the party and the eventual nomineeWith both candidates launching 10day sprints ahead of New Yorks April 19 primary the strain and resentment of a hardfought and unexpectedly long contest boiled over repeatedly in interviews speeches and other public appearancesJohn Wagner Abby Phillip and AnneGearanreport The senator from Vermont refused to retract his assertion that Clinton is not qualified to be president Clinton dismissed that claim as silly and countered that Sanders has repeatedly made promises he cant keep Sanders continued to blame Clinton for going on the attack and said he has simply been defending himself And while he expressed regret for the tenor of the campaign over the previous 24 hours and said the acrimony will make it harder for Democrats to unite in the fall he also said he does not regret his own statementsClinton had raised questions in a television interview about whether Sanders was prepared to be president but she repeatedly stopped short of saying he was unqualifiedPresident Obama who has sought to stay out his partys nominating contest weighed in Thursday though a spokesman Traveling with Obama on Air Force One White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama believes that Clinton comes to the race with more experience than any nonvice president in recent campaign history Schultz emphasized that Obama feels fortunate that Clinton whom he defeated in a sometimes nasty battle for the 2008 nomination served as his secretary of stateIn an interview with The Posts John Wagner Sanders stood by his view that Clinton is not qualified  but he also pledged to support her if she is the nominee Three highlights Congressional Democrats expressed hope thatthe dustup over whether Hillary is qualifiedserves as a warningfor both candidates to tone things down and keep the party more cohesive than the RepublicansIts really important that everybody take a pause that everybody calm down said North Dakota Sen Heidi Heitkamp At this point in campaigns people get tired say things they dont mean to emotions get raw I think a lot of this will dissipate with a couple good nights sleep Why is Berniethrowing the kitchen sink rightnow Because he must fundamentally disruptthe race to have any chance of ultimatelyprevailing Sanders still trails Clinton by more than 200 pledged delegatesThe math is close to determinative and not in his favor Barring a major cataclysm in the race Clinton will be the nominee writes Chris CillizzaThis chart compares Clintons lead over Sanders to Obamas lead over her at this point in 2008 Panama financial scandal blows up into Democratic skirmishing over trade by David Nakamura President Obama took pains to describe Merrick Garland as a unifying figure during a speech at The University of Chicago Law School Juliet Eilperin and Mike DeBonis In a carefullyorchestrated question and answer session with students and faculty  including several of Garlands family members the president said

legislativemaneuversto pusha vote on Garland Democrats have thus far refrained from holding up legislation or other Senate business to gain leverage on the court fightAn ultimate step would be to force a floor vote on Garland without committee action  a move that would almost certainly fail but would attract attention and put those vulnerable Republican incumbents on the spot A Democratic leadership aide said that is being considered as a last resort one that would not be deployed for months Lindsey Graham said he will meet with Garland reversing course on his earlier pledge not

the parents by Jenna Portnoy Sen Richard H Black doesnt think of himself as squeamish But the Northern Virginia Republican said he was so stunned by the moral sewage in  Toni Morrisons Beloved that he did something he professes to never have done in office He abandoned all diplomacy and told a constituent exactly what he thought Black called the book profoundly filthy and smut The screed is part of an extraordinary email exchange between Black and Loudoun County teacher Jessica Berg who wrote to Black to protest his vote for a bill that would have required teachers to give parents advance notice if they planned to assign material with sexually explicit content in class allowing parents to opt out their children from reading the offending books Its ridiculous that you are trying to control education when you have no idea what it entails she wrote You do not want free thinkers I want teachers who wont teach such vile things he responded You do not know better than the parents Read the

1 Million From Saudi Arabia by Bill Allison A nonprofit with ties to Senator John McCain received a 1 million donation from the government of Saudi Arabia in 2014 according to documents filed with the IRS McCain has strictly honorary roles with the McCain Institute for International Leadership a program at Arizona State University and its fundraising arm the McCain Institute Foundation according to his office But McCain has appeared at fundraising events for the institute and his Senate campaigns fundraiser is listed in its tax returns as the contact person for the foundation Though federal law strictly bans foreign contributions to electoral campaigns the restriction doesnt apply to nonprofits engaged in policy even those connected to a sitting lawmaker  The Saudi donation to the McCain Institute Foundation may be the first congressional instance of that trend coming to light The extent of this practice is difficult to gauge of course Holman said because we only know about it when a nonprofit or foreign government voluntarily reveals that information We missed this story when it came out last week but its caused a stir in Arizona where McCain is up for reelectionOn the campaign
