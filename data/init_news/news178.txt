his big heart about our partys commitment to working people as only he can doAnd first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching and the president we elect is going to be their president tooAnd for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine  you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senatorAnd he will make the whole country proud as our vice presidentAnd  I want to thank Bernie SandersBernie Bernie your campaign inspired millions of Americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primaryYouve put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belongAnd to all of your supporters here and around the country I want you to know Ive heard you Your cause is our causeOur country needs your ideas energy and passionThat is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for AmericaWe wrote it together  now lets go out and make it happen togetherMy friends weve come to Philadelphia  the birthplace of our nation  because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us todayWe all know the story But we usually focus on how it turned out  and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at allWhen representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wanted to stick with the king And some wanted to stick it to the kingThe revolution hung in the balanceThen somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purposeAnd by the time they left Philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nationThats what made it possible to stand up to a kingThat took courage They had courageOur Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger togetherNow now America is once again at a moment of reckoning Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart Bonds of trust and respect are frayingAnd just as with our founders there are no guarantees It truly is up to us We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise togetherOur countrys motto is e pluribus unum out of many we are one Will we stay true to that mottoWell we heard Donald Trumps answer last week at his convention He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each otherHes betting that the perils of todays world will blind us to its unlimited promise Hes taken the Republican Party a long way from Morning in America to Midnight in America He wants us to fear the future and fear each otherWell you know a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time The only thing we have to fear is fear itselfNow we are cleareyed about what our country is up against But we are not afraid We will rise to the challenge just as we always have We will not build a wall Instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get oneAnd well build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economyWe we will not ban a religion We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorismTheres a lot of work to doToo many people havent had a pay raise since the crashTheres too much inequality Too little social mobility Too much paralysis in Washington Too many threats at home and abroadBut just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world We have the most tolerant and generous young people weve ever had We have the most powerful military The most innovative entrepreneurs The most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunityWe should be so proud that those words are associated with us I have to tell you as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries When people hear those words they hear AmericaSo dont let anyone tell you that our country is weak Were notDont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes We doAnd most of all dont believe anyone who says I alone can fix itYes those were actually Donald Trumps words in Cleveland And they should set off alarm bells for all of usReally I alone can fix it Isnt he forgettingTroops on the front lines Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger Doctors and nurses who care for us Teachers who change lives Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safeHes forgetting every last one of usAmericans dont say I alone can fix it We say Well fix it togetherAnd remember remember Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power Twohundredandforty years later we still put our faith in each otherLook at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join themAnd you know how the community responded Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 daysThats how Americans answer when the call for help goes outTwenty years ago I wrote a book called It Takes a Village And a lot of people looked at the title and asked What the heck do you mean by thatThis is what I mean None of us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally aloneAmerica needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to making our nation better and stronger I believe that with all my heartThats why Stronger Together is not just a lesson from our history Its not just a slogan for our campaignIts a guiding principle for the country weve always been and the future were going to buildA country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what zip code you live inA country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach Where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love trumps hateThats the country were fighting for Thats the future were working toward And so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in Americas promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United StatesNow sometimes sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stageAs you know Im not one of those peopleIve been your First Lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of New YorkThen I represented all of you as secretary of stateBut my job titles only tell you what Ive doneThey dont tell you whyThe truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public partI get it that some people just dont know what to make of me So let me tell youThe family Im from well no one had their name on big buildings My family were builders of a different kind Builders in the way most American families areThey used whatever tools they had  whatever God gave them  and whatever life in America provided  and built better lives and better futures for their kidsMy grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years Because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did And he was rightMy dad Hugh made it to college He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl HarborWhen the war was over he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screensHe wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had And he didMy mother Dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl Sheended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid She was saved by the kindness of othersHer firstgrade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year The lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me No one gets through life alone We have to look out for each other and lift each other upAnd she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you canSo I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund going doortodoor in New Bedford Mass on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to schoolI remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house She told me how badly she wanted to go to school  it just didnt seem possible in those days And I couldnt stop thinking of my mother and what shed gone through as a childIt became clear to me that simply caring is not enough To drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws You need both understanding and actionSo we gathered facts We built a coalition And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilitiesIts a big idea isnt it Every kid with a disability has the right to go to schoolBut how how do you make an idea like that real You do it stepbystep yearbyyear sometimes even doorbydoorMy heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage  because we changed our law to make sure she got an educationSo its true I sweat the details of policy  whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint Mich the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugsBecause its not just a detail if its your kid  if its your family Its a big deal And it should be a big deal to your president tooAfter the four days of this convention youve seen some of the people whove inspired me People who let me into their lives and became a part of minePeople like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning They told their stories Tuesday nightI first met Ryan as a 7yearold He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him upChildren like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our countryLauren Manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on 911 It was the thought of her and Debbie St John who you saw in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 911 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground ZeroI was thinking of Lauren Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justiceAnd in this campaign Ive met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change And with your help I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White HouseAnd you heard you heard from from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign Well I will be a president for Democrats Republicans and independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who dont For all Americans togetherTonight tonight weve reached a milestone in our nations march toward a more perfect union the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for presidentStanding here standing here as my mothers daughter and my daughters mother Im so happy this day has comeIm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in betweenIm happy for boys and men too  because when any barrier falls in America it clears the way for everyone After all when there are no ceilings the skys the limitSo lets keep going lets keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to haveBut even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years aheadLets begin with what were going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay aheadNow I dont think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimesOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office Nearly 15 million new privatesector jobs Twenty million more Americans with health insurance And an auto industry that just had its best year everNow thats real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo Not by a long shotWere still facing deepseated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recoveryIve gone around our country talking to working families And Ive heard from many who feel like the economy sure isnt working for themSome of you are frustrated  even furious And you know what Youre right Its not yet working the way it shouldAmericans are willing to work  and work hard But right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do And less respect for them periodDemocrats we are the party of working people But we havent done a good enough job showing we get what youre going through and were going to do something to helpSo tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better livesMy primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States From my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behindFrom our inner cities to our small towns from Indian Country to Coal Country From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closuresAnd heres what I believe I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives I believe that our economy isnt working the way it should because our democracy isnt working the way it shouldThats why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict themAnd if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens UnitedI believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return Many of them are But too many arent Its wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the otherAnd I believe Wall Street can never ever be allowed to wreck Main Street againAnd I believe in science I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of goodpaying clean energy jobsI believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy it would be selfdefeating and inhumane to try to kick them outComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together  and its the right thing to doSo whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaignIf you believe that companies should share profits with their workers not pad executive bonuses join usIf you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty join usIf you believe that every man woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care join usIf you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to China that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers then join usIf you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a womans right to make her own health care decisions then join usAnd yes yes if you believe that your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay join usThats how were going to sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the topNow you didnt hear any of this did you from Donald Trump at his convention He spoke for 70odd minutes  and I do mean oddAnd he offered zero solutionsBut we already know he doesnt believe these things No wonder he doesnt like talking about his plans You might have noticed I love talking about mineIn my first hundred days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since World War II Jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructureIf we invest in infrastructure now well not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the futureAnd we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobsBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuitionfree for the middle class and debtfree for allWe will also we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debtIts just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts and students and families cant refinance their debtsAnd something we dont say often enough Sure college is crucial but a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good jobWe will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing itWe will give small businesses like my dads a boost Make it easier to get credit Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banksIn America if you can dream it you should be able to build itAnd we will help you balance family and work And you know what if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me inNow heres the other thing were not only going to make all these investments were going to pay for every single one of themAnd heres how Wall Street corporations and the superrich are going to start paying their fair share of taxesThis is not because we resent success because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent thats where the money is and we are going to follow the moneyAnd if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas well make them pay us back And well put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at homeNow now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking well that all sounds pretty good But how are you going to get it done How are you going to break through the gridlock in WashingtonWell look at my record Ive worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people And if you give me the chance thats what Ill do as presidentBut then I also imagine people are thinking out there but Trump hes a businessman He must know something about the economyWell lets take a closer lookIn Atlantic City 60 miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his billsNow remember what the president said last night Dont boo vote People who did the work and needed the money and didnt get it  not because he couldnt pay them but because he wouldnt pay them He just stiffed themAnd you know that sales pitch hes making to be president Put your faith in him  and youll win big Thats the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bagHe also talks a big game about putting America first Well please explain what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China not Colorado Trump suits in Mexico not Michigan Trump furniture in Turkey not Ohio Trump picture frames in India not WisconsinDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again  well he could start by actually making things in America againNow the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national securityYou know anyone anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we faceFrom Baghdad to Kabul to Nice and Paris and Brussels from San Bernardino to Orlando were dealing with determined enemies that must be defeatedSo its no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance Looking for steady leadership wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priorityIm proud that we put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot  now we have to enforce it And we must keep supporting Israels securityIm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement  now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments including ourselvesAnd Im proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face including from RussiaIve laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happenWe will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our countryIt wont be easy or quick but make no mistake  we will prevailNow Donald Trump Donald Trump says and this is a quote I know more about ISIS than the generals do No Donald you dontHe thinks he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disasterWell Ive had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee and I know how wrong he is Our military is a national treasureWe entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces decisions about war and peace life and deathA president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country  including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence both MarinesSo just ask yourself Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chiefDonald Trump cant even handle the roughandtumble of a presidential campaign He loses his cool at the slightest provocation When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter When hes challenged in a debate When he sees a protester at a rallyImagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weaponsI cant put it I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with selfcontrol and restraint but by little men  the ones moved by fear and prideAmericas strength doesnt come from lashing out It relies on smarts judgment cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power And thats the kind of commander in chief I pledge to beAnd if were serious about keeping our country safe we also cant afford to have a president whos in the pocket of the gun lobbyIm not here to repeal the Second Amendment Im not here to take away your guns I just dont want you to be shot by someone who shouldnt have a gun in the first placeWe will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass commonsense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals terrorists and all others who would do us harmYou know for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch But I ask you How can we just stand by and do nothingYou heard you saw family members of people killed by gun violence on this stageYou heard you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminalsI refuse to believe we cant find common ground hereWe have to heal the divides in our country Not just on guns But on race Immigration And moreAnd that starts with listening listening to each other Trying as best we can to walk in each others shoesSo lets put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposableLets put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day heading off to do a dangerous and necessary jobWe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serveAnd we will defend we will defend all our rights  civil rights human rights and voting rights womens rights and workers rights LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilitiesAnd we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes fromYou know for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trumps comments  excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a showThey thought he couldnt possibly mean all the horrible things he says  like when he called women pigs Or said that an American judge couldnt be fair because of his Mexican heritageOr when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain  a true hero and patriot who deserves our respectNow at first at first I admit I couldnt believe he meant it either It was just too hard to fathom  that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things Could be like thatBut heres the sad truth There is no other Donald Trump This is itAnd in the end it comes down to what Donald Trump doesnt get that America is great  because America is goodSo enough with the bigotry and bombast Donald Trumps not offering real changeHes offering empty promises And what are we offering A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country  to keep you safe to get you good jobs and to give your kids the opportunities they deserveThe choice is clear my friendsEvery generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer fairer and strongerNone of us ever have or can do it aloneI know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart it can be hard to imagine how well ever pull togetherBut Im here to tell you tonight  progress is possibleI know I know because Ive seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back upAnd I know it I know it from my own life More than a few times Ive had to pick myself up and get back in the gameLike so much else in my life I got this from my mother too She never let me back down from any challenge When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully she literally blocked the door Go back out there she saidAnd she was right You have to stand up to bulliesYou have to keep working to make things better even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierceWe lost our mother a few years ago but I miss her every day And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working keep fighting for right no matter whatThats what we need to do together as a nationThough we may not live to see the glory as the song from the musical Hamilton goes let us gladly join the fightLet our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to seeThats why were here  not just in this hall but on this EarthThe Founders showed us that And so have many others sinceThey were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who followThat is the story of America And we begin a new chapter tonightYes the world is watching what we doYes Americas destiny is ours to chooseSo lets be stronger together my fellow AmericansLets look to the future with courage and confidenceLets build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved countryAnd when we do America will be greater than everThank you and may God bless you and the United States of America
