NEW YORK  Bernie Sanders is at a crossroadsThe Vermont senator took Wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife leaving his top aides behind in Washington to cool their heelsHe wanted an opportunity to think said Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine Its affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign what he wants to say in the weeks ahead He hasnt had a real chance to do that in weeksThe Sanders campaign poured itself into New York throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could They spent 56 million twice what Hillary Clinton did made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big ralliesBut in the end Sanders came up short  not just of winning but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit which might set them up for a path through California the campaigns final hopeNow with the nomination even further out of reach Sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next Does he set a dowhateverittakes course to actually win the Democratic nomination Or does he return to the message campaign his longshot White House bid was originally seen asTheres no question that Sanders will stay in the race either way Bernie made a decision after Nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote vote Devine saidDemocratic primary voters have shown no sign theyre in a rush for the race to settle down and seem hungry for Sanders message if not his presidencyHell continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish On Wednesday night the campaign announced raising 15 million more than Clinton in March though they also spent much moreBut even some Sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidates message in New York where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on Clinton and issues with the election processGoing forward what were encouraging Senator Sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues said Neil Sroka the communications director of Democracy for America which backs SandersThe campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues  but only as long as the Clinton campaign joins them So far at least they believe Clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign Clinton still views Sanders as a threatPrivately some Sanders allies say its time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the Democratic National Convention and afterwards and less about beating Clinton at all costsOne indicator of which kind of campaign Sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nominationThe strategy which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if Sanders loses more primaries and caucuses was floated by campaign manager Jeff Weaver with MSNBCs Steve Kornacki late Tuesday nightMoveOnorg and Democracy for America both of which have endorsed Sanders have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votesMore than 380000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes and not who has the most support from party insidersBoth groups confirmed to MSNBC Wednesday that they still hold that positionMoveOn members overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders for president and we want him to win the most pledged delegates become the nominee and become president But superdelegates shouldnt overrule the will of the Democratic grassroots said MoveOn Washington Director Ben Wikler If the primary and caucus winner is Hillary Clinton then Clinton should be the nomineeDevine said the campaigns main focus is still to win pledged delegates But if Sanders falls just short of a majority its negligible  de minims Devine said  and the campaign will pitch super delegates that Sanders is the stronger general election candidateAnother indication of Sanders intentions will be where he devotes his precious time in the days leading up to Tuesdays contestsFive states are voting and Maryland is expected to be Sanders worst showingIf he invests heavily there its a sign his campaign is still focused on winning and scraping together delegates If he spends time in states like Connecticut and Delaware to try to eek out wins despite limited delegate opportunities its a sign hes more focused on moral victories than ones that lead to the nominationWhat Sanders decides to do and how aggressively he decides to continuing pursuing Clinton will help determine the shape of the rest of the primary and how quickly Clinton the oddson nominee can unite the partyClintons favorability rating has tumbled during the primary especially among Sanders voters presumably at least in part due to his attacksBut as Democratic leaders worry about the damage the party seem to be enjoying the contestNational polling between Clinton and Sanders has tightened to a virtual dead heat suggesting voters are not ready to settle on Clinton Exit polls showed twothirds of New York primary voters found the heated contest in the state to be energizing not divisiveMr Sanderss presence has made this an immeasurably more substantive race The New York Times wrote in an editorial Wednesday calling on Sanders to ignore calls to leave the race which was shared by the Sanders campaign The enthusiasm of his supporters should be a wakeup call to leaders of both parties They are missing something big about their own members priorities and their moodStill Sanders entire campaign has been about bringing new people into politics and the Democratic party At some point he might risk pushing them back out again
