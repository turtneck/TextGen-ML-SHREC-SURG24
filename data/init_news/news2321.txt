Senator Johnny Isakson fought President Obamas reckless deal with the Iranian regime Now Iran is already violating the agreement  illegally testing ballistic missiles threatening Israel and supporting terrorism in the Middle EastThis ad begins with Isakson who is running for his third Senate term saying I voted against the nuclear deal with Iran for a ton of reasons Then a narrator claims that Iran is already violating the agreement which the senatoropposed by illegally testing ballistic missiles We spotted this ad on the website of our partners Political TV Ad Archive Is that really the case We did some diggingThe formal name for the deal reached in July between Iran and world powers including the United States is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of ActionJCPOA commonlycalled the Iran dealIsakson member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations opposed the dealBut Senate Republicans failed to advance legislation that would have allowed them to reject the agreementThe agreement was aimed at curbing Irans nuclear program in exchange for relief from internationalsanctionsAfter the deal was reached the United Nations Security Council  which had imposed sanctions on Iran to pressure it to negotiate  adopted Resolution 2231 The resolutionendorsed the deal and outlined conditions under which sanctions are to be lifted Under the resolution ballistic missile restrictions expire after eight yearsThis is an important point inthe context of Isaksons ad The Iran deal is not the same as UN Security Council Resolution 2231The nuclear agreement was officially implemented thisJanuary after the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA certified that Iran had complied with all the nuclearrelated measures it agreed to in July Yet Iran has continued to testballistic missiles and said it willnot stopThe deal does not prohibit the testing or development of ballistic missiles But the UN resolution does contain restrictions relating to ballistic missiles So how is Iran able to continue its testing Experts say the resolutions language allows Iran to argue that its ballistic missiles do not fit within the restrictions laid out in Resolution 2231PreviousUN resolutions had statedthat the councildecides that Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons The new resolution statesIran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons including launches using such ballistic missile technologyThe language change from decides that Iran shall not to Iran is called upon representsa softening in tone signaling amore nonlegallybinding appealThis changewas made precisely because the Iran dealdoes not contain any limits on the countrysmissile programssaid Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the MiddleburyInstitute of International Studies in MontereyIt is perfectly respectable for opponents of the agreement to object to the Iran deal on these grounds  the JCPOA removes missilerelated sanctions without requiring Iran to limit its missile programs Lewis said This was the hardest part of the agreement for me to accept even if that sanctions relief only occurs after eight yearsFurther the new resolution refers to missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons rather than capable of such delivery So Iran nowargues that its missiles are not designed for such capabilityIf one finds that the missiles used are designed for nuclear weapon delivery it appears to me that there will evidently be also a problem with the compliance with the JCPOA which bans weaponization activities said Olli Heinonen who ledthe IAEAs safeguards section during the 20032005 talks between Iran and three European powers Britain France and GermanyThat argument is possible but will be difficult to prove experts say A legal determination hasnt been made one way or the other meaning that the testing is not yet a violation of the Iran dealThe Isakson ad claims that Iran is already violating the agreement through these missile tests The citation in the ad is an oped in US News and World Report that Irans missile tests highlight weaknesses in the nucleardealThe senatorsstaff pointed to news articles describing the tests as a violation of the UN resolutionThey noted that President Obama had accused Iranofgoing against the spirit of the nuclear agreement as he did at an April news conferenceBut the ad itself does not say that Irans actions violate the spirit of the deal or that it violates the UN resolution It says Iran is violating the agreement that Isakson opposed That agreement would be the Iran deal not the UN resolutionTheres frustration over the testing and we have to look for effective policy tools to impede Irans missile program But none of those tools unfortunately is the ability to say this is a violation of the Iran nuclear deal said Robert Einhorn senior fellow at Brookings Institution and former special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation at the State DepartmentEinhorn added that its difficult to use the Security Council resolution as a policy tool because Russiaand China are reluctant to viewmissile testsas a violation of or inconsistent with the resolutionIsaksons ad is about the Iran deal and his opposition to it It claims that Iran is already violating the nuclear agreement by illegally testing ballistic missiles Yet the actual deal did not have restrictions on ballistic missiles testing Instead the UN resolution that implements the deal contains the language A range of experts we consulted said that the testing could be argued as violating the Iran deal but that it will be difficult Its an important technical distinction that is not reflected in the ad ultimately misleading viewers Moreover its a matter of interpretation as to whether the testing is illegal under the resolutionWe understandthat its probably not as catchy for a narrator in a campaign ad to say Western leaders view Irans missile tests as a violation of the UN resolution passed in tandem or that the testing is inconsistent with the spirit of the Iran deal But both of those phrases are accurate and are certainly preferable tothe sweeping inaccurate claim in the adSend us facts to check by filling out this
