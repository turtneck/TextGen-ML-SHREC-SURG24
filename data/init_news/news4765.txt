Less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses there is growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Donald Trump and Ben Carson and widespread bewilderment over how to defeat themParty leaders and donors fear that nominating either man would have negative ramifications for the GOP ticket up and down the ballot virtually ensuring a Hillary Rodham Clinton presidency and increasing the odds that the Senate falls into Democratic handsThe party establishment is paralyzed Big money is still on the sidelines No consensus alternative to the outsiders has emerged from the pack of governors and senators running and there is disagreement about how to prosecute the case against them Recent focus groups of Trump supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire commissioned by rival campaigns revealed no silver bulletTrumps wild 95minute rant How stupid are the people of IowaIn normal times the way forward would be obvious The wannabes would launch concerted campaigns including television attack ads against the frontrunners But even if the other candidates had a sense of what might work this year it is unclear whether it would ultimately accrue to their benefit Trumps counterpunches have been withering while Carsons appeal to the base is spiritual not merely political If someone was able to do significant damage to them theres no telling to whom their supporters would turn if anyoneThe rest of the field is still wishing upon a star that Trump and Carson are going to selfdestruct said Eric Fehrnstrom a former adviser to 2012 nominee Mitt Romney But he said they have to be made to selfdestruct  Nothing has happened at this point to dislodge Trump or CarsonFehrnstrom pointed out that the fourth debate passed this week without any candidate landing a blow against Trump or Carson Were about to step into the holiday time accelerator he said You have Thanksgiving Christmas New Years then Iowa and a week later New Hampshire and its going to be over in the blink of an eyeThe Take Why no one is dropping out of the GOP presidential raceAccording to other Republicans some in the party establishment are so desperate to change the dynamic that they are talking anew about drafting Romney  despite his insistence that he will not run again Friends have mapped out a strategy for a late entry to pick up delegates and vie for the nomination in a convention fight according to the Republicans who were briefed on the talks though Romney has shown no indication of reviving his interestFor months the GOP professional class assumed Trump and Carson would fizzle with time Voters would get serious the thinking went after seeing the outsiders share a stage with more experienced politicians at the first debate Or when summer turned to fall kids went back to school and parents had time to assess the candidates Or after the second third or fourth debates certainlyNone of that happened of course leaving establishment figures disoriented Consider Thomas H Kean Sr a former New Jersey governor who for most of his 80years has been a pillar of his party His phone is ringing daily bringing a stream of exasperation and confusion from fellow GOP power brokersPeople usually start off in the same way Pollyannaish Kean said They assure me that Trump and Carson will eventually fade Then well talk some more and I give them a reality check Ill say The guy in the grocery store likes Trump So does the guy who cuts my hair Theyre probably going to stick with him Who knows if this endsSouth Carolina Gov Nikki Haley herself an outsider who rode the tea party wave into office five years ago explained the phenomenonYou have a lot of people who were told that if we got a majority in the House and a majority in the Senate then life was gonna be great she said in an interview Thursday What youre seeing is that people are angry Wheres the change Why arent there bills on the presidents desk every day for him to veto Theyre saying Look what you said would happen didnt happen so were going to go with anyone who hasnt been electedBefore Tuesdays debate in Milwaukee Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker had a reception at the Pfister Hotel with party leaders donors and operatives There was little appetite for putting a political knife in the back of either Trump or Carson according to one person there Rather attendees simply hoped both outsiders would go awayThere are similar concerns about Sen Ted Cruz of Texas who is gaining steam and is loathed by party elites but they are more muted at least for nowCharlie Black who has advised presidential campaigns since the 1970s said he believes the 2016 contest will eventually fall into the normal pattern of one outsider and one insider and historically the insider always winsBlack said he was briefed on the findings of two recent private focus groups of Trump supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire that showed these voters knew little about his policy views beyond immigration Things like universal health care and other more liberal positions hes taken in the past will all get out before people vote in New Hampshire he said Black said the focus groups were commissioned by two rival campaigns but he was not authorized to identify themOne wellfunded outside group the Club for Growth has aired ads attacking Trump in Iowa and more recently came out against Carson as well Donald Trump and Doctor Ben Carson are in over their heads said Club for Growth President David McIntosh labeling both candidates as pretendersStill the party establishments greatest weapon  big money  is partly on the shelf Kenneth G Langone a founder of Home Depot and a billionaire supporter of New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said he is troubled that many associates in the New York financial community have so far refused to invest in a campaign due to the races volatilitySome of them are in but too many are still saying Ill wait to see how this all breaks Langone said People dont want to write checks unless they think the candidate has a chance of winning He said that his job as a megadonor is to figure out how we get people on the edge of their chairs so they start to give moneyMany of Romneys 2012 National Finance Committee members have sat out the race so far including Peter A Wish a Florida doctor whom several 2016 candidates have courtedIm not a happy camper Wish said Hopefully somebody will emerge who will be able to do the job but he added Im very worried that the Republicanbase voter is more motivated by anger distrust of DC and politicians and will throw away the opportunity to nominate a candidate with proven experience that can winThe apprehension among some party elites goes beyond electability according to one Republican strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the worriesWere potentially careening down this road of nominating somebody who frankly isnt fit to be president in terms of the basic ability and temperament to do the job this strategist said Its not just that it could be somebody Hillary could destroy electorally but what if Hillary hits a banana peel and this person becomes presidentAngst about Trump intensified this week after he made two comments that could prove damaging in a general election First he explained his opposition to raising the minimum wage by saying wages are too high Second he said he would create a federal deportation force to remove the more than 11million immigrants living in the United States illegallyTo have a leading candidate propose a new federal police force that is going to flush out illegal immigrants across the nation Thats very disturbing and concerning to me about where that leads Republicans said Dick Wadhams a former GOP chairman in Colorado a swing state where Republicans are trying to pick up a Senate seat next yearSaid Austin Barbour a veteran operative and fundraiser now advising former Florida governor Jeb Bush If we dont have the right nominee we could lose the Senate and we could face losses in the House Those are very very real concerns If were not careful and we nominate Trump were looking at a race like Barry Goldwater in 1964 or George McGovern in 1972 getting beat up across the board because of our nomineeGeorge Voinovich a retired career politician who rose from county auditor to mayor of Cleveland to governor of Ohio to US senator said this cycle has been vexingThis business has turned into show business said Voinovich who is backing Ohio Gov John Kasich We cant afford to have somebody sitting in the White House who doesnt have governing experience and the gravitas to move this country aheadDavid Weigel in Hilton Head Island SC
