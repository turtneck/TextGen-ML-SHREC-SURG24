Theres a creeping anxiety in the halls of some American progressive groups  especially those aligned with labor unions and economic populism  that Donald Trump might be almost too weak a nominee from their point of view The worry is that hes so vulnerable that hell tempt Hillary Clinton to run a campaign that is as anodyne as possible on policy focused almost exclusively on Trumps personality and lack of qualifications aiming for a landslide win that would carry no mandateDavid Frum writing in the Atlantic from the point of view of a centerright Republican dissidentoffers the opposite worry He says Clinton faces a danger that neither Johnson nor Nixon had to face in 1964 or 1972  the danger of a divided party that will tempt her to hew to the left to keep Bernie Sanderss supporters on boardHe cites LBJs 1964 convention speech as an example of the kind of rhetoric Clinton should  but probably cant  offerTonight we offer ourselveson our record and by our platformas a party for all Americans an allAmerican party for all Americans This prosperous people this land of reasonable men has no place for petty partisanship or peevish prejudice The needs of all can never be met by parties of the few The needs of all cannot be met by a business party or a labor party not by a war party or a peace party not by a southern party or a northern party Our deeds will meet our needs only if we are served by a party which serves all our peopleThe reality is that the 1964 election ought to carry the lesson that this is fundamentally a false choice Johnson tried as hard as possible to run an anodyne campaign focused on the idea that Barry Goldwater was an unacceptable outlier whom even lifelong Republicans should rejectThis Confessions of a Republican ad that the Democrats ran is a great example of what it looked likeBut now ask yourself What happened in 1965 Well not only did Johnson win in a landslide but Democrats found themselves possessing historic majorities in the House and Senate And they proceeded to enact a burst of progressive legislation in 196566 that stands alongside 193334 and 186162 as the biggest legislative leaps forward in American historyIts no coincidence that these three Congresses produced the biggest spurts of legislation At the beginning of Abraham Lincolns term in office Southern representatives and senators overwhelmingly Democrats had literally walked out in order to support a violent rebellion for the purpose of entrenching slaveryThat left Republicans with giant majorities and they used them to enact major legislationThe Depression bequeathed FDR enormous majorities in 193334 and again he used them In 1964 enormous majorities were built on the combination of an economic boom the emotions around John F Kennedys assassination and Goldwaters extremism And Johnson used themAnother big burst of legislating happened in 200910 where again Democrats had big majorities Those early Obama years werent quite as productive as the sheer numbers might have forecast because Mitch McConnells determined use of the filibuster both reduced Democrats effective margin in the Senate and generally slowed the pace of legislating But a lot still got doneThis is the basic reality of the 2016 election  the amount of progressive stuff Clinton gets done is going to be driven more by the shape of Congress than by the content of her platformClinton doesnt have a realistic chance of securing large Democratic majorities The House districts are sufficiently tilted that even securing a narrow one would be a very steep uphill fight and any Democratic majority would depend heavily on relatively moderate members holding Republicanleaning districts But its still the case that even a small Democratic majority reliant on moderate legislators would pass more progressive legislation  hiking the minimum wage raising taxes expanding Medicaid funding etc  than a Republican oneWhether or not Democrats are able to secure that kind of majority is going to be a bigger driver of policy outcomes than whatever liberal causes Clinton pays lip service toAnd given the way House districts have been drawn Democrats hopes of securing such a majority depends on either swinging Republicans over to their side or else demoralizing Republicans and getting them to stay home altogether Either way it suggests that the basic LBJ pattern remains as valid in 2016 as it was in 1964 The choice between reassuring the center and laying the groundwork for policy on issues is a false one
