As they went on their rampage the men who killed 12 people in Paris this week yelled that they had avenged the prophet They followed in the path of other terrorists who have bombed newspaper offices stabbed a filmmaker and killed writers and translators all to mete out what they believe is the proper Koranic punishment for blasphemy But in fact the Koran prescribes no punishment for blasphemy Like so many of the most fanatical and violent aspects of Islamic terrorism today the idea that Islam requires that insults against the prophet Muhammad be met with violence is a creation of politicians and clerics to serve a political agendaOne holy book is deeply concerned with blasphemy the Bible In the Old Testament blasphemy and blasphemers are condemned and prescribed harsh punishment The bestknown passage on this is Leviticus 2416  Anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be put to death The entire assembly must stone them Whether foreigner or nativeborn when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to deathBy contrast the word blasphemy appears nowhere in the Koran Nor incidentally does the Koran anywhere forbid creating images of Muhammad though there are commentaries and traditions  hadith  that do to guard against idol worship Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan has pointed out that there are more than 200 verses in the Koran which reveal that the contemporaries of the prophets repeatedly perpetrated the same act which is now called blasphemy or abuse of the Prophet  but nowhere does the Koran prescribe the punishment of lashes or death or any other physical punishment On several occasions Muhammad treated people who ridiculed him and his teachings with understanding and kindness In Islam Khan says blasphemy is a subject of intellectual discussion rather than a subject of physical punishmentSomebody forgot to tell the terrorists But the gruesome and bloody belief the jihadis have adopted is all too common in the Muslim world even among socalled moderate Muslims  that blasphemy and apostasy are grievous crimes against Islam and should be punished fiercely Many Muslimmajority countries have laws against blasphemy and apostasy  and in some places they are enforcedPakistan is now the poster child for the antiblasphemy campaign gone wild In March at least 14 people were on death row in that country and 19 were serving life sentences according to the US Commission on International Religious Freedom The owner of the countrys largest media group has been sentenced to 26 years in prison because one of his channels broadcast a devotional song about Muhammads daughter while reenacting a wedding Really And Pakistan is not alone Bangladesh Malaysia Egypt Turkey and Sudan have all used blasphemy laws to jail and harass people In moderate Indonesia 120 people have been detained for this reason since 2003 Saudi Arabia forbids the practice of any religion other than its own Wahhabi version of IslamThe Pakistani case is instructive because its extreme version of antiblasphemy law is relatively recent and a product of politics Mohammed Zia ulHaq Pakistans president during the late 1970s and 1980s wanted to marginalize the democratic and liberal opposition and he embraced Islamic fundamentalists no matter how extreme He passed a series of laws Islamizing Pakistan including a law that recommended the death penalty or life imprisonment for insulting Muhammad in any wayWhen governments try to curry favor with fanatics eventually the fanatics take the law into their own hands In Pakistan jihadis have killed dozens of people whom they accuse of blasphemy including a brave politician Salmaan Taseer who dared to call the blasphemy law a black lawWe should fight terrorism But we should also fight the source of the problem Its not enough for Muslim leaders to condemn people who kill those they consider as blasphemers if their own governments endorse the idea of punishing blasphemy at the very same time The US religious freedom commission and the UN Human Rights Committee have both declared that blasphemy laws violate universal human rights because they violate freedom of speech and expression They are correctIn Muslimmajority countries no one dares to dial back these laws In Western countries no one confronts allies on these issues But blasphemy is not a purely domestic matter of concern only to those who worry about countries internal affairs It now sits on the bloody crossroad between radical Islamists and Western societies It cannot be avoided anymore Western politicians Muslim leaders and intellectuals everywhere should point out that blasphemy is something that does not exist in the Koran and should not exist in the modern worldRead more from Fareed Zakarias archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
