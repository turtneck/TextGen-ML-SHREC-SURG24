Donald Trump has long been at odds with our beleaguered leagues of factcheckers who regularly award him Pants on Fire Four Pinocchios and other colorful rulings on his truthinessYet somehow such definitive unanimous debunking never seems to faze the Republican presidential frontrunner And I think Ive discovered whyIts because Trump  like Socrates among other trailblazing truthseekers throughout history  has developed his own innovative method for factchecking Rather than relying on stale lamestreammedia techniques such as gathering evidence crunching numbers or consulting experts he takes a different route He goes online and sees whether random people agree with himFor example hes lately been challenged on his claims of seeing TV footage of thousands and thousands of people in Jersey City cheering when the twin towers came down While fusty factcheckers at The Post and elsewhere have foolishly tried to find such footage Trump instead prefers a pioneering Twitterbased authentication methodWhy wouldnt it have taken place Ive had hundreds of people call in and tweet in on Twitter saying they saw it and I was 100 percent right Trump said Sunday on NBCs Meet the PressWhen host Chuck Todd protested that Trump wouldnt make a business deal based on retweets Trump doubled down By the hundreds theyre calling and theyre tweetingSeveral days later appearing on the Alex Jones Show Trump again explained the value of his truthseeking techniqueSo many people have called in and on Twitter realdonaldtrump theyre all tweeting so I know it happened Trump saidReality may have a wellknown liberal bias but Trumps Twitter followers do not Nor do the conspiracy theory Web sites from which Trump also seems to glean much of his information and policy ideasTo be honest this worldview  and the corollary that everyone is entitled not only to their own opinions but also to their own democratically determined facts  never really occurred to me Sure I occasionally use Googlefight to check the more commonly used spelling of a word eg demagogue beats demagog But Ive never thought to use hordes of anonymous netizens as a sieve for the truthHow Donald Trump courted the rightwing fringe to conquer the GOPI began to wonder Whats it like to navigate life as Trump does Whats it like to learn about human existence via Twitter Reddit message boards and the Drudge ReportTo find out I compiled a list of things youd learn were true if you factchecked them solely by seeing whether strangers on the Internet agreed with you1 You are a Nazi I am a Nazi Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both Nazis Everyone on the Internet is eventually a Nazi according to other people on the Internet who disagree with them and who themselves become Nazis if any conversation goes on long enough2 Your spouse is definitely cheating on you3 You have cancer Several really really rare forms of cancer Also lupus mad cow disease fibromyalgia osteoporosis and a urinary tract infection Or maybe its just a common cold Either way the ailments can be cured by purchasing dietary supplements from a sketchy Web site featuring testimonials from a person currently running for president Modern medicine is for losers4 Some dress somewhere is the exact two colors that you think it is5 If only Ron Paul had been president we would not have had the secret hyperinflation pandemic currently ravaging the nation Also gold and bitcoins have been and will continue to be the safest places in which to store your life savings excluding perhaps your mattress a Nigerian princes bank account or your hollowedout spare copy of Atlas Shrugged6 This one weird trick will help you lose belly fat7 You should be ashamed of yourself You are a terrible parent and also a terrible pet owner and friend and unAmerican and probably not even human Why would you do whatever you just admitted to doing you jerk8 Leonardo DiCaprio got raped by a bear or something9 Obama is a secret Muslim Also maybe Thomas Jefferson was a secret Muslim As with Nazism pretty much everyone you dislike is a secret Muslim Unless they already admit to being a Muslim in which case theyre probably also a secret Mexican who wants to steal your job10 If you dont forward this column to at least 10 people you will have bad luck for the rest of your lifeSheesh it really is a scary world out there I dont envy you Mr Trump
