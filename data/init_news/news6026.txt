Hillary Rodham Clinton holds a commanding 6 to 1 lead over other Democrats heading into the 2016 presidential campaign while the Republican field is deeply divided with no clear frontrunner according to a new Washington PostABC News pollClinton trounces her potential primary rivals with 73percent ofDemocrats and Democraticleaning independents reinforcing a narrative of inevitability around her nomination if she runs Vice President Biden is second with 12percent and Sen Elizabeth Warren Mass is third with 8percentAlthough Clintons favorability rating has fallen since she stepped down as secretary of state a year ago she has broad Democratic support across ideological gender ethnic and class lines Her lead is the largest recorded in an early primary matchup in at least 30 years of PostABC pollingThe race for the Republican nomination in contrast is wide open with six prospective candidates registering 10percent to 20percent support No candidate has broad backing from both tea party activists and mainline Republicans signaling potential fissures when the GOP picks a standardbearer in 2016New Jersey Gov Chris Christie who was at or near the top of the Republican field in many public opinion surveys last year appears to have suffered politically from the bridgetraffic scandal engulfing his administrationThe new survey puts Christie in third place  with the support of 13percent of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents  behind Rep Paul Ryan Wis with 20 percent and former Florida governor Jeb Bush at 18 percent The rest of the scattered pack includes Sens Ted Cruz Tex Rand Paul Ky and Marco Rubio Fla who are at 12 11and 10percent respectivelyAmong strong backers of the tea party  who make up about onefifth of the Republicans polled  Cruz has a big lead with 28percent followed by Ryan at 18percent But Cruz an iconoclastic freshman senator who rose to prominence during last falls partial government shutdown registers just 4percent among those who oppose or have no opinion of the tea partyChristie is weakest among the strong tea party set winning 6percent of that group but he has the backing of 15percent of other Republicans Bushs base of support comes from selfidentified Republicans while Ryans strength comes from white evangelical Protestants young voters and less conservative wings of the party Rubio does particularly well among Republicans with college degreesChristie has benefited from the perception that he has unique appeal among independents and some Democrats a reputation the governor burnished with his 2013 reelection in his strongly Democratic stateBut that image has been tarnished the survey finds More Democrats now view Christie unfavorably than favorably with independents divided Republicans meanwhile have a lukewarm opinion with 43percent viewing him favorably and 33percent unfavorably Overall 35percent of Americans see him favorably and 40percent unfavorablyChristies administration is under investigation for a plot last fall to shut down local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge and cause four days of gridlock in Fort Lee NJ in an act of apparent political retribution against a Democratic mayorAmong the public 46percent say they consider the bridge episode a sign of broader problems with Christies leadership while 43percent say they think it was an isolated incidentMost Republicans give Christie the benefit of the doubt with 57percent saying the bridge incident is isolated Sixty percent of Democrats say it is indicative of broader problems while independents are almost evenly splitThe 2016 presidential campaign is not likely to start taking shape until the end of this year when candidates are expected to begin declaring their intentions Among the Republicans Ryan and Bush appear to be the most ambivalent about a campaign Other Republicans not named in the poll such as Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker could gain steam as potential candidatesOn the Democratic side Warren has said she will not run although she has a loyal following among some liberal groups hoping to draft an alternative to ClintonPolling this far out in the cycle is poor at forecasting winners of party nomination battles but it offers important clues about current voter attitudes Major fundraisers and party activists in particular look to such polls as indications ofpotential candidates strengths and weaknesses on the national stage as they begin to pick their horsesIn a theoretical headtohead generalelection matchup Clinton leads Christie among registered voters 53percent to 41percent This is a far larger deficit than Republicans had in the popular vote in the past two presidential elections In 2012 President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 51percent to 47 percent and he beat John McCain by 53 percent to 46 percent in 2008Christie is hurt by weak support among independents  trailing Clinton by 48 percent to 43percent  as well as by a less consolidated party base Although 90percent of Democrats say they would back Clinton only 79percent of Republicans say they would support Christie By contrast Romney beat Obama among independents by five percentage points and he won 93percent of Republican votesClinton who would become the first female president if elected shows enormous strength among women in the new poll She leads Christie among female voters by 59percent to 34percent  more than double the 11point margin Obama held over RomneyChristie tops Clinton by a slender three points among men 49 percent to 46 percent Romney won men by seven percentage pointsClinton is buoyed by netpositive favorability ratings and by the intense loyalty of her supporters Fiftyeight percent view her favorably  including 32percent who are strongly favorable while 38percent have an unfavorable view of herThis marks a decline from a PostABC poll last January as Clinton prepared to leave the State Department At the time 67percent said they viewed her favorably The drop can be attributed to declining support among independents and Republicans as Clinton inched back into partisan politics and the news media stopped covering her as a globetrotting diplomat and focused on her presidential ambitionsStill Clintons current popularity is as high or higher than at any point during her eightyear tenure as a US senator from New York when her favorable rating in PostABC polling mostly hovered in the high 40s or low 50sAlthough Clinton was the frontrunner heading into the 2008 primary season she barely tipped over 50percent in two PostABC surveys Clintons standing heading into the 2016 Democratic primaries is considerably stronger The poll shows her with remarkable strength across demographic groups She wins nearly threequarters of men and women whites and nonwhites young and old as well as lower and higher income votersThe PostABC poll was conducted Jan 2023 among a random national sample of 1003 adults including interviews on conventional telephones and with cellphoneonly respondents The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 35 percentage points
