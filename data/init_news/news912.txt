The battle over the budget that President Obama will submit Monday is emerging as a preview of the 2016 presidential election debate on national security an area that for now appears to be the greatest vulnerability of Obama and the DemocratsThe president will ask Congress to break through its own spending caps  commonly referred to as sequestration  and allocate about 561billion for Pentagon expenditures about 38billion more than is currently allowed under the lawTheres broad consensus in both parties that the military needs more money to modernize its forces and meet its responsibilities in a world that seems to have grown more chaotic and dangerous in the past 12 months Its unclear however how Congress and the White House can come to an agreement on where to find the additional fundsEven if both parties share the blame a cashstrapped Pentagon could still provide an opening for Republicans  whose standing on national security issues was damaged by the Iraq war  to make an argument that they are the party best positioned to keep the country safeA lot of Republicans see opportunity in an election thats a referendum on Obamas foreign policy said Danielle Pletka vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute A presidential election featuring Hillary Rodham Clinton who served as Obamas secretary of state would raise the profile of international issuesDemocrats though are determined to prevent the reemergence of their preIraqwar reputation as being the weaker party on defenseThe impasse over the defense budget has left the Pentagons top generals complaining that the spending caps which have been in place since 2013 are damaging the military at a time when the country can least afford it The list of new threats includes Islamic State fighters who last year seized major cities in Iraq and Syria a Russianbacked insurrection in eastern Ukraine and the collapse of the government in YemenThe global security environment is more dangerous and sequestration is still on the books as the law Gen Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said last week Its absolutely crazy for this countryObama has in recent months been able to cite a resurgent economy strong job growth and a low unemployment rate as proof that his economic policies are delivering for the nation Because of the policies that this administration put in place our economy has bounced back stronger than ever White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters FridayThe public perception of the presidents handling of national security matters amid the growing unrest in the Middle East and Ukraine has not been nearly as strong Weve had an interesting and I would acknowledge upanddown year with respect to the perception of our foreign policy said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of the formal budget announcementIn recent years Republicans and Democrats have been able to blunt the worst effects of the budget caps by cobbling together shortterm deals that modestly increased defense and domestic spending by finding offsets  essentially cuts to other programs or fee increases But each year that the budget caps are in place it gets harder to find new savings to meet the Pentagons needs lawmakers and White House officials saidRepublicans have shown little willingness to raise taxes to cover the costs of a bigger military budget The White House meanwhile is not likely to back a budget compromise that would boost defense spending at the expense of prized domestic programs that have also been slashed in recent yearsIt looks like the administration is trying but I dont think the fundamentals are there for a compromise said Kathleen Hicks who served as a top official in the Pentagon under Obama and now is a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International StudiesRepublicans long divided between deficit and defense hawks have not made additional spending on defense a top priority in recent years But as the economy improves and the presidential election nears they appear to be coalescing around the need for more Pentagon spending for no reason other than expediency Hicks saidTheyll have to move to the center on defense spending she said And I do think world events are pushing them in that directionIt is unclear how hard the Obama administration is willing to fight for more military spending Although the presidents blueprint includes a big boost for the Pentagon some in the presidents party have questioned his commitment on the issue The president did not mention the need for more military spending in his State of the Union address or in a major foreign policy speech at the US Military Academy in late May an omission that some hawkish Democrats found worrisome Hicks saidWhite House officials though insist that a failure to provide relief to the Pentagon would be devastating to the countrys military and its national security and that Obama will not accept a budget that carries the caps forwardThe promises of more money from Congress and the White House have yet to ease concerns in the Pentagon The top brass have been complaining for years that the budget caps have forced them to pare back training slash troop levels and gut their modernization programsNow their biggest worry is that lawmakers and the public have stopped listening to them on the issue and absent a major crisis will not fix the problemAt what point do we lose our soldiers trust the trust that we will provide them the right resources the training and equipment said Gen Ray Odierno the Army chief of staffThe militarys case for more money also has been hindered by the turmoil at the top of the Defense DepartmentFormer defense secretary Chuck Hagel who was essentially fired by Obama in November had little background in Pentagon budget issues and generally seemed overwhelmed by the job military officials said Obamas pick to replace him Ashton B Carter has not been confirmed by the Senate He has a long background serving at top levels of the Pentagon and is expected to be a more forceful and articulate advocate for lifting the budget capsMeanwhile liberal Democrats eager to fend off the Republican critique that excessive domestic spending and government waste have caused the Pentagons budget woes cite the supporters of the 2003 Iraq war as the real problemThese are the same guys who voted for a war in Iraq and forgot how it was going to be paid for said Sen Bernard Sanders IVt a possible Democratic presidential candidate You know how its paid for Its paid for on the credit card We dont know how much it will cost by the time we take care of the last veteran  3trillion or 4trillion They werent worried about thatMissy Ryan and Steven Mufson contributed to this report
