Could this be the populist momentA seemingly unstoppable coalition of the powerful assembled to advance the Trans Pacific Partnership trade bill A Democratic president aligned with the Republican majority in both chambers of Congress and the full lobbying might of Corporate AmericaBut on Tuesday afternoon the Senate Democratic minority delivered a surprise defeat to President Obama and a severe setback to one of the last few items on his presidential agenda They blocked consideration of fast track trade authority  a crucial vehicle to get the Pacific trade pact through CongressThe victors the ascendant populist wing of the Democratic Party and its spiritual leader Sen Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Over and over Americas workers have taken the brunt of bad trade deals the former Harvard professor and scourge of big business told a gathering of the Roosevelt Institute a liberal think tank hours before Tuesdays voteWe cant keep pushing through trade deals that benefit multinational companies at the expense of workers she added with theatrical urgency Government cannot continue to be the captive of the rich and powerful Working people cannot be forced to give up more and more as they get squeezed harder and harderWarren masterfully undermined the trade bill by highlighting the administrations obsessive secrecy the details of the proposed agreement are classified and the role of corporate interests in drafting the deal 500 nongovernment advisors participated she said 85 percent of them industry executives or lobbyistsAnd now this trade deal is getting the full court lobbying press from those same giant multinational corporations she said The middle class is on the ropes and now is the time to fight backUnder intense pressure from the Warren wing 44 of the 45 Democrats present Tuesday afternoon defied Obama Even Sen Ron Wyden DOre the chief Democratic advocate for the fasttrack bill buckled Proponents fell eight votes short of the 60 they needed to take up the fasttrack billSenate freetraders will likely find a way to revive the bill but Tuesdays defeat will embolden opponents in the House where the freetrade package already faced trouble However the trade debate is resolved Tuesdays defeat in the Senate is likely to be a turning point because it shows that the populists are now firmly in control of the Democratic Party Anger over growing inequality has reached critical mass and a backlash has begun against a political system that has over the last three decades allowed 100 percent of all income growth to go to the wealthiest 10 percentThe trade deal has for now become the victim of that anger  less because of the details of the TPP than because it hasnt been accompanied by more protections and assistance for American workersI believe in this Obama said of the trade deal the same way that I believe in a higher minimum wage The same way that I believe in stronger protections for workers who are trying to get a voice in their company The same way I believe in equal pay The same way I believe in paid sick leaveBut Obamas actions havent matched his words and he didnt require Republicans to accept any of those priorities before he joined them in pushing for freetrade legislation Senate Republicans drove more Democrats into opposition when they declined requests to bring up other traderelated bills other than legislation offering a meager and reduced amount of training funds for workers who lose their jobsAt the White House press secretary Josh Earnest called Tuesdays vote a procedural snafu But Obama was undone by more than procedure His wouldbe successor Hillary Clinton was not courageous enough to take a position on the trade legislation but her silence gave Democrats more freedom to oppose it And Democrats in Congress bristled at Obamas disparagement of opponents of the trade bill as emotional illogical and dishonestThe president is making some fairly nasty remarks about people on the other side that they dont understand were in the 21st century Joseph Stiglitz a Nobel laureate in economics said at the Roosevelt Institute gathering at the National Press Club Actually we do I dont think he understandsWarren at the same event took a shot at those Democrats who have floated along with the idea that economic growth is in direct opposition to strengthening the wellbeing of Americas working families That claim is flatly wrongTuesdays 44to1 vote against Obamas position confirms that Warrens populists now dominate the Democratic Party  and if Obama wants to retain a semblance of relevance hell join themRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
