Before Its NewsIm about to be seriously unPCHillary Clinton appeared yesterday on El Gordo y la Flaca a Univision TV show I would never ask my loyal readers to watch these videos in their entirety However it is clear Hillary does not have custody of her eye movements In the first video you can stop at 7s 15s and 31s to witness her whacked out eyesAt the 135 mark of the second video Hillary is introduced by a little person who conveniently helps her down the stairs on to the set Hop up to 412 601 610 and 621 to see her eyes scramble It is particularly noticeable at 610Does the following make me a racistIf youd like to know what Hillary is talking about in the second video youll have to be able to speak Spanish since the translator speaks over Hillary What happened to immigrants having to speak English to become a citizen If the people watching this need to have it translated in order to know what Hillary is saying then why are they allowed to vote
