Dr Martin Luther King Jr died young  at age 39  and ever since his assassination in 1968 there has been a contest over his legacyIve met black radicals who sneer at the national holiday celebrating his birth They see the King holiday as white Americas preference for celebrating a moderate nonviolent black leader instead of a militant violent young Malcolm XOn the other side are critics who see the King holiday as political correctness taken to new heights King was not a president like Washington and Lincoln so they ask why he is deserving of a national holiday Blinded by racial bitterness they suggest President Reagan signed the King holiday into law in 1983 as a token political gestureNow a very good emotionally powerful new movie  Selma  about Dr Kings historic role in the struggle for voting rights has set off a new fight over his legacyThis dramatic film by director Ava DuVernay will be remembered less as a record of Dr Kings greatness and more as a sign of the racial power struggles of the early 21st centuryI know the real civil rights story Ive written two bestselling histories of the period The greatest social movement of the last century belongs to all Americans But some people prefer to play racial gamesThis movie fits in with the racially divisive discussion about who owns the history of the civil rights movement It fits with polarizing racial figures like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton They regularly exploit the history of the civil rights movement for their own personal gain  hosting television shows and getting money from corporations  while not doing the hard work of addressing high rates of black crime school dropouts and family breakdownIt is also fits with many white politicians who blame the poor for every problem and find it easy to push minority voters out of their districts while ignoring the nations history of denying black people the right to voteNow a version of the same race hustle is on display in Hollywood To celebrate King as a hero the director who is black decided to make President Lyndon Johnson into a white villainIn one scene Johnson erupts in anger at Dr King telling the civil rights leader Youve got one big issue Ive got one hundred and one People who were in the room black and white aides to the president and Dr King say no such confrontation ever happenedThe movie also has Johnson approving of FBI Director J Edgar Hoovers scheme to send Dr Kings wife an audio recording of her husband having sex with another woman The historical record is clear Yes the tape is real No Johnson had nothing to do it And the tape had nothing to do with events in SelmaAll of that is what Bill Moyers called the worst kind of creative license suggesting the very opposite of the truthAnd when the director DuVernay was called on the distortion she said people who care about history are the problem She argued that crediting Johnson with supporting the Selma march was jawdropping and offensive and amounted to ignoring black citizens who made it so To her the fact that Johnson explicitly endorsed the idea of taking the movement to Selma in a recorded phone call to Dr King is just a nuisanceWhite directors have similarly distorted civil rights history The 1988 film Mississippi Burning featured two heroes both white and both FBI agents That was an incredible distortion of a story about the bravery of civil rights workers who dared to go south to stand with beleaguered black heroes against racial oppression In truth the FBI was often in league with local police departments in covering up racially motivated murderIn 1988 that distortion was rationalized as a smart box office decision to offer white heroes to white audiencesNow that a black director has a chance to make Hollywoods first big movie about Dr King she sees it as time for payback and her own brand of distortionRace retains a powerful grip on American guilt fear lust and anger Thats why controlling the narrative is so important And the key to the narrative is in the facts of slavery legal segregation and the fight for equal rights That is why facts about Dr King are subject to a constant power struggle DuVernay is saying she will tell her story as a black story for black audiences with a black hero and she will twist facts as she pleasesMark Twain said Get your facts first then you can distort them as much as you pleaseThe facts are that mostly white students went south for Freedom Summer white ministers and rabbis took great risks and even died for the cause white government officials like John Doar and Nicholas Katzenbach put themselves between racist mobs and black people None of this diminishes the contributions of black peopleThe truth is that President Johnson worked to make the movement a success The president famously brought tears to Dr Kings eyes in 1965 when he told a joint session of Congress and a television audience of 70 million that every American should stand up for equal voting rights Their cause must be our cause too the president said Because its not just Negroes but its really all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injusticeAnd then in a rhetorical crescendo the president said And we shall overcome He used a phrase that told the nation he was on the side of civil rights for black people  As the author of a history of the civil rights movement Eyes on the Prize  Americas Civil Rights Years Ive done enough research to know that any fair account of the great social movement has to acknowledge Lyndon Baines Johnson as a civil rights heroAnd Dr King doesnt need to have anyone put down so he can look heroic He really is a hero Thats a factJuan Williams is a cohost of FNCs The Five where he is one of seven rotating Fox personalities
