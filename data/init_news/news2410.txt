Hillary Rodham Clinton has locked up public support from half of the Democratic insiders who cast ballots at the partys national convention giving her a commanding advantage over her rivals for the partys presidential nominationClintons margin over Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley is striking Not only is it big but it comes more than two months before primary voters head to the polls  an early point in the race for so many of the people known as superdelegates to publicly back a candidateShe has the experience necessary not only to lead this country she has experience politically that I think will help her through a tough campaign said Unzell Kelley a county commissioner from AlabamaI think shes learned from her previous campaign he said Shes learned what to do what to say what not to say  which just adds to her electabilityThe Associated Press contacted all 712 superdelegates in the past two weeks and heard back from more than 80 percent They were asked which candidate they plan to support at the convention next summerThe 712 superdelegates make up about 30 percent of the 2382 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination That means that more than two months before voting starts Clinton already has 15 percent of the delegates she needsThat sizable lead reflects Clintons advantage among the Democratic Party establishment an edge that has helped the 2016 frontrunner build a massive campaign organization hire top staff and win coveted local endorsementsSuperdelegates are convention delegates who can support the candidate of their choice regardless of who voters choose in the primaries and caucuses They are members of Congress and other elected officials party leaders and members of the Democratic National CommitteeClinton is leading most preference polls in the race for the Democratic nomination most by a wide margin Sanders has made some inroads in New Hampshire which holds the first presidential primary and continues to attract huge crowds with his populist message about income inequalityBut Sanders has only recently started saying hes a Democrat after a decadeslong career in politics as an independent While hes met with and usually voted with Democrats in the Senate he calls himself a democratic socialistWe recognize Secretary Clinton has enormous support based on many years working with and on behalf of many party leaders in the Democratic Party said Tad Devine a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign But Sen Sanders will prove to be the strongest candidate with his ability to coalesce and bring young people to the polls the way that Barack Obama didThe best way to win support from superdelegates is to win support from voters added Devine a longtime expert on the Democrats nominating processThe Clinton campaign has been working for months to secure endorsements from superdelegates part of a strategy to avoid repeating the mistakes that cost her the Democratic nomination eight years agoIn 2008 Clinton hinged her campaign on an early knockout blow on Super Tuesday while Obamas staff had devised a strategy to accumulate delegates well into the springThis time around Clinton has hired Obamas top delegate strategist from 2008 a lawyer named Jeff Berman an expert on the partys arcane rules for nominating a candidate for presidentClintons increased focus on winning delegates has paid off putting her way ahead of where she was at this time eight years ago In December 2007 Clinton had public endorsements from 169 superdelegates according to an AP survey At the time Obama had 63 and a handful of other candidates had commitments as well from the smaller fraction of superdelegates willing to commit to a candidateOur campaign is working hard to earn the support of every caucus goer primary voter and grassroots and grasstop leaders said Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson Since day one we have not taken this nomination for granted and that will not changeSome superdelegates supporting Clinton said they dont think Sanders is electable especially because of his embrace of socialism But few openly criticized Sanders and a handful endorsed himIve heard him talk about many subjects and I cant say there is anything I disagree with said Chad Nodland a DNC member from North Dakota who is backing SandersHowever Nodland added if Clinton is the partys nominee I will knock on doors for her There are just more issues I agree with BernieSome superdelegates said they were unwilling to publicly commit to candidates before voters have a say out of concern that they will be seen as undemocratic A few said they have concerns about Clinton who has been dogged about her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of stateIf it boils down to anything Im not sure about the trust factor said Danica Oparnica a DNC member from Arizona She has been known to tell some outright lies and I cant tolerate thatStill others said they were won over by Clintons 11 hours of testimony before a GOPled committee investigating the attack on a US consulate in Benghazi Libya Clintons testimony won widespread praise as House Republicans struggled to trip her upI dont think that theres any candidate right now Democrat or Republican that could actually face up to that and come out with people shaking their heads and saying That is one bright intelligent person said California Democratic Rep Tony Cardenas
