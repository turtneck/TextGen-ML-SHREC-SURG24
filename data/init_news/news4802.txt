This attack on retirement benefits follows a very familiar pattern of fabricating data to destroy retirements that work and that people really like Its the same nonsense and lies used to destroy private pensions two decades ago but this time its being done as part of a partisan wet dream of limited government Its a strategy as American as fast food and crumbling infrastructureThis latest skirmish in the retirement wars perpetuates the biggest lie ever foisted on Americathat we cannot afford retirement benefitsPrivate pensions have indeed been systematically destroyed in recent decades and replaced by defined contribution 401k plans The conventional wisdom is that pensions are too expensive but this is the heart of the lie A great many private pensions were onceoverfunded but a change in law allowed companies to invest the excess funding in other parts of their business Once businessmen could legally raid the pension fund the idea of private pensions was over Many books have been written about the great pension theft I recommend for one reading Retirement Heist How Companies Plunder and Profit from the Nest Eggs of American WorkersSpoiler alert you will feel rageIm no bystander in all this because Im a member of the Nevada pension system through my day job Even when I considered myself a Republican I supported the pension system just as my conservative friends and colleagues still do But a lot has changed in a few years Public pensions used to have bipartisan support but the dysfunction and extremism that has turned Washington DC into a shitshow has spread to states like mineThe attacks on benefits are always underhanded and dishonest an effort to keep critics quiet and this latest attempt is no exception because it only targets future members of the pension system Its the same tactic used in the constant assault on Social Security  just take it from people who dont have it yet My favorite visual is the conservative who collects Social Security month after month after month after month then votes for politicians who will destroy those very modest benefits for his children  all while reciting the false narrative of not saddling those same children with debtA better idea rather than stealing from our own children would be to pay the reasonable levels of taxes necessary to fund the programs we all use But family values conservatives are always delighted to burn the crops and salt the earth behind them children be damnedIts understandable that people without pensions resent those who still have them Its much easier to rage about a schoolteachers pension than it is to understand the systemic greed of high finance and thats by design The rich and powerful who looted private pensions have managed to set the members of the middle class upon one another At the same time the purveyors of 401k plans get rich off of fees from individual accounts Millions of people are shuffled into the market to be preyed upon by the vultures of high finance who get paid no matter how much money you win or lose in the grand casinoI admit that there are reasonable criticisms of pensions There are always a few people an overpaid manager or administrator perhaps who manage to game the system through overtime pay or inflated salaries Critics can point to the handful of people with sixfigure pensions with understandable fury but to extrapolate it to everyone is plain hogwash In my own pension system the average monthly benefit for regular retirees is around 2200 a month and retirees are not eligible for Social SecurityFor those who think pensions should all be abolished Id draw your attention to the constant attacks on Social Security Serious rightwing presidential candidates and even some Democrats have proposed upping the retirement age cutting benefits and in general making life a little less pleasant for retirees The hope is that many of us will die before we can collect what weve earned through decades of work Even though the trust fund has a balance of trillions of dollars the money has been used to fund everyday government spending Politicians would rather loot your retirement rather than fund government spending with honest taxation Im not even saying that we have to sacrifice other spending priorities to fund retirements because theres enough wealth in this country to do both But the very question of affordability is moot because the attack on retirement has nothing at all to do with money The real goal of conservatives is to break government so that Wall Street and the wellconnected can feast upon the carcass gorging themselves on illconceived privatization schemes America has become epitome of a failing company and politicians are acting as the investment banker breaking whats left into pieces to sell off for quick cash As a member of Generation X Ive spent my adult life riding waves of bubbles watching housing values implode retirement accounts halved and job prospects evaporate With each subsequent crisis I and my cohort are asked to give up a little more to help the country recover even as a tiny fraction of people and corporations reach unprecedented unimaginable levels of wealth This disparity is unsustainable I can almost sympathize with the Tea Party a group built on similar feelings of frustration and anger Their only mistake is that they do not see who is really picking their pockets Its not immigrants the gays or liberals Tea Partiers have tragically bought into the total nonsense that poor people are somehow responsible for the malaise of the middle class It would be almost amusing if it werent so tragic Todays Tea Party voter is willing to sell out the future of his own child because he cant see through bullshit shouted at him by Fox News every day We cannot afford pensions or health care or food stamps but by god we can afford 15 trillion for a plane that doesnt fly Like so many workers Ive watched my benefits erode year after year with frozen salaries forced unpaid days off and ever more stingy medical benefits I take heart that the latest attempt to destroy the pension system seems doomed if only because it will cost more money to wreck it than to leave it alone But the greater war on pensions and Social Security is not over Libertarians and conservatives will not rest until they have unmade the last century of progress and the entire New Deal They will destroy and dismantle vilify and divide because its easier to make people resent one another than to make society better They want to not only halt progress but to turn back the hands of time Its not just pensions but overtime pay weekends and the fortyhour workweek that are all in danger Its an act of selfdestruction and stupidity They drill holes in a leaky boat in which we are all riding somehow unaware that when the boat sinks they will also drown
