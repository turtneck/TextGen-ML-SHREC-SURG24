To share the high costs of covering the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton more than a dozen news organizations banded together to form a press pool  essentially a collaborative in which reporters from contributing organizations take turns shadowing the Democratic frontrunner and sending back emailed reports of her every move The whole idea rests upon the expectation that the Clinton campaign will provide access to the pool reporterDavid Martosko US political editor for the Daily Mail sent an email to his fellow pool participants early today alerting them to trouble on the trail Hillary pool report 1  might be final for today noted Martosko in his first message The pooler had shown up at 745 am at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester ready for action A press staffer with the New Hampshire Democratic Party told Martosko that he wasnt the approved print pool reporter for todays pooled eventsA subsequent pool report from Martosko summarized a conversation that hed had with Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill Martosko writes of MerrillHe offered varied and contradictory reasons for this decision First he confirmed that the concern had to do with the Daily Mails status as foreign press Weve been getting a lot of blowback from foreign outlets that want to be part of the pool and we need to rethink it all maybe for a day and just cool things off until we can have a discussion Your pool informed him that the Guardian is part of the pool and that the pool doesnt discriminate on the basis of media ownership He then said that the campaigns position is that the Daily Mail doesnt qualify because it hasnt yet been added to the White Houses regular print pool  something the pool informed him was a timing issue not a White House choice since Francesca Chambers our White House correspondent has been vetted and has a hard pass Were just trying to follow the same process and system the White House has he said Merrill then insisted that the decision had nothing to do with the campaign considering the Daily Mail foreign press We dont consider you foreign press he said Its your poolers understanding that this was the only reason given last night when Nick sprung this on Ruby Cramer of Buzzfeed who coordinates the pool Pool pointed out to Merrill that if the campaign is denying pool access to foreign press but wont take the position that the Daily Mail is foreign press the position is untenable Then he said This isnt about you Its about a larger  and didnt continue his sentence Merrill later insisted that his reasons were not based on the foreignpress question but that the campaign simply wanted a day to have a conversation about how to proceed Were going to make the decision he said referring to choosing whether to give access to the designated print pooler Your pooler told Merrill that he seemed to be contradicting himself and pointed out the murky situation of foreign ownership interests in several outlets in the pool He reiterated that the campaign could choose to decline pool coverage and claimed that its my understanding that the pool wasnt sending a reporter today Your pooler informed him that the pool sent me and Im here and that the pool would show up at all the events today whether or not the campaign chose to grant access and would request access each time He offered that this afternoons launch party one of three calendared events for the day is open press so theres no issue with that one The pool lodged one further objection and reminded him that the call was on the record since hes a campaign spokesperson and there was no discussion about the onoffbackground status of the call at any timeAs the morning progressed Martosko chauffered himself around to the campaigns stops At 1100 am he issued Pool report 5  denied entry at the Rochester NH event In this dispatch Martosko describes how he was carefully denied access to an early childhood education event at the YMCA of Strafford CountyThe Erik Wemple Blog placed the matter before Merrill in an email and the spokesman quickly replied We want a happy press corps as much as the press corps does And we work very hard to achieve that in tandem with them Its a long campaign and we are going to do our best to find equilibrium and best accommodate interest from as many news outlets as possible given the space limitations of our eventsEveryone in the campaign world understands space limitations  and those space limitations are precisely one of the reasons that the pool exists in the first place Why not have one reporter chronicling the quotidian travels of a top candidate instead of 12 or 15 reporters doing the same In any case Martosko is part of a pool that includes outlets such as The Washington Post the New York Times Buzzfeed and othersMartosko himself isnt above adding a bit of media commentary to his work on the trail as in this tweet from Saturday following Clintons big speechIn landing at the Daily Mail Martosko followed a colorful path He formerly served as executive editor of the Daily Caller a position in which he directed the outlets muchdiscredited reporting that Sen Robert Menendez had romped with prostitutes on a trip to the Dominican Republic And before that he worked at the Center for Consumer Freedom a nonprofit run by PR ace Richard Berman In that position Martosko used a phony Facebook account to gather dirt on animalrights activistsThe Daily Mail has issued this statement on the matterWe can confirm that David Martosko US Political Editor DailyMailcom was today denied access to Hillary Clintons campaign event and was prohibited from boarding a van that the Clinton campaign is using to transport pool reporters around New Hampshire We are seeking an explanation from the Clinton campaign as to why this occurred as Mr Martosko was scheduled to be the designated print pool reporter in New Hampshire this morningScott Wilson deputy national editor of the Washington Post expressed concern with the sequence of events Who participates in the pool should be decided by the news organizations not the campaign and there can be no selective exclusions based on outlet or individual once the pool is set notes Wilson in an email The campaigns rules should be clarified as soon as possible and shared with pool representatives so that what happened to David yesterday is not repeated When asked whether a backup pool reporter was allowed to hop on board after Martoskos denial Merrill responded Absolutely though the pool declinedThis post has been updated numerous times given the rolling nature of the story
