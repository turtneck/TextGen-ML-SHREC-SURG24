President Obama unveiled a 4 trillion budget Monday featuring an ambitious public works program a onetime tax on foreign profits kept overseas by corporations tax credits for middleclass Americans and a 13 percent pay raise for federal employees and troopsThe massive document is a blueprint for what Obama has been calling middleclass economics but congressional Republicans are likely to view it merely as the presidents opening bid in a contentious process designed to forge a tax and spending plan for the new fiscal yearThe document will become if not law another defining moment for the president as he tries to carve out priorities for his remaining two years in office Administration officials have tried to map out potential political tradeoffs by offering elements such as a corporate tax revision that could appeal to Republicans while asking for more spending on infrastructureBut the president is also seeking to fund his proposals by raising taxes on the richest Americans an approach that has immediately drawn Republican oppositionHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan RWis appearing on television Sunday rejected many of Obamas ideas for raising taxes on the wealthy as envy economicsThe presidents budget features a sixyear 478 billion public works program for upgrading the nations infrastructure including roads railroads and portsThe package is bigger and stretched over more years than Obamas earlier unsuccessful requests for infrastructure moneyThe administration is proposing to pay for the ambitious program in part with revenue from a onetime mandatory 14 percent tax on about 2 trillion in profits that corporations have been keeping overseas in order to avoid corporate income taxes here The tax would be a sizable hit on multinationals and a way of discouraging them from parking money in foreign countriesThe administration also is seeking to lower the corporate federal incometax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent by closing loopholesAnd the president wants to raise pay for federal workers and troops by 13 percent which would be more than the 1 percent pay bump given to them the past two fiscal yearsThe administration is also seeking a 6 percent increase in research and development spending a substantial investment in early education boosts in efforts on cybersecurity and resources to fight the Islamic State and other foreign threatsThe Office of Management and Budget said the presidents plan would produce a474 billion deficit or 25 percent of the gross domestic product which is little changed from the current fiscal year but in line with deficits as a share of the economy over the past halfcenturyThe budget requests exceed the spending caps established in 2010 by 74 billion spread evenly between military and nonmilitary discretionary spending and while the administration is proposing offsets it also argued strongly for the elimination of the limits that trigger wide cuts known as sequestration Weve seen bipartisan agreement that the sequestration is mindless and is not the right approach for our country said a senior administration officialThe OMB also forecasts that over the next decade nearly 6trillion will be added to the national debt but that would represent a small decline as a share of the economy at 733 percent in 2025 said a congressional aide familiar with the plan who was not authorized to speak about it publicly That forecast includes 18trillion in deficitreduction measures said another person familiar with the planThe administration said it achieves these goals by replacing mindless austerity with smart reforms paying for all new investments and seeking new savingsThat isnt likely to appease Republicans however who are expected to quickly dismiss Obamas budget request and start drafting their own blueprint that would seek to eliminate deficits entirely over the next 10 years and tackle the biggest drivers of government spending Social Security and federal health programsAlthough the president has previewed his tax and spending priorities over the past two weeks the budget provides important  and controversial  detailsThis is a budget that fleshes out the presidents State of the Union address and puts meat on the bones of his middleclass economics agenda said Rep Chris Van Hollen Md the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee It makes important strategic investmens to sharpen our competitive edge including investments in infrastructure science research and education  things that have helped power the American economy in the past  and we risk falling behind if we dont make those investments going forwardVan Hollen added that the administration is proposing tax changes  including an increase in the capital gains tax and expanded tax credits for families with children  designed to address what is currently a tilt in the tax code in favor of those who make money off of money and against those who make money off of hard workAccording to a Tax Policy Center paper if all of the major individual income tax provisions were fully phased in the presidents package would raise taxes by an average of 164 per household in 2016 But winners would outnumber losers by more than 7 to 1 with the tax increases concentrated among the richest 1percent of householdsThe vast majority of households in the bottom four quintiles would pay lower taxes  or receive larger refunds  as a result of the policy proposals Those in the lowest quintile would by far save the mostMy job is to present the right ideas Obama told NBC News in a preSuper Bowl interview broadcast from the White House If the Republicans think theyve got a better idea they should present them But my job is not to trim my sails and not tell the American people what we should be doing pretending somehow that we dont need better roads or more affordable collegeThe president will also propose approximately 18 trillion in deficitreducing measures over a 10year period Those measures which resemble past proposals would include about 160 billion in higher income and Social Security taxes resulting from immigration reform 400 billion in health care savings and 640 billion from taxes raised mostly by eliminating deductions without raising rates Additional savings would come from lower interest costs on the federal debtOne item that will still be in the printed version of the budget a tax on withdrawals from 529 accounts designed to promote parents savings for college tuition After that proposal was recently greeted with a backlash the administration retreated from the idea but it was too late to change the printed budgetObama administration officials have been trying to link various tax and spending changes to build support among members of Congress who might favor only one part of those pairingsTreasury Secretary Jack Lew recently said that the windfall resulting from taxing foreign profits accumulated by corporations should go to funding the infrastructure program The administration also paired increases in capital gains taxes and a new fee on the liabilities of big banks and insurance companies with proposals to expand middleclass tax credits and free communitycollege education And the administration has also said that it wants to break through spending caps for discretionary spending by equal amounts for military and nonmilitary programsBut making those tradeoffs will prove more difficult in Congress than on paperFor example the tax on foreign profits regardless of whether they are brought back to the United States is likely to face strong headwinds in Congress Obamas plan would impose an immediate tax of up to 280 billion on USbased multinationals at a time when manylawmakers are worried about pushing companiesto move their headquartersoverseasThe 14 percent tax would transition to a longterm 19 percent rate senior administration officials saidAs previously announced the budget will include an increase in the top capital gains tax rate to 28percent which would fall primarily on the richest 1 percent of AmericansWhat I think the president is trying to do here is to again exploit envy economics This topdown redistribution doesnt work Ryan said on NBCs Meet the Press It may make for good politics it doesnt make for good economic growthFor example Ryan called Obamas plan to expand the amount of inherited wealth subject to the capital gains tax a bad idea that would make it really hard for a family to pass on a family business to the next generationStill Ryan embraced some of Obamas proposals for cutting taxes especially for the struggling middle class Ryan has long endorsed expanding the earnedincome tax credit to childless adults for example saying it pulls people into the workforceWe really believe that we should reform the entire tax code for all people  individuals families businesses simpler the whole thing But it is pretty clear to us that the president doesnt agree with that on individuals Ryan said So the question is  which I dont know the answer to  is there common ground on aspects of tax reform that we think can help grow the economy  Well find outLori
