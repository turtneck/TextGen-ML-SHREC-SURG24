privatelyCaught on tape making shockingly crude comments about a married woman he tried to seduce Donald Trump declared in a midnight video I was wrong and I apologize Yet even as he did so he claimed the astonishing recording was nothing more than a distraction and argued his words were not nearly as egregious as former President Bill Clintons marital affairsIve said some foolish things the Republican presidential nominee said in a taped apology posted on his Facebook page early Saturday morning But theres a big difference between the words and actions of other people Bill Clinton has actually abused womenTurning to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton Trump accused her of having bullied attacked shamed and intimidated her husbands victimsTrumps 90second statement capped a jarring day that threatened to sink his presidential campaign and sent Republicans into a panic with early voting well underway in several states and a little more than a month until Election DayOn Friday afternoon The Washington Post and NBC News released a 2005 video on which Trump describes trying to have sex with a married woman He also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famousWhen youre a star they let you do it Trump says You can do anythingHe adds seconds later Grab them by the p You can do anythingWithin hours the shock of the video led to widespread condemnation from inside Trumps own party House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was sickened by Trumps comments while a onesentence response from GOPs chairman was devastatingNo woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner Ever said Reince Priebus who had stood by Trump through his past provocative commentsRyan added tartly that Trump was no longer attending a joint campaign appearance set for Saturday in Wisconsin Trump himself later said in a statement that he would be preparing for Sunday nights debate insteadOther Republicans painfully aware of Trumps possible impact on their own political fates were quick to chime in New Hampshire Sen Kelly Ayotte who is locked in a close race called his comments totally inappropriate and offensiveBy the time Trump posted his video apology three Republican members of Congress had called on Trump to abandon the race Among them was Utah Rep Jason Chaffetz who called Trumps words some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imaginePence was beside himself and his wife was furious according to a person familiar with their thinking That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the private discussionOn the tape Trump is caught on a live microphone while talking with Billy Bush of Access Hollywood The candidate is heard saying I did try and f her She was married He also uses graphic terms to describe the womans body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful womenAccess Hollywood said a recent Associated Press story about Trumps lewd behindthescenes comments as star of The Apprentice led it to dig through its archives and turn up the previously unaired tape It was recorded during a bus ride while Trump was on his way to appear in an episode of the soap opera Days of Our LivesTrump offered a halfhearted apology shortly after the video was released saying he was sorry if anyone was offended Only hours later after the scope of the damage became clear did he release the video statementTrump appears alone in the video and appears to be reading off a script He closes the video by suggesting hell raise Bill Clintons affairs again in the coming daysSee you at the debate he saysHillary Clinton seized on Trumps quotes from the 2005 video calling them horrific She said in a Twitter message We cannot allow this man to become presidentBut she had her own problems Friday with sudden revelationsThe WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta including some with excerpts from speeches she gave to Wall Street executives and others  speeches she has declined to release despite demands from TrumpThe excerpts include Clinton seeming to put herself in the free trade camp a position she has retreated from In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013 she said her dream was a hemispheric common market with open trade and open bordersTrump strongly opposes current US trade deals and insists Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street to reform itFridays developments came two days before Trump and Clinton are to meet in the second presidential debate with the Republican urgently in need of a strong performance After his uneven showing in the first contest public opinion polls have showed Clinton pulling ahead in nearly all battleground states some of which are already in the midst of early votingThere were plenty of other problems for Trump on what surely was one of the worst days of his twoyear drive for the White HouseHis advisers planned for him to spend a quiet Friday preparing for the debate and meeting with border security officials But the day was quickly consumed by a series of controversies including Trumps unsubstantiated claim about immigrants in the US illegally voting in the election and his questioning the innocence of five black teenagers exonerated in a 1989 rape caseThen there were new signs of unusual links between Trump and Russia For the first time the US publicly blamed the Russian government for hacking the Democratic National Committee and accused Moscow of trying to interfere with the American election Diplomats also told the AP that Russia had lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations over a UN officials condemnations of TrumpAlso in the mix Friday New questions about the Trump campaigns finances With roughly a month until Election Day the campaign has yet to schedule the 100 million in television advertising that his campaign boasted about just two weeks agoThe campaign has just half that amount scheduled and late this week shifted ad money around rather than increasing its overall investment suggesting a bit of pennypinching even as the clock winds down
