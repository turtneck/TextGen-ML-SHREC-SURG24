The Trump campaign is coming apart from the inside according to Regent Universitys Dr Gerson MorenoRiano and only the days ahead will show whether the candidate can bring people together not only in his inner circle but in the Republican PartyRegent Univeritys Dr Gerson MorenoRiano talks more about Trumps challenge with Evangelicals Watch aboveTrump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Monday amid reports of disagreements and infighting among the staffI think whats happened with the Trump campaign is I think its fractured itself internally MorenoRiano said I think that it is trying to meet a number of different objectives and keep a number of constituencies very very happy and it has been unable to do soAnd I think this is just symptomatic of a broader a more deeper problem within the American electorate particularly GOP evangelicals he addedMorenoRiano said the test for Trump is to find a way to bring his message under control and highlight the core concerns of GOP constituencies including evangelicalsThe dilemma has always been whether Trump himself has what Ill call the internal characterbased resources to pull this off he explained He is a man who is very direct very strongminded and the question is Does he have enough discipline both personally and professionally enough political discipline to pull this off I think at the end of the day its his question to answerThe decision to fire his campaign manager comes just one day before Trump is set to meet with hundreds of evangelical leaders in New York City to answer their questions and lay to rest the many concerns they have about his conservative  and Christian  bona fidesMorenoRiano listed abortion religious liberty and the Supreme Court as some of the most important issues he can address in the meeting including the question Are you truly someone who understands the evangelical mindset  those areas of deep concernBut he pointed out evangelicals themselves are not unitedThey need to bring unity to the table and I just dont see that he saidSince the 1950s evangelicals have failed to rally around any candidate and thats too big a burden to place on Trump he said I think theyre going to try to assess whether hes truly evangelical or not so its a big challenge for him to try and unite them around a common denominator Thats going to be difficult
