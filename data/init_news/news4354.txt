Its not really in character for Hillary Clinton to speak in terms of vivid imagery creative metaphors or striking turns of phrase But she did it over the weekend setting off a growing firestorm of controversy thats defined the week in politicsYou know Clinton said to a friendly crowd of wealthy donors this weekend to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic  you name itWith that odd turn of phrase  basket of deplorables  Clinton sent the mediapolitico ecosystem into a tizzy Donald Trumps campaign immediately took offense on behalf of his constituents and Clinton rather rapidly apologized But Trump has only escalated At a Monday night rally in North Carolina he accused Clinton of running a hatefilled and negative campaign and released a television ad built around the remarkAnd indeed while Clinton apologized for painting with such a broad brush as to call fully half of Trumps supporters deplorables her campaign is very much sticking to the core accusation that Trump is trafficking in bigotryMeanwhile some liberals think Clinton was wrong to back away from her numerical estimates Writers like the Atlantics TaNehisi Coates Slates Jamelle Bouie New Yorks Jonathan Chait and Voxs own German Lopez have all argued that as best as we can tell Clinton was if anything undercounting the quantity of irredeemable bigots in Trumps ranksThe multifaceted controversy touches on two of the more enduring taboos in American politics  frank discussion of racism and disparaging the electorate And it highlights the contrasting campaign strategies of the Trump and Clinton camps It started because the Trump camp correctly sensed Clinton had made a mistakeBut it continues so viciously because it covers terrain Clinton is fundamentally comfortable with  reenforcing a dynamic in which Trump like the television entertainer he is chases the evertighter loyalty of a minority  while Clinton seeks to paint Trump as broadly unacceptable to the general population that will be voting in NovemberClintons remarks came in the context of what was essentially a fundraising pitch She expressed her understanding of the fact that despite massive strides in achieving legal and social equality LGBTQ Americans still face many challenges You can get married on Saturday post your pictures on Sunday and get fired on Monday she said before launching into a litany of specific policy commitments shes made to the LGBTQ communityThen she pivoted to the askI know there are only 60 days left to make our case  and dont get complacent dont see the latest outrageous offensive inappropriate comment and think well hes done this time We are living in a volatile political environment You know to just be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic  you name it And unfortunately there are people like that And he has lifted them up He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11000 people  now 11 million He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful meanspirited rhetoric Now some of those folks  they are irredeemable but thankfully they are not America But the other basket  and I know this because I see friends from all over America here I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas as well as you know New York and California  but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures and theyre just desperate for change It doesnt really even matter where it comes from They dont buy everything he says but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different They wont wake up and see their jobs disappear lose a kid to heroin feel like theyre in a dead end Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well And what I hope is that in addition to your extraordinary generosity you will go to our website HillaryClintoncom or text to join at 47246 to see how else you can get involvedTo be persnickety about it the problem here is that Clinton is somewhat herselfThe upshot of Clintons quasiapology is to disavow the second claim while increasing her bet on the first Their strategy was boosted when Donald Trump Jr responded to the controversy by Instagramming a proTrump meme image featuring Pepe the Frog a common white nationalist symbol thats an explainer for another day but Olivia Nuzzis primer is a good place to start and then Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence went on CNN and refused to call former KKK grand wizard David Duke deplorable suggesting the current Republican Party is in a tough spot when it comes to white nationalistsClintons use of the phrase deplorables at the LGBTQ gala was not unique Earlier in the week in an Englishlanguage interview on Israeli television Clinton explained If I were to be grossly generalistic Id say you can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets There are what I call the deplorables And then there are the rest  lots of basically good decent Americans who she believes dont buy into the ugly side of what Trump is saying but who are so desperate to see change in American politics that they are willing to vote for TrumpWriting at Slate Ben Zimmer suggests that the basket of deplorables construction entered Clintons mind by way of analogy with the term parade of horribles which starting in the 1920s entered legal usage as a dismissive term for imagined concerns about a rulings negative effectsClinton is an attorney by training so Zimmer thinks she would be accustomed to that particular instance of nouning an adjectiveActual Englishlanguage use of deplorables as a term for a group of people however is quite rare though Zimmer did find Thomas Carlyle in 1831 writing that of all the deplorables and despicables of this city and time the saddest are the literary menIn general this type of linguistic term suggests to me the vocabulary of revolutionary France and indeed Carlyle wrote an early history of the French Revolution This vocabulary is probably most familiar to the mass audience from the musical and book Les Misrables with its invocation of the miserables as a term for the French urban poor But the revolutionary era also gave us Les Enrags the enraged as a term for a loose group of radical polemicists the SansCulottes the pantsless ie people who were the opposite of fancy pants for the Paris mob and other instances of nouning adjectives to give a name to social classesWherever Clinton got it from exactly it seems that in her LGBTQ gala she committed the cardinal political spin of mixing up two different spielsOne spiel the one that includes the phrase deplorables is intended to set the stage for a rhetorical pivot to the idea that the vast majority of Trump supporters arent deplorable She wants to say that they are mostly simply confused They are frustrated by the political status quo as is she and she hopes that if she wins she can deliver change and prosperity and win them over despite their doubtsThe other spiel is intended to recapitulate the themes of Clintons speech on Trump and the altright in which she denounces Trump individually for elevating a handful of extreme and hateful voices that early Republican leaders would have marginalized By crossing the rhetorical streams Clinton wound up saying that fully half of Trump supporters belong in the tiny basket of hateful extremists Whatever one makes of that as a question of demographics it doesnt make sense as a piece of political rhetoric which is why Clinton backed away from itIn the overwhelmingly white community of political journalists it felt natural to take the fact that Clinton had made a political error as the starting point of analysis and proceed from there But a group of writers disproportionately and not coincidentally composed of people of color wanted to press the point that Clinton was probably correct Her political error if there was an error was in breaking the taboo around saying that racial bias is a potent and widespread force in contemporary American lifeAs Lopez wrote for Vox public opinion polling strongly suggests that a great majority of Trump supporters hold unfavorable views of Muslims and support a policy that bans Muslims from entering the US Most of them support proposals that stifle immigration from Mexico and they agree with Trumps comments that Mexican immigrants are criminals And many  but not a majority  say that black people are less intelligent and more violent than their white peersIn particular a ReutersIpsos polling analysis of the GOP primary showed that Donald Trumps supporters stood out from backers of the other GOP candidates primarily in having highly negative attitudes toward nonwhite groupsWhether the deplorables are really half of Trumps current general election voters depends a bit on how you count but its at least a plausible estimateOne important nuance about this that liberals sometimes miss is that even though theres a lot of reason to believe racial hostility was key to Trumps rise theres very little reason to think that white racism in general is more widespread in 2016 than it was 20 or 30 years ago Rather as Lee Drutman writes separately for Vox the issue is that whites with strong racist attitudes turned much more sharply Republican following Obamas election including some who had previously been DemocratsBack in the 1980s and 90s the Democratic Party was already identified as being more aligned with black interests but the election of an actual black president combined with the growth of the nonwhite population kicked that identification into overdrive Racially resentful whites left the Democratic Party and Democrats decided they could build a winning coalition without them turning racial attitudes into a powerful axis of partisan conflictAaron Blake at the Washington Post immediately reacted to the news of Clintons remarks by asking Did Hillary Clinton just make her own 47 percent gaffeThis is a reference to a secret video recording released to Mother Jones in September 2012 that showed Mitt Romney at a closeddoor fundraiser explaining that there was a 47 percent floor on Barack Obamas supportThese remarks rapidly entered the lexicon of political operatives and journalists as a textbook example of a damaging gaffe so framing Clintons remarks as a potential new 47 percent moment is meant to play up their potential consequencesHowever just as the actual Hurricane Katrina did not have the political impact that the search for Obamas Katrina implies there is little reason to believe the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney Indeed in their excellent empirical account of the 2012 campaign The Gamble John Sides and Lynn Vavreck find that none of the many wellcovered gaffes of the 2012 season made much of a difference On a high level the economic fundamentals favored an Obama victory which is what happened and Romney proved more popular than virtually every GOP Senate nominee which indicates that at the end of the day the party chose a fairly effective messengerDespite what I wrote above it is widely believed in professional political circles that the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney so its natural for practitioners to leap at the chance to relive it Beyond that despite some recent tightening in the polls Trump is still losingIndeed he has been consistently losing from day one of this election At times hes made it close but hes never been ahead His best chance of winning would probably be some kind of economic calamity but its already midSeptember so hes running a bit short on time Remember though that in 2008 Obama was the beneficiary of a spectacular financial meltdown in October so anything can happen He has to try to do something and the big push around deplorables is indeed somethingBeyond that the basket of deplorables idea reenforces a longstanding conservative contention that liberal coastal elites fundamentally despise white workingclass Americans They view white workingclass culture as backward white workingclass politics as bigoted and white workingclass community problems as fundamentally less worthy of addressing than those of downscale black and Latino communitiesIn that sense the Clinton gaffe is reminiscent of Barack Obamas characterization of small town politics from the 2008 primary as full of people who get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or antiimmigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrationsIts worth noting however that Obama and Clinton were in a sense positioning themselves on opposite ends of the liberal spectrum of views on this matter Obama was essentially a premature proponent of the economic anxiety school of Trump Studies promoting the view that all of conservative cultural politics is a massive case of false consciousness in which residents of failing economic communities cling bitterly to guns religion and racism which in turn induces them to vote for mainstream RepublicansClinton meanwhile is offering the considerably more mainstream view that one reason many Americans are planning to vote for a man who says racist stuff is that a large share of those Americans agree with the racist stuff he saysWhile some critics see Clintons willingness to back away from her comments as a sign of cowardice or expediency the norm against attacking the other partys constituents has a real logic to itWe are all Republicans we are all Federalists said Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural address that marked the first peaceful transfer of power between political parties in American history If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat itThis can read as simply banal two centuries later but its worth considering it in context A losing party whose members fear the other party will persecute them if they lose and go into opposition has every reason to resist giving up power peacefully And a winning party that fears the other party will resist giving up power has every reason to persecute the losersPreventing a downward spiral of violence and civil conflict requires the winners to reassure the losers that they are not losing everything by giving up power Reassuring the losing partys supporters that they are not the targets of personal enmity on the part of the winning partys leaders is key to thatIts since become traditional for newly elected presidents to mouth some version of this message almost ritualistically And like many rituals its actually pretty important even if cynics are inclined to roll their eyes at it  the quadrennial reminder that we are Americans with policy disagreements not warring tribes is crucial civic glueWhat ties together the 47 percent the bitter clingers and the basket of deplorables is an apparent tradition of violating this ritual at fundraising talks  badmouthing not the opposition party but its voters in an effort to rationalize away the fact that the candidate wont be able to secure their votesThe fact that hes been consistently losing tends to obscure this but Trump has a lot of advantages in the 2016 race Clinton herself is very unpopular with the American mass public and she has a notoriously poor relationship with the American news media People with liberal public policy views but weak institutional and emotional attachments to the Democratic Party overwhelmingly voted for her opponent in the primaries and there is a real risk of them either not voting in November or else pulling the lever for Gary Johnson or Jill SteinThe nations overall policy mood typically shifts in the opposite direction of the incumbent president and the Obama years have been no exceptionIndeed in state after state  from New Hampshire to Nevada to Ohio to Florida and beyond  virtually every Republican Party Senate candidate is performing better than TrumpTrumps strong personal affiliation with racism is not the only reason this is the case but it is one of the reasons In the primaries Trumps willingness to court racial controversy worked in his favor because most Republicans take the view that discrimination against nonwhites is an overblown problem in the United StatesThis view commands overwhelming support among Republicans but few prominent Republican Party officeholders have championed it because its not popular with the public at large Trumps willingness to say and do things that other presidential contenders wouldnt say or do  that all Muslims should be banned from the United States or that Mexican immigrants are a physical threat to Americans safety  thrilled the primary electorate but alienates general election votersTrump by loudly and proudly defending white Americans from charges of racism intensifies his bond with his core base of racially resentful workingclass whites Thats an excellent strategy for pumping up rally crowds or building a hypothetical future media business but does nothing to help him reach the people  minorities and racially liberal whites  who find him disturbingBack during the heyday of Richard Nixons Southern strategy Pat Buchanan then an adviser to the White House wrote that by playing cultural wedge politics we can break the country in half and it will leave us with far the larger halfTrump who is backed by Buchanan and advised by the old Nixon hand Roger Ailes is employing the exact same strategy today  except 40 years of demographic changes mean hes left with the smaller half
