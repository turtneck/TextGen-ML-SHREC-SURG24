Africa  China  Hybrid Wars  United States By Andrew KORYBKO USA The most colonized and exploited continent in the history of the world is once more the center of global competition albeit this time the form of rivalry between the Great Powers has taken on a much more nuanced though no less intense form The US France and their unipolar allies want to retain Africa as their exclusive labor market and resource reserve for the foreseeable future both out of their own material selfinterest and with the added strategic benefit of depriving China and others of its economic fruits Contrarily China wants to integrate the worlds fastest growing economies and populations into the unfolding multipolar world order and give them a fair chance at succeeding in the global system The contrast between the Wests neocolonialism and Chinas liberating sovereignty couldnt be more crisp and its this opposition of diametrically opposed global strategies and development models that sets the stage for the grand proxy battle between the US and China over Africa Just as much as China needs Africa in order to maintain its steady growth rates into the foreseeable future and ensure its domestic stability so too does the US want to poach Africa from China in order to offset the structural sustainability of its number one rivals global leadership The nature of the Africanwide proxy conflict is that China is ardently working to finance construct and connect various infrastructural projects to one another in order to create a supraregional web of intermodal transport corridors that could then perfectly complement the maritime portion of the One Belt One Road New Silk Road global vision while the US is trying with equal fervor to seize control of key nodes along these transnational routes as well as strategically disrupt crucial portions in order to increase Chinas dependence on the unipolarinfluenced areas As the ultimate last resort however the US the world island in all the manners that it can be strategically understood as will pull out all the stops and unleash a scorched earth trail of Hybrid War destruction in its wake while it strategically retreats back to its selfsufficient Fortress North America as the final coup de grace in the African proxy war against China More than likely it wont ever get to that dramatic of an absolute point whereby the US fully retreats from Africa or totally destroys the continent with Hybrid War but realistically speaking therell likely be a blended development of scenarios that takes place in this heated theater of competition over the coming decades that integrates elements of both extremes China will predictably succeed in spearheading several ultrastrategic New Silk Road development corridors in Africa while the US will probably sabotage a few others and unleash a handful of Hybrid Wars to keep the existing ways indefinitely at bay from fully actualizing their envisioned geoeconomic potential Theres no surefire way to know with absolutely certainty what the future will bring but its possible to acquire an educated expectation about the structural and systemic manner in which the identified group of states will be targeted by USprovoked Hybrid Wars Even accounting for the possibility that some of the forthcoming examined scenarios might be naturally occurring in that they require little if any external pressure to instigate theres still a strong likelihood that at least some of the investigated possibilities will eventually occur to varying extents and that the geopolitical repercussions will indisputably impact quite negatively on China and the larger multipolar worlds grand position in the New Cold War This section of the book is organized in such a manner that Part I will describe Africas overall geopolitical situation highlighting the influence of hegemonic and institutional regionalism sometimes overlapping other times not over the continents affairs in order to clearly illustrate the preexisting advantages and obstacles to Chinas New Silk Road vision The subsequent chapters of the African Hybrid War research will then comprehensively examine the five separate categories of states and their pertinent neighbors that the author has already identified as being relevantly incorporated into the immediate thesis To remind the reader about what was described in Part III of the books Introduction and to expand upon the earlier presented paradigmatic map in a more structurally detailed manner the following cartographic revision will be henceforth used as the point of reference in guiding the research beyond Part I Key  Yellow  East AfricaEast African Federation  Blue  CentralSouthern Africa  Black  Failed State Belt  Red  Lake Chad Region  HashedThatched Lines  countries that will inevitably become involved in the targeted category states Hybrid War destabilization whether as an aggressive actor a passive victim or a blended mix thereof Schematic Observations A few comments need to be stated about the above map before commencing Part I of the African Hybrid War research Southern African Cone Firstly while its conceptually possible for all states in Africa or anywhere in the world for that matter to be afflicted by Hybrid War keeping in accordance with the axiom that this method of warfare is more often than not applied in disrupting multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects andor seizing control of them it can be surmised that the ones which could most radically revolutionize the continents geopolitical and geoeconomic would be most actively targeted and consequently receive the highest likelihood of some sort of Hybrid War destabilization in the coming future All of this will be described in detail in Part I but for now its enough to know that the identified states lay along the paths of Chinas presently constructed Silk Road routes or most probable forthcoming projects that it could pursue in achieving its grand strategic ends It should be clarified at this point that the Southern African Cone was not included in the above model because its economic corridors are relatively wellestablished and have already been utilized for some time by all sorts of Great Powers the West obviously included Furthermore concerning Namibia and Botswanas global connectivity via South Africa and to an extent even Zimbabwe and Mozambiques as well this mostly deals with the oneway transport of natural resources and less so with each respective states labor and market potential While each of these countries have a given role that they play visvis the Chinese economy none of them except for South Africa the hub through which most of their exports barring Mozambiques pass is integral enough to be targeted by their own Hybrid War Theoretically speaking disruptions in the regional periphery around South Africa could have a strategic effect in putting pressure on the countrys multipolar leadership and pave the way for a regime change scenario but given the rotten nature of corrupt South African politics its more expected that traditional soft coup means such as constitutional technicalities and simple Color Revolutions ie the antiRousseff coup in Brazil would be used in this instance Additionally the resources of the populationsparse countries of Namibia and Botswana and the general market and labor potential of South Africa are already pretty much integrated into the larger global economy so there are many existing unipolar stakeholders that would also be adversely affected by a severe disruption in or around their common point of African access The same cant be said so much about Zimbabwe and Mozambique the former rich in minerals such as diamonds and platinum while the latter is poised to become one of the worlds largest LNG exporters so its entirely possible that they may be targeted sometime in the future But even so it would be less in connection with Chinas multipolar transnational connective infrastructure projects than with their own individual standalone potentials in their respective fields thus strategically differentiating them from the other countries included in the present study although that is not to say that Hybrid War techniques would not be used  they probably would to a large extent Insular Importance In relation to the above the insular countries of Africa were also not included in the continental overview although they too play an important role in its evolving geopolitical paradigm Nevertheless because theyre island nations theyre not directly connected to anything else besides the high seas so although they may have valuable transit node status for China as an integral component of its Sea Lines of Communication theyre not as directly affected by the regionstretching Hybrid War study that was commenced for the mainland Nevertheless because each of them could play a pivotal role in influencing continental affairs if properly utilized by a partnering Great Power its worthwhile to very concisely comment on how they fit into the larger strategic equation that will be described throughout this work  Yellow  Canary Islands Spain This legacy holding allows Madrid to exert influence near the coasts of Morocco and Western Sahara both thought to be rich with fish and possible energy resources  Green  Cabo Verde formerly Cape Verde prior to late2013 The former Portuguese colony connects the North and South Atlantic and offers a strategic position near the mouth of the Senegal River as well as being positioned along an important oceanic route that the US and EU must take to access West Africa  Blue  So Tom and Prncipe Another former Portuguese colony this one is crucially located in the hydrocarbonrich waters of the Gulf of Guinea and in close proximity to the shoreline of Africas largest economy Nigeria  Violet  Comoros and the French overseas department of Mayotte These two locations are almost on top of northern Mozambiques LNGprospected Rovuma Basin and thus near what will likely become a major energy exporting area in the near future  Orange  Seychelles The former UKcolonized island chain lies along the route of approach that India and China must take in accessing the burgeoning East African marketplace and its for this strategically competitive reason that New Delhi has proactively sought to build a naval base and position some of its military units there in order to contain China  Unmarked  Mauritius and the French island of Reunion These two insular areas are not directly relevant to Africas mainland geopolitical order although they do acquire significance visvis Madagascar and the UScontrolled Indian Ocean bastion of Diego Garcia Transregional Conflict Overspill One of the most striking aspects of the reference map is that it clearly delineates the geopolitical fault lines where Hybrid War conflicts could easily become transregional Out of all of the areas designated by the map its most probable that the uncontrollably violent processes in the Failed State Belt of the Central African Republic CAR and South Sudan would be the ones to spread to other parts of Africa at least as regards the continents conflicts that are presently ongoing and not accounting for those that have yet to possibly erupt In particular CARs chaos could result in a refugee and militant overspill to Cameroon and Chad possibly leading to these respective Christian and Muslimled governments supporting their own confessional sides in the countrys unresolved civil war The misleading Clash of Civilizations narrative that would assuredly be purposely pushed by the Western mainstream media will be discussed later on when addressing the Failed State Belt but at this moment its useful just to be aware of the transregional infection potential that the CAR has in affecting the Lake Chad region Additionally the countrys domestic difficulties could also spread southward into the northern reaches of the CentralSouthern state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC representing a dual destabilization threat emanating from the CAR South Sudan can do something similar to the CAR in relation to the northern part of the DRC but possibly even to the Horn of Africa state of Ethiopia and the East African state of Uganda as well Tellingly these latter two states are actively involved in the conflict resolution process in South Sudan and are jostling against one another for influence there in order to carve out defensive buffers but also markets of course to protect themselves from this scenario It should go without saying that South Sudan was only brought into existence because it was forcibly severed from Sudan proper over a threedecadelong civil war period and the dynamic of antiKhartoum action hasnt stopped since Juba gained its independence in 2011 Therefore South Sudan represents an even larger asymmetrical regional threat than CAR does and their combined destabilization potential explains why theyre both categorized together as part of the Failed State Belt If their respective conflicts somehow merged into a transnational conflagration then that would represent a largescale Hybrid War threat in the geographic heart of Africa but the closest this has henceforth come has been the overexaggerated threat of Joseph Kony With reference to the Failed State Belts Hybrid War vulnerabilities and the transregionalization that its internal conflicts pose its little wonder then that the US exploited the mystique around this warlord in order to deploy a limited but very strategic contingent of its special forces to Uganda South Sudan DRC and CAR Almost as an afterthought but drawing on the tangent of transregional conflict overlap its topically pertinent to recall the Darfur Conflict and how this essentially was a proxy competition between the Lake Chad regional state of Chad and the extended Failed State Belt and somewhat Gulfinfluenced state of Sudan Its no longer as relevant of a geopolitical item as it once was during the mid2000s but it nevertheless still has the potential to reerupt in the future especially if the externally directed Sudanese dissolution process speeds up and makes headway in the states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan Lastly theres the realistic possibility that the US attempts to instigate a Hybrid War in Burundi could set off a chain reaction of destabilization in the eastern DRC Rwanda and by extent possibly up to Uganda and western Tanzania thereby making this geographically tiny state a disproportionately large trigger in upsetting the regional balance Although theres not yet an active conflict in Burundi anywhere on par with the scale of whats been raging in the CAR and South Sudan over the past couple of years this doesnt mean that one cant quickly develop if the entire state collapses under Hybrid War pressure and this disturbing scenario will certainly be explored more at length later on in the work Mapping out the expected transregional conflict overspill zones in Africa one can unmistakably see that its the entire UpperCentral Failed State Belt and the eastern portion of the CentralSouthern zones of Africa that are most at risk of this destructive process unfolding Accordingly this realization leads one to conclude that the DRC and the areas immediately abutting it provide the most fertile ground for the transnationalization of domestic conflicts which somewhat but not totally explains why the Second Congo War eventually came to involve states located far away from the actual battlespace and be nicknamed  Africas World War  To put it another way the Hybrid War vulnerabilities of the identified area combined with its obvious geostrategic centrality to the African continent makes it doubly capable of sucking countless states into a literal Black Hole of Chaos that could easily become the ultimate proxy war climax between the US and China To be continued Andrew Korybko is the American political commentator currently working for the Sputnik agency He is the author of the monograph  Hybrid Wars The Indirect Adaptive Approach To
