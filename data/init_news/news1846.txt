listing the campaigns national delegate candidates that were riddled with errors The flier displaying the Trump slate is supposed to be the tip sheet that party members use to fill out their ballot

election polling matchups with Hillary Clinton Kasich however had not won any delegates as of Saturday afternoonTrump campaign surrogate Stephen Miller a policy adviser to the real estate magnate drew a warmer response by opening his speech with a focus on the issue that helped carry Trump to the top of the Republican field ImmigrationDo you think the United States of America needs to secure its border Miller asked the crowd which shouted Yes in response Before even mentioning Trumps candidacy Miller went on to read letters from parents who he said had lost their children to illegal immigrant violenceThese Americans deserve a voice and I am going to give it to them today Miller said Its the powerless who are standing up behind Mr TrumpCruz dominated the intricate delegate selection process of the Colorado Republican Party and in this pivotal swing state a strong campaign organization has often made the difference between defeat and victory in the race to the White HouseIn this first round for the GOP Team Cruz once again proved its mettle  far outpacing the efforts of Trump and Kasich in the scramble for delegates at each of the congressional district gatherings this weekBy late Friday Cruz had swept all the available delegates in the states seven congressional districtsIn the final rounds of a messy and chaotic process Friday candidates vying to be one of Colorados delegates lined up along the walls of the ballroom at a Doubletree hotel here waiting their turn to deliver campaign speeches You have 10 seconds Go a party official barked as the first candidate stepped to the microphone Friday morningCruz volunteers seemed to be everywhere working the hallways where party members were crammed shoulder to shoulder among vendors peddling Cruz infinity scarves and Trumpstyle Make America Great Again hats In one corner a hot pink handwritten sign lured the undecided over to talk to Cruz Persuasion TeamsThe ballroom floor was littered Cruz campaign slates the tip sheets indicating which delegates are endorsed by the campaign Scattered across the room were glossy copies of the Donald Trump Voter Guide which is actually an antiTrump pamphlet distributed by one of the super PACs that is trying to defeat himAmid all the jostling shouting and chaos throughout the day Friday delegates aligned with Cruz won again and againTrump still maintains a wide lead over Cruz in the delegate count as the two candidates attempt to win the 1237 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nominationBut at a time when a contested convention looks increasingly likely there was palpable disdain for Trumps candidacy among the GOP faithful here His string of unforced errors nasty tweets and controversial policy statements in recent weeks have clearly taken a tollThe momentum against Trump at the activist level is just frothing said Josh Penry a former state senator who was Marco Rubios state chairman in Colorado There was a time when Trump could have competed in Colorado That time has long since passed  Among the activists the tide has turned against him dramaticallyTrump canceled a planned rally in Colorado this week as he focused his efforts on New York which holds its critical primary on April 19While Trump had some fervent supporters here at the state convention it was clear from the speeches delivered by delegate candidates that his appeal has worn thin for many Republicans  a testament to how much work the real estate magnate would have to do to unite the party if he becomes the nomineeAt Thursday nights gathering for Colorados 7th Congressional District 19yearold student Angel Merlos urged the crowd to elect him as a Cruz delegate to the convention because he said the nations values and morals were at stake if Trump were to become the Republican nomineeMorality is about how you act how you speak and how you carry yourself Merlos said in interview after his brief speech in Arvada I believe Trump has no morals because he lies about many things  He contradicts himself on everythingHe thinks he knows what will help the immigration problem but he doesnt Merlos continued He talks about a wall  that may do something I dont know exactly what it will do But he uses immigrants to help him build his buildings and yet hes so cruel and harsh when he talks about them Merlos saidDelegate candidate David Head ran as an unpledged delegate in the hope of serving as a voice against Trump on the floor of Republican convention in JulyI think he would be a disaster for both the Republican Party and the country said Head who owns an insurance business in Westminster Colorado with his sonHe confuses intimidation and bluster with straight talk and honesty I think he is antiwoman I think he is saying whatever he thinks will sell to get him a vote and I think hes playing on the fears and prejudices of a lot of people to intimidate people into voting for himLibby Szabo a Jefferson County Commissioner who won a slot as a Cruz delegate to the national convention said as a conservative she was troubled by Trumps recent comments about punishing women who have illegal abortions Trump backed off that position after an uproar from opposite sides of the political spectrumI like that he has started a dialogue in our party that we need to have I just dont see him as being consistent Szabo said One week he says one thing the next week he says another thingTrump campaign looks to step up operationBeyond the simmering antiTrump sentiment here Cruzs strength in the delegate chase in Colorado as well as states like North Dakota Louisiana and Tennessee has once again exposed the deficiencies of Trumps organizing operation which is scrambling to catch upTrumps allies insist there is still time to streamline their delegate wrangling operation and time to persuade even those who are resistant to his brand of politics at this momentOne Trump adviser said they entered the Colorado GOP contests with the expectation of winning zero delegates  and were pleased at the end of the day Friday that they had won two alternate delegates pledged to Trump in Congressional District 4This is just the beginning of a fourmonth process to convince the unpledged delegates and alternates in Colorado that Donald Trump means what he says hes going to make America great again said Davis a Coloradobased political consultant who joined the Trump team this week after Trumps campaign manager fired their Colorado state directorIn conversations with Cruz supporters Davis brushed off questions about Trumps poor standing in general election matchups with Hillary Clinton arguing that polls taken today six months away from November are garbage and will not be predictive on election dayAs for Cruzs clear organizational advantage Davis said Trumps team remains undauntedThis is an insiders game Davis said as he waited for the final votes of the day to be tabulated Nowhere in America including Colorado are insiders the heart and soul of the Trump campaignBut the question is whether Trump can get geared up in time to win that insiders gameHis campaign announced an expanded role this week for veteran GOP operative Paul Manafort who is managing convention activities for Trump  just as he did for the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan George HW Bush and Bob DoleBecky Mizel a Trump volunteer who was the former chair of the Pueblo County Republican Party in Colorado said she wasnt discouraged by Trumps poor showing in the stateCruz has a very strong organization here she said when asked about the obstacles her candidate had faced One of Cruzs most powerful allies she noted was the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners which circulated ubiquitous blue fliers touting Cruz delegates at every voting location this weekMizel credited the head of the group Dudley Brown who she counts as a friend with organizing the Cruz machine with the legislators who have decided to go and block Mr TrumpThe average person on the street is working or raising their kids  they arent political junkies like the caucus attendees are  and those are the people that are attracted to Mr Trump she saidAt the same time Mizel said she was relieved that the Trump campaign now seems to grasp the gravity of the task before them as they prepare for the possibility of a contested convention
