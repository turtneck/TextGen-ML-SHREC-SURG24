By Sarah Jones on Fri Oct 28th 2016 at 1208 pm Donald Trumps Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something hes offended by but its not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family Nope Pence is offended by a news report he hasnt read about their voter suppression efforts Share on Twitter Print This Post Thats offensive to me that kind of language Its not our operation Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBCs Morning Joe  Yes Donald Trumps Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something hes offended by but its not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family Nope Did Pence read the story No But hes offended So offended Because that kind of language is offensive Not the actual suppression of the votes but the language because its not our operation Watch here via MSNBCs Morning Joe  Twice saying he hasnt read the article Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read Thats offensive to me that kind of language Its not our operation Pence denied Donald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election And thats our message is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them That we can have government as good as our people again but its going to take all of us And you saw Donald Trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted Republican weve got an agenda to bring our cities back Pence is twice offended so super offended Ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way Frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign Its not the approach were taking Were reaching out to every American Pence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying Its time for Republicans to come home because Trump won the primary Mike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because Its just not what I see out there Trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched This explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together It turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the Republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise Both Pence and Trump dont care a whit about facts This is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context The context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts Pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters But why would he Pence didnt care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign Like Trump Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior Image Screencap via MSNBCs Morning Joe Mike Pence Is Fine With Trump Sexual Assault But Offended By Voter Suppression added by Sarah Jones on Fri Oct 28th 2016
