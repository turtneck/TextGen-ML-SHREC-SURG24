The legal authority for several national security programs expired at midnight Sunday and will not be renewed for at least two days after Senate Republicans leaders were unable to maneuver around Sen Rand Paul RKy a presidential candidate who followed through on a pledge to block an extension of the lawThe Senate closed a rare Sunday session without approving the only legislation that would have averted a lapse in the authority  a Housepassed bill that would provide for an orderly transition away from the most controversial program authorized under the current law the National Security Agencys bulk collection of call records from telephone companiesSpurred by the impending deadline senators voted overwhelmingly 77 to 17 to proceed with the measure Sunday a week after they didnt act on it before starting a weeklong recess But Paul under Senate rules was able to delay final passage of the bill until at least TuesdayOn Monday House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif reiterated his preference to have the Senate pass the alreadyapproved House bill without any amendments so that it can be sent to President Obamas desk quickly for its enactment into law I still think the best advice for them is to pass our bill McCarthy told reporters Monday morning He declined several opportunities to say whether he would accept any changes by the Senate which would require the House to reconsider the antiterror legislationThe best option for the protection of this country is to pass our bill he saidImmediately after the vote Paul took the floor and began his remarks by conceding that the measure he opposes would eventually pass But after he left the floor he declared victory because the House bill known as the USA Freedom Act would end the governments collection of phone recordsThe point we wanted to make is we can still catch terrorists using the Constitution he said Im supportive of the part that ends bulk collection by the government My concern is that we might be exchanging bulk collection by the government with bulk collection by the phone companiesDuring an earlymorning session on May 23 Paul used his powers under Senate rules to foil Majority Leader Mitch McConnells efforts to extend the existing authority for 60days a week or even one day On Sunday he objected to a proposal from McConnell RKy that would have extended lesscontroversial surveillance programs while the debate about the NSA telephone program continuedThat prompted a fiery floor speech from McConnell who accused Paul and other opponents of the NSA program of engaging in a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation prompted by the illegal actions of former NSA contractor Edward SnowdenWe shouldnt be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive said McConnell who has endorsed Paul for president and looked directly at Paul at times as he delivered his remarks He later made procedural moves to prevent Paul from offering amendments he has sought to the pending billThe NSAs collection of phone records began in secret after the Sept 112001 attacks and was later authorized also in secret by a court under Section215 of the USA Patriot Act  the provision that is set to expire The continuation of the program and its justification were revealed in 2013 by SnowdenUntil Sunday McConnell had resisted taking action on the House bill arguing alongside other key Republican senators that it would not do enough to preserve necessary counterterrorism capabilitiesThose senators on Sunday pledged to amend the USA Freedom Act to provide further assurances that intelligence officials will have timely access to the phone records even if they remain in private hands If the bill is amended it would go back to the House whose leaders have resisted any suggestion that more changes are needed further extending the lapse in authorityHouse Speaker John A Boehner ROhio on Sunday repeated calls for the Senate to pass the USA Freedom Act which would provide for an orderly transition away from the bulk collection program and cleared the House earlier this month by an overwhelming vote of 338 to 88AlQaeda ISIL and other terrorists around the globe continue to plot attacks on America and our allies Boehner said using an acronym for the Islamic State Anyone who is satisfied with letting this critical intelligence capability go dark isnt taking the terrorist threat seriously Id urge the Senate to pass the bipartisan USA Freedom Act and do so expeditiouslyCIA Director John Brennan said Sunday that the expiring programs are integral to making sure that were able to stop terrorists in their tracksI think that there has been a little too much political grandstanding and crusading for ideological causes that have skewed the debate on this issue he said on CBSs Face the Nation But these tools are important to American livesBrennan said terrorist elements are watching Congresss actions very carefully and are looking for the seams to operate withinThis is something that we cant afford to do right now because if you look at the horrific terrorist attacks and violence that is being perpetrated around the globe we need to keep our country safe he addedAfter the Senate adjourned Sunday White House press secretary Josh Earnest in a statement called on senators to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as shortlived as possibleOn a matter as critical as our national security individual senators must put aside their partisan motivations and act swiftly he said The American people deserve nothing lessThe USA Freedom Act is the product of months of compromise between Republicans and Democrats the administration and privacy groups Under it the NSA would stop gathering billions of call records  their times dates and durations but not their content Instead the phone companies would be required to adapt their systems so that they could be queried for records of specific terrorism suspects based on individual court orders The bill also would renew other expiring investigative powers that the FBI says are criticalBut Paul who wants the NSA program ended outright and a handful of senators who prefer that the NSA program remain as is effectively blocked action on the bill until Sunday McConnell had counted on the impending deadline to force at least a shortterm extension of the current law but Paul and a few other senators blocked any stopgapOn the Senate floor Sunday afternoon Minority Leader Harry M Reid DNev lambasted McConnell for a lack of strategy planning and open lines of communicationReid said the expiration of the Patriot Act provision cant be blamed on Paul who has long been an outspoken critic of overreach by the NSA Were in this mess today because of the majority leader Reid said Sunday My friend from Kentucky simply didnt have a plan Thats why were hereElizabeth Goitein a national security expert at New York University Law Schools Brennan Center for Justice said McConnell badly overplayed his handHe gambled that he could wait until the last minute and ram through a shortterm reauthorization of the Patriot Act and he lost she said By the time he tried to backpedal and move the USA Freedom Act forward it was too lateSome of the tools that are set to lapse are not controversial and have been renewed in the past President Obama said in his radio address They include the ability to seek a roving wiretap to keep up with suspected terrorists or spies who constantly switch out cellphones Another power  never used  enables wiretaps on suspected lone wolf terrorists who cannot be directly tied to a terrorist groupOne of the most important officials say is Section 215 That authority permits the government to obtain all types of records on an individual as long as they are relevant to a foreign terrorism or espionage investigationRep Adam B Schiff Calif the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence said national security officials may be able to rely on workarounds to the lack of Section 215 authority in some cases but not others Unquestionably theres going to be a disruption in the capabilities he said adding that the situation wont be optimal by any meansThe USA Freedom Act also would end bulk collection of records under other national security authorities including national security letters It would require the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court which meets in secret to declassify significant legal decisions and provide for an advocate for the publics privacy rights at the court which generally hears only the governments cases for a wiretap or other surveillance order And it would grant technology companies more leeway to report on the scale of national security data requestsThe bill also contains a sixmonth transition period during which the NSA would work with phone companies to ensure that they can set up their systems to quickly search for records and send them to the agencySince last weekend NSA winddown teams were placed on a hot standby which included contacting phone companies with a plan of action for shutting down the bulk collection The actual shutdown time is about eight hours officials saidPaul Kane and Katie Zezima contributed to this report
