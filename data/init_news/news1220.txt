More Catholics are in Congress than ever before  and in positions of power To each however Pope Francis visit means something differentPope Francis talks with President Obama after arriving at Andrews Air Force Base Sept 22 First lady Michelle Obama is shown at right This is the popes first visit to the United States and he will become the first pontiff to ever address a joint session of Congress ThursdayWhen Pope Francis addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday morning  a first for a pope  he looked out on the most Catholic Congress ever Just over 30 percent of the lawmakers are Roman Catholic with that group evenly balanced between Democrats and RepublicansWhile these members may be in agreement on religious affiliation theyre often at odds over politics Indeed Francis arrives at a time of great tension on the Hill as abortion politics plays out in a funding battle that could trigger a government shutdown next week And because of the popes views on climate change one Catholic lawmaker Rep Paul Gosar R of Arizona says hes boycotting the addressStill Catholic members are clearly honored  and excited  by the visit which has caused them to reflect on their faith and the message of this popular popeHere are the views of six Catholic lawmakers ahead of the address  their hopes for healing of the body politic and the effect of their religious beliefs on their outlook as legislatorsBefore he got into public service the congressman  originally from Boston  considered the priesthood He spent six years studying at a Catholic seminary He views the popes visit through the lens of history recalling his boyhood excitement over John F Kennedys presidential campaignI was an IrishCatholic Bostonian bursting with pride that one of our own was running for president Representative Connolly relates in an interview in the chandeliered speakers lobby of the House Imagine the chagrin I felt when I saw the headline of Time magazine and Newsweek at that time saying Can a Catholic be president and questioning our patriotism our allegiance to the countryIt was a shock that anyone would even ask such a question or that the nominee would have to answer it he saysConnolly describes the integration of Catholics and their religion in the great American mosaic as coming to full resolution with the invitation to Francis to address the Congress  and the nationCan other religions such as Islam make a similar journeyI think so America is always a work in progress he says Were about ultimately expanding rights Widening inclusivity Broadening opportunity And so acceptance and tolerance is in our future and more of itLike other lawmakers Senator Collins says her faith informs her political philosophy but doesnt dictate itFor instance she doesnt agree with the Catholic Churchs teachings on contraception and earlyterm abortions But unlike many of her Republican colleagues shes very glad the pope is sounding the alarm over climate changeIn her college days at St Lawrence University the senator took a course in Christian ethics She was surprised that a whole unit was devoted to the environment and stewardshipThe concept of stewardship and that we should leave the earth in a better condition for the next generation is very much a biblical concept she says Francis views on that reinforce her ownThis popes message of inclusiveness forgiveness mercy and love is so appealing to me as well as to lapsed Catholics and people who arent even Catholic says Collins who planned to bring her mother in her late 80s to the addressThe senator hoped that the pope appeals to our better natures that he preaches a message of unity and compassion for others that are less fortunate and that he challenges usOver the past 20 years Mr Boehner has invited three popes to speak before Congress One finally accepted It fulfills a dream for a man with Catholicism deeply anchored in himselfBoehner grew up in a big workingclass family  the second of 12 children He went to Mass before school and said prayers with his football teammates and coach at his Catholic high schoolPrayer is a big part of the speakers life When friends first suggested he run for Congress he declined But he went each morning for a month to church and prayed about itApparently after a month he got the answer says his former chief of staff Mick Krieger in a video about the speakerI have my conversations with the Lord They start in the morning early and they go on all day long You cant do this job by yourself Boehner has saidThe speaker had a oneonone with Francis before the pontiff took his place in the House After the address the pope moved out to the speakers balcony to greet the crowds on the West Lawn of the CapitolThe speakers office planned to record the visit from beginning to end at speakergovpopeI think theres a lot of interest in what the pope is saying his outreach to the poor the fact he thinks people ought to be more religious Boehner said in a video released by his office Hes got some other positions that are a bit more controversial But its the popeItalianAmerican the daughter of a politician father who was mayor of Baltimore and a longtime public figure herself the top Democrat in the House has an unusual history of encounters with popesThey started in the eighth grade when she visited Pope Pius XII in Rome with her family she recounts to reporters As a young woman she stood along the papal parade route in Manhattan thinking that Pope Paul VI had seen her waving She knows better now she laughsShe speaks reverently of Pope John Paul II whom she welcomed to San Francisco in 1987 and of the writings and speeches of Pope Benedict XVI whom she met in Rome in 2009 He is the author of her favorite encyclical God is loveThe visit of Francis to Congress is thrilling beyond words He will speak as a head of state she says so it wont be a blessing And yet Catholics such as herself are overwhelmingly almost emotional about the religious experience of his comingShe may not agree with the church on abortion  a woman has Godgiven free will in her view  but the popes commitment to focusing on the climate crisis is an act of worship Ditto on his emphasis on helping the needyTo minister to those needs is an act of worship to ignore those needs is to disown the God who made us Thats how I see his visitThe freshman lawmaker from Miami says that being a practicing Catholic makes me very hopeful about my role as a legislator and what Congress can do to help the neediest people in the country and the world His faith he says indirectly influences his policy decisionsRepresentative Curbelo is a product of a prestigious Catholic boys school Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami Its motto is Men for Others and he carried that interest into his work on the MiamiDade County School Board before being elected to Congress last year His focus in the House is on reforming poverty programs K12 schooling and higher educationCurbelo hoped that the pope would speak broadly about issues rather than make specific policy recommendations Highlight climate change A good idea Prescribe a carbon tax Not so good Call attention to the Syrian refugee crisis Please Ask the United States to take 100000 refugees That would be an inappropriate suggestionMore than anything Curbelo hoped Francis inspires us and shows us that we can work together here Being from a swing district the young congressman is taking a pragmatic approach to politics and is willing to compromiseMaybe the pope can help renew the Congress in some way he saysUp in his office on the third floor of the Capitol the secondranking Democrat keeps a Roman Catholic prayer book that belonged to his grandmother Its in Lithuanian She brought it with her and her three children when she crossed the ocean to immigrate to America in 1911In the old country the book was contraband because Russians were imposing their orthodox religion But in America said Senator Durbin on the Senate floor on Tuesday his grandmother could use that prayer book freelyThe senator told this story in a windup of praise for the Constitutions religiousfreedom provisions including that there is no religious test for elected office The broader context was Republican presidential candidate Ben Carsons recent comment that a Muslim should not be president as well as GOP antiabortion measures in the Senate this weekCaught as he exited the chamber Durbin commented on the effect of Catholicism on his outlook as a legislatorIve always tried to be thoughtful about the relationship between religion and democracy he said My values guide me but I want to make my decisions in the context of our Constitution and our democracyFrancis is wildly popular in his family and comes up at the dinner table with praise for his decision to dress in an unadorned way and to live in a simple apartment A humble life What an inspirationAs for the popes message Durbin smiles and laughs It is no surprise that all of us in political life are thinking about the political impact of his message Is it going to be more Democratic more Republican What is he going to say that makes us feel good or makes us squirmHis guess is that the pope will transcend the political and speak to larger issuesI have such faith in this man I didnt think I would live long enough to see another pope in the mold of John XXIII and Pope Francis has answered my prayers
