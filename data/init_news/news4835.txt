After Super Tuesday and Thursdays candidate brawl at the 11th GOP presidential debate lets call this latest experiment in democracy Stopby Saturday  four states in the northeast southeast and Midwest holding GOP primaries and caucusesA very big vote awaits the four remaining Republican candidates Tuesday in Michigan followed a week later by winnertakeall primaries in Florida and Ohio The field may be down to just two candidates after thatStill what transpired Saturday in Kansas Kentucky Louisiana and Maine mattered for these four reasons1 Trumps Fertile Ground One thing weve learned about Donald Trump and his flying circus there are plenty of states amenable to his message of economic frustration and rage against the political machineThat includes Maine which caucused on Saturday  and going into Saturday was presumably Trump TerritoryAfter years of economic decline in the form of a shrinking manufacturing base Down Easterners now face the question of whether to encourage immigration to meet growing employment demandsTwice in the last six years the states chosen the bombastic Paul LePage as its governor He has a Chris Christielike style of bully politics and a Trumplike way with political incorrectness for example earlier this year blaming Maines heroin epidemic on guys by the name DMoney Smoothie ShiftyThe point the seeds for Trumps success may have sown well before he plowed the 2016 fieldHowever in Maine Trump came a cropper though he did claim Kentucky and Louisiana for a split decision on the night Credit Texas Sen Ted Cruz with outorganizing Trump in yet another small ruraltinged caucusBut with primaries now taking over from caucuses are these latest returns a sign of coming attractions or just a bad stretch of road for the Trump Express2 Trumps a Frontrunner but not a Conservative Favorite All four states on Saturday had closed primaries or caucuses which meant that only Republicans were eligible to vote in Maine independents could do sameday GOP registration otherwise voters had to come over to the Republican side weeks before the polls openedBefore Saturday Trump had dominated in a February and Super Tuesday heavy with states employing open voting rules Iowa Nevada Alaska and Oklahoma were the only closed affairs  Trumps batted oneforfour you can expect talk about frontloading more closed primaries and minimizing if not eliminating open primaries when the GOP turns to 2020 planningThis made Kansas in particular worth watching as both Trump and Cruz worked the state hard immediately after Super TuesdayGoing into the Jayhawk caucuses this Trafalgar Group poll had Trump up by 6 points over Texas Sen Ted Cruz 352percent293 percent with Florida Sen Marco Rubio a distant third 166 percentGranted StopbySaturday polling was scarce but this time the swollen turnout in Kansas it was up by 50 percent over 2012 absent Democratic and independent crossovers didnt break Trumps wayBetween Trumps setbacks in Kansas and Maine and Cruzs victory in the CPAC straw poll we seem to have a paradox the Republican frontrunner is not a conservative favorite3 The Delegate Math The four states offered a combined 155 delegates  thats the same exact number as Texas 10 fewer than FloridaOhio and 17 fewer than California Moving forward fewer than 1600 of the GOPs 2474 delegates are still up for grabsSaturdays results arent a gamechanger but they do factor into a Trump march to the nomination thats long or short depending on the candidates ability to gobble up winnertakeall states and increase his delegate share in proportional outcomes that may increase if its just Trump and Cruz going at itAnd theres one other GOP convention equation Which would be   4 Adding Up To Eight The other reason why Kansas and Maine mattered for Cruz the GOP rule that only candidates with a majority of delegates in a minimum of eight states can qualify for the conventions nominating ballot the party can always change this before the nominating begins but to do so would be contentious  if not downright uglyCruz now has six such states The better question how the math adds up for Rubio and Ohio Gov John KasichIf Rubio wins Florida that brings his total to two states he won Minnesota on Super Tuesday If Kasich carries his home state that brings his total tooneHow does either candidate get to eight given that only 19 states remain after March 15Thats not the only question after Saturdays vote Here are four more Will this soon be a twoman race between Trump and Cruz Does that improve or harm Trumps chance of a firstballot win in Cleveland Do Rubio andor Kasich find redemption on their home turf The more Republicans flail about is Hillary Clinton suddenly living a charmed political existenceOn a Saturday night like March 5 when the race takes yet another odd twist those answers still seem far awayBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution where he analyzes California
