From an Indiana pizzeria to a Washington State florist America is grappling with a clash between gay rights and religious liberty But there are paths forwardWhy climate scientists are taking factchecking into their own handsArkansas state Rep Warwick Sabin D cheers with others protesting the states religious freedom law at the state Capitol in Little Rock last monthThe recent backlash against religious accommodation laws in Indiana and Arkansas is evidence of an increasingly bitter confrontation that is dividing the country and threatens to diminish the scope of religious liberty in AmericaThat is the conclusion of a number of scholars and experts who are urging the United States Supreme Court to consider this confrontation when it hears oral argument on April 28 in a potential landmark case involving samesex marriageOn one side are gay couples who are seeking the full benefits of equal treatment and dignity in a society that has long forced them into secondclass status or substantially worseOn the other side are religious conservatives who say they are being coerced to support andor participate in activities that offend their religious beliefsGay rights activists sensing an approaching victory at the Supreme Court are growing more aggressive in challenging the conservatives Many argue that any accommodation of religious beliefs in the context of gay rights would amount to a license to discriminateConservatives counter that the issue is freedom of conscience Religious accommodations traditionally have been provided to avoid the prospect of coercion against ones faith they sayIndiana and Arkansas were just the latest flashpoints in what could become a major turning point For the first time in US history a sizeable social and political force seems intent on sharply restraining or eliminating religious accommodations according to scholars who study religious freedomNow with the Supreme Court poised to take up samesex marriage some advocates are hoping the high court will offer muchneeded guidance to a nation torn between conflicting valuesSome states like Indiana have tried to address the religious accommodation side of the equation while others like Utah have taken a more comprehensive approach  addressing religion accommodations and antidiscrimination laws togetherThe stakes involve more than just whether samesex couples will be able to obtain a cake or photographs or flowers for their wedding Ultimately at stake is a quintessential requirement of life in America tolerance  on each side for the otherDouglas Laycock a leading scholar of religious liberty has staked out a middle ground position in the looming confrontation between gay rights and religious rights He calls his approach liberty and justice for allSamesex civil marriage is a great advance for human liberty But failure to attend to the religiousliberty implications will create a whole new set of problems for the liberties of those religious organizations and believers who cannot conscientiously recognize or facilitate such marriages writes Mr Laycock a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law in a friendofthecourt briefHe is urging the high court to recognize a constitutional right to samesex marriage And he believes states should pass laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientationBut he also favors robust religious freedom restoration laws at the state level and he is urging the justices to make clear in their opinion that religious conservatives retain broad freedom to live their lives in accord with their highest sense of morality and faithThe gain for human liberty will be greatly undermined if samesex couples now force religious dissenters to violate conscience in the same way that those dissenters when they had the power to do so forced samesex couples to hide in the closet Laycock saidThat is what will happen unless this Court clearly directs the lower courts to protect religious liberty as well as samesex civil marriage he told the justicesIn a speech last fall Sen Orrin Hatch R of Utah warned that religious liberty was under attack  and losing ground What was once a broad consensus here in the United States that religious freedom deserves special protection has recently crumbled he saidThe senator said that gay rights organizations and other advocacy groups were increasingly opposed to religious exemptions that a few years ago would have passed without dissentFrom my perspective it appears that now these groups believe they are winning the argument and therefore have no need for religious accommodations he said Whereas in the past they were willing to respect religious freedom now that they believe they have the upper hand they are ready to disregard religious liberty altogetherLast June the Supreme Court pushed back against this trend in a 5to4 decision upholding a religious accommodation for the owners of Hobby LobbyWithin weeks of that ruling 56 senators voted to overturn the decision and eliminate the accommodation The tally only four votes short of the 60 needed to advance the bill included every Senate Democrat and three RepublicansThe uproar sparked by Indianas passage of its own Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA in late March illustrates the potential high stakes for religious conservativesIndiana lawmakers and Republican Gov Mike Pence encountered a swift and unrelenting backlash by a wellorganized gay rights campaign supported by major business leaders Democratic governors and others threatening to unleash an economic boycott against an entire stateThose threats prompted Republican leaders in Indiana and Arkansas to quickly retreat and water down their religious freedom lawsIt also directed a national spotlight on the intersection of gay rights and religious rightsIt did so in part by focusing on an eighttable pizza shop in Walkerton IndMemories Pizza owner Kevin OConnor and his daughter Crystal said they would serve any gay or lesbian customers in the shop But they added that they would refuse to cater a samesex wedding because such a ceremony would offend their religious beliefs about marriageThe store closed for eight days after receiving threats and hate mail At the same time supporters on a fundraising website contributed more than 840000 to the shopThe action against Memories Pizza erupted not from an actual request for service from a gay couple It resulted from a hypothetical question from a local television news reporterOther wellknown cases involve a Colorado bakerys refusal to bake a wedding cake for a samesex marriage ceremony a New Mexico photographers refusal to photograph a samesex commitment ceremony and a Washington florists decision not to design floral arrangements for a samesex weddingIn each case the Christian business owner said the refusal was based on a sincerelyheld religious belief about the sanctity of marriage And in each case the courts ruled that the Christian owners violated laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientationIn the last year or so with the rise of the push for gay rights it is beyond wanting there to be an appreciation and respect for gay rights Now a segment of our population is seeking to have that right trump religious freedom said Jeffrey Mateer a lawyer with Liberty Institute in Plano TexasWe are seeing people of faith being attacked discriminated against and losing their jobs because they are speaking out on the marriage issue Mr Mateer saidAmong other cases cited by conservativesIt isnt just a matter of filing lawsuits or challenging the award of government benefits to certain businesses The broader campaign often portrays religious conservatives as bigots The strategy appears aimed at discrediting any claim to the American tradition of solicitude to religious adherents involving sincere matters of faithThats one way of looking at it says Yale Law School Professor William Eskridge Heres another way What counts as a religious reason is highly dynamicIn the 1960s opponents of the Civil Rights Act used the Bible to try to justify continued discrimination against AfricanAmericans notes Professor Eskridge a leading scholar of gay rights It didnt work The tactic was swept aside as the tide of public opinion embraced the principle of equality for AfricanAmericansEskridge suggests it is only a matter of time before gay rights become normalized across the country and religious and moral arguments are swept aside and discardedOne of the lessons of history unfortunately is that very often the line between bigotry and religious doctrine or religious faith is not a clearcut line particularly when public opinion is swiftly changing Eskridge saidThe professor predicted that as the nations rapid embrace of gay rights continues public norms and the law will also change So will religious practice and belief he saidWeve already seen it And we are going to continue to see it he said Some religions are literally changing their doctrineSo where does that leave the state of interplay between gay rights activists and religious conservativesThe legal landscape is a patchwork Even if the US Supreme Court rules in late June that all 50 states must issue marriage licenses to samesex couples only 22 states currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientationThat means that gay men and lesbians are vulnerable to discrimination in 28 statesAmong those 28 states Indiana and ArkansasSome observers view the recent ugly flareup in the culture war in both states as a missed opportunityHad officials in Indiana and Arkansas sought to pass their new religious freedom restoration laws in concert with new legal protections for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT community the energy invested in threatened boycotts and waging heated protests would have been expended instead on celebrations of leadership and progress these analysts sayRobin Fretwell Wilson knows how to get this done She was an adviser to the effort do it in one of the most conservative states in AmericaAt a time of great change people have to know what the rules are says Ms Fretwell a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law The idea is to get the relevant parties around a table and negotiate a set of rules acceptable to allIt employs a common sense approach If you are sensitive to our concerns well be sensitive to yoursThe result was the Utah Compromise It passed the Republicancontrolled state legislature and was signed into law last month with the blessing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday SaintsWhen it takes effect on May 11 it will mark the first time in state history that gay men lesbians bisexuals and transgender people have specific legal protections prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment because of sexual orientation or gender identityUtah gets it right on every single score Wilson says They did something good and decent for the LGBT community but they did not make it come at the expense of religious believers I think thats hugeThe workplace protections apply to all businesses with 15 or more workers including state agencies local governments and school districts It does not apply to religious organizations religious schools and whollyowned subsidiaries of religious organizations It also exempts the Boy ScoutsThe compromise has its critics Some say it does not go far enoughFor example the Utah Compromise does not address the thorny issue of public accommodations  whether a small business such as a bakery wedding planner or florist must participate in samesex wedding ceremonies if they have religious objectionsBut within the compromise are the seeds of a solution to that problem as well Wilson saysThe agreement establishes a right for any qualified person in Utah to get married at a county clerks office But under the agreement no official in any clerks office can be fired or otherwise forced to officiate a samesex wedding if they have a religious objectionInstead every clerks office in Utah  including in rural counties  must have a process that provides a willing celebrant to any samesex couple seeking to marry at the clerks officeThere is a term for this kind of approach It is called religious accommodationWilson says she is developing a similar model that may offer a compromise for religious business owners who are worried about getting sued over their religious objections to participating in a samesex weddingIn the medical field there are recognized abortion conscience clauses that exempt certain medical professionals from involvement in that procedure because of their religious beliefs In effect someone else takes their place through a prearranged processWhen that happens no one says you are being mean to the lady who wants an abortion Wilson said We dont even think about it that wayThe same prearranged process could be set up at a Christianowned bakery or flower shop In essence those parts of the business serving samesex marriages would be handled by workers inhouse or by contract who do not have a religious objection to such ceremoniesThe idea that you show up in the moment and get refused by a religious person is really really hard to choke down I dont think the gay rights people are going to be able to bargain to that Wilson says And the idea that you suddenly let gay rights run roughshod over every religious person in the community is also hard to choke downShe adds So if we can find a model where everybody gets served and religious people dont have to leave those jobs I think wed do a really good thingWilsons approach holds great promise particularly in conservative red states looking for solutions or to avoid economic boycotts But not everyone is ready and willing to negotiate a ceasefire in the culture warThats where the concept of a RFRA may become essential as an increasing number of cases move into the courtsMuch of the controversy last month in Indiana and Arkansas was premised on misinformation and misconceptions on both sides of the debate according to legal expertsSome conservatives were under the false impression that a RFRA would offer guaranteed protection against lawsuits by samesex couples And some gay rights activists argued incorrectly that the Indiana RFRA would be a license to discriminateUncritical press reports parroted this line over and overThe debate kicked up gobs of dust and fury but shed almost no light on the real purpose of passing a state RFRA analysts sayI dont think it is right to view RFRAs in light of gay rights specifically because RFRA has always protected religious minority groups says Eric Rassbach a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in WashingtonHe says RFRAs have helped protect a Santeria priest seeking an exemption from a local ordinance outlawing goat sacrifices it is being invoked to help native Americans who need an exemption from federal law to possess eagle feathers The law has been used to uphold the right of a Sikh accountant to pass through security at a federal building in possession of her religious kirpan a small dull dagger that is as symbolic to Sikhs as the cross is to ChristiansIn January the US Supreme Court applied a RFRAlike statute and ruled that the Arkansas prison system must allow a Muslim inmate to grow a short beard in compliance with his religious faith That ruling was 9 to 0If people want to go around stopping RFRAs or neutering RFRAs the people who are going to be hurt will be the religious minorities  the Sikhs the native Americans the Muslims the Orthodox Jews Mr Rassbach saidI think that is a real problem for our society because we are not getting less religiously diverse we are becoming more heterogeneous he saidThe purpose of passing a religious freedom restoration law is not to grant a right to engage in antigay discrimination Rassbach and other analysts say The law isnt designed to work that way and it hasnt worked that way in practiceNo religious exemption sought under RFRA has ever been granted in any case involving alleged sexual orientation discriminationThat doesnt mean there wont be an accommodation granted in the future But these results suggest RFRA is no license to discriminateThe real license to discriminate in Indiana was the states lack of a statute prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation That is a license to discriminate legal experts sayIn contrast the purpose of a RFRA is different The law is designed to allow a neutral judge to weigh the competing interests when a law that is applied broadly imposes a significant burden on sincerelyheld religious beliefsWhen that happens there must be proof that the provision advances a compelling government interest and that it is tailored to do that in a way least restrictive of religious faithThis approach was not dreamed up in some backroom legislative chamber in Indiana It is a legal standard that was recognized as a constitutional guarantee for the entire country and was enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990Despite this broad constitutional protection of religious conscience religious adherents didnt always prevail In 1983 Bob Jones University argued for a religious exemption from a federal regulation prohibiting taxexempt organizations from discriminating on the basis of race The university had a rule barring interracial datingThe high court held that the government had a fundamental  and overriding  interest in ending any vestige of racial discrimination in educationThough the decision did not diminish the importance of religious accommodations in general it put religious adherents on notice fighting discrimination is a compelling government interest that can outweigh a claim for religious accommodationThen in 1990 the high court abruptly changed course The justices were presented with a case involving two drug counselors who were fired for their sacramental use of peyote as members of the Native American Church They were also denied unemployment benefits The two sued the state of Oregon seeking a religious accommodation that would allow them to collect the benefitsA divided Supreme Court ruled that the free exercise clause of the Constitution did not authorize a religious exemption from laws of general applicabilityThis was a major constitutional shift that made it more difficult for religious adherents  particularly those in minority religions  to seek accommodations from general laws that imposed significant burdens on their faithCongress responded in 1993 by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act It passed the House by voice vote and the Senate 97 to 3 The statute reestablished the same national legal standard of religious accommodation that had been enforced by the high court from 1963 to 1990Then in 1997 the Supreme Court ruled that the federal RFRA only applied to federal law not at the state or local levelIn response to that decision states began enacting their own religious freedom restoration acts Currently 22 states  including Indiana and Arkansas  have enacted RFRAsIn addition 11 other states have interpreted their state constitutions as providing guarantees of religious liberty consistent with the standard enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990Thus 33 of the 50 states have in some fashion embraced the broad concept of offering religious accommodationsHow the approaching legal battles will play out is uncertainSome cases will be preempted by automatic exemptions from discrimination laws that have long been granted to religious organizations and affiliated groupsBut the stage is now set for litigation over public accommodations related to samesex marriages Ironically most of those cases will be litigated not in conservative red states but in liberal blue states that have already accepted gay marriage Thats because there are no antidiscrimination statutes in most red states that would allow a samesex couple to file a lawsuitIt is that middle area of the small business individual proprietorship the mom and pop enterprise thats the area where this is going to bite Eskridge says That is in play and it is highly dynamicThe professor sees the legal landscape shifting against accommodation claims Accommodations that would have been given in courts 10 years ago are not going to be given in courts 10 years from now or even today in some casesIn courts across the country the critical question is going to be whether it is possible to strike a balance between discrimination and religious accommodationWhat is at stake is more fundamental than cakes and photographs and flowers It is whether at some point politicians and judges begin to look for ways to defuse disputes so that both sides can start moving forward together toward tolerance and acceptanceThe alternative is more Indianastyle protests and boycottsWhat was so devastating for the religious community was to be seen as saying we have to have our religious freedom so that we can knock down your gay rights When they say stuff like that  which is just ugly  they lose Wilson saysBut on the other side if the gay rights guys say I have to run you out of business in order for me to win that is just as ugly and they will lose she says
