Washington CNN A federal appeals courts ruling on Thursday that the National Security Agencys bulk collection of telephone metadata is illegal has split the 2016 presidential field making unlikely allies of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the Republican Partys most conservative membersSens Rand Paul and Ted Cruz lauded the decision as a win for Americans personal freedoms and though Clinton didnt weigh in specifically on the decision she did suggest her support with a tweet endorsing an NSA reform billBut the other two 2016 contenders in the Senate  Sens Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham  expressed opposition to the move The split in the Senate is likely to complicate the upcoming effort to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act which authorizes such surveillance programs and expires at the end of the monthThe decision is already sparking a fierce debate within the 2016 field Heres a roundup of whos offered support whos expressed opposition and whos keeping mum on the controversial programThe Florida Senator is an outspoken defense hawk and has long expressed support for the program He said Thursday in a statement that it would be a bad move to eliminate the NSA surveillance programThe solution is not to get rid of a program at a time when we know that the risk of homegrown violent extremism is the highest its ever been Rubio saidPaul praised the decision as monumentalfor all lovers of liberty and issued a series of laudatory tweets and offered discounted campaign swag in honor of itTo celebrate todays ruling weve lowered the cost of the NSA spy blocker in our campaign store Paul tweetedI guess its gratifying that the courts are beginning to recognize the problem We are anticipating and eager for this to get to the Supreme Court he told BreitbartAnd he took a veiled jab at potential primary opponent Jeb Bush tweeting Sadly one GOP candidate thinks the NSAs violation of your rights is very important Tell him hes wrongBush hasnt yet weighed in on the courts decision but has been a strident supporter of the NSA program in the past Pauls tweet was in fact a reference to Bushs policy speech in April during which the former Florida governor reiterated his support for government surveillanceThe New Jersey governor said in the face of the court challenge that the NSAs collection of telephone data should continue and called for Congress to extend the program without delay He also warned against rolling back any such programs especially during this really dangerous timeI believe there can be appropriate oversight by Congress and people in the Justice Department who can oversee whether the law is being followed or whether the law is being violated Im not one of those folks who believe we should bring our guard down especially during this really dangerous time he said Friday during a breakfast discussion in New HampshireIt can be done in a way thats not only constitutional but also protects national securityChristie also called for reauthorizing the PATRIOT ActI know how important a tool the PATRIOT Act is to help to prevent terrorism to intercede before a terrorist act occurs Im not someone whos going to back away at all from the Patriot Act he saidCruz was quick to offer support for the decision declaring in a statement that the courts ruling today confirms what the American public already knew The National Security Agencys data collection program went too far in collecting the phone records of Americans He also called for the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act a bill that would reform the NSA and effectively end the surveillance program by giving telephone companies full control over phone recordsThe USA FREEDOM Act ends the NSAs unfettered data collection program once and for all while at the same time preserving the governments ability to obtain information to track down terrorists when it has sufficient justification and support for doing so Cruz saidIt would be pretty hard to diminish this program right now based on a court ruling thats not binding he saidClinton didnt comment on the decision specifically but did endorse the USA Freedom ActCongress should move ahead now with the USA Freedom Acta good step forward in ongoing efforts to protect our security  civil liberties she tweetedSanders another Democratic presidential contender tweeted that the NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional mannerHe lauded the ruling in a statement that emphasized the need for balance between Americans security and their personal freedomsWe can protect the country from terrorism without living in an Orwellian world where the government and private corporations know every telephone call that we make every website we visit everyplace we go he said in the statementThe Maryland governor hasnt yet weighed in on the court decision but said last month he hopes the debate over reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act creates an opportunity to have a conversation about whether or not weve struck the right balance hereI dont think that we should sacrifice our privacy for our security We have to find a way to protect them both he said thenThe rest of the fieldBen Carson Mike Huckabee and Rick Perry havent yet weighed in though theyve been generally critical of the program in the past Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and former HewlettPackard CEO Carly Fiorina havent offered clear opinions the program and havent yet weighed in on the decision
