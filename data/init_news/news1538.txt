Read the Open Letter By Former Federal Prosecutors Criticizing James Comey Posted on Oct 31 2016 FBI Director James Comey  Flickr  CC 20  Editors note This open letter was published on Hillary Clintons website Sunday night in response to FBI Director James Comeys recent announcement regarding the agencys email review  See the full list of signatories on her website here  Sunday as reported by the Associated Press  a group of nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and highranking Department of Justice officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations including former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Deputy AG Larry Thompson issued the following joint letter expressing serious concerns over FBI Director Comeys departure from longstanding department protocols As former federal prosecutors and highranking officials of the US Department of Justice we know that the impartiality and nonpartisanship of the United States justice system makes it exceptional throughout the world To maintain fairness and neutrality federal law enforcement officials must exercise discipline whenever they make public statements in connection with an ongoing investigation Often evidence uncovered during the course of an investigative inquiry is incomplete misleading or even incorrect and releasing such information before all of the facts are known and tested in a court of law can unfairly prejudice individuals and undermine the publics faith in the integrity of our legal process For this reason Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on the existence let alone the substance of pending investigative matters except in exceptional circumstances and with explicit approval from the Department of Justice officials responsible for ultimate supervision of the matter They are also instructed to exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election because as official guidance from the Department instructs public comment on a pending investigative matter may affect the electoral process and create the appearance of political interference in the fair administration of justice It is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees Many of us have worked with Director Comey all of us respect him But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department officialRepublican or Democrathas on the eve of a major election issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the elections outcome yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new Director Comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing Department policy and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections Moreover setting aside whether Director Comeys original statements in July were warranted by failing to responsibly supplement the public record with any substantive explanatory information his letter begs the question that further commentary was necessary For example the letter provides no details regarding the content source or recipient of the material whether the newlydiscovered evidence contains any classified or confidential information whether the information duplicates material previously reviewed by the FBI or even whether or not the material may be significant Perhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Departments widelyrespected nonpartisan traditions The admonitions that warn officials against making public statements during election periods have helped to maintain the independence and integrity of both the Departments important work and public confidence in the hardworking men and women who conduct themselves in a nonpartisan manner We believe that adherence to longstanding Justice Department guidelines is the best practice when considering public statements on investigative matters We do not question Director Comeys motives However the fact remains that the Directors disclosure has invited considerable uninformed public speculation about the significance of newlydiscovered material just days before a national election For this reason we believe the American people deserve all the facts and fairness dictates releasing information that provides a full and complete picture regarding the material at issue
