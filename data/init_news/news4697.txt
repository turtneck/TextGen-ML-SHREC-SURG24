Lets get a few things straight about the delay in confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general Its outrageous It also has nothing to do with her race or genderContriving prejudice where none exists demeans the importance of fighting discrimination And it demeans those who drop such ugly hintsTo wit SenDick Durbin DIll who complained that the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar  this after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy held her nomination hostage to action on a stalled human trafficking billOh please Im not in the habit of agreeing with Rich Lowry of National Review but opposing Lynch is no more racebased than Durbins own opposition to the nomination of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of stateThats not to say that lawmakers are biasfree This is impossible to prove but to watch Attorney General Eric Holder testify before Congress makes me think that at times he is treated with less respect than if he were whiteBut relations between Holder and congressional Republicans are badly frayed it is in those fraught moments of tension that prejudices perhaps subconscious emerge There was no such atmosphere during the Lynch hearingsSame with gender Hillary Clinton raised the subject last week tweeting Congressional trifecta against women today  Blocking great nominee 1st African American woman AG for longer than any AG in 30 years  Please again Id like to see one smidgen of evidence that Lynchs gender is working against herSo the Lynch delay is about ideology But not her ideology  President Obamas And the Justice Departments The case against Lynch is the case against the presidents executive action on immigration and the fact that Lynch said she agreed with the Justice Departments analysis of their legalityWhich raises the question How could Republican senators reasonably expect Lynch to take a different view How could they expect Obama to name any nominee who differed If they cant what is the point  other than as a vehicle for expressing pique  of opposing LynchTheres a legitimate argument about whether the presidents actions went too far I dont blame Republicans for chafing at them or for being frustrated at their inability to do much in responseHolding up spending bills in a fit of temper over Obamas immigration moves is bad for the country and selfdestructive The courts represent an unlikely avenue of relief So the Lynch nomination offers one tempting way for Republicans to vent frustration with what they view as executive overreachThe Senate shouldnt confirm any attorney general nominee from whatever party of whatever race ethnicity or gender identification who believes the president can rewrite the nations laws at will Lowry wrote in a column for Politico  blithely overstating Lynchs and Obamas positionLowry acknowledged that the ironic result of his approach would be to leave the muchreviled Holder in place But theres no helping that he added The principle that would be upheld is the Senate not giving its imprimatur to an attorney general who thinks its lawmaking role is optionalWhat about the principle of the Senate deciding that its confirming role is optional If senators have a serious problem with the presidents selection for a particular job  if they believe the nominee lacks experience is temperamentally unsuited or is ideologically too far outside the mainstream  they have the constitutional right to reject the choiceBut thats not Republicans beef with Lynch Their beef with Lynch is that she is Obamas nominee and shares his viewsIn the end whenever that finally comes Lynch appears to have enough Republican support to squeeze through  perhaps with Vice President Biden casting the deciding vote This lets Republicans have their tantrum without being responsible for the logical consequences of their positionLast week McConnell refused to bring up Lynchs nomination while the Senate was stalemated over a human trafficking bill and abortion politics This week the Senate is busying itself debating a budget that will never be put in place Then it takes two weeks offBy which point Lynchs nomination will have languished for more than five months Enough Its long past time for the Senate to do its job however grudginglyRead more from Ruth Marcuss archive follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook
