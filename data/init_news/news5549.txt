The intentional winner of the Fox News Republican debate Thursday night was Marco RubioHe had a really good debate He was substantive and sharp clear and polished He came across as likable He came across as someone who knows foreign policyThe accidental winner though was Ted Cruz The debate got off to a rough start with CruzThe other candidates were piling on the man in the center seat His campaign had expected itHis engagement with the moderators made him seem less likableBut the moderators unintentionally and accidentally solidified Cruzs support for him and got fence sitters between Trump and Cruz off the fenceWhat about ObamaCare the moderators asked Cruz He wanted it repealed and replacedWhy does Washington hate you they asked Cruz That question let Cruz give a dissertation on his efforts to clean up and shrink WashingtonThen there was the issue of the ethanol lobby that gave Cruz a minute of clear answers on level playing fields and ending government subsidiesCruz could not have asked for a better set up of questions at a time when his favorables are vastly higher than other Republicans in WashingtonWithout Donald Trump the tone of the debate was lower energy but filled with much more optimismThe Megyn Kelly Accountability Project was a welcome addition to the debate and forced the candidates to own their records or flipflopsJeb Bush had a far better night without Trump there I was surprised there was not a clash with Kasich given his rise in Iowa But Bush held his own and Kasich annoyed as alwaysThe ultimate winner however was Megyn Kelly After days of being beaten up by the Trump forces she showed she is a sharp credible journalist who is willing to ask tough questions and hold the candidates accountable for their prior statementsThe video montages and prior records of the candidates were fair game and she forced them to answerOverall though the debate had lower energy than prior ones it was wonderful to have the candidates have to own their recordsAs for losers that had to be Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum who had their kneel before Zod moment showing up at a Donald Trump rally where everyone treated Donald Trump as the conquering heroIt was like conquered kings being traipsed before RomeTheir campaigns are overErick Erickson is a Fox News contributor He is host of Erick on the Radio and foundereditor of The Resurgent He is the founder of RedStatecom Follow him on Twitter EWErickson
