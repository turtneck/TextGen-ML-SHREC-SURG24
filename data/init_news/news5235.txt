Cast Your Vote Whose Foreign Policy Position Do You Prefer Posted on Oct 28 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate Screen shot via YouTube  We are only 10 days away from Election Day and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes Over the past week WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage Donald Trump meanwhile continued to close in on Clinton in the polls The week began on a somber note when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76 His original Truthdig reports  which have been reposted throughout the week reinforce the importance of an antiwar foreign policy Our systemspolitics media cultureare totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right he said in 2016  Many of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East Although written over a decade ago Haydens words of caution still ring true as in this piece on a potential US withdrawal from Iraq  Many activists are learning for the first time or perhaps all over again what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war All the wasted lives can never be brought back all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed true enough But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk why should ending it be any different It may still be far from over with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon As Hayden warned US involvement in the Middle East is far from over and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena Russia Earlier this week Trump stated that Clinton if elected would cause World War III with Russia Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that superpowers dont fight one another in the nuclear agethey fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan Cole asserts that Clintons experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike Others however dont feel too positive about a potential Clinton administrations foreign policy Clinton has proposed a nofly zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan alarming security experts  As Lauren McCauley writes reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration will likely usher in a more aggressive bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond She quotes Greg Jaffe The Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House the Washington Posts White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports One such study published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress CAPwhich is run by president Neera Tanden policy director for Clintons presidential campaignrecommends the next administration step up its military engagement amid a more proactive and longterm approach to the Middle East But what of Trumps foreign policy Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trumps assertions on the US presence in the Middle East he doesnt have the slightest idea of what he is talking about Truthdigs own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week labeling Trump a threat to democracy Trumps scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency Boyarsky writes Added to that is his racist rabblerousing against Muslims those of Mexican descent and other immigrants And of course the discussion on foreign policy doesnt solely revolve around just two presidential nominees This week NATO urged all allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russias borders in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called shortsighted There is also an inherent problem with the American military spending says William D Hartung director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy Through good times and bad regardless of whats actually happening in the world one thing is certain in the long run the Pentagon budget wont go down he writes As long as fear greed and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending no matter who is in the White House substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable So although there are broader deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact Given the
