Leaders of Gulf nations unnerved by Washingtons nuclear talks with Iran and Tehrans meddling across the Mideast look to President Barack Obama to promise more than words and weapons at Thursdays Camp David summitThey want commitments from Obama that the United States has their backs at a time when the region is under siege from Islamic extremists Syria continues to unravel Iraq is volatile and Yemen is in chaosI think we are looking for some form of security guarantee given the behavior of Iran in the region given the rise of the extremist threat We definitely want a stronger relationship said Yousef Al Qtaiba the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United StatesIn the past we have survived with a gentlemans agreement with the United States about security I think today we need something in writing We need something institutionalizedWhat are the expectations for Obamas meetings with Gulf Cooperation Council countries  Saudi Arabia Kuwait United Arab Emirates Qatar Bahrain and OmanWeapons sales A renewed call for a coordinated missile defense system More joint military exercises Better cooperation on cybersecurity as well as maritime or border security Making the countries defense systems work in concertI dont believe theres a single GCC country that doesnt think a defense shield for the region is a bad idea I think everyones on board Qtaiba said The challenge is how do you turn on a regional defense system when different countries are purchasing different equipment and at different paces How do you link it How do you get the radars to talk to each otherA highlevel Saudi official told The Associated Press in Riyadh that his country wants a defense system and military cooperation similar to what the US affords Israel The official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to disclose details of the Saudis wish list at the summit said they also want access to hightech military equipment missiles planes and satellites as well as more technology and training cooperation with the USThe US and five other nations are working to finalize a deal intended to stop Irans pursuit of nuclear weapons in exchange for easing penalties that are choking the Iranian economy The White House says the Gulf countries would be better off with an agreement that blocks Irans path to an atomic weaponBut the nuclear deal is not the only source of uneaseArab allies feel threatened by Irans rising influence and they fear a nuclear pact will embolden Tehran They worry that the deal would unlock billions of dollars that Iran might decide to use to further intrude in countries or support terrorist proxiesSen John McCain chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Obama will have to work hard to convince the Arab allies that they do not need to fear fallout from any nuclear dealRight now they feel that they have no support from this administration so he has a steep hill to climb said McCain pointing to Saudi Arabias decision to act unilaterally in YemenMcCain RAriz said thats why the Saudis gave Gen Lloyd Austin head of the US Central Command only an hours notice they were going to strike Yemen Saudi Arabia has led airstrikes against Iranianbacked rebels who have toppled the Yemeni governmentSecretary of State John Kerry is optimistic but declines to say exactly what kind of reassurances Obama is prepared to offer at Camp DavidI can just tell you in general terms that they have to do with the intensifying and strengthening of the securitymilitary relationship between the United States of America and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries as well as dealing with new challenges that we face in the region foremost of which is the Iranian interference in the affairs of the countries of the region Kerry said Friday in ParisHe said US officials were fleshing out a series of commitments that will create a new security understanding a new set of security initiativesStanding by his side Saudi Foreign Minister Adel alJubeir said he expected the summit would lead to ways that joint action will be more effective and more expansive in all areas whether it relates to cybersecurity or defense against ballistic missiles or military training or equippingSen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina chairman of the Senate panel overseeing foreign aid warns against the US offering a massive arms package in exchange for Gulf nations support of a nuclear deal Graham RSC said he isnt opposed to upgrading the military capabilities of Arab allies but if it has a hint of being connected to the Iran deal I will do everything I can to make sure they never get one bullet or one planeJon Alterman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington wonders if there is anything the United States can do that would reassure the Gulf states when it comes to Iranian expansionism in the regionIt seems to me that where they most want reassurance is where the US is both least able and most unwilling to provide it he said My guess is that the summit is going to leave everybody feeling a little bit unsatisfied
