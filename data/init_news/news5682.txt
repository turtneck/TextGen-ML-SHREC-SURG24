their tolerance of Donald Trump But there is certainly a metric that helps them gauge the amountMost Republicans have gone along grudgingly with Trump  if they support the presumptive presidential nominee at all Some of those lawmakers are now reviewing that political quotient as they wonder what Trump might say nextThey ponder how many more times theyll have to condemn Trumps remarks They ask themselves if theyll again have to awkwardly criticize Trumps comments about a judge or women or Muslims  yet reaffirm allegiance to him in the next breathOnly Trump knows what lies in his heart when it comes to race ethnicity and religion But some of his comments give people pause and perhaps make them think of the lyrics in the Avenue Q tune No Trump doesnt go around committing hate crimes But
