Shred the political playbook The 2016 campaign will be remembered as the year in which the conventional wisdom was anything but wise Most political pundits have been wrong And almost every assumption about presidential campaigns since the birth of modern politics in 1960 with the first televised debate and widespread use of TV advertising has been debunked Our political catechism has been upended Consider the followingWhen the Supreme Court ruled in the 2010 Citizens United case that corporations were people and therefore could spend unlimited amounts of money  without disclosure in some instances  on political campaigns Democrats and other critics warned that democracy was now for sale and that the candidate who raised the most money would invariably prevail over less wellfunded contenders Enter Jeb Bush the Republican Partys inevitable nominee who raised over 130 million for his campaign and Super Pac even before he formally declared Eight months later exit Jeb the lowenergy candidate who having spent the vast majority of the money he had raised quit the race dragging his exclamation point behind him Donald Trump by contrast may be wealthy  just how rich remains in dispute  but he has spent less overall than any other candidate and because of the nonstop coverage his slurs and antics have received virtually nothing on TV advertisingTed Cruz was supposed to win all the early GOP contests because of his heavy investment in his ground game But with the exception of Iowa  which he first visited in 2008 only months after being elected a firstterm senator from Texas  organization like money has meant little this year Cruz won Iowa thanks to a large evangelical turnout after Trump skipped what turned out to be a critical debate days before the nations first caucus but he has steadily faded ever since Polls suggest that Trump won in Nevada New Hampshire and South Carolina with the most modest of campaign ground organizations because of his powerful slogan of American revitalization because he is seen as a consummate political outsider a blunt businessman who says what ordinary people think a problemsolver and antipolitician and because of his celebrity status and tempestuous rallies complete with the by now almost ritualistic ejection of a protester While Trump has repeatedly flown to primary states in his private jet he rarely spends a night outside his baronial residence on Fifth AvenueApparently not this year Almost no establishment politician endorsed Trump during the first two primaries The only other celebrity politician who rallied to Trumps side was Sarah Palin whose rambling incoherent 45minute endorsement prior to the Iowa caucus if anything may have cost him votes there Marco Rubio the candidate who has garnered the most endorsements has yet to win a primary and is unlikely to do so despite his growing support from a still reeling Republican establishment4 You cant run against the mediaTrump has mocked this political platitude repeatedly If anything one of the bumptious billionaires most reliable applause lines is his frequent declaration that the media are terrible among the most dishonest groups of people hes ever met Apparently his rivals have gotten the message During the debate in Houston last Thursday every candidate except John Kasich who is running a poor fifth except in his home state of Ohio attacked the pressQuite the contrary In 2016 given Americas deep political polarization no candidate seems able to win without high negatives The nations bitter frustration seems to require candidates to make increasingly stark even extreme appeals The GOP field has no shortage of candidates with high positive ratings especially Ben Carson and Marco Rubio neither of whom has carried a single state primary or caucus On the Democratic side Bernie Sanders has far higher favorability ratings than Hillary Clinton who in poll after poll is widely viewed by potential voters of most ages ethnicities and genders as untrustworthy and perhaps even dishonest Yet Clinton got 735 percent of the Democratic vote in South Carolina on SaturdayMany Trump critics continue to assert that he will ultimately stumble because no candidate can win his partys nomination or be elected to the nations highest office without substantial political experience While the 2008 election of a junior senator from Illinois whose resume featured only a brief stint as a community organizer began to challenge that political bromide the crucial primaries on March 1 and March 15 will be the ultimate refereeGiven the pundits predictive record so far a degree of humility is in order Trump once the unthinkable may soon become inevitable For better or worse the 2016 race is anything but politics as usualJudith Miller
