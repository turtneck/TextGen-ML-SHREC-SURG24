Washington CNN On the fifth anniversary of Osama bin Ladens death President Barack Obama sharply defended his targeted approached to fighting terror  and said the next president would most likely follow his lead rather than his predecessorsThe kinds of Special Forces and intelligencegathering that we saw in the bin Laden raid is going to be more often than not the tool of choice for a president in dealing with that kind of threat he saidThe ideology has not been extinguished Obama acknowledged in an exclusive interview with CNNs Peter Bergen on Monday night The world is still dangerous In many ways the Middle East is in a more chaotic situationBut  without directly referring to President George W Bushs decisions to send US troops into Afghanistan and then Iraq  Obama said such largescale operations which continue to reverberate in the current presidential race would only make the fight against extremism harderObama said the idea of sending 100000 troops to invade every country where an organization like this appears going be counterproductive and in some ways feeds the kinds of ideology that were fightingObama offered the assessment as part of three hours of conversations Bergen had with the President and his top circle about details of the raid that killed bin Laden for the Anderson Cooper 360 special We Got Him Obama Bin Laden and the War on TerrorWhile Obama spoke with confidence of the decision to launch the raid despite the odds being probably 5050 that that the US was correct that the target in the Abbottabad Pakistan compound it was tracking was bin Laden he did speak about the difficulty in making wrenching decisions especially with the expanded use of drones during his presidencyUnmanned aircraft have become an invaluable tool in areas tough to reach with US soldiers Obama said Within the first two years of his presidency though Obama said he felt the legal architecture and control systems in place to use them werent enoughIt became so easy to use them without thinking through all the ramifications he said What weve tried to do is make sure that we are accountable at the highest levels for how were using PredatorsThe standard is of near certainty that the target is an active terrorist threat and that civilian casualties are being avoided the President saidHaving said that you always lose sleep because you know theres always the possibility in a kinetic action that somebody who shouldnt be killed is killed he saidAnd he spoke of the risks of the bin Laden operation in the shadow of US historyReminded that former President Jimmy Carter had lost a chance at a second term because hed taken a similar risk in trying to free US hostages from revolutionary Iran  and failed  Obama responded if I hadnt thought of it on my own it was raised by a number of my advisorsStill Obama said that he didnt consider aborting the mission even when it started with a downed helicopterMy initial concern there was extraction That if something happened to the helicopter that we could make sure that we got our guys out he said pointing to the backup helicopters that had been prepared as part of their plan BNevertheless it gave you a little jolt Obama said I think it reminded you that no matter how well you plan theres always going to be something that comes upObama said US Special Forces had developed a deep capacity during years in Iraq and Afghanistan that meant this wasnt completely foreign terrain for themIt was uniquely complicated because the stakes were so high Obama said and we were operating inside of Pakistan But these guys had been through a lot of harrowing momentsOne thing about having been through a lot of this previously and everybody sitting around this table had been through the ups and downs of any wartime situation the President said Its interesting the degree to which nobody cheered or nobody high fived because we couldnt be sure at that pointObama said it wasnt until the helicopters had landed in Afghanistan with bin Ladens body that all of us breathed  a sigh of reliefObama and his team said that now any future terrorfighting formula will have to include working with allies to address the political resentment and economic frustration that give extremist groups such fertile groundThe case of Pakistan has proved particularly thorny There has continued to be speculation that the government was aware of bin Ladens presence in AbbottabadThenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN that she believes that senior Pakistanis knew bin Laden was thereClinton said it was just too much of a coincidence  that that house that unusuallooking house would be built in that community near the military academy surrounded by retired military professionals even though we couldnt prove itThere was never any evidence that we could uncover that led directly to the top of the Pakistani military and intelligence service Clinton said I believe Pakistanis knewClinton the Democratic presidential frontrunner will have to evaluate whats needed to continue the fight against al Qaeda should she take the White House But Obamas aides stressed that the next commander in chief will for sure need a blend of the finegrained intelligence work and surgical force that defined the lethal 2011 strike against al Qaedas mastermindIn the years since the raid on bin Ladens Abbottabad compound the US has worked systematically to degrade core al Qaeda and go after its leadership Obama said Meanwhile the ability of organizations like ISIS or al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to carry out a catastrophic attack is much lower he saidBut Obama and his advisors acknowledged that the fight against terrorism didnt end with bin Ladens death If anything they said that despite their efforts that battle is now more complex with social media fueling the proliferation of groups and extending their reachThe President praised the incredible structure of cooperation between intelligence military and law enforcement that has hardened the homeland but he didnt directly mention the controversy surrounding measures such as National Security Agency surveillance and the use of drones though both are central to Obamas terrorfighting approachJohn Brennan director of the Central Intelligence Agency said that if counterterrorism is going to be effective and youre going to take offensive action you need to have the care and the precision of a surgeons scalpelObama said the scalpel has only gotten sharper and more precise since he took office He said that US intelligence gathering as well as the accuracy and lethality of Predator drone strikes have increased significantly in the past eight yearsThe next president whether Republican or Democrat will have to think strategically about the battle against terrorism Obama said a longterm undertaking that doesnt involve just force but ideasWhile he didnt address the current presidential race directly Obama and his officials offered an indirect criticism of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trumps proposal that American Muslims be denied entry to the US if they leave the countryWe have to make sure that were not engaging in the kind of kneejerk antiMuslim sentiment that weve heard from some politicians Obama said American Muslims success and integration has insulated the US from some of the terrorism Europe is seeing he added Broadly speaking the US should not react in ways that make the problem worse rather than better Obama saidThe current occupant of the Oval Office dismissed the possibility of Trump taking over from him saying I dont expect that to happenObama concluded with his belief that the American people can draw a reassuring lesson from the raid that will endure beyond his tenureWeve got really effective people and a government that knows how to do this he said And as long as we operate from a position of confidence and strength and are true to who we are groups like this or individuals like this cant defeat us
