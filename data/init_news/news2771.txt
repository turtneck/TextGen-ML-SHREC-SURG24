After months of uncertainty Donald Trump hascommitted to participating in the generalelection presidential debatesI expect to do all three I look forward to the debates Trump toldreporters in Ohio on Monday I think it is an important element of what were doing I think you have an obligation to do the debatesOne reason for the long delay in Trumps agreement to join Hillary Clinton onstage this fall had been complaintsabout the schedule  in particular two debates thatconflict with primetime National Football League gamesButperhaps the biggestreason for the holdout the identities of the journalists asking the questions at those faceoffs Ill have to see who the moderators are the Republican nominee told Time magazine last month Yeah I would say that certain moderators would be unacceptable absolutely Trump had boycotted a primary debate because he was unhappy with the inclusion of Fox NewshostMegyn Kelly as a moderator The stakes were lower then but he showed he was willing to follow through on the threatAs of Friday the lineup was out NBCs LesterHolt will moderate the firstdebate on Sept 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead NY ABCs Martha Raddatz and CNNs Anderson Cooper will lead a townhallstyle forum at Washington University in St Louis on Oct 9 and Fox Newss Chris Wallace wouldhandle the questioning at the final debate on Oct 19 at the University of Nevada at Las VegasWhy Donald Trump might not debate Hillary ClintonThe diverse rosternamed by the Commission on Presidential Debates includedVicepresidential debate moderator Elaine Quijano also represented a couple of milestones as the first Asian American moderator of a generalelection debate and the first to work primarily for a digital network CBSNNone of the names on the list were dealbreakers for Trump But he has tangled with all of them in the pastThe GOP nomineeprobablyhad no objection to Wallace given that he twice agreed to participate in GOP primary debates moderated by the Fox News Sunday anchor But Wallace was tough on himat those events most memorablywhen he used fullscreen graphics to factcheck Trump on the spotWallace later told me Do I take a certain pleasure when I open the gate and he decides to walk down the path and Ive got the bear trap at the end of the path Yeah SureHolt who moderated a Democratic primary debate has likewise tripped up Trump with factchecks In a June interview he pressed for evidence to support Trumps claim that Clinton was asleep at critical times during the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya and got the casino magnate to admit that his assertion might not be trueShe was asleep at the wheel whether she was sleeping or not Trump conceded Who knows if she was sleepingLater in the interview Holt flummoxed Trump by asking how he could say for certain that Clintons private email server was hackedHOLT But is there any evidence it was hacked other than routine phishing TRUMP I think I read that and I heard it and somebody also gave me that information TRUMP I will report back to you I will give it to you HOLT You said it with such certainty yesterday TRUMP I dont know if certainty Probably she was hackedHolt isnt the onlyjournalist with a record of throwing Trumpoff balanceTrump participated in a primary debate moderated by Raddatz but faced only a few questions from her Raddatz split duties with ABCs David Muir and there were seven candidates onstage The exchanges were uneventfulBut Raddatz absolutely grilled Trump last summer in his first interview after saying Sen John McCain RAriz was not a war hero She also confronted Trump about his rhetoric in generalThere seems to be a pattern Mr Trump Raddatz said When youre criticized or attacked you often respond with namecalling using terms like dummy loser total losers on Twitter and elsewhere You even demean some peoples physical appearanceIs that something you would continue doing if you were president Isnt that language beneath the office of the presidentTrump has granted many interviews to Raddatzs partner in the second debate Cooper who moderated two Democratic primary debates When the GOP standardbearer finally agreed to appear on CNN recently for the first time in more than two months it was on Coopers programThat interview produced more headlines about Trumps immigration flipflops as Cooper pressed him to reconcile the softening he had described to Sean Hannity with the hardline stance he took early in the campaign At one point in the conversation Trump accused Cooper of being on Clintons sideI know you want to protect her as much as you possibly can said Trump who often refers to CNN as the Clinton News NetworkThe hard questions Trump has faced from these moderators were well within the bounds of fairness But Trump is not one to limit himself to rational bias claims Even those fall moderators who have been involved witha presidential debate in past cyclescan expect to oversee faceoffsunlike any they have handled beforeThis story has been updated
