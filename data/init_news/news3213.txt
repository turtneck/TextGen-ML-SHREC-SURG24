WASHINGTON  In a significant setback for President Obamas signature domestic initiative the administration on Tuesday abruptly announced a oneyear delay until 2015 in his health care laws mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties The decision postpones the effective date beyond next years midterm electionsEmployer groups welcomed the news of the concession which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the White House and Treasury Web sites while the president was flying home from Africa Republicans gleeful reactions made clear that they would not cease to make repeal of Obamacare a campaign issue for the third straight election cycleWhile the postponement technically does not affect other central provisions of the law  in particular those establishing health insurance marketplaces in the states known as exchanges where uninsured Americans can shop for policies  it threatens to throw into disarray the administrations effort to put those provisions into effect by Jan 1I am utterly astounded said Sara Rosenbaum a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University and an advocate of the law It boggles the mind This step could significantly reduce the number of uninsured people who will gain coverage in 2014At the White House Tara McGuinness a senior adviser on the law disputed thatNothing in the new guidance regarding employer reporting and responsibility will limit individuals eligibility for premium tax credits to buy insurance through the marketplaces that open on Oct 1 she saidUnder the law most Americans will be required to have insurance in January 2014 or they will be subject to tax penalties The announcement on Tuesday did not say anything about delaying that requirement or those penaltiesAdministration officials sought to put the action in a positive light in the online announcements and they emphasized that the existing insurance coverage of most Americans would not be affectedWe have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively Mark J Mazur an assistant Treasury secretary wrote on the departments Web site We recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do soThe 2010 Affordable Care Act required employers with more than 50 fulltime workers to offer them affordable health insurance starting next year or face fines Some companies with payrolls just above that threshold said they would cut jobs or switch some fulltime workers to parttime employment so that they could avoid providing coverageUnder the provision to set up statebased marketplaces subsidies are supposed to be available to many lower and middleincome people who do not have access to coverage from employers or other sources It may be difficult however for officials running the exchanges to know who is entitled to subsidies if employers do not report information on the coverage they provide to workersEnrollment in the exchanges is to begin Oct 1 with insurance coverage taking effect on Jan 1 We are on target to open the health insurance marketplace on Oct 1 where small businesses and ordinary Americans will be able to go to one place to learn about their coverage options and make sidebyside comparisons of each plans price and benefits before they make their decision Valerie Jarrett Mr Obamas senior adviser and liaison to the business community wrote on the White House Web siteBut even some supporters of the law dispute that the establishment of the health insurance exchanges is on schedule especially since progress varies by state and some Republicanled states are resisting the health care law and withholding resources for putting it into effectMuch of the administrations public effort especially at the Department of Health and Human Services has been directed toward spreading the word to uninsured Americans especially younger and healthy individuals whose participation is needed to help keep down premiums for everyone else About 85 percent of Americans are insured so most individuals will be unaffected at least initiallyBehind the scenes however the administration has been fielding questions and criticisms from businesses about the reporting requirements  especially the Treasury Department which has responsibility given its oversight of the tax reporting systemEmployer groups were quick to applaud the delay At the US Chamber of Commerce which has strongly opposed the law Randy Johnson senior vice president for labor immigration and employee benefits said in a statement The administration has finally recognized the obvious  employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandateE Neil Trautwein a vice president of the National Retail Federation said the delay will provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishmentMr Mazur the Treasury official said the delay will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the lawSecond he added it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employeesWithin the next week Mr Mazur said Treasury will issue official guidance to insurers selfinsuring employers and other parties that provide health coverage Formal rules will be proposed this summer he added but the administration will encourage employers to comply with the laws reporting provisions in 2014 as originally mandatedDemocrats were all but silent on the news but a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada the majority leader released a statement late Tuesday Both the administration and Senate Democrats have shown  and continue to show  a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved the spokesman Adam Jentleson said It is better to do this right than fastBut Republicans immediately reacted with statements claiming vindication for their efforts to repeal the law altogetherSenator John Barrasso Republican of Wyoming called the administration action a cynical political ploy to delay the coming train wreck associated with Obamacare until after the 2014 electionsAnd Senator Mitch McConnell the Senate Republican leader who faces reelection next year in Kentucky said in a statement The fact remains that Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with commonsense reforms that actually lower costs for Americans
