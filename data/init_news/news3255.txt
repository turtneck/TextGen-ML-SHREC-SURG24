We Are Change Issues surrounding Hillary Clintons health and ability to take on the demanding position of President have pervaded this presidential race But several recent WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta chairman of Hillarys campaign have revealed that Hillary Clintons health problems cannot possibly be branded as conspiracy theories any longerBefore Hillary Clinton announced her run for president an email sent on March 14th 2014 by campaign manager Robert Mook to Clinton campaign chairman Podesta asks whether Podesta has discussed Hillarys taxes and health The email states that he acknowledges theyre both hyper sensitive issues wondering whether both are better dealt with very early so we control themrather than responding to calls for transparency In this thread Mook stated Yes We need to kill that baby in the cradle Which perfectly articulates how sadistic the Clinton campaign and agenda is within a single metaphorA later email thread from July 31 2015  shows Dan Schwerin Clintons director of speech writing aiming to roll out Hillarys tax records along with a letter from her physician stating that she is in excellent health and that following this We expect the stories that pop at 2 pm to have headlines such as CLINTON IN EXCELLENT HEALTH MEDICAL RECORDS SAY  CLINTON RELEASES HEALTH REPORT  CLINTON CAMP AIMS TO ONEUP BUSH IN DISCLOSING FINANCESThe emails expose the Clinton campaigns attempts to suppress any further inquiry into these health problems and control the narrative and provide them with the best possible fighting chance of promoting the most helpful story linesAlso stating that the first stories on health wont pop until 2 1 pm is just when we will quietly approach the reporters  the Clinton camp is exposed in the way in which the mainstream media has held complete bias in favor of a Clinton presidency This has also been revealed through all the recent Podesta email Wikileaks releases Just one example being an email sent April 30 2015 by Politico reporter Glenn Thrush who even called himself a hack when asking Hillarys top campaign aide John Podesta to check over sections of his report regarding the Democratic presidential candidate before publication Startlingly an email exchange between Hillarys campaign leaders Tanden and Podesta even questions if she is aware that we are living on planet Earth Telling an audience in Ohio that she was moderate and center after previously stating just a few days prior that she was progressive Tanden asks Why did she call herself a moderatePodesta replied  I pushed her on this on Sunday night She claims she didnt remember saying it Not sure I believe her In response Tanden stated I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know shes actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues It worries me more that she doesnt seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment  It can be speculated as to what this statement is referring to but it is evident that this proves Hillarys lack of awareness and mental stability Perhaps regarding her inability to hold a firm political position or even more worryingly her inability to retain even the most basic and fundamental information due to a medical condition that she is suffering from Giving credibility to the latter possibility Hillarys top aide Huma Abedin admits that the former Secretary of State is still not perfect in her head in a newly revealed Wikileaks email on TuesdayCountless incidents capturing Hillarys poor health and unstable mental state have been brought to light despite the Clinton campaign and mainstream medias attempted censoring of this content in the hope that portraying a false narrative regarding these episodes will stray attention away from this issue For example after Hillarys recent fall at a 911 memorial event filmed by a bystander the Clinton campaign tried to cover up by claiming this was due to pneumonia and dehydration even though Clinton does not appear limp as though she has fainted In contrast she appears ridged and shaky throughout this episode as Secret Service agents lift her into the vehicle However Hillarys constant tumbles do not surprise me as the gravitational force pulling this Democratic nominee towards underworld must be so incredibly strongThis along with many other recently recorded accounts of Hillarys severe coughing fits  dangerous falls recurring eye problems  and the spitting up of a vile yellow substance have undoubtedly shown that this presidential candidate is scarcely physically fit to perform duties as president Hillarys mental state is also a major point of concern which top aides Podesta and Abedin have confirmed through the Wikileaks emails stated in this articleIf Hillary blatantly appears unable to function healthily during her time running for president we can only expect these issues to increase in severity if she were to take on the stressful position of presidentThe post WikiLeaks Podesta Emails Confirm Hillarys Health Issues appeared first on We Are Change
