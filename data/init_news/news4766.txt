Past perceived gaffes such as Romneys 47 percent comment in 2012 have drawn far more attention from the media than from voters who may make up their minds about candidates in other waysDarcy Butkus from left Becky Love and Kathy Potts make a political statement at a town hall gathering hosted by Trump supporter and former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich at Kennesaw State University on Monday Sept 12 2016 in Kennesaw GaHillary Clintons weekend comment that half of Donald Trumps supporters are a racist and sexist basket of deplorables is still roiling the presidential race as the workweek begins Lots of pundits are comparing it to Mitt Romneys famous 47 percent statement in which he said nearly half of American voters can be written off as welfare moochersLost in most of the discussion of this comparison is the fact that Romneys 47 percent words revealed when a secret source leaked the tape of a fundraiser to Mother Jones magazine didnt much affect the 2012 outcome and probably did not even move the polls that muchThats the political reality behind such moments as Mrs Clintons deplorables or Romneys 47 percent Voters usually dont make up their minds from a few days of news coverageIts true that many voters saw Romneys perceived gaffe in negative terms And it sure seemed like something that would have serious negative repercussions harsh words seemingly delivered in secret about an opponents supporters That made it seem more important than a typical political slip of the tongueBut in terms of who people planned to vote for there was no consistent evidence that much changed in the wake of the tapes release wrote political scientists John Sides of George Washington University and Lynn Vavreck of UCLA in their history of the 2012 election The GambleGallup poll data showed President Obamas lead over Romney actually shrank from 3 to 2 percentage points the week after 47 percent became public Rasmussen polls stayed the same The average of all public polls was stable in the wake of the controversy according to Sides and VavreckIn other words peoples opinions about the race did not really alter on either sideIn contrast the first 2012 debate held on Oct 3 did move the polls The media roundly declared Romney the victor over a flat Obama Some surveys even put Romney in the lead Spoiler alert He lost The fallout of subsequent debates reversed those gainsWhats the takeaway from this Maybe that lots of things the media says are gamechangers arentIts certainly possible that Clintons deplorables comment could hurt her Insulting ordinary voters is not something campaign consultants generally urge But in general presidential races are not unstable Leads shrink or widen slowly driven by fundamentals such as the state of the economy or predictable dynamics such as Republican voters rallying around Trump At this point in the cycle many peoples minds are set and it takes a lot to change themThere are break points but they tend to be set news events that draw massive coverage The conventions are one  Clinton jumped out to a big lead following the close of the Democratic National Convention The debates might be another Thus the first direct clash between Clinton and Trump set for Sept 26 is likely to be more consequential than Clintons insult
