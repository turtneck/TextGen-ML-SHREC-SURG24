Muhammad Ali was beloved around the world but perhaps one of his unlikeliest friends was Sen Orrin Hatch who remembered the threetime heavyweight champion at his funeral on FridayThe Utah Republican said Alis commitment to finding common ground with people different from himself was one of his greatest giftsSpeaking at Alis funeral in Louisville Kentucky Hatch said the two met 28 years ago when an assistant told him he had a visitor in his Senate office The two bonded over their love of boxing as Hatch was once an amateur boxerI was very surprised that it was none other than the champion Hatch said The friendship we developed I think it was puzzling to many people  especially those who saw only our differencesBut where others saw difference Ali and I saw kinship he added The two men shared humble childhoods in workingclass cities a high value of family and deep devotions to their faiths Hatch said these things were the foundation of a rich and meaningful relationship True we were different in some ways but our differences fortified our friendships they did not define it Hatch said I saw greatness in Alis ability to look beyond the horizon and our differences to find common ground
