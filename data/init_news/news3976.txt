By Catherine J Frompovich This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissions Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3 2016 Currently Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution I contend Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMFRFR controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the 35page report  EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of EMFrelated health problems and illnesses  which is a Spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanuncios201607msg00069html This report cites 308 published scientific references which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUCand PECO in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era safety THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety Those safety studies originated in Germany during World War II are totally outmoded but remain the present Federal Communications Commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters It is now 2016 How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in todays technology world of 2016 Wheres the science later than the 1940s Please may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC Frompovich therefore respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the aboveaforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFREMF healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and therefore I introduce Exhibit U1 Why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults The Consequences and Exhibit U2 American Academy of Pediatrics August 29 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates SARs regarding EMFRF exposures Also I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity EHS is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following 26 of the USA population 19 of the Swedish population 27 of the Danish population and 32  of the German population are EHS compromised See Exhibit V  However other sources claim that as much as 5 of the entire worlds population is affected Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or Multiple Chemical Sensitivity MCSso too is EHS now being recognized by many including the World Health Organization I introduce Exhibit W Electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment Printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidMDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute A review on Electromagnetic fields EMFs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 247365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters Before I include my previously submitted testimony I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by Furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100 certainty which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions EMFRF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day No medicalscientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that I know of Wheres the science Therefore Frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds Just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents Therefore Frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own Ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late 1970s During my career I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles I am in my 78 th year thank God Since the early 1970s when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life Ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle Ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities For the record 383 of US adults and 118 of US children used whats referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics1 Complementary and Alternative MedicineCAM as its called is popular throughout the world while in the US there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health However the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one Therefore I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers WiFi smart gadgets and in particular AMI Smart Meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers Most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health Fortunately I am not one of those people thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house But first I think you ought to know some of my background Im a wellinformed plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author That I should be taken seriously I offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the US Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare CANAH for five years and as such presented FDAsolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTAH405 NTIS PB911048932 Unconventional Cancer Treatments 3 expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the US Food and Drug Administration the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation who set up LEFs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazoncom and my 2016 book Eat to Beat Disease Foods Medicinal Qualities Additionally I wrote and produced two TV shows One called  Turn Off the Violence  was nominated for a Telly Award That hourlong show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland4 who founded a 24hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence What Ive shared is much less than half of my background More would take too much of your time However I feel compelled to ask How many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues Furthermore I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health I probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help Because I am opposing faulty and healthdamaging RFEMF science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the USA if I have to do that Attorney Ward Smiths interrogatory requesting Frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom Ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed Why Because Frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them Furthermore since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right I respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue Whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all Pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiesPECO included the PA PUC and the Commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom RFEMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot 1940s vintage radar safety researchfor RFsEMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation RFsEMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue There are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUCPECO forced AMI Smart Meter 247365 RFEMF electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse Nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing PA population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon Penna Medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the Commonwealth To cement that forewarning I offer the World Health Organizations statistic Approximately 10 of reported cases of EHS electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving That however does not include cancerinduced health issues from RFsEMFs What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PAs legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed Has anyone thought about that very real problem Continued in Part 3
