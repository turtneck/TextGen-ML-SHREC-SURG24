The presidential campaigns of Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich announced late Sunday that they were coordinating their efforts in three upcoming primary states in an extraordinary attempt to prevent Republican frontrunner Donald Trump from clinching the GOP nomination before this summers conventionIn a pair of simultaneously released statements the campaigns announced that Kasich would pull out of Indiana to give Cruz a clear path ahead of that states winnertakeall primary May 3 while the Cruz campaign will clear the path for Kasich in Oregon which votes May 17 and New Mexico which votes June 7Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans Cruzs campaign manager Jeff Roe said To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our leadThe arrangement marks a sharp reversal for Cruzs team which aggressively opposed the idea of a coordinated antiTrump effort as recently as late last week Yet it underscores a bleak reality for the billionaire businessmans Republican foes Time is running out to stop himA statement from the Trump campaign called the move a horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have horribly failedThe Kasich campaign confirmed to Fox News that it had canceled two Indiana campaign events scheduled for TuesdayAs recently as three days ago Kasichs campaign announced investments in Indiana including the opening of two offices and the creation of a campaign leadership teamCampaign manager John Weaver said in his statement that the Kasich team hoped to perform well in Oregon and New Mexico which Weaver said were structurally similar to northeastern states where Kasich performed well earlier in the cycleOur goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland Weaver added where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nomineeThe announcement came less than 48 hours before voting begins across five Northeastern states where the New York billionaire is poised to add to his already overwhelming delegate lead Trump campaigned Sunday in Maryland which will vote on Tuesday along with Rhode Island Connecticut Pennsylvania and DelawareTrump needs 1237 delegates to win the Republican nomination If he falls short the national Republican gathering in July will evolve into a rare contested conventionAt a rally in Hagerstown Md Trump stressed repeatedly that he expects to win the 1237 delegates needed in the first round of voting to stave off a contested conventionI only care about the first Were not going for the second and third and fourth and fifth said TrumpEven before the plan was announced Cruz had all but abandoned the Northeastern states in favor of Indiana which holds its primary on May 3 Both Cruz and Kasich had cast the state as a critical turning pointKeeping Trump from winning a plurality in Indiana is critical to keeping him under 1237 bound delegates before Cleveland Kasichs campaign said Sunday We are very comfortable with our delegate position in Indiana already and given the current dynamics of the primary there we will shift our campaigns resources west and give the Cruz campaign a clear path in IndianaIndiana will award 57 delegates to the winner of its primary Oregon and New Mexico have 28 and 24 proportionately awarded delegates at stake respectivelyFox News Dan Gallo and the Associated Press contributed to this report
