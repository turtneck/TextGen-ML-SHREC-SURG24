As Democrats Grow Nervous Clinton Tries To Appeal To Party LeadersHillary Clinton has spent much of the summer fending off questions about her private email account during her time as secretary of state Bernie Sanders is gaining on her in the polls And theres a looming possible challenge from sitting Vice President Joe BidenThats a far cry from the beginning of this campaign when she was seen as an almost inevitable Democratic nomineeNow shes trying to regroup and make the case before the very people who will choose that nominee  not voters but her base the party establishmentI have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and Im not going to stop now Clinton said at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis Friday In fact Im just getting warmed upShe vowed that she is not taking a single primary voter or caucusgoer for grantedBut party leaders are growing concerned that Clinton has not wrested control of the storyline of those emails Its made many bite their nails and its given the other four candidates currently in the race some hope that theres an opening for someone elseSanders an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate got a boost Saturday night from an Iowa poll showing him gaining on Clinton just 7 points behind the frontrunnerHe underlined  in a notsoveiled shot at Clinton  that politics as usual and same old same old is not going to work in firing up Democratic voters to get out to the pollsMaking a parallel argument to the one conservatives make on the Republican side Sanders blamed the party in part for major losses in the 2014 midterm elections because liberal base voters didnt have something to vote forWe lost because voter turnout was abysmally embarrassingly low and millions of working people young people and people of color gave up on politics as usual and they stayed home Sanders saidHe added With all due respect  and I do not mean to insult anyone here  that turnout that enthusiasm will not happen with politics as usual The same old same old will not workFormer Maryland Gov Martin OMalley also took aim at the partys establishment repeating his criticism of the Democratic debate schedule which begins in October He described it as a rigged process and a cynical move to delay and limit our own party debatesOMalley who trails in the polls wants more debatesFour debates and four debates only we are told  not asked  before voters in our earliest states make their decision OMalley said making for a rather awkward moment with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz as he left the stageBiden did not attend the meeting in Minneapolis But in a conference call last week the vice president told DNC members that he has been talking with his family about whether or not to enter the race He said if he runs he wants to give the campaign his whole heart and soulAnd right now both are pretty well banged up Biden said His son Beau a rising star in the Democratic Party died of brain cancer in MayAhead of her speech Clinton released a series of memos highlighting her organizational strength in the four early voting states She campaigned in Iowa last week with Tom Vilsack the agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor Vilsack was asked if his endorsement of Clinton while Biden is considering a run will make for awkward Cabinet meetingsI love Joe Biden  just like we all do Hes a wonderful man Vilsack said But he said campaigns require difficult choices and he and his wife are supporting ClintonIt may already be too late for Biden in the minds of many DNC members who have backed Clinton by now Take for example Florida committeeman Jon M Ausman who said this to Politico in MinneapolisBy rolling out early endorsements Clinton is wise to try to make a show of strength now to ward off a Biden run says Mo Elleithee executive director of Georgetown Universitys Institute of Politics and Public Service Elleithee is also the immediate past DNC communications director and worked for Clintons 2008 campaignBiden will not have oxygen in the room if she has locked people down Elleithee said I think he is probably looking at the field and saying OK at this late date in the process can I build the organization Can I raise the money And can my message break through Asked about Biden Clinton said she believes the vice president is facing a tough decision and she wants to give him the space and time to make it She told reporters in Minneapolis that shes also learned some lessons from her primary loss to President Obama in 2008I got a lot of votes she said but I didnt  I didnt get enough delegates And so I think its understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates as well as votes this time
