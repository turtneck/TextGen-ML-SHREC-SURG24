Many see a double standard in the FBIs recommendation not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for her use of a personal email server But some say theres good reason for thatUS Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has come under fire from the FBI for extremely careless handling of classified messages which she kept on a personal server as Secretary of StateIs Hillary Clinton too big to fail In other words does her status as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president protect her from criminal charges related to her use of a personal server for State Department communicationsThats what top Republicans are saying in the wake of Tuesdays announcement by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey that the bureau wont recommend prosecution of Mrs Clinton for her handling of classified emails Its one reason why the GOPcontrolled House will hold a hearing Thursday on the FBIs decisionThat hearing could be a pivotal forum for Clintons foes Theyd like to portray the former secretary of State as the undeserving beneficiary of what presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump labels a rigged systemAfter all voters already give Clinton low marks for trustworthiness Anything that reinforces that feeling could be good for the Trump campaign Plus it could keep the spotlight off Mr Trumps own controversies  at least for a while For Trump supporters extending the period of Clintons troubles is now job oneThis is one of the reasons why people are so dissatisfied so upset about government They think that people live by a different set of rules and the Clintons they take the candle on this one said House Speaker Paul Ryan during an appearance Tuesday on Megyn Kellys Fox News showMr Ryan and other Clinton critics say that the split nature of Director Comeys press conference was disorientingAt first the FBI director listed what Clinton did wrong noting among other things that on her private server shed sent and received messages that were classified at the time Her handling of secret material was extremely careless Comey saidIt seemed as if he might be leading up to a recommendation that the Justice Department prosecute Clinton after allAnd then he said in essence never mind The agency would not urge the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton he said No reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case according to ComeyWhy not President Obamas Justice Department has a history of pursuing officials who leak secrets points out journalist Glenn Greenwald who wrote some of the initial reports on classified information provided by exNational Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden The Obama administration has brought more cases under the 1917era Espionage Act than all previous administrations combinedWhile the Snowden case hinged on massive leaks many of these prosecutions didnt Former Central Intelligence Agency employee Jeffrey Alexander Sterling and former NSA executive Thomas Andrews Drake were both convicted of various charges related to small amounts of classified materialHad someone who was obscure and unimportant and powerless done what Hillary Clinton did  recklessly and secretly install a shoddy home server and worked with Top Secret information on it then outright lied to the public about it when they were caught  they would have been criminally charged long ago with little fuss or objection writes Mr Greenwald atThe InterceptPerhaps Motivation is a factor here however Both Messrs Sterling and Drake leaked information to reporters As did Mr Snowden obviously Clinton did notIn Clintons case there is no evidence of clear and willful mishandling of intelligence or any inference of disloyalty to the United States according to the FBIs Comey Thats a big reason why she wasnt chargedIn looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts said Comey at his Tuesday press conferenceBut wasnt isnt the same as couldnt Under federal law its illegal to handle classified information with gross negligence And Comey himself said that Clinton acted with extreme carelessness Arent those phrases descriptions of pretty much the same thingThey might be However Comey also emphasized that an examination of past cases played a large role in the FBIs decision on Clinton What that means according to rightleaning Washington Post pundit Jennifer Rubin is that the FBI did indeed think Clinton had violated federal law  but they could find no instances of anyone being prosecuted under the gross negligence standard They werent about to set a new precedent and blow up US presidential politics in the bargainWe actually do require a high level of proof for prosecuting high government officials so as to avoid politicized harassment of public officialswrites Ms Rubin Call that a double standard of justice but frankly its one with which investigators and prosecutors are very familiarRubin says this result will not satisfy everyone but might still be judicious Comeys description of Clintons actions regarding her email server was scathing Many of her defenses have been exposed as untruths Voters can now make up their own minds It is not the fault of the FBI that Clintons electoral opponent is someone with even lower public approval ratings
