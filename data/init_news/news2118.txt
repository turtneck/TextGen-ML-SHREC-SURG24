in General Health  Medical  Health  Sleuth Journal  Special Interests Ive written many articles on the hazards and drawbacks of getting a mammogram which include  The risk of false positives  Besides leading to unnecessary mental anguish and medical treatment a false cancer diagnosis may also interfere with your eligibility for medical insurance which can have serious financial ramifications  The risk of false negatives  which is of particular concern for densebreasted women  The fact that ionizing radiation actually causes cancer and may contribute to breast cancer when done over a lifetime Results published in the British Medical Journal BMJ show that women carrying the BRCA12 gene mutation are particularly vulnerable to radiationinduced cancer 1  The fact that studies repeatedly find that mammograms have no impact on mortality rates As so expertly demonstrated in the video above created by Dr Andrew Lazris and environmental scientist Erik Rifkin PhD its easy to misunderstand the benefits of mammograms Mammograms are said to reduce your risk of dying from breast cancer by 20 percent but unless you understand where this number comes from youll be vastly overestimating the potential benefit of regular mammogram screening  Most doctors also fail to inform patients about the other side of the equation which is that far more women are actually harmed by the procedure than benefit from it 1 in 1000 Women Is Saved by Regular Mammogram Screening While 10 Undergo Cancer Treatment for No Reason Incredible as it may sound the 20 percent mortality risk reduction touted by conventional medicine actually amounts to just 1 woman per 1000 who get regular mammograms How can that be As explained in the video for every 1000 women who do not get mammograms 5 of them will die of breast cancer For every 1000 women who do get mammograms 4 will die anyway The difference between the two groups is 20 percent the difference of that one person in the mammogram group whose life is saved On the other side of the equation out of every 1000 women who get regular mammograms over a lifetime HALF will receive a false positive So while they do NOT have cancer about 500 out of every 1000 women getting mammograms will face the terror associated with a breast cancer diagnosis 64 will get biopsies which can be painful and carry risks of adverse effects 10 will go on to receive cancer treatment for what is in actuality NOT cancer including disfiguring surgery and toxic drugs or radiation Surgery chemo and radiation are all risky and dying from the treatment for a cancer you do not have is doubly tragic All things considered the evidence seems quite clear most women should probably avoid mammograms as they cause far more harm than good Many studies have now come to that conclusion and the most recent research 2 published just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month again hammers home that point Harms of Mammography Eclipse Benefits For this study the researchers analyzed US cancer statistics collected by the government in order to estimate the effectiveness of mammography By comparing records of breast cancers diagnosed in women over the age of 40 between 1975 and 1979  a time before mammograms came into routine use  and between 2000 and 2002 three key findings emerged 3  4  5  6  7  8 The incidence of large tumors 2 centimeters or larger has declined from 68 percent to 32 percent The number of women diagnosed with small tumors has increased from 36 to 64 percent The incidence of metastatic cancer which is the most lethal has remained stable This may initially sound like good news for mammograms but in absolute numbers the decrease in large tumors was actually rather small  a mere 30 tumors less per 100000 women Meanwhile the dramatic increase in small tumors was mostly attributed to overdiagnosis  an estimated 81 percent of these small tumors did not actually need treatment The fact that metastatic cancer rates remained even suggests were not catching more of them earlier Instead were catching and treating mostly harmless tumors The researchers also found that twothirds of the reduction in breast cancer mortality was attributable to improved treatment such as the use of tamoxifen Breast cancer screening only accounted for onethird of the reduction in mortality Lead researcher Dr HGilbert Welch explains the findings of the study in the video above As reported by WebMD 9 The upshot according to Welch is that mammography is more likely to overdiagnose breast cancer than to catch moreaggressive tumors early Whats more the researchers said that while breast cancer deaths have fallen since the 1970s that is mainly due to better treatment  not screening Welch noted the current studys findings have nothing to do with women who feel a lump in the breast They need to get a mammogram he stressed But Welch suggested when it comes to routine screening women can decide based on their personal values Screening as Personal Choice When speaking to NBC news Welch went on to say that screening is a choice Its not a public health imperative 10 At present most conventional cancer specialists do view mammograms as an imperative although recommendations vary depending on who you listen to As of last year the American Cancer Society ACS recommends women of average risk should have their first mammogram at age 45 followed by an annual mammogram up until age 55 Women 55 and older should have them every other year 11 Meanwhile the US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF recommends waiting until the age of 50 and only getting a mammogram every other year thereafter 12 In response to heated debate over the varying guidelines the US Congress passed legislation requiring insurance companies to cover mammograms regardless of age Not surprisingly the ACS has sharply criticized the latest study In a statement chief cancer control officer of ACS Dr Richard Wender said These conclusions are bold attentiongrabbing and should be taken with a grain of salt  actually an entire spoonful The problem with Wenders attitude is that this is by no means the first or only study suggesting that mammography has been vastly oversold In fact a number of studies have now refuted the validity of mammography as a primary tool against breast cancer The Evidence Overwhelmingly Refutes Routine Use of Mammography Other studies that support the findings of the featured study include the following  Archives of Internal Medicine 2007  A metaanalysis of 117 randomized controlled mammogram trials Among its findings Rates of falsepositive results are as high as 56 percent after 10 mammograms 13  Cochrane Database Review 2009  This review found that breast cancer screening led to a 30 percent rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment which actually INCREASED the absolute risk of developing cancer by 05 percent The review concluded that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout a 10year period the life of just one woman was prolonged while 10 healthy women were treated unnecessarily 14  New England Journal of Medicine NEJM 2010  This study concluded that the reduction in mortality as a result of mammographic screening was so small as to be nonexistent  a mere 24 deaths per 100000 personyears were spared as a result of the screening 15  The Lancet Oncology 2011  This study described the natural history of breast cancers detected in the Swedish mammography screening program between 1986 to 1990 involving 650000 women Since breast lesions and tumors are aggressively treated andor removed before they can be determined with any certainty to be a clear and present threat to health there has been little to no research on what happens when they are left alone This study however demonstrated for the first time that women who received the most breast screenings had a HIGHER cumulative incidence of invasive breast cancer over the following six years than the control group who received far less screenings 16  The Lancet 2012  showed that for every life saved by mammography screening three women are overdiagnosed and treated with surgery radiation or chemotherapy for a cancer that might never have given them trouble in their lifetimes 17  Cochrane Database Review 2013  A review of 10 trials involving more than 600000 women found mammography screening had no effect on overall mortality 18  NEJM 2014  Drs Nikola BillerAndorno and Peter Jni published a paper in which they describe the findings of an independent health technology assessment initiative to assess the effectiveness of mammography of which they were a part 19 First we noticed that the ongoing debate was based on a series of reanalyses of the same predominantly outdated trials  Could the modest benefit of mammography screening in terms of breastcancer mortality that was shown in trials initiated between 1963 and 1991 still be detected in a trial conducted today Second we were struck by how nonobvious it was that the benefits of mammography screening outweighed the harms The relative risk reduction of approximately 20 percent in breastcancer mortality associated with mammography that is currently described by most expert panels came at the price of a considerable diagnostic cascade with repeat mammography subsequent biopsies and overdiagnosis of breast cancers  cancers that would never have become clinically apparent  Third we were disconcerted by the pronounced discrepancy between womens perceptions of the benefits of mammography screening and the benefits to be expected in reality The figure shows the numbers of 50yearold women in the United States expected to be alive to die from breast cancer or to die from other causes if they are invited to undergo regular mammography every two years over a 10year period as compared with women who do not undergo mammography  The Swiss Medical Boards report was made public on February 2 2014 20 It acknowledged that systematic mammography screening might prevent about one death attributed to breast cancer for every 1000 women screened even though there was no evidence to suggest that overall mortality was affected At the same time it emphasized the harm  in particular false positive test results and the risk of overdiagnosis  The board therefore recommended that no new systematic mammography screening programs be introduced and that a time limit be placed on existing programs In addition it stipulated that the quality of all forms of mammography screening should be evaluated and that clear and balanced information should be provided to women regarding the benefits and harms of screening  British Medical Journal BMJ 2014  A Canadian study put the rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from mammography at nearly 22 percent 21  JAMA Internal Medicine July 2015  Here researchers concluded mammography screenings lead to unnecessary treatments while having virtually no impact on the number of deaths from breast cancer A positive correlation between breast cancer screening and breast cancer incidence was indeed found but there was no positive correlation with mortality 22  23  Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine September 2015  The conclusion of this study is stated right in the title which reads Mammography screening is harmful and should be abandoned 24  25 In short the authors concluded that decades of routine breast cancer screening using mammograms has done nothing to decrease deaths from breast cancer while causing more than half 52 percent of all women undergoing the test to be overdiagnosed and overtreated According to lead author Peter C Gtzsche had mammograms been a drug it would have been withdrawn from the market long ago Its Time to Revise the When in Doubt Cut It Out Mentality Going back to where we started even when using the cancer industrys own statistics mammography comes up short provided you understand what the 20 percent actually means To reiterate the difference between getting routine mammograms and not getting them is that the life of 1 in 1000 women is saved Four die even with mammograms compared to five deaths among those who do not get screened And again 10 of those 1000 screened women will be treated for cancer even though they do not actually have it Clearly the choice is yours If you find comfort in thinking you may be that one person who is saved then by all means follow your heart or gut instinct Just be clear about the risks because the chances are far greater you could be one of the 10 who ends up undergoing chemo or a mastectomy for a tumor that would not have caused you harm As noted by Dr Joann Elmore of the University of Washington School of Medicine 26 We get credit for curing disease that never would have harmed the patient We receive positive feedback from patients thanking us for saving my life alarming feedback from patients with missed diagnoses and no feedback at all from patients whose cancer was overdiagnosed The mantras All cancers are lifethreatening and When in doubt cut it out require revision Solid Evidence for Vitamin D as a Cancer Prevention Tool Mammograms are portrayed as the best form of prevention a woman can get But early diagnosis is not the same as prevention And when the cancer screening does more harm than good how can it possibly qualify as your best hope I believe the evidence really speaks for itself when it comes to mammography The same can be said for research into vitamin D which repeatedly shows that optimizing your vitamin D level within a range of 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter ngml provides impressive cancer protection I believe testing your vitamin D level is one of the most important cancer prevention tests available Ideally get tested twice a year There are exceptions of course If you feel a lump in your breast a mammogram may be warranted although even then there are other nonionizing alternatives such as ultrasound which has been shown to be considerably superior to mammography especially for densebreasted women who are at much higher risk of a false negative when using mammography One of the most recent studies 27 looking at vitamin D for breast cancer found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cancer progression and metastasis As noted by Stanford University researcher Dr Brian Feldman 28 A number of large studies have looked for an association between vitamin D levels and cancer outcomes and the findings have been mixed Our study identifies how low levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood may play a mechanistic role in promoting breast cancer growth and metastasis  Having higher levels of vitamin D has also been linked to increased likelihood of survival after being diagnosed with breast cancer 29 In one study breast cancer patients who had an average of 30 ngml of vitamin D in their blood had a 50 percent lower mortality rate compared to those who had an average of 17 ngml of vitamin D I am really grateful that the medical community has embraced vitamin D and started using it However its important to understand that the best way to get vitamin D is from sensible sun exposure and if youre really interested in optimal health and healing you will do everything in your power to get it This is one of the reasons I moved to Florida I have not swallowed vitamin D in over 8 years and still have levels over 60 ngml There are many other benefits of sunlight exposure other than vitamin D Over 40 percent of sunlight is nearinfrared rays that your body requires to structure the water in your body and stimulate mitochondrial repair and regeneration If you merely swallow vitamin D and avoid the sun you are missing a primary benefit of sensible sun exposure If you are stuck in the winter and have low vitamin D it is probably best to swallow oral vitamin D like a drug but please recognize that this is a FAR inferior way to optimize vitamin D levels and you are missing many important biological benefits when you avoid sun exposure You can learn more about vitamin Ds influence on cancer and other health problems in my previous article  The Who Why and When of Vitamin D Screening  The fact of the matter is there are many strategies that are far more beneficial in terms of breast cancer prevention than mammography So if youre hitching your fate on mammograms youre doing yourself a huge disservice For key dietary guidelines and lifestyle strategies that can help reduce your cancer risk please see my
