West Des Moines Iowa CNN Donald Trump had every reason to feel optimistic Monday His poll numbers were up he had secured two prominent endorsements in the space of a week and even the weather seemed to be cooperating with a snowstorm coming in from the west expected to hold off until after midnightAnd then he lost coming in second to Ted CruzTrump spent January in fullon attack mode against Cruz Trump questioned whether Cruz qualifies as a naturalborn citizen eligible to serve as president He went after the evangelical vote winning the endorsement of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr but didnt back up the appeals with a ground game And then he sat out the final debate opting for a rally across town at the same timeHe acknowledged Tuesday that may have backfired I think some people were disappointed that I didnt go into the debate Trump said in New HampshireTrump and his advisers dont have too much time to figure out what went wrong With Cruzs win and Marco Rubios much strongerthanexpected finish Monday night Trump now urgently confronts the danger of the Florida senator chipping away at his establishment backing in upcoming contestsThe secondplace finish should serve as a serious reality check for his campaign which is in large part based on bucking the traditional rules of campaigning and political engagement Then again nothing about Trump is conventionalPeople didnt talk about my second place Trump said Tuesday night They didnt talk about it as positively as they should haveIn the air but not on the groundThere was nothing traditional about Trumps campaign style in IowaThe Trump campaign remained tightlipped about its efforts to get voters out sharing little to nothing about its grassroots and volunteer efforts on the ground The campaign swatted away reports of a lackluster ground game insisting that its supporters in Iowa would turn out in the end because they were so eager to elect a nontraditional candidate like TrumpIt was only in the final stretch that Trump showed minimal interest in retail politicsHe began holding more than one event a day In January he made his first stop at a Pizza Ranch  the famous restaurant chain that is a favorite among presidential candidates Trump even slept at a Holiday Inn in one of his final weekends in the stateThe Texas senator crisscrossed the state ultimately completing the full Grassley by visiting all 99 counties in the state His campaign developed a massive grassroots operation that according to the campaign 12000 volunteers fanned out cross the state knocking on doors and making phone calls It also recruited dozens of pastors and county chairsRubio in the meantime came on and surprised everyone at the end After Thursdays debate there were rumblings of a Rubio rise which were tamped down by the Des Moines Register poll released two days before the caucuses that showed the Florida senator in the midteens far ahead of of the others in the establishment lane like Chris Christie and Jeb Bush but still significantly behind Trump and CruzHundreds of Rubio volunteers made phone calls to undecided voters in the days leading up to the caucuses according to campaign aides During those calls they found that a good number of Trump supporters  some frustrated with the businessmans decision to skip last weeks Fox debate  were switching over to RubioTrump had an improbable run as the national frontrunner for most of the summer and fall Then in December he started to trail Cruz in Iowa for the first time Up until that point the two men had refused to attack one another seeming to believe that voters would find a messy mudwrestling match distastefulBut at the first sign of losing ground to Cruz here Trump swiftly reversed courseTrump also jabbed at Cruzs antiestablishment credentials wondering out loud why the senator had failed to disclose large loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank for his Senate campaignThe truth is hes a nasty guy Trump said in an interview on ABCs This Week Nobody likes him Nobody in Congress likes him Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know himCruz who has tried to stay close to Trump without antagonizing the billionaire finally hit back calling his rival a man of New York values and blasting his support for eminent domain Even then Cruz and his allies seemed much more conflicted about the strategy and wary that it could backfirePrior to running for president Trump had a reputation for being many things a ruthless litigious businessman a colorful reality television star the ultimate Manhattan socialiteIt wasnt exactly the image of a Bible reading churchgoing family manBut on the stump the GOP frontrunner sought to sand down those rough edgesTwo consecutive Sundays before the Iowa caucuses Trump attended morning church services in the state even breaking from his usual practice of returning to New York City every night to sleep in his own bedAll of this has been a part of Trumps monthslong and intensifying campaign to win over evangelicals in Iowa  a sizable and influential constituency with real power to sway the outcome of the caucuses That outreach became all the more critical when Cruz  the favorite among Hawkeye State evangelical Christians  bypassed Trump in the polls for the first time in DecemberCleveland Pastor Darrell Scott a Trump backer who spearheaded an effort to coalesce AfricanAmerican pastors around the candidate said it was difficult to overstate the importance of these endorsementsPalin brings a lot of evangelical support with her Then Jerry Falwell Jr was the icing on the cake he saidA religious leader like Falwell in particular Scott said was key to convincing undecided voters and onthefence churchgoersIn Christianity the sheep tends to follow their shepherd They will trust the wisdom and trust the decision of their pastor Scott said So when my pastor thinks highly of him to endorse him there must be something thereAhead of last weeks GOP debate Trumps longrunning feud with Fox News was back in full forceThe billionaire publicly grumbled about debate moderator Megyn Kelly saying if she couldnt treat him fairly he may skip the event altogether  not the first time he had threatened to boycott a debateWe learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president the networks statement read A nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetingsInstead less than three miles down the road from the debate Trump held a rivaling event to benefit wounded veterans The venue was filled to capacity political reporters were suddenly split between covering the Trump event and the debate and the candidate boasted that he had raised nearly 6 million for veterans in a matter of hoursBut while Trump pulled off a political feat in only the way that Trump can it was clear that the decision rubbed some Iowans the wrong wayAfter all voters in the Hawkeye State take their responsibly of being first seriously and the debate that Trump skipped was the final  and critically important  debate ahead of the caucusesSteve Ziller was one of the 29 that disapprovedA farmer from Belmond Ziller was undecided between Trump and Cruz when he attended a Trump rally in Clear Lake on January 9th Soon after that event Ziller said he made the decision to support Trump But that decision quickly got undone when Trump skipped the debateI just think if hes elected president hes going to have a lot more tougher issues than dealing with a female reporter from Fox Ziller told CNN the day before the caucuses If he would have showed up to the debate and had a good debate I would have been a 100 for TrumpOn caucus night Ziller ultimately chose to back Trump But it wasnt an easy callAsked whether the decision was difficult Ziller responded Very
