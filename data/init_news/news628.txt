Today they are the source of all conspiracy theories they are the inspiration behind many fiction novels moviesIlluminati is considered as the secret organization that is really controlling the world pulling strings from behind the scene and steering the world towards a New World Order But this all started back in 1776 Ingolstadt Germany by a man named Adam Weishaupt who was a respectable professorAdam Weishaupts idea was creating a better world As a boy he was an avid reader consuming books by the latest French Enlightenment philosophers in his uncles library He was convinced that the monarchy and the church were repressing freedom of thoughtAdam Weishaupt was not he said against religion itself but rather the way in which it was practiced and imposed  His thinking he wrote offered freedom from all religious prejudices cultivates the social virtues and animates them by a great a feasible and speedy prospect of universal happiness To achieve this it was necessary to create a state of liberty and moral equality freed from the obstacles which subordination rank and riches continually throw in our way In this period Freemasonry was steadily expanding throughout Europe This secret group offered appealing alternatives to freethinkers Adam Weishaupt wanted to join this lodge however he decided later to create his ownOn the night of May 1 1776 the first Illuminati met to found the order in a forest near Ingolstadt Bathed in torchlight there were five menThere they established the rules that were to govern the orderAll future candidates for admission required the members consent a strong reputation with wellestablished familial and social connections and wealthAt the beginning the order had only 3 levels novices minervals and illuminated minervals The name Minerval referred to the Roman goddess of wisdom Minerva reflecting the orders aim to spread true knowledge or illumination about how society and the state might be reshapedA novice preparing to pass to the higher level of minerval for example had to present a detailed report on the titles of the books he owned the identity of his enemies and the weak points of his character All members had to pledge the needs of a society before their personalTHE RISE OF THE ILLUMINATI Over the years the secret order grew considerably in size and diversity By the end of 1784 the Illuminati had 2000 to 3000 membersAlthough at first the Illuminati were limited to Weishaupts students the membership expanded to included noblemen politicians doctors lawyers and jurists as well as intellectuals and some leading writers including Johann Wolfgang von GoetheThey included important people in Bavarian public life such as Baron Adolph von Knigge and the banker Mayer Amschel Rothschild who provided fundingBaron von Knigge played a very considerable role in the societys organization and expansion As a former Freemason he was in favor of adopting rites similar to theirsMembers were given secret names from famous history characters Weishaupt was Spartacus for example and Knigge was PhiloWith more members the number of levels in the Illuminati had to increase There were 13 degrees of initiation divided into three classesHERE IS THE COMPLETE LIST OF ILLUMINATI CLASSES AND LEVELS FIRST CLASS Each novice was initiated in humanitarian philosophy until he became a minerval He then received the orders statutes and could attend meetingsInitiate Novice Minerval Illuminatus Minor SECOND CLASS The various degrees in this class were inspired by Freemasonry The illuminatus major supervised recruitment and the illuminatus dirigens presided over the minervals meetingsApprentice Fellow Master Illuminatus Major Illuminatus Dirigens THIRD CLASS The highest degree of philosophical illumination Its members were priests who instructed lowerdegree members The lower orders of this class were themselves under the authority of a kingPriest Prince Magus King THE PROHIBITION OF ILLUMINATI The secret society stood for some controversial opinions They considered that suicide was legitimate that its enemies should be poisoned and that religion was an absurdity However when the DukeElector of Bavaria found the secret society was planning to conspire against Bavaria on behalf of Austria it was then when he issued an edict in June 1784 banning the creation of any kind of society not previously authorized by lawBavarian police found highly compromising documents including a defense of suicide and atheism a plan to create a female branch of the order invisible ink recipes and medical instructions for carrying out abortionsThe evidence was used as the basis for accusing the order of conspiring against religion and the state In August 1787 the dukeelector issued a third edict in which he confirmed that the order was prohibited and imposed the death penalty for membershipAdam Weishaupt lived the rest of his life in Gotha in Saxony where he taught philosophy at the University of GttingenThe Bavarian state considered the Illuminati dismantledTHE ILLUMINATI WAS JUST GETTING STARTED Adam Weishaupt was accused of helping to plot the French RevolutionThis was the start of a war that will give birth to some of the greatest money machines that still exist todayThe secret society shifted its goals They already had connections and knowledge They didnt need their society to be legal to existMembers chose to use the connections for making more money and profit because they realized with enough money you can control the world You can control the laws You can establish your agendas without being conflicted by less enlightened peoples opinionsThe Illuminati have been fingered in recent events such as the assassination of John F Kennedy Weishaupts ideas have also influenced the realms of popular fiction such as Dan Browns Angels  Demons and Foucaults Pendulum by Italian novelist Umberto EcoAlthough his group was allegedly disbanded Weishaupts idea still exists pulling the stringsBut this article raises one really important question Considering Adam Weishaupts first intent a state of liberty and moral equality freed from the obstacles which subordination rank and riches continually throw in our way is it possible for this to be achieved and integrated into a society where people are not fully awakenLife Coach Code SOURCE
