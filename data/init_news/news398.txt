Republicans keep saying theyll be ready to act if the Supreme Court upholds the big legal challenge to Obamacare thereby wiping out financial assistance for millions of people in twothirds of the states  With the clock ticking down to a ruling its gotten awfully hard to take the GOPs vows seriouslyMost experts expect the court to rule on King v Burwell as the case is known on or around June 29 which is the last official day of its term A victory for the plaintiffs would cut off tax credits that residents in Florida Texas and 32 other states now use to pay for health insurance they obtain through Healthcaregov the federally operated marketplaceThe ranks of the uninsured would swell by more than 8 million according to an estimate by the Urban Institute The loss of so many customers would likely force insurance companies to raise premiums and withdraw altogether from some markets affecting even those customers buying directly from insurers rather than through Obamacares marketplacesUnder Supreme Court rules an order would typically take effect within 25 days of its announcement from the bench In theory the court could issue a stay delaying its impact In practice legal experts consider such a move both unlikely and of questionable significance given the tight deadlines that insurers and state regulators face for setting next years premiumsInfographic by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post  Leaders of the Republican Party have cheered on the lawsuit in some cases filing formal friendofthecourt briefs in support of it They have also promised  in opeds speeches and interviews  to craft a transitional plan or some kind of offramp if the lawsuit is successful The goals of such plans Republican leaders have said would be to minimize disruption for the people who now depend upon Affordable Care Act tax credits for their insurance while crafting a longterm replacement scheme that would serve the public better than President Barack Obamas health care law has   Rep Paul Ryan RWis was among those who made that promise back in early February shortly after he took over as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee We have to have a contingency plan Ryan said We think we need to have an option a plan for these states that might find themselves in this difficult position  Ryans committee arguably the most powerful in the House has direct jurisdiction over health care financing So how many hearings has it held about these contingency plans  ZeroOver in the Senate Ron Johnson RWis has introduced actual legislation and it has nearly 30 cosponsors including Mitch McConnell RKy who is the majority leader But the bill is at best a first draft at legislation and so far neither the Finance Committee which has the most power over health legislation nor the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee which also has some jurisdiction has sought testimony or scheduled a hearing  about either the Johnson bill specifically or more generally what to do if the Supreme Court stops the tax credits in those 34 states   No in the six months since the Supreme Court announced it would hear King v Burwell Republicans in Congress have held exactly one formal hearing that focused on the subject It took place last week before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee But the Small Business Committee is among the least powerful in Congress and it has virtually no jurisdiction over health care financing issues That may explain why it attracted very little interest  even from committee members only a handful of whom bothered to show up  A generous takeaway from that hearing  and lack of others  is that Republicans are thinking about and working on health care plans much more intensely behind the scenes Brendan Buck Ryans spokesman pointed out to The Huffington Post that Republican leaders have convened a working group to craft a postKing contingency plan  with Ryan among its leaders That group is now meeting three times a week Buck said Theyre informal but its an active group   In addition several highprofile conservative intellectuals have been talking and writing actively about how Republicans ought to react if the court takes their side  and what kind of health care plan Republicans should be proposing as an alternative to the Affordable Care Act regardless of how the justices rule Avik Roy the Manhattan Institute scholar and Forbes columnist now working with former Texas Gov Rick Perrys political action committee has been outspoken on the need for an alternative Philip Klein longtime writer on health care and now managing editor of the Washington Examiner has written a whole book on the subject  But theres a reason that congressional Democrats spent literally years holding hearings on health care reform and then in 2009 focusing intensely on legislation for several months The hearings were sometimes acrimonious and for reform advocates the media coverage that testimony and questions generated was a source of neverending grief At the same time these hearings before the committees that actually had jurisdiction on the issues were necessary to craft a solution that could accomplish the reforms main goals and then rally enough support to make it through CongressThe kinds of plans Republicans seem to have in mind would require making equally difficult tradeoffs and uniting even more fractious groups Johnsons bill for example would limit enrollment in plans only to those who already have them and it would eliminate the individual mandate  the requirement that people get coverage or pay a fine  in all of the states That would force insurers to raise premiums or maybe exit markets altogetherOther Republicans have discussed altering the Affordable Care Acts regulation on premiums so that insurers could charge less to younger people But reducing premiums for the young means raising them for the old which might be hard for Republicans to pull off given that older voters are now their political baseJohnsons bill has gone to the Congressional Budget Office for a formal estimate on its impact a Johnson spokesperson confirmed Thats meaningful  and more than can be said of most proposals that Republicans have floated on oped pages recently But if Republicans were serious about crafting a proposal thats capable of avoiding disruption and passing Congress they would have started hashing out these arguments months agoOf course the absence of a public effort to match the public rhetoric matters only if Republicans are actually serious about passing a plan They may not be Their real goals may be purely cosmetic  to insulate the party from a political backlash should millions of people suddenly lose health insurance and more immediately to ease the anxiety of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy either of whom might hesitate to issue a ruling with such potentially devastating consequences to so many people  The lack of hearings obviously doesnt prove that Republican leaders have such ulterior cynical motives But it makes that theory a lot more plausible
