Fox Businesss Tuesday night Republican debate wasequal parts thuddingly dull and thoroughly truthaverse savefor one interesting moment when Rand Paul took a moment to troll Marco Rubio about defense spending and not just because Paul managed to unnerve the usually slick as a snail Rubio Admitting that we spend a lot of money and thats not very fiscally conservative is a third rail in Republican politics and yet there Paul was looking alive hollering Weneed a safe country but did you know we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combinedI want a strong national defense but I dont want us to be bankruptIt wasnt like he declared himself an atheist or anything but in a debate format geared towards maximum tedium it was pretty entertaining Indeed for people who dont live in the conservative bubble it helped make Rand Paul seem like the sanest person on the stage last night though thats like a 2yearold beating a bunch of newborns in a foot race But the audience wasnt really having it Paul got a smattering of applause but its not clear if its because anyone agreed with him or that they just liked that someone was bothering to entertain them for a momentAt this point the only reasonable cause Paul has to run for president is that he hates Republicans and enjoys exposing every chance he gets how they are a bunch of lying hypocrites with this entire small government talking point It cant be that he wants to win since trolling people about their delusions is not known as a way to win friendsTo hear conservatives talk this principle of small government is sacred inviolable and the supposed Democratic opposition to it stems no doubt from their ideological commitment to evil Why we are supposed to love small government is rarely explained Like daylight savings time or that rule about not taking the Lords name in vain it just is and not for we mere mortals to questionIfyou do start to question it it becomes immediately apparent that finding a Republican who legitimately wants to shrink the size of the government on principle is harder than finding a Republican who has warm things to say about Planned Parenthood On the contrary one strong consistent trend over the past century is that Republican presidential administrations contribute more to the federal debt than Democratic ones Even though almost no one knows it deficit spending under President Obama has been consistently dropping now shrunk by a 1 trillion compared to what the federal government had to spend to recover from the Bush recession Principled adherence to small government would simply not lead to voting Republican if only out of fear that all that warmongering rhetoric would lead to more expensive adventure wars like the previous President Bush gave usAnd as Paul compulsively points out this is partially because Republicans love the military Watching Tuesdays debate you would get the strong impression that cutting even one dollar of military spending is the equivalent ofsending a cruise ship full of free weapons to ISIS and bringing them over to the United States to be let loose in Miami When you actually start to prod conservatives you will quickly discover that small government isnt a principle at all and doesnt even touch the truly sacred principles like profligate defense spendingThats because small government is and always will be a cover story for the real principle at stake which is halting government activities aimed at ameliorating injustice and inequality If you listen carefully to any Republican who is not Rand Paul youll see that the concept of big government only encompasses two ideas Regulations on business that protect workers or the environment and social spendingTo be clear even the category of social spending that qualifies as big government is exceedingly limited Anything spent on middle class or wealthy people is not big government but if the money goes to help lower income peopleespecially if they are perceived as disproportionately people of colorthen all hell breaks loose In practice this means that Republican voters dont treat Medicare and Social Security or other social safety net programs for the middle class as big government In numbers that means that only about 10 of federal welfare spending is considered big government by your average Republicanpolitician Consider The term big government doesnt cover Social Security which is a quarter of the federal budget But it is used frequently to slur Obamaphonesa program that provides low cost cell phones to low income peoplewhich costs our federal government 0 because its paid for directly by telecom companies and not through federal taxes And of course big government is rarely if ever used by conservatives to slur unnecessary regulations passed on abortion clinics for the sole purpose of reducing abortion access or to raise the alarm about police overreach such as stop and frisk Big and small government are never defined by expenditures or by levels of government intrusiveness The terms instead reflect whose interests are being served Are wealthy people being served at the expense of working people or is white privilege beingprotected Then its small government Are underprivileged people getting a leg up or are workers being protected Then its big government In conservative parlance its big government to tell Hobby Lobby they cant interfere with their employees reproductivechoices but its small government if legislators pass a bunch of laws interfering with womens reproductive choices The consistent theme here is not the actual size of the government but whether the goalinterfering with womens reproductive choicesis being advanced None of this is new or particularly hard to figure out Which is why it remains such a mystery that Rand Paul is running for president Surely he must know that small government is a code term for squash the little guy and not an actual declaration of principles about government spending and overreach You cant spend more than five minutes around Republicans without seeing that quite clearly Nor does he really articulatewhy you should want a literal small government if its not to advance the squash the little guy principle There is no converting people to his point of view since small government doesnt appeal as a principle without this overarching need to reassert unjust power systems Hell even Paul doesnt really believe his own nonsense since Mr Small Government still wants to use government power to force unwilling women to give birth The only explanation that makes sense is that Pauls a troll and that his campaign is a very expensive way to get some lulz at the expense of other Republicans In an election cycle featuring Donald Trump its not even the oddest motivation there is to run for president
