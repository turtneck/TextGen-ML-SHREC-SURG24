Scott McConnell The American Conservative October 31 2016 Editors Note This article is worth reading in its entirety A redacted version is below Twentyone years ago I was assigned by Commentary to write about Jared Taylortoday known as one of the eminences of the altright Taylor had written a grim book on American race relations Paved With Good Intentions  which had been published by a mainstream house and was widely if critically reviewed Though unusually skeptical about the prospect of blacks and whites living together harmoniously in the United States it stopped well short of any systematically racist argument The book had several fans among New Yorkers I knew prominent in journalism and city politics When I referred to it in passing in a New York Post column we quickly received a fax from Abe Foxman of the AntiDefamation League stating that Taylor was far more extremist than I had let on Curious to explore further I queried Commentary where I then did most of my nonnewspaper writingand they were interested I interviewed Taylor read back issues of his monthly newsletter American Renaissance  AR  and drafted a piece AR was devoted primarily to demonstrating that in American history racism was as accepted as apple pie and that this was by no means a bad thing It contained large doses of the evolutionary and biological racial thought fairly commonplace amongst American elites in the 20s and 30s A central contention was that the United States could not thrive as an increasingly multiracial and multicultural country and that American whites were facing a kind of cultural dispossession I summarized this quoting liberally and concluded that the endgame vision of the AR crowd was potentially horrific leading to national dissolution or civil war while adding that continued mass immigration really would put the common culture of America under grave stress If immigration rates went down Taylor and AR would remain fringe players If they rose white racial anxieties would bubble to the surface and Taylor might one day have his moment The piece was never published Neal Kozodoy Commentary s editor told me I had indulged Taylor too much and asked for a shorter tighter rewrite By then my brief summer vacation had ended other tasks intervened and I eventually lost interest Jared Taylors moment has not arrived but clearly he has edged into the national conversation He has been pictured and quoted in an antiTrump attack ad produced by Hillary Clintons campaign he has been a guest on Diane Rehms show on NPR and his core ideas have been broadcastand excoriatedin magazines and websites great and small He is now touted as one of the intellectual leaders of the altright a diffuse movement of uncertain significance but one deemed sufficiently important by the Clinton campaign for Hillary to devote a large portion of an August campaign speech to it Donald Trumpwho has almost surely never read a single article by an altright figureis claimed by Clinton and other liberals to be under its influence and propagating its doctrines The truth is quite different parts of the altright have raised their own visibility by attaching themselves to Trump At the same time Trump and his unanticipated success in winning the Republican nomination are symptoms of the same political and civilizational crisis that makes altrightish themesat least in a more or less bowdlerized and softcore formcompelling to a growing number of people  Taylor 65 is old by altright standards and is an atypical representative though just how much so is difficult to discern for much of the altright is anonymous The movement fields no candidates publishes few books or pamphlets It is a creature of the web strongest on Twitter Pepe an internet cartoon frog is an altright characterand has actually been formally denounced by the Clinton campaign Altright internet trolling sometimes ugly blatantly racist and antiSemitic is also part of the movement There is some debate whether it should be taken as an offensive and unfunny jokemerry keyboard pranksters who enjoy pretending to be internet neoNazis rather like punk rock bands of the late 70s deploying Nazi imagery for shock effector is something more sinister a genuine resurgence of hardcore racism and antiSemitism Likely its more the former but its also likely that the altright banner has given the minute number of genuine neoNazis in the country a kind of protective shield Richard Spencer may serve as a bridge between older white nationalists such as Taylor and a younger altright internet crowd Its mistaken to call him or anyone else a leaderthe movement has no procedure for choosing leadersbut he is clearly a pole of influence Hes an intellectual entrepreneur who arrived in DC roughly ten years ago from a Duke graduate program He worked at TAC for seven or eight months where he was kind of a square peg in a round hole Sometime thereafter his ideology began to crystallize He started a website called AlternativeRightcom and later revitalized a whitenationalist think tank the National Policy Institute and launched a journal Radix  Spencer can be engaging and amusing but his core doctrine is likely to remain barring some sort of Mad Maxtype Armageddon well outside what most Americans would consider plausible or desirable What is the doctrine At a recent press conference in DC Spencer explained that the core of altright thought is race Race is real race matters race is foundational to human identity You cannot understand who you are without race Many people would agreeat least privately or partiallywith the first two assertions but the third is the critical one and has never been true historically or sociologically Not that there havent been groups of selfproclaimed panAsian or panAfrican intellectuals who sought to make it true Spencer fits into their tradition In any case Spencer hopes somehow to spur whites into a kind of panwhite racial consciousness and galvanize them to become aware of who we are and to prepare themselves one day somehow to form a white ethnostate He refers to Theodore Herzls propagation of Zionism as a model for how such an ethnostate seemingly a distant dream could be eventually achieved He fails to add that it took a Holocaust to make a Jewish State a reality snip Prior to last fall and before Hillary introduced the altright to a national audience Spencer and Taylor held periodic conferences that could gather perhaps 200 people These were often held under shameful harassment by the leftist antiFirst Amendment crowd but thats a different issue Spencer says he sees the altright as a vehicle that will influence politicians and intellectuals taking as its model neoconservatism snip snip What spurred this sudden emergence It was not whitenationalist conferences or doctrine which had been around forever but events Last year the West received a nasty highvoltage shock of political reality The first jolt was the Charlie Hebdo attack in January France had experienced jihadist murders before but this time the strike came in the center of Paris and France was alarmed to find no small amount of support for the killing among its five million Muslim residents many of them second and thirdgeneration citizens That spring and summer European newspapers began to fill with reports of intensifying migrant and refugee flows driven partially by the Syrian civil war and partially by the expansion and streamlining of peoplesmuggling routes from Africa snip By 2016 the welcome had grown cold Hundreds of migrants sexually assaulted German women in and around the central train station of Cologne on New Years Eve a mass assault that German authorities initially tried to cover up snip If the sexual assaults could be seen as the cultural edge of the migrant surge it was more difficult for even liberal antiracist European leaders to ignore or explain away the terrorism aspect The Charlie Hebdo attack was followed by the mass slaughters at the Bataclan theater in Paris at the Brussels Airport then on a seaside promenade in Nice culminating in the execution by knife of an aging French priest by two assimilated Muslim migrants in his church outside of Rouen snip snip Richard Spencer may be incorrect about America but one remark from his press conference in DC last month was arresting The refugee crisis in Europe is something like a world war It is in many ways a race war In terms of direct violence it does not resemble World War I or II It is a demographic struggle a struggle for identity a struggle of who is going to define the continent period It is a new kind of war a postmodern war a war through immigration There are no trenches no guns But it is a world war Of course it is not primarily a race war Religion or religious culture plays a major and perhaps decisive role in the conflict and conflict between Christendom and Islam is not new by any means Still there is something in the bluntness of Spencers depiction that rings more true than 90 percent of what appears in the American media which invariably depicts the refugee crisis in humanitarian terms and terrorism as a barely related lawenforcement issue It is surely not a coincidence that the altright began making strides into American consciousness precisely at the moment Muslims were surging into Europe as refugees while others were blowing up Parisian rock concerts or mounting mass sexual assaults on European women snip Whatever one might say about the altright it is not perplexed Few other political factions in America had a vocabulary ready foror even made an effort to interpret seriouslywhat was going on in Europe at a time when many people were seeking one snip American developments in the fall of last year while less critical than those in Europe also spurred the altright The rise of Black Lives Matter put into question one of the outstanding domesticpolicy advances of the past generation the dramatic reduction in urban crime rates which has made possible the revitalization of many cities The lie which held that Americas police forces were chock full of marauding racist murderers suddenly became mainstream repeated endlessly on television and pushed in only slightly more subtle fashion by Obamas own attorney general Meanwhile some urban neighborhoods were looted by rioters and others saw dramatic spikes in their murder rates snip It was predictable that such developments touching on visceral areas of personal security national sovereignty and freedom of expression would stir desire for a muscular response Donald Trump filled the bill if not always eloquently So too occasionally did segments of the more established conservative media But there was a market for a pushback as scathing and polemically unafraid as the lefts own polemicists which might not have been the case four years earlier This as much as anything accounts for the emergence of the altright at least in its less ideologically extreme iterations snip And though Samuel Huntington was a famous and deeply respected Harvard political scientist and a lifelong Democrat the concerns of Clash are those raised implicitly by Trump and explicitly by what I call the softcore elements of the altright There is of course much racism in American history and there are enormous crimes for which Europe continues to strive to atone But neither antiracism nor respect for other cultures should be turned into a national or civilizational suicide pact Here what Irving Kristol famously wrote about Sen Joseph McCarthy comes to mind There is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy he like them is unequivocally antiCommunist About the spokesmen for American liberalism they feel they know no such thing In the now global faceoff between Western civilization versus mass immigration fused with multiculturalism Kristols words describe with uncanny accuracy the dichotomy between Donald Trump and his supporters on one hand and those most feverishly denouncing him on the other Among the former for all their faults are those who want unequivocally Western civilization to survive About the latter no such thing is certain
