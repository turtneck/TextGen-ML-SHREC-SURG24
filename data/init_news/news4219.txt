Washington Free Beacon October 27 2016 CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law Its not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress Rye said on CNNs New Day The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly Alisyn is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal which is what they said they wanted to do and replace Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent according to data released this week by the Obama administration Indiana will see its rates slightly go down but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans   817
