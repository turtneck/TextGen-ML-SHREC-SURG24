Baltimore  When a few dozen members of the 300 Men March movement paraded somberly past William Stewarts West Baltimore stoop Tuesday afternoon spreading their organizations message of peace and calm in matching black Tshirts the 27yearold rolled his eyesHe begrudgingly returned their Peace brother and How yall doing greetings But he doesnt really agree with the stance the men whove dubbed themselves Baltimores antiviolence movement  pleading for a stop to the violence and even physically separating protesters from police  have takenIts not that Stewart is completely for the riots that erupted Monday after the funeral ofFreddie Gray a 25yearold black man who died on April 19 after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody But his personal experiences with the police and general hopelessness about the way people like he and Gray  who he says was a neighborhood acquaintance  are treated wont let him be too strongly against them eitherDo I condone what they did Hell no Am I okay with it Yes I amAt the end of the day I dont condone them setting stores on fire he said from his perch just blocks from where Gray lived in the citys Gilmor Homes locals call it Gilmor Projects public housing development on a dark street with faded multicolored rowhousesBut it got the point across Do I condone what they did Hell no Am I okay with it Yes I am Because at the end of the day you mean to tell me it takes 3000 people to go all around one town for the mayor and the president to say something about what goes on in Baltimore It should have been happening for yearsStewart is one of the everyday people in West Baltimore who are invisible in the narrative that tends to pit the young people Mayor Stephanie RawlingsBlake called thugs and Obama called criminals against the ministers and civil rights leaders whove made desperate pleas at press conferences for positive change and working together Stewart and others like him see the story of Grays death and the possibility that the officers will go unpunished as utterly predictable They may not have participated in or celebrated the violence  the looting the setting fires the destruction of local businesses  but theyre acutely aware that these things are exactly what forced a flood of national news outlets to show up where they live Their real despair over the alltoofamiliar topic of police misconduct means that the riots to them were understandable And even in some ways rightYall mad at the police I know I get it a middleaged woman with a scarf wrapped around her dreadlocks shouted into the mic at a West Baltimore block party when it was her speak from atop a box that served as a makeshift stage In fact just about everyone gets it among black people in West Baltimore theres simply no question about whether grievances with the police are legitimateThis problem is well documented The Baltimore Sun reported last September that the city has shelled out more than 5 million in the past four years in lawsuits accusing police officers of assaulting citizens  most of whom were AfricanAmerican and almost all of whom were ultimately cleared of criminal charges The article chronicles outrageous brutality against victims including a 15yearold boy a pregnant woman and a 65yearold church deaconRough rides when police vans are driven recklessly sometimes seriously injuring passengers who are handcuffed and not wearing seat belts  are common enough that the Sun reported police have multiple alternative nicknames for the practice including screen test and bringing them up frontIn response to the Suns investigation into brutality lawsuits Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez who leads the departments Professional Standards and Accountability Bureau told the paper that officers are mandated to police in a manner that doesnt violate constitutional rights We will not let officers get away with any wrongdoing Rodriguez told the Sun in 2014 It will not be toleratedThe people who are living it though dont talk about wrongdoing They dont talk about police misconduct or use phrases like a few bad policemen or racially biased policing that you hear in media accounts of whats become a regular national story sinceMichael Brown was killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson Missouri last AugustWhen they complain they usually just say the police  suggesting that in their minds lawless cruel treatment is not a recent plague or a problem with a few bad apples but rather a permanent characteristic of the entire departments identityA 45yearold woman hovering half behind the screen door of a rowhouse just across from the Gilmor Homes who didnt want to give her last name shot nervous glances at her 23yearold son who sat visiting a friend in front of the house two doors down I worry about him every day about something happening to him Freddie Gray could have been mine It could have been anyones child she said adding Im as worried about something happening to him with the police as I am about anyone else It doesnt matter who you are They think were all the same Stewart who remembered Gray as a nice kid and a totally regular guy who never hurt anyone said he himself could have easily been the one with the deadly spinal cord injury after an encounter with officers Thats how they treat us he said Theyll beat the shit out of you and lock you up Ive been arrested unjustly plenty of timesHis neighbor a 27yearold named Melvin who only wanted to give his first name called the Baltimore City Police Department the biggest gang out hereHe ticked off their tactics rather casually Theyve slapped my face for nothing  they take us to other districts just to get us beat up Theyll drop you somewhere far from where you live and leave you theyll take the battery out of your phone Were talking years and years of this shit Peoples fed up with itThe consensus that this experience is so commonplace  that being antagonized by the police without any remedy is simply part of life for black people in certain parts of Baltimore  is jarring I havent met a young person in their teenage years who hasnt been harassed said Noche Dias a 26yearold youth organizer from New York City who traveled to Baltimore after Grays death Ive talked to mothers who have told me their sons were killed by police and everyone says theyve been treated like a criminal EveryoneBaltimores mostly young protestors who were blamed for multiple police injuries and looting Monday night  police were also caught on video throwing rocks back at them  have been dismissed as everything from wholly irrational to purely criminalBy the end of the night police said20 officers were injured and over two dozen people were arrested A CVS drugstore and a senior center had been destroyed by fire TheNational Guard was called in a state of emergency was declared in the city Baltimore public schools were closed and a weeklong curfew was put in placeAn earlier statement by Mayor Stephanie RawlingsBlake appeared to have been ignored It is idiotic to think that by destroying your city youre going to make life better for anybody shed said Saturdayas the protests first became violent Too many people have spent generations building up this city for it to be destroyed by thugs who in a very senseless way are trying to tear down what so many have fought forAt a press conference Tuesday Obama echoed these sentiments saying rioters should be treated as criminals and accusing them not only distracting from multiple days of peaceful protests that were focused on entirely legitimate concerns but of being wholly counterproductive Theyre destroying and undermining opportunities and businesses in their own communities he saidBut according to Mark D Smaller the president of the American Psychoanalytic Association the psychology of rioting means it shouldnt be written off quite so easily as pointless destruction These groups can become the vehicle for expressing anger rage and helplessness he said in an email to Vox One must keep in mind that this behavior is not simply random but a group or communitys way of communicating their frustration at chronically not beinglistened to responded to and finally marginalizedRaphael Blake 40 who was walking somberly alone through Tuesdays block party sees riots as more than random Thats why he said while the violence saddens him the protesters have good reason to be skeptical of the refrain of political and religious leaders  and people like the members of the 300 Men March group  that the youth must calm down and look for peaceful solutionsIf you protest peacefully they dont give a shitYou want to sit down and compromise and talk but about what These mayors these preachers theyre trying to sugarcoat it but the youth dont want to hear that shit cause theyre rubbing elbows with the oppressors The kids might not understand the policy and politics exactly but they understand whats happening to them They might as well shut down the system he said with a shrug Theyre already set upStewart said his personal experience  and his disappointment with the recommended peaceful approach  wont allow him to criticize those who took the response to Grays death in a more destructive direction I was one of the ones who started the peaceful protests  the first seven days after Grays death when it was fine and dandy I walked about 101 miles in peace But if you protest peacefully they dont give a shit he saidSome even see the riots as rational According to Heather Gautney associate professor in Fordham Universitys department of sociology and author of Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era this analysis makes some sense Critics of the rioters claim there are alternative more rational means of making social change and realizing justice but what are these means she asked The rioters in Baltimore and elsewhere know that the chances of making change within the system are few  that the system has turned against them  so they react with rage a sense of abandon and revenge and desire to tear it down and start anewWhy would you destroy your own neighborhood is a question that rang out on cable news as cameras recorded protesters destroying parts of Ferguson last summer and again as buildings burned in Baltimore Monday The implication is that the destruction and violence is a meaningless illogical response  hurting ones own neighborhood to protest the actions of outsiders But Gautney said its wrong to paint all riots as irrational outbursts Riots like the ones we are seeing in Baltimore and before that in Los Angeles in 1992 should be viewed as rational responses to injustice she said Riots highlight the injustice and violence thats prevalent in impoverished neighborhoods in this countryAnd Stewart  as someone who lives in one of those neighborhoods  can see how that could make the destruction ultimately worth it The CVS They got insurance they can rebuild Freddie Gray had insurance but its not gonna bring back his lifeThe potential to highlight injustice is why Paul a 50yearold born and raised in Baltimore who initially dismissed this weeks looting with a resigned Its teenagers What are you gonna do said that when he saw the destruction to his community it didnt particularly hurt him It was coming he said They probably think this is gonna end up in the history books because they caused this ruckus And you know what They may be right
