Waco Texas CNN A memo has gone out to law enforcement in the wake of Sundays shooting warning officers that members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle gangs reportedly had been instructed to arm themselves and travel to north TexasObviously its something were concerned about We would encourage biker groups to stand down Theres been enough bloodshed Theres been enough death here Waco police Sgt W Patrick Swanton told CNNs Anderson Cooper 360 on Monday nightBy the time the Sunday melee was over at least nine people were dead 18 were hospitalized and at least 170 were arrested and chargedThe biker gang members who began beating stabbing and shooting each other in a Texas Twin Peaks restaurant knew the police were outside they just didnt care Swanton saidFor two months police concerned with the bikers presence at Twin Peaks which hosted special events for its leatherclad clientele had patrolled outside  and not in plain clothes and unmarked cars eitherWe wanted our presence to be known Swanton told reporters They knew we were seconds away and going to respond That mattered not to themThe United Clubs of Waco billed Sundays event as the Texas Region 1 Confederation of Clubs and Independents meeting Before the restaurant and surrounding parking lots became a bloody battleground the Waco Police Department had 18 officers on the scene including an assistant chief and tactical officers along with four officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety Swanton saidAn altercation in the bathroom seems to have sparked the violence Shots were fired inside the eatery and a brawl spilled onto the patio area before scores of men flooded the parking lot in broad daylight Some bikers were beaten with brass knuckles clubs and chains while others were stabbed or shot Swanton saidWhen police responded  within 30 to 45 seconds because of their proximity  the bikers turned their weapons on law enforcement he saidOur officers took fire and responded appropriately returning fire the sergeant saidAs police rounded up suspects and paramedics tended to the injured investigators found eight bodies  three in the parking lot behind Twin Peaks four near the front of the restaurant and one that had been dragged behind a nearby establishment Swanton said More than 100 weapons were confiscated as well he saidAnother victim died at a hospital where doctors treated patients for gunshots stab wounds bluntforce trauma or some combination of the threeAccording to a law enforcement source preliminary information indicates that four of the bikers killed were killed by police gunfire The investigation continues and the ballistics will be analyzed to determine for certain who was responsible for each shootingSwanton called it the most violent and gruesome scene that I have dealt with in three and a half decades of law enforcementThe scores of suspects who hail from five different biker gangs remained locked up in the McLennan County Jail on Monday facing charges of engaging in organized crime Swanton saidProsecutors and investigators could level other charges  and capital murder charges are expected to be among them given the body count  but the organized crime charge is pretty serious he saidIt doesnt get much more significant than that he saidMcLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that bond was being set at 1 million for each of the 170 people in custodySwanton would not release the names of the gangs involved Photos from the scene showed bikers wearing the insignias of the Cossacks Bandidos Scimitars and Vaqueros but it was not clear if the photographed gang members were involved in the fightingAs Swanton briefed reporters at the crime scene Monday afternoon 24 hours after the brawl he said tactical units remained on the scene to protect journalists and investigators Police hoped to finish processing the scene by sundown he saidThe Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission shut down the Twin Peaks location known for bike nights and its risque dress code for servers for the next week It wasnt a punitive measure Swanton said rather it was closed because theres enough of a reason to believe that more violence would occur there had they been allowed to remain open for the next sevenday period he saidLater Monday morning the commission said it was suspending the restaurants liquor license for those seven days while its agents investigate what happened The investigation could yield anything from a fine to the permanent revocation of Twin Peaks liquor license commission spokesman Chris Porter saidThere have been no previous complaints or actions taken against the eatery he addedWe are in the people business and the safety of the employees and guests in our restaurants is priority one the restaurant chains statement read Unfortunately the management team of the franchised restaurant in Waco chose to ignore the warnings and advice from both the police and our company and did not uphold the high security standards we have in place to ensure everyone is safe at our restaurantsIt further said the corporate office would be revoking their franchise agreement immediately Our sympathies continue to be with the families of those who died and are very thankful no employees guests police officers or bystanders were hurt or injuredThe Waco restaurants Facebook account which had been a landing page for harsh criticism of the franchise was deleted shortly thereafterSwanton slammed Twin Peaks after the bloodshed Sunday saying the franchise failed to help avoid trouble and ignored the police departments advice to try to keep biker gangs away from the restaurantAre we frustrated Sure because we feel like there may have been more that could have been done by a business to prevent this Swanton saidHe said Twin Peaks has a right to deny entry to known biker gangsBefore word came of the franchise being revoked Jay Patel operating partner at the Waco Twin Peaks said his staff was cooperating with policeWe are horrified by the criminal violent acts that occurred outside of our Waco restaurant today Patel said Sunday night on Facebook We share in the communitys traumaThe franchise released a statement Monday saying it was working hard to learn the facts about the shootingIt is important to clarify that to the best of our knowledge law enforcement officials did not ask either the Waco restaurant operator with whom they spoke several times or the Twin Peaks franchisor to cancel the patio reservation that was made on SundayBased on the information to date we also believe that the violence began outside in the area of the parking lot and not inside our restaurant or on our patio as has been widely reported it readEven after the chaos subsided Waco police continued arresting people arriving at the scene with weaponsSwanton warned other biker gang members against coming to Waco to reignite the violenceWe have been getting reports throughout the day that bikers from out of state are headed this way he told KTVT on Sunday We would encourage them not to because we have plenty of space in our county jail to put them there
