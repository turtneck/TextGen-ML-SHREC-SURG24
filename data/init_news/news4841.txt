Even as Hillary Clinton has stepped up her rhetorical assault on Wall Street her campaign and allied super PACs have continued to rake in millions from the financial sector a sign of her deep and lasting relationships with banking and investment titansThrough the end of December donors at hedge funds banks insurance companies and other financial services firms had given at least 214 million to support Clintons 2016 presidential run  more than 10 percent of the 1578million contributed to back her bid according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings by The Washington PostThe contributions helped Clinton reach a fundraising milestone By the end of 2015 she had brought in more money from the financial sector during her four federal campaigns than her husband did during his quartercentury political careerIn all donors from Wall Street and other financial services firms have given 441 million to support Hillary Clintons campaigns and allied super PACs compared with 397 million in backing that former president Bill Clinton received from the industry according to campaign finance records dating back to 1974 that have been compiled by The PostNearly half of the financialsector donations made to support Hillary Clintons current presidential run have come from just two wealthy financiers billionaire investor George Soros who gave 7 million last year to the proClinton super PAC Priorities USA Action and hedgefund manager S Donald Sussman who gave the group 25 millionMost of their money was donated in December as Clinton wastaking an increasingly tough stance toward the industry in an effort to blunt the populist appeal of her opponent Sen Bernie Sanders of VermontI believe strongly that we need to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again she declared at a campaign stop in West Des Moines Iowa on Jan24 adding No bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jailClintons success at raising millions from major Wall Street players  even as she blasts some of their most lucrative practices  shows how she continues to benefit from relationships she and her husband forged over decadesMany of those supporting her now have been involved with the Clintons since 1992 when a network of young bankers and investors mobilized to raise money for Bill Clintons first White House run including some who went on to serve in his administrationI feel like I know her well enough to know that she is a very rational and practical and smart person said Sussman who helped Bill Clinton in 1992 and has since hosted fundraisers for both Clintons at his Connecticut home And in fact it will help theindustry if there is more transparency more enforcement of regulations  even perhaps stronger regulations  so that the investor public has confidence in the marketsAs Sanders has put her on the defensive about her Wall Street contributions Clinton has responded that the campaign money does not influence her approach to regulating the financial industryAnybody who knows me who thinks they can influence me name anything theyve influenced me on Just name one thing Clinton said Wednesday night at a televised CNN forum in New Hampshire Im out here every day saying Im going to shut them down Im going after themClinton points to her proposals to rein in the sector  such as a new risk fee on large financial institutions and increased penalties for financial crimes  as evidence that she cannot be swayedShe believes that the measure of our success must be defined by how much incomes rise for hardworking families not just CEOs and money managers said campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin The hundreds of thousands of people who have supported Hillarys campaign know thats what shes fighting forOn the trail Clinton regularly cites the support she has from Wall Street reform advocates such as former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank who coauthored the 2010 DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection ActFrank said in an interview that he was not concerned that Clinton would be beholden to Wall Street because of the industrys donations noting that he also has taken contributions from banksThe plan she has put forward is tougher and better than Sanderss Frank said Even for people who dont want to trust her integrity  and I do  if she is president of the United States and she has taken strong public positions on these things  her ability to back down in favor of a campaign contribution is nonexistentStill Clintons deep ties to the financial sector have emerged as one of her biggest obstacles as Sanders casts her as a friend of the big banks Most progressives that I know dont raise millions of dollars from Wall Street he tweeted Wednesday Only about 75000 of the 75 million Sanders has raised for his 2016 campaign has come from donors in the finance sector according to data from the Center for Responsive PoliticsEarlier in the campaign Clinton tried to explain her connections to the industry in part by noting that she represented Wall Street as a US senator from New York In one debate in November she appeared to suggest that campaign donations she received from financial services firms came in response to her support for New York City after the 911 terrorist attacksAs Sanderss excoriations of Wall Street have helped him gain traction the former secretary of state has sought to ramp up her own rhetoric matching his tone of outrage and indignationBernie Sanderss campaign brings in jawdropping 20 million in JanuaryIm really proud of my plan that it is driving the Republicans and Wall Street crazy Clinton said in Dover NH on Wednesday adding They know that I know how to stop them from ever hurting us againClinton has called out specific companies such as Pfizer and Johnson Controls for conducting corporate inversions  a merger with a foreign counterpart for tax benefitsOn the tax code they call that an inversion I call it a perversion she said Wednesday And Im going to go right after thatAt the same time however Clinton continues to collect money from financiers who are benefiting from some of the deals she decries Among those who have raised at least 100000 for her campaign is Blair Effron a founding partner of Centerview Partners a boutique investment firm that played a role in the Pfizer and Johnson Controls inversion negotiations A Centerview spokesman declined to commentIn December Effron attended a joint fundraiser for Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee held at the Manhattan home of Blackstone Group President Hamilton Tony James and his wife as first reported by the Wall Street Journal The featured guest was legendary investor Warren Buffett and attendees included Byron Wien a vice chairman at Blackstone Wesley Edens cofounder of Fortress Investment Group and Cliff Robbins chief executive of Blue Harbour GroupClintons reliance on such figures for financial support alarms some on the left who are already wary of the ties she and her husband have to Robert Rubin the former Goldman Sachs cochairman who became Bill Clintons treasury secretaryHillary Clintons tougher rhetoric and regulatory proposals are commendable said Jeff Hauser who leads the Revolving Door Project a foundationfunded effort that has joined Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass in calling for presidential candidates to commit to appointing independent regulators at the Treasury Department and other agenciesBut Hauser said she has to decide whether she wants to fully commit or have one foot on the reform wing of the Democratic Party and another on the Wall Street wingClinton scooped up Wall Street donations during her first Senate run in 2000 turning to Rubin and investment banker Roger Altman who served in her husbands administration to introduce her to key playersSince that first race the financial sector has been among the top industries that have supported her a Post analysis found last yearAlong with the 441 million the industry has donated to back her campaigns she personally earned more than 37 million for delivering paid speeches to banks and other financial services firms since leaving the State Department in 2013 personal financial disclosures showThose payments have dogged her on the campaign trail During the CNN forum Wednesday night Clinton struggled to explain why she accepted 675000 from Goldman Sachs to deliver three speeches to the bankThats what they offered she told moderator Anderson Cooper adding Theyre not giving me very much money now I can tell you that much Fine with meWith the 214 million that Wall Street has given for her current White House bid Clinton is on track to quickly exceed the nearly 23 million that she raised in her three previous campaigns combined from the PACs and employees of banks hedge funds securities firms and insurance companies according to the latest Post analysisThats in part because this is the first time Clinton is running in the era of super PACs which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations So far financialsector donors have given 174 million to her allied super PACs the analysis foundBut Clinton is also leaning on Wall Street to help finance her campaign directly as she tries to stay ahead of Sanderss robust online fundraising operation which brought in more than 20million in JanuaryLast week Sanders jabbed at Clinton for attending a fundraiser in Philadelphia at the office of investment firm Franklin Square Capital Partners days before the Iowa caucuses The event included a special acoustic performance for donors by Jon Bon Jovi A spokeswoman for the firm declined to commentMeanwhile two other finance industry fundraisers that were set to take place before the New Hampshire primary have been rescheduled for later dates The campaign declined to say whyClinton was originally supposed to attend an event in Boston on Friday organized by Jeannie and Jonathan Lavine the managing partner of Sankaty Advisors an affiliate of Bain Capital according to details obtained by the Sunlight Foundations Political Party Time The fundraiser has been rescheduled for a later date that the campaign would not revealIn addition a New York fundraiser billed as a Conversation With Hillary cohosted by Matt Mallow chief legal officer for the assetmanagement firm BlackRock originally scheduled for Jan 28 has been moved to Feb 16The next day Bill Clinton will headline a fundraiser in New York hosted by real estate investor Bal Das and Valrie Demont a lawyer who heads the USIndia practice at Pepper Hamilton specializing in international mergers and acquisitionsDas said he has not been troubled that Hillary Clinton now goes after Wall Street regularly on the campaign trailHer points are very fair said Das who was also a top fundraiser for her 2008 presidential bid She is not saying anything that someone deeply involved in the financial services sector would disagree with She is spot on pragmatic with a deep understanding of how this all does come togetherAlice Crites and Rosalind S Helderman in Washington Abby Phillip in Dover NH and John Wagner in Keene
