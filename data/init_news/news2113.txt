Heres something interesting from The Unz Review Recipient Name Recipient Email  I was born on July 20 1944 the day of the failed officers plot against Adolf Hitler That means I preceded the official dawning of the nuclear age by exactly 369 days which makes me part of the last generation to do so Im speaking not of the obliteration of two Japanese cities by Americas new wonder weapon on August 6th and 9th 1945 but of the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexican desert near Alamogordo on July 16th of that year When physicist Robert Oppenheimer  the father of the atomic bomb witnessed that explosion the line from the Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita  that famously came into his head was I am become Death the destroyer of worlds How apt it still remains more than seven decades later at a moment when nine countries possess such weapons  more than 15000 of them  in their arsenals most of which are now staggeringly more destructive than that first devastating bomb and as TomDispatch regular Michael Klare points out today some of which are closer to possible use than at any point in at least a couple of decades For those of us who lived through the years of bomb shelters atomic movie monsters  the Cuban Missile Crisis which left me age 18 fearing I might be toast in the morning the rise and fall of antinuclear movements and nuclear nightmares of a sort I still remember vividly from my youth in a way I no longer recall the dreams of last night its a horror to imagine that nuclear war is still with us even more so because in Election 2016 we have a presidential candidate who is not only ignorant about those weapons in hardtobelieve ways but who wonders why we cant use them and who might months from now have his finger on that nuclear button or rather command of the nuclear codes that could launch such a war Dont tell me that this isnt a living nightmare of the first order I find it eerie in the extreme and unnervingly apt that the Clinton campaign has brought back a living icon of our nuclear fears the little girl from the 1964 election who appeared in the famous or infamous  Daisy  ad President Lyndon Johnson ran against Republican contender Barry Goldwater who in retrospect seems like the soul of stability compared with you know whom She was then seen counting to 10 as she plucked petals off a daisy just before an ominous echoing male voice began the countdown to an atomic explosion that filled the screen Now that girl Monique Luiz  a grown woman is shown saying  The fear of nuclear war we had as children I never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again And to see that coming forward in this election is really scary Shes now 55 years old and however the Clinton campaign may be using her theres still something deeply unnerving for those of us who had hoped to outlast the nuclear age simply to see her there more than five decades later And if you think thats unnerving on the eve of the most bizarre presidential election in memory then read todays piece by Michael Klare and imagine just how unsettling in nuclear terms the years ahead may prove to be
