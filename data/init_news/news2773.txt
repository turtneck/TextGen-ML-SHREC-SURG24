Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday he was prepared to use all the powers the federal government has to get the city of Ferguson Missouri in line with the Constitution Asked if that included dismantling the police force Holder said If thats whats necessary were prepared to do thatIt sounds like a radical move on Holders part But dont get too swept up in it The DOJ doesnt exactly have the power to dismantle the Ferguson police department if the city doesnt consent  and would have to go through a lot of steps before getting that power Plus dismantling the embattled police department might not fix some of the worst problems outlined in the Justice Departments reportThe Department of Justice doesnt have the power to dismantle local police departments at will The way its probably going to work with the City of Ferguson as Holder also hinted today is by drawing up an agreement where Fergusons police would still be independent but would be monitored by the DOJ The agreement would be enforced in federal court The feds would only take over if the city failed and failed badly to make the changes laid out in the agreementThis nearly happened in Oakland in 2012 as a compromise the federal government fired the police chief but left the department under the citys control But it was a full decade after the agreement was first signedif dismantling happens itll be something the city agrees to do itself  or even suggests to begin withIf Holder really wants to tear down the Ferguson Police Department and start over the best way to do that would be to make dissolution part of the original courtenforced agreement If the city didnt agree he could sue them to do it which would also take yearsBut given how expensive its going to be for Fergusons police to comply with the likely court agreement it might actually be cheaper for them to agree to give up and try again So the possibility exists that the Ferguson police department will be dissolved  but it would almost certainly be because the city of Ferguson agreed to do it or even suggested it in the first place That also means the city would be in charge of putting together whatever is going to replace the Ferguson PDGetting rid of the police in Ferguson would only address half of the problems identified by the federal government The Department of Justice also found massive discrimination and Constitutional violations in the municipal court system including arresting people for showing up to court without being able to afford a court fee suspending drivers licenses of people who didnt even know that theyd had a court date let alone missed one and setting jail bonds not based on what someone would be able to pay but based on making the most money for the cityTheres no way the federal governments going to be satisfied if Ferguson reforms its police but leaves its courts the way they are Disbanding the police department might allow the city to focus on reforming the courts but it wont be enough on its ownMore importantly though who would do police work in Ferguson after the Ferguson police force gets dismantledthe actions of other law enforcement agencies in st louis countyhave contributed to a general distrust of policeTypically a nearby police force is brought in to take over either temporarily while a new police department is hired from the chief down or permanently on a contract And its not at all clear whether other police departments in the St Louis area are any better After all residents had plenty of experience with the St Louis County police last summer during the protests after Michael Browns death  and they didnt treat protesters any better than Ferguson police didThe DOJ report certainly indicates that the problem in St Louis is bigger than Ferguson In fact some of the things it faults the Ferguson police for doing are things theyre being asked to do by other jurisdictions like arresting people without warrants based on requests from police in other departments By the same token many of the unfair court practices the DOJ found appear to be pretty typical in municipal courts in the areaThe report even says Individuals experiences with other law enforcement agencies in St Louis County including with the police departments in surrounding municipalities and the County Police in many instances have contributed to a general distrust of law enforcement that impacts interactions with the Ferguson police and municipal courtIf Eric Holder wants to dismantle the problems facing the criminaljustice system throughout the St Louis area hes welcome to try  but its going to take a lot more investigations and potential lawsuits than the one he has going right now
