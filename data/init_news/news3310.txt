Donald Trump once again found himself the lightning rod of the Republican presidential race Wednesday as he tangled with a debate stage full of rivals trying to position themselves as the best alternative to the GOP frontrunnerThe second Republican primary debate veered into serious policy territory  covering everything from Iran to Russia to Planned Parenthood to immigration But at times to the visible frustration of candidates trying to stick to those issues few segments passed without a sparring session between Trump and one of his opponents Almost every time Trump hit back  and it was unclear whether any candidate would be able to dent his frontrunner statusThe candidate perhaps most eager to knock the billionaire businessman down a peg was former Florida Gov Jeb Bush who lost his lead to Trump over the summer Repeatedly Bush challenged Trump on his record and past commentsHe told Trump to apologize to his wife for suggesting her being from Mexico makes Bush more sympathetic to Mexicans  Trump refusedHe accused Trump of once giving him money as he sought casino gambling unsuccessfully in FloridaTrump denied it and when Bush criticized Trump for bragging about demanding Hillary Clinton attend his wedding Trump teased him saying More energy tonight I like that Bush answered back at the end of the debate  asked what his Secret Service codename would be Bush said Very High Energy Donald and the two shared a highfiveIt was such a disaster those last few months that Abraham Lincoln couldnt have been elected Trump saidBush responded that his brother kept us safe Trump answered You feel safe right nowSome of the most heated exchanges at the CNN debate also came between Trump and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina both business leadersAfter Trump called her former company a disaster she cited his repeated bankruptcy filings and questioned why America should trust him to manage its financesNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie interjected and said middleclass Americans could care less about your careers He told the two to stop this childish back and forthFiorina also got her chance at the debate to respond to Trumps controversial jab at her where in a magazine article he said Look at that face  would anyone vote for thatAsked to respond she said I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump saidFiorina received loud applause for the line and Trump added I think shes got a beautiful face and I think shes a beautiful womanDespite all the attention on Trump his dominant lead in the polls means his rivals may be battling at this stage for runnerup for nowRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson currently holds that status after vaulting into second place in the polls  yet was able to avoid the fray for most of Wednesdays debateHe took one lighthearted jab at Trump after Trump discussed his views on vaccines and said there are cases of children getting sick  and having autism  after getting themAsked about Trumps medical opinion Carson said Hes an okay doctor  in reference to a comment Trump recently made about him Carson went on to say theres no documented association between autism and vaccines but doctors are probably giving too many vaccines in a short period of timeAfter the exchange about George W Bush Carson also noted that he did not want Bush to go to war in Iraq He added that radical jihadists now are an existential threat to our nation and leaders cant put our heads in the sandAside from the sparring with Trump the candidates did have a chance to stake out their positions on a range of policy issuesFiorina in an impassioned moment in the debate appealed to Congress to defund Planned Parenthood following videos exposing organ harvesting from aborted fetusesThis is about the character of our nation And if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill shame on us she saidFormer Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee slammed a federal judge for temporarily jailing Kentucky clerk Kim Davis saying the US has made religious accommodations for Guantanamo detainees and the Fort Hood shooter but Davis is facing a criminalization of her faithAnd Texas Sen Ted Cruz said of the agreement with Tehran I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear dealOhio Gov John Kasich urged against going that farFlorida Sen Marco Rubio also focused on foreign policy warning about Chinas military buildup and gangsters in Moscow meddling on the world stageOn this Rubio challenged Trumps global affairs knowledge Trump vowed I will know more about the problems of this world as president And he criticized Rubio for missing votesTrumps fitness to be commanderinchief was a common theme for his rivalsFiorina said when asked if shes comfortable with Trump controlling Americas nuclear weapons I think Mr Trump is a wonderful entertainer She said judgment and temperament will be revealed over time and under pressure in the raceTrump answered I may be an entertainer  but I will tell you this What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessmanTrump also went after Sen Rand Paul saying he shouldnt even be on the stageTheres a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr Trump Paul answered but he added hes concerned about him being in charge of nuclear weapons Paul chastised Trump for his visceral response including attacking people on their appearance which he likened to junior highTrump said he never did that to Paul quipping Believe me theres plenty of subject matter right thereWisconsin Gov Scott Walker also zinged Trump saying We dont need an apprentice in the White House We have one right nowWalker and Bush have both seen their polling numbers drop in recent weeks as Trump and now Carson have risen Walker is trying to refocus his campaign on his record as governor and record battling labor unions the latter issue did not surface much during Wednesdays debate though In his closing remarks Walked vowed that as a leader I wont back down any day any way anyhowAn unexpected clash also broke out at the end when Paul made a veiled reference to Bush having smoked marijuana years ago as Paul challenged federal marijuana policyBush acknowledged Paul was talking about him and said 40 years ago I smoked marijuana and I admit itPaul then claimed people with privilege dont go to jail for marijuana but others doThe main stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley Calif Wednesday night featured the 11 toppolling candidates It followed an earlier undercard debate of four lowerpolling candidatesFiorina while rising in the polls is still averaging just over 3 percent nationally according to RealClearPolitics Bush once the frontrunner is at about 8 percent Walker is down to 3 percent Cruz and Rubio remain in the middle of the pack trailing slightly behind BushBut with Carson and Trump attracting the support of roughly half of primary voters the other 14 candidates are fighting for relative scraps Trumps national lead now tops 30 percentAt the earlier undercard debate Sen Lindsey Graham RSC tangled often with his GOP rivals positioning himself as an experienced practical lawmaker not beholden to conservative activist causes He focused squarely on the need to defeat radical Islamic terrorists while Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal focused at that debate on religious freedom issues
