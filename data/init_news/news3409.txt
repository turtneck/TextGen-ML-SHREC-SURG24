Debate over the Cleveland Indians Mascot November 1 2016 The US governments genocide against Native Americans has led many to find the use of Indian nicknames and caricatures in sports offensive such as the grinning Chief Wahoo mascot of the Cleveland Indians in the World Series reports Dennis J Bernstein By Dennis J Bernstein With the Cleveland Indians in Major League Baseballs World Series attention is drawn again to the teams smiling mascot Chief Wahoo who represents to many Native Americans a racist stereotype Indeed a real Cleveland Indian  Jacqueline Keeler a Navajo Yankton Dakota Sioux who was raised in Cleveland and is now a writer based in Portland Oregon  has been fighting against Chief Wahoo and other sports mascots that are degrading toward Native Americans She was interviewed regarding the images high profile during the series against the Chicago Cubs Dennis Bernstein Why dont you give us a little background on your family and growing up in Cleveland Jacqueline Keeler Many people dont know this but Cleveland was the site of a relocation program that took places in the 50s 60s and early 70s It was part of a twopronged program launched by the US Congress to terminate tribes and to relocate the populace to relocate Native Americans to urban centers And it was a way to make us disappear and also to gain access to our lands and many tribes were terminated and then they had their land sold And here in Oregon many tribes were terminated and they got access to their timber stands  And so my parents were relocated they were on the relocation program into Cleveland and as young people And within a decade of that program starting in Cleveland by the late 60s Cleveland had a pretty substantial Native population for the first time since Native people were removed from Ohio in the 1830s to Oklahoma Chief Wahoo the Cleveland Indians mascot DB And so your parents met there JK Uhhuh DB And that was part of a relocation and termination policy JK Yes for tribes And luckily that was defeated and turned around And my tribes were not terminated DB What was the policy Explain that policy JK Well the idea was that they would just finally get rid of tribes Tribes are actually sovereign nations within the United States And were pesky reminders that the United States is basically occupying our lands And so they were just hoping to wave a wand and make us all go away And then taking the relocation program was for young people from 18 to 35 years of age and the idea was to basically depopulate our communities and make us disappear in large cities And so these relocation programs were set up in Los Angeles in Denver in Cleveland in Dallas Texas Within a short time there were about 20000 young Native people in Cleveland And what they did was they began to organize And one of the first things they began to organize against was Chief Wahoo And so the earliest documented large scale protest against Chief Wahoo occurred in 1968 DB Okay remind us who Chief Wahoo is what he stands for because everybody is not from Cleveland JK Yeah Its a totally grotesque caricature of a Native person Supposedly its meant to honor a Cleveland baseball player who was Native American back in the early 20th century Its a really grotesque caricature My organization started the notyourmascot hashtag We trended nationally Pretty much the only Native hashtag thats ever trended nationally And I remember arguing with the Washington NFL fans and having them say Well why  Your mascot the Cleveland mascot is way worse in defending their own mascot Of course for me the issue is mascotry which is a word I invented The problem is all the different sort of stereotypes that having a Native mascot promotes in the populace and in the fans and what it teaches people about Native people Thats the problem You have the red face the acting out of Native traditions and culture and the entitlement it breeds over our culture and identities So I remember growing up hearing stories about my parents talking about protesting against Chief Wahoo We moved away when I was quite young so I didnt have to live with Chief Wahoo Although when I wrote the article for Salon and went over the history of Native people in Cleveland Salon titled the article My Life as a Cleveland Indian I went back last year and I participated in the protests during the season opener at Progressive Field there in Cleveland And I got to meet the Native community DB And what was that like Was that empowering  JK It was I landed in Cleveland and the airport is really small and people were really friendly And when I told them I was born there everyone even like Cleveland Indian fans that I was interviewing at the games even though they were drunk they were really touched that I came back They actually asked me to move back Its the only place Ive been besides the reservation where people have asked me to move back And I think thats part of Clevelands story the Ohio River Valley was you know the colonists one of the reasons they launched the Revolutionary War was to gain access to the Ohio River Valley which was denied to them by King George III because hethey had set that aside as Indian land And after the Revolutionary War they throw the tribes out when it comes down to everyone the Shawnee And so its just strange that after taking that land and basically committing genocide against the tribes in Ohio Cleveland is really fearful that they might be abandoned by the United States They look at Detroit they can see Detroit from their backyard They know that the US abandons cities And so there are still stories partly tied into this idea of that they are half what they were when my family lived there They went from being the seventh largest city in the 1950s to being the 48th or 49th now And its really shocking And I really felt really welcomed when I was there And so for them their teams winning like this the Cavs Cavaliers last year and now the MLB in the baseball team you want to cheer for them But  when its attached to this kind of racism it makes it very difficult DB I want to ask you a little bit about the actual actions that are taking place during the World Series You have an email campaign I imagine you couldnt its probably pretty hard to get tickets to the World Series but are there any protests in terms of the context of the World Series JK Yeah there are Theres a really great local group there in Portland I got to meet with them Theyre called the Committee for 500 Years and they actually are part of they grew out of the American Indian community in Cleveland the real Cleveland American Indian community They have been connecting protests for decades of these games And they are doing protests They are protesting right now as we speak And they have a great presence there And it is sort of surprising because you know Cleveland has a really large black community But when you go to the games one of the things I noticed was that all the fans were white Like I didnt see any people of color The Washington Redskins mascot And when we protest at the Redskins game sometimes like 30 of the fans were African American which is very difficult because they would walk right by a whole flank of Native people protesting and just not look us in the eye or sometimes jeer at us And you want solidarity And its hard when people the mascot I often say that mascoting masks our identities It dehumanizes us to our fellow Americans and its not a great thing to teach the next generation I just saw an article where they are giving away Cleveland Indian onesies to newborns in hospitals around Cleveland And its like theyre teaching them these stereotypes at birth DB Theyre teaching them the stereotypes at birth You mean these are like gifts So we won the World Series so this is a special thing were doing JK Well yeah They just showed a picture of all the newborns in their incubators and theyre all wearing onesies DB Well that gets them early huh JK Yeah and online were doing my group eradicating offensive Native mascotry Were doing a Twitter storm and were doing it all week throughout the World Series Were just making sure that people get educated about the facts and the harm that mascotry does There have been plenty of studies done that show that the teaching of stereotypes are primarily negative The University of Buffalo came out with a study last year that found that they are negative and that they actually encourage other stereotypes about other groups as well And then Dr Stephanie Fryberg she did studies at Stanford where she found that Native youth that were exposed to mascots Native mascots had a loss of selfesteem a measurable loss She measured their selfesteem before and after and Native youth who claimed to be okay with Native mascots actually suffered the steepest decline in selfesteem And it really indicates that a lot of coping mechanisms have to be employed a lot of energy employed to make it okay And Native youths have the highest rates of suicide in the country bar none And they have a rate of about three times that of other peers And Native young men actually have the highest rate The rates are nine times that of other young American men And so this is the most vulnerable group in America And they really dont need this kind of extra added DB Alright so  there is an email campaign JK We have a Twitter storm that were doing  Were actually doing notyourmascot and also dechief which is another hashtag that was started by Cleveland fans where they would cut Chief Wahoo out of their apparel and gear and then post a picture of that online with the hashtag dechief DB So this is interesting And are there any Native American players on these teams the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago Cubs playing in the World Series JK I dont know I dont think there are In the early years of baseball there were a lot of pro Native players in the early 20 th century My greatgrandfather and his twin brother played pro baseball as well But I dont know I know that the Washington NFL team reportedly recruited a Native a guy whos of Native descent onto their team and everything As a way to try to say that our criticism was unwarranted But yeah I dont know DB And this is now a national struggle because this isnt the only racist mascot stereotype thats being perpetuated This is a part of the professional leagues in the United States JK Yeah it has a huge reach And even at the college level and high school level there are 2000 high schools in this country that have Native American mascots And if you were to scale that up for other ethnic groups like for Black Americans which have 10 times the population of Native Americans you would have 20000 high schools with black mascots and it just gives you the idea of how overwhelming this is for Native people And to see it on TV to have stadiums with 90000 people in them doing Hopi chants and acting out stereotypes how isolating that is to Native people who are really a minority amongst minorities in most communities And about 80 of all Native people live off the reservation So they dont live in communities where they are part of any sort of majority at all or a significant group So they have to face this kind of ignorance alone And yeah it has a huge impact DB This is amazing Because if you contrast this with what you also know a lot about which is whats going on in North Dakota whats happening in North Dakota is what the US government didnt want to happen and by various acts of genocide like the one were talking about tonight subtle undermining of a culture by the use of racist stereotypes This is sort of an interesting parallel structure because you see the oppression here but theres a real movement being led by the Native peoples to stop the destruction of the planet JK Exactly I just got back from North Dakota My dads tribe the Yankton Sioux tribe some of the sites there are Yankton or Ihanktowan sites burial sites That is part of our 1851 Treaty that we signed with the US government and my dads tribe has a lawsuit right now with the Army Corps of Engineers over whats happening there at Standing Rock and the Dakota Access Pipeline I think when you look at the parallels basically what is happening they try to disappear us there are no tribe reservations in Ohio and in North Dakota most of its land that its claiming is private land is actually unceded treaty territory which means that the US government signs treaties with tribes And these are not special little agreements these are international legal agreements And the Senate only ratifies treaties with other sovereign nations So by ratifying treaties with us they recognize our status internationally as sovereign nations Protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline in St Paul Minnesota on September 13 2016 Flickr Fibonacci Blue And so when the Oceti Sakowin the great Sioux Nation exerts its rights it is actually in its legal rights to do so And similarly there are large tracts of land across the United States that have never been actually legally ceded to the United States they are held by force The whole state of Nevada the Shoshone tribe never ceded that And of course the most famous case is the Black Hills which the great Sioux Nation never ceded that land either And actually the Supreme Court agreed with us in 1981 I think And so we actually have legal title to these places and theyre being held And you can see whats happening in North Dakota Theyre being held by force And that force is revealing itself The United States is a colonial enterprise whose goal is to profit off of our land And their only purpose is to make a profit And theyre not a real nation in the sense that we have a connection to the land When I woke up last Saturday at camp they were playing John Trudeau the Santee Dakota poet poetry having him read and hes passed on but they had a recording of him and he was saying We are the people of the Earth Who are you And I think that Native nations our origin stories always go back to some sort of meeting with a sacred being With the Lakota and Dakota people it is with the White Buffalo Calf Woman and they say that she actually appeared to us near the site of where the Dakota Access Pipeline is being laid Right there where the White Stone massacre happened And so this is where we became a people a nationDakota and these are the stories that tie us to the land And these are the stories they are trying to erase And by making us American citizens and clouding our identity as citizens of our own nations I think thats all part of the story And assuming our identity is of course the full circle of that In my moms culture in Navajo culture they have these things called skin walkers theyre like witches and they wear the skins of animals and take on their appearance and really I often feel like this whole thing of taking on our identity in this way through mascotry is a form of skin walking And its a form of trophyism You know that they see us and they have a right to do what they want with our image and our culture DB And what tribe did you say your dad was from JK He is Yankton its a Yankton Sioux tribe In our language it would be Inhanktowan Dakota DB And theyre suing the Army Corps of Engineers JK Yes They are Their lawsuit hasnt been heard yet and then of course the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is also suing But they lost and theyre appealing now And the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe has enjoined that lawsuit as well DB And this suit goes right against the Army Corps of Engineers which has been halted from action by the President at this point JK Yeah they have DB They have halted the company from going on public lands JK Yeah the federal the waterways the Missouri River is the federal waterway so the Army Corps of Engineers and the federal government has jurisdiction over it However most of the pipeline is on private land In fact they purchased the Cannonball Ranch where they had over Labor Day weekend dug up recently identified burial sites and other archeological sites for the DB The company bought the ranch JK They bought it Yes Actually they may have broke the law because North Dakota has a Depression Era law against corporate ownership of agricultural land nonfamily owned corporations owning agricultural land in North Dakota And they admit they broke the law but they say theyre going to make it right later DB So a private citizen sold to the company which proceeded to drill and did JK Yes  JK My family fought the Keystone XL Pipeline The Yankton Sioux tribe played a major role in that And so I talked to the folks the white farmers that helped us they band with us My aunt helped form this alliance called the Cowboy and Indian Alliance and I talked to them and they said that theyre hearing that A protestor holds a sign against the Washington football teams name at a rally in Minneapolis Minnesota on November 2 2014 Flickr Fibonacci Blue DB These are the farmers and the Native Americans who are working together to restrain the oil JK Yes We were really lucky to find landowners white landowners who were willing to stand with us cause they take a huge risk Because they face imminent domain threats They could pay all these legal fees and still lose their land And I heard that the Energy Transfer Partners the Dallas corporation that is behind Dakota Access Pipeline is even more vicious and even worse than TransCanada was DB Well let me ask you we just got a minute or two left what are you asking people to do in terms of the stereotypes in terms of the racist mascots You talked about an action I want to remind people what youre up to and what you folks are trying to do here JK We want the mascoting of Native people to stop And to basically change the emphasis to real representations of Native people in the media and in sports And we would like for our real lives to be seen and to be understood  You know here in Portland we have this Powells Bookstore that has thousands of books But how many of those books actually feature Native protagonists Thats the problem theres no balance People often ask me Well what about the Vikings Well the difference is that thats not the only way you see a white man as a Viking If you never saw a white man as anything else than a Viking and you never saw him on TV you never saw him save the world in a Hollywood film you never saw him as President of the United States then it would be a similar situation The issue is the prevalence of mascotry and stereotypes over real knowledge of Native people DB I guess tonight youll be rooting for the people and the removal of that racist symbol right That will be a home run for the home team for you huh JK Well I guess Im rooting  that we get a chance to use this time this week during the World Series to really educate people and to really get people to think about it And to get Americans to understand because obviously other Americans understand this because you will notice that no other ethnic group is mascoted to the degree that Native people are DB Were going to have
