CNN Russias airstrikes in Syria do not go beyond ISIL ISIS al Nusra or other terrorist groups recognized by the United Nations Security Council or Russian law Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said ThursdayPushed to define other terrorist groups Lavrov said If it looks like a terrorist if it acts like a terrorist if it walks like a terrorist if it fights like a terrorist its a terrorist rightLavrov was addressing reporters at the UN in New York Thursday on the second day of airstrikes by Russian warplanes in SyriaMoscow which supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar alAssad has been accused of using the strikes to target antiAssad groups including the USbacked opposition group the Free Syrian Army FSABut Lavrov said Russia does not consider the FSA a terrorist group We believe that Free Syrian Army should be part of the political process he saidThe goal of our operation  in response to the request of President Assad and on the basis of the decision granted by the Russian parliament to the Russian President in accordance with the Russian constitution  the goal is terrorism and we are not supporting anyone against their own people We fight terrorism Lavrov saidLavrov questioned the USled coalitions legitimacy given the mission had not received the consent of the UN Security Council or any request of one of the countries on whose territories they operateYou cannot avoid the impression that the legal basis of the coalition activities in Syria is really flawed he saidAs far as I understand the coalition announced ISIL and other associated groups as the enemy and the coalition does the same as Russia does Somehow some people try to present the coalition action as leading to a political settlement and Russia fighting the same people is being perceived or presented like defending the regime Its absolutely unfair he saidThe foreign minister also questioned the logic of trying to topple alAssad to further the fight against ISIS asking whether the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya had made those countries better placesRussias Defense Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday saying that it had carried out new airstrikesRussian Aerospace Forces engaged another four ISIS facilities in Syria this night the Ministry announced on Twitter along with gun camera video showing large explosionsThe strikes were carried out by eight Russian SU24 and SU25 jets which claimed to hit ISIS terrorist staff and an ammunition dump near Idlib and another headquarters in HamaBut 24 hours into the military campaign there were concerns it was targeting those who oppose alAssad including more moderate factions that are supported by the United States and others in the WestThe Syrian Ambassador to Russia Riad Haddad told CNNs Matthew Chance that Russians were fighting alongside the Syrians to destroy not just ISIS but all of the other rebel groups in SyriaHaddad said all of the rebel groups including ISIS have a common goal to spread terrorHe told CNN that the impact of the Russian airstrikes over the past few days has been more effective than all of the coalition airstrikes so far combined and that the Syrian army and the Russian army are working side by side sharing intelligence and data and working very closely togetherA Syrian opposition activist living north of Homs near one of the villages targeted  Talbiseh  told CNN that ISIS had no presence in the areaRussian warplanes were targeting civilians and innocent people only Putin is lying about targeting Daesh militants Khdaier Khushfa said via Skype Daesh is another name for ISISDaesh withdrew from the northern countryside of Homs in an announcement they made a year ago after the groups refused to deal with them including Ahrar al Sham and Revolutionaries Front he saidWe know that Russia is the biggest ally of the Syrian regime and since Bashar alAssad considers us terrorists then there is no doubt that Putin knows these areas are under our control and not DaeshKhushfa said the Russian strikes had killed 17 civilians in Talbiseh and 11 in Zafaraniya despite rebel military posts and headquarters being located outside the two villagesWe are used to the regime airstrikes but now the entire world is watching another country killing civilians in cold blood without taking any action he said We are very concerned about what will happen next  civilians I spoke to are very scared  its like after five years since the revolution started we are back to ground zeroUS officials have also questioned whether ISIS is active in the areas hit by the Russian strikesSen John McCain  chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee  told CNNs Chris Cuomo that he could absolutely confirm that the initial strikes were against our Free Syrian Army or groups that have been armed and trained by the CIA because we have communications with people thereMcCain called the Russian strikes an incredible flouting of any kind of cooperation or effort to conceal what their first  Putins priority is And that is of course to prop up Bashar alAssadDefense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday that the Russian attacks which the Kremlin said were meant to target terrorists didnt appear to hit targets under the control of ISIS which operates in the north and east of the countryBut the White House downplayed the dangers of the Russian moveI think the Russians have made clear that theyre not interested in provoking a conflict White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Their actions thus far indicate that thats what they believeThe US and Russian military will hold a secure video teleconference call Thursday The US will be represented by Elissa Slotkin assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs

that reason alAbadi said Iraq appreciated anyone willing to join the fightOur message to the Russians  I met with Putin  please join this fight against Daesh he said using another name for ISIS Daesh is a dangerous terrorist organization not only against Iraq against Syria against the whole region against the whole world It is time that we all join the same forces to fight DaeshIn his comments at
