Principal Krystal Hardy has dedicated herself to improving the culture and upping the test scores at a struggling New Orleans charter school Her thirdgraders for one take 14 standardized tests including Common Core ones each yearThirdgrade students at Sylvanie Williams College Prep elementary school read individually in class on Jan 16 2015 in New Orleans Fifty percent of the children here started the academic year below grade level in reading and math The goal is to help them catch up and keep making progressThis story is the third in a yearlong series following Krystal Hardy a firstyear principal trying to bring order and improve test scores at a struggling New Orleans charter school The project is a partnership between The Christian Science Monitor and The Hechinger Report a nonprofit nonpartisan news outlet that covers inequality and innovation in education and is affiliated with Teachers College Columbia UniversityA week before their final round of Common Core tests the fifthgraders at Sylvanie Williams College Prep a charter school in New Orleans are reviewing the procedures for solving a multipart word problem in math Their principal Krystal Hardy looks onPay attention Ive seen these kinds of questions on the PARCC test says math teacher Tiffany Labrie referring to the Common Core tests that most students in Louisiana take this month This calls for converting ounces to pounds so you can use your reference sheet she tells them indicating a handout on every deskDont forget you can use the reference sheet today but also on the what asks Ms Labrie rhetoricallyPARCC echoes Labrie Youll have those reference sheets during the PARCC tests Remember to use themMs Hardy  who is in her first year as principal  has staked her career on improving the culture and upping the test scores at this struggling elementary school located in a gritty part of New Orleans Central City neighborhood At the start of the academic year in August 50 percent of the approximately 400 students nearly all of whom are AfricanAmerican and most of whom are poor scored below grade level in reading and math Their road to improvement is paved with testsIndeed like most public school students across America pupils at Sylvanie Williams get tested often  although Hardy is trying to balance the datadriven instruction with a strong social justice curriculumThe earliest tests this year helped teachers figure out which students had learned the material and which ones needed that lesson again After five months Hardy and her staff began diving deeper comparing test results with worksheets that students completed in class When they saw patterns of errors the teachers themselves worked through the problems trying to figure out exactly where the students were going wrongTheir findings have already dramatically changed the way teachers teach And the teachers are noticing that student achievement is picking upWe were able to administer targeted medicine says HardyInstead of saying Some of these students arent good at multiplying  she says we could start to say for example that 40 percent of these students in this class dont seem to understand the placevalue concept in threedigit numbers and about 40 percent say understand the concept but are not paying attention to details when they computeStudents at Sylvanie Williams take annual tests in science and social studies aligned to the states standards plus two rounds of Common Core tests in English and math developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers PARCC In some grades students also take three sets of benchmarking tests three or four times a year In the end thirdgraders who get tested the most take a whopping 14 standardized tests per year in addition to exit tickets  teachergenerated assessments at the end of a unit of studyTesting infuses many aspects of the school day The walls of Hardys office and the teachers conference room are hung with posters sporting bar charts that show test results Students and teachers talk about the test the test day and reaching basicOutside a thirdgrade classroom a colorful handdrawn poster names the children who have achieved the advanced mastery and basic levels on one test In another classroom a teacher has written out in magic marker a severalfootlong list of standards 4NF5 Express equivalent fractions and add fractions with denominators of 10 and 100  presumably to keep his own teaching on target for the Common Core math testAlthough a vocal minority of parents whose children tend to be enrolled in more affluent schools around the country have refused to let their kids take the Common Core tests no Sylvanie Williams families have opted out And Hardy is predicting the final round wont be a problem for her scholars Theyre used to it she says simplyEarly in the year diagnostic test results helped distinguish what had been taught from what had been learned Hardy keeps a close eye on lesson plans  teachers submit them to her each week  so she knows what material is being coveredBy January armed with more data Hardy and her teachers and coaches were really poring over the test results And thats when the dialogue around instruction began to shift The teachers started collaborating on how to quickly and directly backfill the specific foundational skills that students need to move forwardAfter that point says fourthgrade teacher Terrance Mitchell I think as a school we really started to see the achievement of our students begin to accelerateAlthough Hardy is committed to running a testdriven school the data focus has its frustrations Because the Common Core exams are new this year the PARCC administrators need to perform technical calculations on the results This means that scores on the tests will be released to Hardy after Sylvanie Williamss school year ends  too late for teachers to use that data to coursecorrectState political leaders are maneuvering to scuttle or at least modify the use of the Common Core in Louisiana so its not certain that the standards that the students are being asked to meet this year will even be around next yearThe schools relentless focus on standards and testing reduces time for less defined but often more meaningful types of lessons  ones that help kids understand themselves their fellow students and the world around them But Hardy has tried to squeeze these kinds of experiences into the school dayIn January she took 40 students on a field trip to Selma Ala to join the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the march to Montgomery And one morning she taught a unit on poverty in America which included having third fourth and fifthgraders compare weekly expenses with median income for high school dropouts college graduates and those with a masters degreeRecently a fifthgrade blackboard showed the remnants of a vibrant discussion about young black men police and excessive force Because of the demographic our children come from many will face immense challenges and unique realities Hardy saysWe need to prepare them to understand how the world will engage with them They need to understand how to engage with it And maybe create the possibility that they will act as change agents in their worldHardy accepts that her school and her tenure as principal will be evaluated largely on test scores But she is adamant about maintaining what she sees as crucial parts of education that no test will measure This project is a partnership between the Monitor and The Hechinger Report a nonprofit
