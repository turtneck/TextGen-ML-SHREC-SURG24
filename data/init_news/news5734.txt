Friend from university is an arse now 311016 A MAN who bumped into an old university friend has discovered that he is now a total dickhead Julian Cook lost contact with former housemate Martin Bishop for over eight years ago during which time Bishop has become a moneyobsessed macho twat who thinks he is the bollocks Office worker Cook said Instead of talking about old times he kept asking me what sort of car I have Then he blathered on about taking home serious Ks from folio development resales assuming I knew what that meant because otherwise I would not be a proper man The worst bit was when he told me about some fringe political group hes into called Libertarian England No actually it was when he said pussy alert when a woman walked past He probably just works and socialises with dipshits but I wouldnt rule out one of those injuries that turns you into a psychopath Maybe he fell off a raft at a teambuilding weekend and hit his head on the riverbed We parted on friendly terms but now he wants me to join his weights oriented gym and go to a lapdancing club which is odd because he used to be into Star Trek Generations  Share
