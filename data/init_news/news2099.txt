WASHINGTON  Fortythree years after the Supreme Court established the right to a safe and legal abortion in Roe v Wade the stakes have never been higher for those on both sides of the abortion debate States have enacted 288 new abortion restrictions in the past five years that have shut down a slew of clinics across the country and the next president could nominate Supreme Court justices who will determine the fate of legal abortion for decades to comeBut even as abortion access for millions of women hangs in the balance the issue has somehow been neglected by presidential debate moderators causing the issue of reproductive rights to fade from the 2016 race The Democratic candidates havent been asked about reproductive rights at all in any of their four debates and the Republicans have only been asked about abortion and funding for Planned Parenthood in the first two of the six debates theyve participated in so farAdvocates working for and against abortion rights are baffled by the silenceThere are real and important differences between candidates here and its a loss for American women that they havent been explored said Jess McIntosh a spokeswoman for EMILYs List a group that helps elect prochoice women to officeNBC moderators did not ask how Sen Bernie Sanders IVt newhealth plan released just two hours before the Democratic debate the network hosted Sunday would handle public funding for abortion and did not press Hillary Clinton on her view that federal restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion should be repealed Sens Marco Rubio RFla and Ted Cruz RTexas havent been asked in the past four GOP debates about their opposition to allowing victims of rape or incest to get abortions a position that is significantly more conservative than those held by prior Republican presidential nomineesThe only abortionrelated question GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has fielded during a debate was back in August when Foxs Megyn Kelly asked him about his 1999 comment that he was very prochoice His stance on abortion is much murkier these days but no other moderators have chosen to ask him about itAmericans United for Life an antiabortion group wants candidates on both sides to explain whether they support public funding for abortion or the kinds of clinic regulations that conservative states have passed to make it difficult for abortion providers to stay openProlife Americans would love to know whether candidates support health and safety standards for women who are exposed to great risks in abortion clinics said Kristi Hamrick a spokeswoman for AUL
