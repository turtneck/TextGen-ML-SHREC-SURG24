Will Mitt 30 as hes already been dubbed be a better model than the earlier two incarnationsWithout so much as a single syllable uttered in public Mitt Romney has shaken up the 2016 race employing a strategy of calculated leaks to indicate that he wants to mount a third presidential bid I was skeptical of what seemed like a trial balloon to buy some time as Jeb Bush claimed the mantle of establishment candidate but this has mushroomed into Mitt trying to get the gang back togetherBut given that Romney muffed what Republicans viewed as a prime opportunity to oust President Obama the media are asking this question What exactly would be different next timeThe exercise is reviving some bad memories of Romneys flaws as the GOP nominee And Romney would have to explain his change of heart after he and Ann so repeatedly declared that they were done trying to move into the White House Whats his rationale To save the party from Jeb Or has he just been badly bitten by the presidential bugLets stipulate that beating an incumbent president even with an anemic economic recovery was tough Lets also stipulate that Romney is an experienced businessman has a good temperament can raise truckloads of money and proved to be a strong debaterBut there were so many selfinflicted wounds that its hard to catalogue them Selfdeportation I like being able to fire people Binders full of women The 47 percentNot even Romneys biggest fans would suggest hes a natural campaigner I watched him up close with crowds and while he gamely tried to connect with folks theres an awkwardness rooted in his natural reserve And that extended to his armslength relationship with the press corpsPart of the chatter now is that Romney could fare betterPolitico quoted one Romney campaign alumnus as saying the new effort would tell the story of Mitt better Several Romney veterans recalled how well the accounts from parishioners in Romneys Mormon community resonated with voters who had been bombarded with ads about his tenure at Bain Capital Romney of course mostly avoided talking about his religionPolitico quoted another former top adviser as saying he really has toshowpeople that hed do it differently rather than justsayhed do it differently He needs to assure folks hed take a much more direct approach to laying out the vision for his campaign versus having those decisions driven by a bunch of warring consultantsSo why is Romney gearing up to do this The Washington Posts Robert Costa who has set the pace on this story quoted yet another anonymous Romney adviser as saying Mitts a very restless character He is not the type to retire happily to read books on the beachHe believes he has something to offer the country and the only way he can do that is by running for president againBut that explanation is more about Romneys feelings than how hed be a stronger candidate than last time around And not everyone in the GOP is wild about the idea John McCain who defeated Romney in 2008 and wants his friend Lindsey Graham to run this time says I thought there was no education in the second kick of a muleWhy would Republicans who grudgingly submitted to a Romney nomination in 2012 only after every other possibility had exhausted itself give him another try when so many alternatives are available What qualities would make a Romney candidacy more attractive to Republican voters in 2016 than it was in 2012The Fix columnist Chris Cillizza admits hes stunned by the prospect of a third Mitt campaignI dont doubt Romneys sincerity But I do think he and those close to him are fooling themselves that he can simply proclaim that he is running a new and different campaign one based on foreign policy and poverty according to Politico and that will be that Its literally impossible for me to imagine such a scenarioBreitbart goes back to the Netflix film Mitt that some acolytes are fondly remembering and doesnt give it two thumbs upThe best that can be said for the Romney portrayed in Mitt is that had he conveyed his behindthescenes personality to voters better Romney might have mitigated the damage from Obamas attacks Maybe some of his selfeffacing humor or seeing Romney wear ducttaped gloves while skiing and pick up hotelroom trash like a normal person might could have offset the ruthless outoftouch businessman image portrayed by his opponentBut the subtext of Mitt is Romneys tragic inability to actually be that person in publicFor a man seeking his third shot at the presidency amidst the strongest GOP bench in decades its not a flattering portraitThe former Massachusetts governor doesnt have to win over the pundits of course but he does need a smarter approach to using the media to get out his message Theres already talk that he wont be bringing back his old communications team which often didnt bother to respond to reportersThe media love the idea of a MittvsJeb showdown But Romney who once mused about how those who lose presidential elections are branded losers needs to offer a compelling rationale for why he can winClick for more from Media BuzzHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11
