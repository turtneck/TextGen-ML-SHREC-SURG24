In August 2016 the announcement of the discovery of a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri artists impression above stimulated the imagination of experts and the general public This star is the nearest star to our sun though it is 10 times less massive and 500 times less luminous This discovery together with the discovery in May 2016 of a similar planet orbiting an even lowermass star Trappist1 convinced astronomers that such red dwarfs as these lowmass stars are called might be hosts to a large population of Earthlike planetsComputer simulations of the formation of planets orbiting in the habitable zones of low mass stars such as Proxima Centauri by astrophysicists at the University of Bern show that these planets are most likely to be roughly the size of the Earth and to contain large amounts of waterWhat might these objects look like What could they be made of Yann Alibert and Willy Benz at the Swiss NCCR PlanetS and the Center of Space and Habitability CSH at the University of Bern carried out the first computer simulations of the formation of planets expected to orbit stars 10 times less massive than the sunOur models succeed in reproducing planets that are similar in terms of mass and period to the ones observed recently Alibert says regarding the results of the study forthcoming as a letter in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics Interestingly we find that planets in closein orbits around these type of stars are of small sizes Typically they range between 05 and 15 Earth radii with a peak at about 10 Earth radius Future discoveries will tell if we are correct the researcher addsIn addition the astrophysicists determined the water content of the planets orbiting their small host stars in the habitable zone They found that around 90 percent of the planets harbour more than 10 percent water For comparison the Earth has a fraction of water of only about 02 percent The situation could be even more extreme if the protoplanetary disks in which these planets form persist longer than assumed in the models In any case these planets would be covered by very deep oceans at the bottom of which owing to enormous pressure water would be in form of iceWater is required for life as we know it So could these planets be habitable While liquid water is generally thought to be an essential ingredient too much of a good thing may be bad says Willy Benz In previous studies the scientists in Bern showed that too much water may prevent the regulation of the surface temperature and destabilize the climate But this is the case for the Earth here we deal with considerably more exotic planets that might be subjected to a much harsher radiation environment andor be synchronous he addsTo start their calculations the scientists considered a series of a few hundreds to thousands of identical lowmass stars and around each of them a protoplanetary disk of dust and gas Planets are formed by accretion of this material Alibert and Benz assumed that at the beginning there were 10 planetary embryos in each disk with an initial mass equal to the mass of the moon In a few days computer time for each system the model calculated how these randomly located embryos grew and migrated What kind of planets are formed depends on the structure and evolution of the protoplanetary disksHabitable or not the study of planets orbiting very lowmass stars will likely bring exciting new results improving our knowledge of planet formation evolution and potential habitability summarizes Benz Because these stars are considerably less luminous than the sun planets can be much closer to their stars before the surface temperature becomes too high for liquid water to exist Considering that this type of star also represents the overwhelming majority of stars in the solar neighbourhood and that closein planets are presently easier to detect and study it is easy to understand why the existence of this population of Earthlike planets is of importanceThe Daily Galaxy via University of Bern Source Daily Galaxy
