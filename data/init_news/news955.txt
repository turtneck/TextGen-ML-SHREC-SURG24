Elections Rape And Sexual Assault Accusations Need to Be Taken Seriously Posted on Oct 27 2016 By Sonali Kolhatkar Protesters organized by the National Organization for Women gather near the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City on Oct 12 as sexual assault allegations about GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump emerged on the heels of The Washington Posts bombshell report about Trumps 2005 Access Hollywood hotmic comments regarding his treatment of women Frank Franklin II  AP Photo Less than a day after the third and final 2016 presidential debate GOP nominee Donald Trump faced new accusations from a woman who recounted a story of her sexual assault at his hands Karena Virginia told members of the press how Trump groped her in public at the US Open in 1998 while asking Dont you know who I am Two days later two more women Kristin Anderson and Summer Zervos made similar allegations  Earlier this year a woman named Katie Johnson said Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old she filed a lawsuit against him that was later thrown out on a technicality Trumps exwife Ivana Trump has also accused him of raping her To date a dozen women have publicly alleged that Trump in some way assaulted them Jane Piper an activist who faced her rapist in court in 2014  told me in an interview that she believes the women who have accused Trump I take their word as their word and I believe them she said We have this documented evidence of Trumps attitude and behavior toward women added Piper referring to his numerous public statements revealing a callous and disrespectful attitude toward women To Piper the idea that Trump might be a serial perpetrator of sexual assault is consistent with his language and the attitude he has publicly displayed Advertisement Square Site wide Think about Bill Cosby While he has not been convicted on charges of sexual assault in the court of public opinion he is already considered guilty He has admitted to drugging women in order to have sex with them and the sheer volume of accusers against him leaves one wondering How could they possibly all be lying As Fox News Chris Wallace asked Trump during the final presidential debate Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances from so many different years why would they all  make up these stories Indeed in cases such as those involving Cosby and Trump there is little to be gained by publicly proclaiming oneself the victim of rape and assault All a woman gains is to be forever known as someone who accused a famous man of a vile crime According to Piper It is not comfortable to be known in this way It makes no sense and it is ridiculous and offensive and insulting to imply that a woman might make it all up for fame Like Cosby Trump has bragged about assaulting women In a now infamous recording obtained by The Washington Post  Trump revealed to TV host Billy Bush that he simply has his way with women Just kiss I dont even wait And when youre a star they let you do it You can do anything Grab them by the pussy You can do anything And as in Cosbys case women are emerging from the woodwork as the election looms to reveal sordid stories about Trumps alleged assaults on them One major difference here is that Cosby is an actor who will indeed face the accusations against him in court while Trump is running for the highest office in the nation While all men including Cosby need to be held to high standards on sexual assault those who run for president deserve the utmost scrutiny Piper dismissed the response by Trumps supporters that the timing of the accusations now emerging is suspect Of course this timing is perfect she told me because Trumps accusers just listened to him in that video describe what he did and be proud of it and the next day in the debate lie and say that he never ever actually did that Piper said that if she had been one of the women who had alleged assault by Trump she would be doing everything in my power to make sure that the public knew what kind of person this man was so that they would know what kind of leader they were choosing to elect Essentially anyone running for president of the United States should expect his or her past and present to be scrutinized under the most stringent of microscopes Womanizing or having affairs as presidential candidate Gary Hart was accused of in 1987 is very different from being accused of sexual assault or rape Hart was brought down by a media frenzy that began with a single provocative photograph Trump is heading straight into an election dogged by repeated accusations of crimesnot affairsand all he has offered are simplistic denials and deflections
