Sent Tuesday August 11 2015 600 PM To Kendall David Subject Hi again from AP inquiry about thumb drive Hi David We have been told and we are preparing to report that the FBI has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession This is what we have been informed and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed then I would gladly accept that as well  But we have solid reason to believe this Wed welcome any comment you can offer Thanks very much Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows its true but will gladly print that its false Whats truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons  In plain English he explains that he has solid reason to believe the report about the thumb drive but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press  and he even suggests what that false narrative should be If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed then I would gladly accept that as well In other words hes not just corrupt dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist hes also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles by the way Essentially the Associated Press reporters say We are total media whores we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think were a credible news organization You gotta love Eric Tucker for this The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what weve known for years the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism  Note carefully that the AP wont even fire Tucker for this admission Hell probably get a prize of some sort How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes It all brings to mind the obvious question How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism Answer Probably about 99 Its not just AP either Its the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America Theyre all liars and crooks and theyre all working for Hillary Clinton the serial killer and rape excuser
