Joe Biden in the still unlikely event he runs for president probably wont beat Hillary Clinton Hes been a lackluster presidential candidate in the past and theres no clear path for him to win the Democratic nomination this timeHe should do it anywayThe rationale  floated to me by a Biden lieutenant  is that the vice president could serve as a stalking horse His entry would shake up the race and thereby lower the barriers for other potentially betterpositioned candidates to join the frayThis could turn the Democratic contest into a freewheeling affair and for the party there would be only upside Either the more fragmented Democratic field would produce a better candidate than Clinton or more likely it would sharpen Clinton on her way to the nominationThe term stalking horse dates back some 500 years to a time when hunters hid behind equines to sneak up on their prey In politics the term refers to a candidate who diverts attention from another and thus benefits a third To switch metaphors Biden jumping into the race could convince other aspirants that the waters fine  and reduce their fears that taking the plunge would end their careersA Bidenscrambled race for the nomination could make a run more attractive to a dozen or more Democrats most of whom have said theyre not running and some of whom have already endorsed Clinton All are unlikely Most would fail and badly But a Biden run should at minimum alter their calculationsPrevious nominees Al Gore or John Kerry could jump in validating Mo Udalls theory that presidential ambition can only be cured by embalming fluid Mike Bloomberg could rejoin the party and put his billions to work in a shortened primary season Populists such as SenElizabeth Warren Mass or failing that Sen Sherrod Brown Ohio or Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York could reconsiderYoung candidates such as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro or Sen Cory Booker NJ could bring racial and ethnic diversity to the race as could former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick Those excited about Clintons historymaking potential as a woman could get behind Sens Amy Klobuchar Minn or Kirsten Gillibrand NYAmong governors theres John Hickenlooper of Colorado and New Yorks Andrew Cuomo who has a famous name if not much of a record a pair of former Virginia governors Sens Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and outspoken former Montana governor Brian SchweitzerIts late in the cycle for new entrants but not too late A CBS News analysis finds that of the nearly 770 top Obama fundraisers from 2012 as few as 51 have committed to bundling big money for Clinton Because Clinton has largely plugged in Obamas campaign operation plenty of Democratic operatives are available And new candidates would be arriving just in time for the debate season beginning Oct13 in Nevada and followed by others in November December and January with two more in either February or MarchNot least theres a clamor for Clinton alternatives from the political press corps which has a long history of antagonism toward her Theres also eagerness for alternatives among the Democratic faithful demonstrated by the large crowds and enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders even though hes a professorial socialist who is about to turn 74Democrats are reasonably content with Clinton In the latest PostABC News poll 72 percent of Democraticleaning voters said they were satisfied with their choice of candidates and 24 percent very satisfied But they could be more so At this time in 2007 83 percent of Democraticleaning voters were satisfied and 33percent very satisfiedSatisfaction could diminish as Clintons emailserver troubles continue Shes scheduled to testify Oct 22 before the Houses Benghazi committee which has generated much of the emailserver controversy The State Department is expected to continue dribbling out Clintons old emails the rest of this year as they are cleared for public consumption And many of her emails are facing reviews to see whether they contained classified information Clinton originally said that she did not use her private email account to exchange classified information but she has since retreated to saying that none of her emails had been marked as classifiedEven if she did nothing illegal the potential for more damage to Clinton remains high But there is one thing that can shift attention from the email saga inject energy into the Democratic side of the presidential race and strengthen Clinton or the eventual nominee A stalking horse of courseRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
