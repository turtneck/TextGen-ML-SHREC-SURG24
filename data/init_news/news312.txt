 NAZI Flying Saucers  A Permanent Base in Antarctica A highly guarded secret is the probablity that German Nazis as early as the 1930s have built a sec Print Email httphumansarefreecom201611naziflyingsaucerspermanentbaseinhtml A highly guarded secret is the probablity that German Nazis as early as the 1930s have built a secret base at the South Pole While this idea undoubtedly will strike most people as absurd there is tantalizing evidence to suggest that something along this line might have some truth to itLongstanding banking and business connections allowed highranking German leaders in 1944 to forge a formidable Nazicontrolled organization for postwar activitiesAuthor Jim Keith wrotein researching the shape of totalitarian control during this century I saw that the plans of the Nazis manifestly did not die with the German loss of World War II The ideology and many of the principal players survived and flourished after the war and have had a profound impact on postwar history and on events taking place todayOrvis A Schmidt the US Treasury Departments director of Foreign Funds Control in 1945 offered this description of a Nazi flightcapital programThe network of trade industrial and cartel organizations has been streamlined and intermeshed not only organizationally but also by what has been officially described as Personnel UnionLegal authority to operate this organizational machinery has been vested in the concerns that have majority capacity in the key industries such as those producing iron and steel coal and basic chemicals These concerns have been deliberately welded together by exchanges of stock to the point where a handful of men can make policy and other decisions that affect us allCould one of those decisions have been the creation of a Nazi base connected to the development of UFOs While this notion may superficially appear to be sheer nonsense the public record offers compelling  if incomplete  evidence to support this ideaOne theory is that Martin Bormann and other top Nazis escaped to South America and on to a secret base in Antarctica  renamed Neuschwabenland by the Germans  where they built UFOs so sophisticated that their secret Nazi empire has exerted significant control over world events and governments to this day Read Hitler Escaped to Argentina  Died Old Pictures of Him After the War FBI Documents DNA Analysis of Skull  Pictures of His House Reportedly German Navy Grand Admiral Karl Dnitz stated in 1943The German submarine fleet is proud of having built for the Fhrer in another part of the world a ShangriLa on land an impregnable fortressAnd it has been reported that US Admiral Richard Byrd  upon his return from an expedition to Antarctica in 1947 stated it wasnecessary for the USA to take defensive actions against enemy air fighters which come from the polar regions and that America could be attacked by fighters that are able to fly from one pole to the other with incredible speedAdvancing the idea that the Nazis continually shipped men and material to the South Pole throughout the war years author R A Harbinson wroteRegarding the possibility of the Germans building selfsufficient underground research factories in the Antarctic it has only to be pointed out that the underground research centers of Nazi Germany were gigantic feats of construction containing wind tunnels machine shops assembly plants launching pads supply dumps and accommodation for all who worked there including adjoining camps for slaves  and yet very few people knew that they existedBut while tales of a secret Nazi base in Antarctica may appear plausible to some the idea that a warm water location at the South Pole has remained undiscovered and no one has escaped or deserted the place in more than 50 years stretched belief to the breaking point in years pastBut with the new revelations of 6070 degree temperature water magnetic anomalies suggesting the possibility of a hidden city or base and the obvious back out taking place concerning current events at the pole the idea of a secret base is no longer so far fetchedRumors began to circulate that whilst Germany had been defeated a selection of military personnel and scientists had fled the fatherland as allied troops swept across mainland Europe and had established themselves at a secret base on the Antarctic continent from where they continued to develop their advanced aircraft technologyFurthermore it is interesting to note that at the end of the war the allies determined that there were 250000 Germans unaccounted for  even taking into account casualties and deaths Huge Discovery Nazi Maps and Documents to Agartha Confirm the Hollow Earth Accounts Could Neu Schwabenland have been a permanently manned German base at that time The brackish water of the warm 30 degrees lakes virtually confirmed that all had an outlet to the sea and would thus have been a haven for Uboats The two icefree mountain ranges in Neu Schwabenland presented no worse an underground tunneling project for Organization Todt than anything they had encountered and overcome in NorwayThe Germans were the worlds experts at building and inhabiting underground metropolisAt the end of the war the United States gave anything concerning Ohrdruf a top secret classification for 100 years upwards The fact that there had been substantial underground workings there and Ohrdruf was the location of the last Redoubt was concealed absolutely Fortunately for researchers in 1962 the DDR had taken sworn depositions from all local residents during an investigation into wartime Ohrdruf and upon the reunification of the two Germanys in 1989 these documents became available to all and sundry at Arnstadt municipal archiveFrom the Arnstadt documents it is clear that the Charite Anlage unit operated in a threestory underground bunker with floors 70 by 20 metersWhen working the device emitted some kind of energy field which shut down all electrical equipment and nondiesel engines within a range of about eight milesFor this reason even though Ohrdruf was crawling with SS it was never photographed from the air nor bombed Declassified USAF documents dated early 1945 admit the existence of an unknown energy field over FrankfurtMain and other locations which fantastic though it may appear were able to interfere with our aircraft engines at 30000 feetOhrdruf rebuilt below Neu Schwabenland during the last two years of the war would not have been difficult and since Charite Anlage had the highest priority of anything in the Third Reich it seems likely that it must have beenSuch a base would have been impregnable for the suggestion is that the forcefield worked in various ways favorable to the occupants Scary Secrets of the Third Reichs Base in Antarctica A remarkable event occurred in 1999 but only specialists paid adequate attention to itA research expedition discovered a virus in Antarctica at that neither people nor animals had immunity to the virus After all Antarctica is far away for this very reason the virus cannot be dangerous for the rest of the planet especially since the dangerous discovery was deep in the permafrostHowever scientists say that against the background of a global warming threatening the Earth the unknown virus can cause an awful catastrophe on the planetExpert Tom Starmerue from the University of New York also shares the pessimistic forecasts of his colleaguesWe dont know what the mankind will face in the South Pole in the nearest time due to the global warming It is not ruled out that an unbelievable catastrophe may break out Viruses protected with a protein cover survive even in the permafrost as soon as the temperature gets warmer they will immediately start reproducingAmerican scientists treated the Antarctica discovery very seriously and even organized a special expedition that currently tests the ice for unknown viruses in order to develop an antidote in good timeWhat is the source of the virus in Antarctica where only penguins can survive in the ice There is no answer to the question specialists are at a loss However several theories concerning the problem have been put forwardA majority of scientists are inclined to believe that prehistoric forms of life probably survived in the permafrost But some specialists blame bonzes of the Third Reich for delivery of a secretly developed bacteriological weapon to Antarctica And this theory arose not in a vacuum It is known that already in 1938 Nazis suddenly became interested in Antarctica they organized two expeditions to the area in 19381939At first planes of the Third Reich took detailed pictures of unexplored territories and then they dropped several thousands of metal pennons with swastika there The whole of the explored territory was called Neuschwabenland and was considered a part of the Third ReichAfter the expedition Captain Ritscher reported to FieldMarshal GringThe planes dropped the pennons 25 kilometers apart we covered the area of about 8600 thousand square meters 350 thousand square meters of them were photographedIn 1943 Grand Admiral Karl Dnitz dropped a remarkable phraseGermanys submarine fleet is proud that it created an unassailable fortress for the Fhrer on the other end of the worldIt highly likely means that Nazis were building a secret base in Antarctica within 19381943Submarines were mostly used for transportation of necessary freight to the placeAs specialists for the Third Reich wrote at the end of WWII the submarines were relieved of their torpedo arms in the port of Kiel and then were loaded with containers with different goods The submarines also received passengers whose faces were hidden behind surgical bandsWilhelm Bernhard was commander of one of the submarines U530 the submarine left the port of Kiel on April 13 1945 When it reached the shores of Antarctica 16 members from the crew built an ice cave and put boxes into the cave it was allegedly said that the boxes contained relics of the Third Reich including Hitlers documents and personal stuff The operation was code named Valkyrie2When the operation was over on July 10 1945 the submarine U530 entered the Argentinean port of MardelPlata and surrendered to the authoritiesIt is also supposed that another submarine from the formation U977 under the command of Heinz Schffer delivered the remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun to Neuschwabenland It followed the route of the U530 submarine and called at Antarctica The submarine arrived in MardelPlata on August 17 1945But the version of Wilhelm Bernhard and Heinz Schffer saying that the submarines delivered relics to the Antarctica shores both captains told it at the interrogations held by the American and British intelligence services seems rather dubious It is unlikely that the serious operation was designed only for the sake of delivery of the Third Reich documents and relicsLater special services seized a confidential letter of Captain Schffer to his friend Captain Wilhelm Bernhard who obviously planned to publish his memoirsThe letter was dated with June 1 1983It runs as follows Dear WillyI was thinking if it is reasonable to publish your manuscript concerning the U530 The three submarines that took part in that operation U977 U530 and U465 are currently at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean Isnt it better to leave them there My old friend think about it Think please how then my book will look when you publish your memoirs after WWII Heinz Schffer wrote a book named U977We all made an oath to keep the secret we did nothing wrong we just obeyed the orders and fought for our loved Germany and its survival Please think again isnt it better to picture everything as a fable What results do you plan to achieve with your revelations Think about it please Even 40 years after the events Heinz insisted that Bernhard mustnt say the truth Is it possible that the submarines delivered something more dangerous to the continent not Hitlers documentsCould it be the bacteriological weapon traces of which were discovered in Antarctica as unknown viruses in the permafrost last year NEUBERLIN If you had been a Wehrmacht soldier at the bombedout railroad station in Poltava a city in the Ukraine during the summer of 1942 you may have seen a very strangelooking military unit on the march heading for a waiting passenger trainThe unit consisted of women all of them blond and blueeyed between the ages of 17 and 24 tall and slender their sensational figures encased in striking skyblue uniformsEach woman wore an Italianstyle garrison cap an Aline skirt with the hem below the knee and a formfitting jacket with the insignia of the SS You might have thought the SS had recruited a platoon of highclass call girls but the truth was far stranger than that You would have been looking at ReichsfhrerSS Heinrich Himmlers latest brainstorm  the Antarktische Siedlungnsfrauen Antarctic Settlement Women or ASFThe story actually begins in 1938 when the German seaplane carrier Schwabenland sailed across the South Atlantic bound for Queen Mauds Land in AntarcticaAccording to Russian ufologist Konstantin IvanenkoThe Schwabenland sailed to Antarctica commanded by Albert Richter a veteran of coldweather operationsThe Richter expeditions scientists used their large Dornier seaplanes to explore the polar wastes emulating Admiral Richard E Byrds efforts a decade earlierThe German scientists discovered icefree lakes heated by underground volcanic features and were able to land on them It is widely believed that the Schwabenlands expedition was aimed at scouting out a secret base of operationsA German base was established in the MuhligHofmann Mountains just inland from the Princess Astrid Coast The area was renamed Neuschwabenland New Swabia and the base was known only as Station 211From the movie Schindlers List people have gotten the idea that killing Jews was the Nazis main concern But in actual fact Hitler and the SS were just as ruthless with the rest of the population in their eastern European empire thinking nothing of shuffling large numbers of people around in their quest for a more perfect Aryan raceThis shuffle was accomplished by a littleknown office of the SS called the Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt German for Race and Settlement Bureau or RuSHA In the Ukraine alone RuSHA drafted 500000 women for forced labor in the munitions factories of Nazi GermanyIt was RuSHA which selected women for Himmlers unit of Antarktische Siedlungsfrauen Antarctic Settlement Women About half of the recruits were Volksdeutschethnic Germans whose ancestors had settled in the Ukraine in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries The others were native Ukrainians whom RuSHA had upgraded to full AryansThis process was called Eindeutschung GermanizationAccording to IvanenkoThere is increased popularity for the idea of a GermanSlavonic Antarctic Reich It is said that 10000 of the racially most pure Ukrainians out of half a million deported in 1942 by Martin Bormann were transported to the German Antarctic bases during World War II in the proportion of four Ukrainian women to one German manIf true this would mean that Himmler transferred 2500 WaffenSS soldiers who had proven themselves in combat on the Russian front to Station 211  now Neuschwabenland  in Antarctica This may be the source of the myth of the Last SS BattalionAn ASF training camp was set up in Estonia on a peninsula near Ristna on Hiiumaa Island in the Baltic Sea It was a combination finishing school and boot camp where the ladies took lessons in charm and housekeeping along with their courses in polar survival Himmler kept the camps existence a closelyguarded secret For unhappy campers the only escape consisted of a oneway train ticket to AuschwitzThere is one known instance of an ASF deserter In 1943 Auschwitz guard Irma Griese 22 the offandon girl friend of Dr Josef Mengele  took to wearing a skyblue ASF uniform which she had scavenged from a pile of inmate clothing Griese was hanged in 1946 for war crimes The uniforms original owner must have had serious second thoughts about a permanent move to AntarcticaThe failure of Grossadmiral Karl Dnitzs Uboat offensive by May 1943 freed up dozens of milk cow U boats These were large submarines almost as big as tramp steamers which Dnitz had used to supply his U boat wolf packs in remote seas of the world Himmler now put them to work carting supplies and personnel to AntarcticaHimmlers rationale for sending thousands of settlers to Antarctica can only be understood within the context of his mystic beliefs As a result of his youthful reading of New Age books his association with the occultist Dr Friedrich Wichtl and his membership in the Artamen Himmler became a believer in the Hindu concept of worldages or yugas He believed that the current age or Kali Yuga would end in a global cataclysm thereby giving birth to a new worldage called the Satya YugaBy sending a Nazi colony to Antarctica Himmler was ensuring that a remnant of the pure Aryan race would survive the coming cataclysm with its society and culture intact They would then take possession of Antarctica when the cataclysm melted the south polar ice capAccording to believers the Neuschwabenland colony survived not only the end of World War II but a full on battle with the 3500 Marines and aircraft of Operation High Jump In 2003 Ivanenko wroteThe total population of Nazis in Antarctica now exceeds two million and that many of them have undergone plastic surgery in order to move about with greater ease through South America and conduct all manner of business transactionsHe called the Antarctic Reichone of the most militarily powerful states in the world because it can destroy the USA several times over with its submarinebased nuclear missiles remaining itself invulnerable to US nuclear strikes because of the twomilethick ice shieldFurther he claims that the city of Neu Berlin the colonys capital sprawls through narrow subglacial tunnels under an unnamed mountain range heated by volcanic ventsThe ufologist also makes the claim that Neu Berlin adjoinsthe prehistoric ruins of Kadath which may have been built by settlers from the lost continent of Atlantis well over 100000 years agoStill other fringe researchers claim that the actual ruins of Atlantis have been found  and possibly reoccupied  under the Antarctic ice Some say that Atlantis is located near one of the 70 or so warm water lakes that have been discovered miles beneath the Polar Ice Sheet such as Lake Vostok near the Russian base at the Pole of InaccessibilityAnother of the oft made claims about Neuberlin is that the city has an Alien Quarter where Pleiadians  Zeta Reticulans  Reptoids  Men In Black  Aldebarani and other visitors from the stars dwell As we have seen the Nazis were working on some very advanced aircraft some of which may have been capable of leaving the earths atmosphereSome researchers are convinced that the Nazis did indeed make it to the moon  and even Mars  Could they have made contact with space aliens once they left the earth Or could their rockets foofighters and disk aircraft have attracted aliens to visit themA claim floats around in modern UFO lore that an extraterrestrial craft with antigravity propulsion crashed in the Schwarzwald in the summer 1936 and was recovered by the Nazis who backengineered it thus explaining their flying saucer program You can read more about Nazi UFOs here  This parallels stories of a similarly recovered crashed saucer near Roswell  New Mexico in 1947 the American backengineering of which supposedly led to the discovery of the transistor patented by Bell Laboratories the following year fiberoptics and other exotic technologiesIvanenko reported that talk about the Antarctic Reich is becoming more and more popular in Russia Poland the Ukraine Belarus and other countries in eastern EuropeHe writesIn the May 10 2003 issue of the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Polish journalist A Stagjuk criticized Polands decision to send troops to Iraq to assist with the Allied occupationAt the end he said The next Polish government will sign a treaty with Antarctica and declare war on the USAIvanenko added that Stagjuks words were broadcast on the shortwave radio station Deutsche Welle the same weekSome analysts compared this sentence to famous code phrases which started wars in the Twentieth Century such as Over all of Spain the sky is cloudless in 1936 and Climb Mount Niitaka in 1941Climb Mount Niitaka was the signal Admiral Yamamoto sent to Kido Butai the Imperial Japanese Navys fleet to begin the attack on Pearl HarborIt is strange to think of a large population living under the ice of Antarctica totally divorced from the mainstream worldThen again there are Jivaro indigenous people living on Lago de Yanayacu lake less than 50 kilometers 30 miles east of Iquitos Peru who have never heard of Courtney LoveSo is there a city under the ice inhabited by the grandchildren and greatgrandchildren of the original SS settlersOr is it just an urban legend stemming from the chaotic conditions that prevailed in Europe during World War IISome day we may know for
