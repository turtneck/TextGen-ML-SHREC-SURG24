Twitter brings out the best in nobody and this week that includes two of the most prominent people in Washingtons national security establishment New York Times chief Washington correspondent David Sanger and State Department senior adviser Marie HarfTheir Twitter fighting is ostensibly over a technical issue in the Iran negotiations Sanger had published a story reporting Iran had developed new nuclear fuel which he suggested was a major embarrassment for the administration and bad for the Iran nuclear dealHarf basically argued that Sanger had misunderstood and misinterpreted the latest nuclear development And on balance Harfs criticisms are correct and Sangers story elided some technical issues that make it clear this is nowhere near as big of a deal as he claims But like so many arguments in Washington over Iran its about much more than thatOn Monday Sangerreported in the Times based on a new study that Tehrans stockpile of nuclear fuel increased about 20 percent over the last 18 months of negotiations Sanger framed this as embarrassing for the Obama administration and a step back in the Iran nuclear negotiations The development poses a major diplomatic and political challenge for President Obama Sanger wrote partially undercutting the Obama administrations contention that the Iranian program had been frozenHarf who is currently acting as State Department spokesperson said later she was perplexed by the storys contentions pointing out that Iran had not violated any agreements and arguing that Sanger had overblown a minor development into a major issue The notion that this is some big issue of concern of negotiation is more manufacturing a controversy than actual reality she saidWhat was interesting watching this unfold is that it prompted two entirely separate conversations One among mostly conservative national security writers and think tankers expresseddismay at the Obama administrations defensiveness and its apparent refusal to acknowledge the cold hard facts spelled out in the study The other among arms control experts actually dug into those facts and ultimately ended up siding with HarfThe first issue as a number of people pointed out is that Sanger had used the phrase nuclear fuel to describe the growth in Irans nuclear program which is both true and misleading Iran has produced a specific category of nuclear fuel calledlowenriched uranium LEU which is used for power plants or other peaceful purposes not for nuclear warheadsSanger implies that this goes against the Joint Plan of Action JPOA Irans 2013 temporary nuclear agreement with the US meant as bridge until final negotiations are concluded this summer In fact Irans development of more LEU is within the agreement so for Sanger to write that it undercuts anything is incorrectOnce the final nuclear deal with Irancomes into effect based on the framework of that deal that was agreed upon in April Iran will still be allowed to produce LEU  but it will only be allowed to keep a small stockpile on hand The idea here is that LEU in itself is not terribly dangerous and that both the production and the stockpile will be under close international monitoring to make sure Iran doesnt try to turn the LEU into highly enriched uranium HEU which is dangerous However the deal will limit how much LEU Iran is allowed to have on hand at any given time the country will be required to ship it out or else convert it to for example fuel rodsThis gets to the heart of Sangers argument he is correct that Iran is building up a much larger stockpile of LEU than it will be allowed to have if the final deal comes into effect To be clear this activity does not violate any agreements currently in force However if the deal comes into effect and if Iran wants to comply with that deal then it will have to convert almost all of that LEU into some other form such as fuel rods or ship it out of the country There is nothing preventing Iran from doing all of this in a way that complies with the dealA representative tweet from the arms control community which seemed to collectively roll its eyes at Sangers storyIrans LEU is up somewhat yes but contrary to headline it doesnt complicate talks IranDeal will cut the size of Irans LEU stockpile to 300kg Arms Control Association director Daryl Kimballwrote calling Sangers story a superficial analysisIts also important to point out that Iran is developing this new LEU under the view of the international community in its officially declared facilities If the Iranians really wanted to cheat they wouldalmost certainly construct a secret facility somewhere  as theyve done in the past  and do it thereThat does not mean that its great news that Iran is enriching more LEU Certainly everyones lives would be easier if Iran unilaterally surrendered its entire nuclear program or at least took no more steps toward nuclear development But Iran is continuing to conduct the sorts of nuclear activities that it is allowed under the JPOA a deal that even Sen Lindsey Graham an Iran superhawknow supports which should not be particularly surprising It is a real stretch to argue as Sanger does that this enrichment poses a major political and diplomatic challenge to the Iran dealThis is in many ways a repeat of the same argument that Washington has been having since 2013 when the JPOA was signed and the US and Iran began down the road to a nuclear deal Supporters of the deal joined since Aprils framework agreement by a chorus of arms control experts say the deal is about the best feasible option we have for limiting Irans nuclear enrichmentIran hawks argue that this is all based on a false premise that the Iran nuclear program is actually the core problem Rather they believe the real problem is inherent to the Iranian regime itself and that because the nuclear deal will not force regime change it elides and thus perpetuates that problemThis is why you see so much arguing between these two sides over every little technical blip along the way For Iran hawks episodes like this one just prove there is no such thing as a good nuclear deal because Iran is so inherently evil that it will find a way to exploit any deal to its advantage Deal supporters and arms control experts meanwhile see that the deal will dramatically limit Irans nuclear development as well as make it much harder for the country to cheat and thus go a long way to prevent both a nuclear bomb and the need for a disastrous war with IranThis is why you get lots of arguments over questions like Is Iran violating the JPOA in spirit if not in letter because for Iran hawks everything Iran does violates the spirit of the agreement because Tehran can only ever be dishonest and warlikeIts why people on both sides spend lots of time debating the degree to which Iran is rational If Iran is rational the incentives of the deal are much more likely to lead it to comply But that word rational ends up becoming very hard to define and clear standards very hard to set Was the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 rational If it wasnt does that mean America is incapable of rationally responding to incentives and must be destroyed for the sake of world peaceYou can see how these debates almost immediately veer away from the factual into the theoretical and the indefinable They are also by the way only tangentially related to technical issues such as whether Irans latest LEU enrichment violates the JPOA These debates are maddeningly unanswerable and unending Most people in Washington who work on this issue having long ago exhausted their arguments on this many times over try to avoid rehearsing the debate But that is not always the case on Twitter even if youre David Sanger or Marie Harf
