Thank you said the man I was standing outside of the offices of Charlie Hebdo covering the aftermath of the terrorist attacks for CNN He was thanking me just for being here just for covering the event and its aftermath what Le Monde referred to as Frances September 11 And his appreciation was echoed by French citizen after French citizenThe rally Sunday for unity drew 15 million people in Paris and more than twice that nationwide it was like nothing Ive ever seen or covered Our nations oldest ally stood firm A young Muslim Frenchwoman held a sign saying Je suis JuifA man and his son came over to me holding a sign saying I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it beseeching me to share their message with the American people And world leaders were standing together amidst a procession that included Francois Hollande of France Angela Merkel of Germany David Cameron of Great Britain Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel along with the leaders of Mali Jordan and TurkeyIt is no small thing for the king of Jordan a direct descendent of the Prophet Mohammed to march in a rally prompted by the murders of people who mocked Islam as well as of innocent Jews  all of whom were killed by Islamic extremistsThe United States which considers itself to be the most important nation in the world was not represented in this march  arguably one of the most important public demonstrations in Europe in the last generation  except by US Ambassador Jane Hartley who may have been a few rows back I didnt see her Even Russia sent Foreign Minister Sergey LavrovI say this as an American  not as a journalist not as a representative of CNN  but as an American I was ashamed I certainly understand the security concerns when it comes to sending President Barack Obama though I cant imagine theyre necessarily any greater than sending the lineup of other world leaders especially in aggregate But I find it hard to believe that collectively President Obama Vice President Joe Biden Secretary of State John Kerry Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Attorney General Eric Holder  who was actually in France that day for a conference on counterterrorism  just had no time in their schedules on Sunday Holder had time to do the Sunday shows via satellite but not to show the world that he stood with the people of France There was higherlevel Obama administration representation on this seasons episodes of The Good Wife on CBS I get that the President visited the French Embassy in Washington and that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke in French and I certainly understand that the American commitment to security in Europe rivals no other But with all due respect those are politicians spending money that they didnt earn and sending troops whom they dont know And this is not just a matter of the current occupant of the White House I find it hard to believe that Speaker of the House John Boehner and new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had more worthy pursuits on Sunday than standing sidebyside with our French brothers and sisters as they came together in an inspirational way After September 11 the first world leader to visit the United States was Frances Jacques Chirac though the most forceful conversation about France in Congress that I can recall came a few years later during debate over whether to invade Iraq and revolved around renaming pommes frites in the US House cafeteria And Im frankly floored that not one of the people who is contemplating running for president in 2016 has yet to even tweet on the subject of the momentous demonstration in Paris much less attend Frances biggest rally in the history of the republic I imagine that Hillary Clinton and her husband are kicking themselves for not hopping on a corporate jet to get here Can you picture Hillary and Bill walking in the front row arminarm with Netanyahu and Hollande Chris Christie Scott Walker and Paul Ryan attended the Green BayDallas football game Sunday and at least one of them sent his potential rivals mischievous tweets as if they were contemplating running for president of Beta Theta Pi Why I hope its not American arrogance a belief that everyone should express shock when something bad happens to us but that our presence at an international rally is worth less than a ticket to the Green Bay game when the victims speak in accents we dont understand I suppose theres always the risk that coming to an event like this as an American leader and getting stuck in the third row could be embarrassing or could lead to accusations that youre trying to capitalize on a tragedy But thats not how it would have been interpreted in France People here are happy that Americans care Theyre eager and appreciative of any evidence of that And I know it exists  although American Twitter seemed much more focused on the Golden Globes than anything else Sunday night I only wish our leaders had done a better job of showing solidarity with the passion for the freedoms exemplified by the rally
