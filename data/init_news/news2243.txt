Walling them out or walling us in Shall we wall off Canada too By Jim Hightower Posted on November 3 2016 by Jim Hightower Evading security cameras in the remote expanse along the US border three Guatemalans waited till dusk to slip illicitly into our country This is the stuff of Donald Trump nightmaresand if he were to witness such a scene we can only imagine the furious rants that would follow But Trump will never see this scene or even know about it because hes facing south fulminating against Mexicans and assuring his faithful followers that hell stop illegal entry into the US by building a  beautiful impenetrable wall  across our 2000mile border with Mexico Meanwhile the scene described took place way up north where rural Vermont connects to Canada As the New York Times recently reported  This area is a haven for smugglers and crossborder criminal organizations With so many of our nations political and security officials obsessed with the southern border more and more criminal actionincluding the smuggling of people drugs and weaponshas plagued our 5500mile Canadian border the longest in the world between two countries Running from the Atlantic to the Pacific through sparsely populated and heavily wooded terrain theres often no clear demarcation of where Canada ends and the US begins Some farms homes and businesses actually sprawl across the border Only about 2000 agents patrol this vast stretch and officials concede they dont even have a good guess of how many people and how much contraband is coming across or where So the question for Mr Trump is Shall we wall off Canada too And how much of our public treasury democratic idealism and international goodwill shall we dump into the folly of militarizing both borders By simply thinking we can wall the world out well be walling ourselves inand thats suicidal OtherWords columnist Jim Hightower is a radio commentator writer and public speaker Hes the editor of the populist newsletter The Hightower Lowdown  Distributed by OtherWordsor g  Commentary  Bookmark the permalink
