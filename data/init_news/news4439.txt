in General Health  Sleuth Journal  Special Interests Taking calcium supplements  even at low doses  linked to brain lesions in the first study of its kind Most calcium supplements are just plain bad news The idea of taking calcium in pill or tablet form to keep the bones strong just doesnt make that much sense given first that we are designed to get our calcium from food Second our bone is a living tissue which requires vitamin C amino acids magnesium silica vitamins D and K etc not to mention regular physical activity just as much as it does calcium Taking calcium to the exclusion of these other critical factors doesnt make sense nor does it make sense to look at osteoporosis as a deficiency of calcium supplements As we have reported on extensively in the past not only is consuming limestone bone and the shells of oysters and eggs not a good idea because the calcium can deposit in our soft tissues leading to heart attacks and strokes  but even the goal of maintaining bones as dense as a 25year old late into life known as the Tscore is fraught with danger including a far higher breast cancer risk for those with the highest bone density  Instead of pathologizing aging and focusing on making the bone denser by any means necessary the focus should be on bone quality and agility and bodily selfawareness late into life which helps the elderly prevent the falls that lead to fracture in the first place In other words simply having a gait or vision disorder can be at least as an important factor in fracture risk as bone mineral density The problem with poor quality inorganic calcium supplements however does not stop with their contribution to cardiovascular disease risk A combination of factors including low magnesium vitamin K2 and the presence of fluoride in the water and diet can lead to pineal gland calcification  as well as the calcification of other brain structures which recently has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease  click image to enlarge A truly provocative study on this topic published last year in the British Journal of Nutrition somehow slipped through the cracks because not only did we miss it but we do not recall it being reported elsewhere Titled  Elevated brain lesion volumes in older adults who use calcium supplements a crosssectional clinical observational study  the study looked at the possibility that since calcium supplements have now been linked in multiple studies with vascular pathologies associated with cardiovascular diseas they may also be associated with the occurrence of brain lesions known on MRI scans as hyperintensities in older adults These brain lesions visible as brighter spots in MRI scans are known to be caused by lack of blood flow ischemia and subsequent neurological damage According to the study Brain lesionsalso known as hyperintensities are areas of damage observed on brain MRI  See Above  These lesions are common in older adults and increase the risk of devastating health outcomes including depression cognitive decline dementia stroke physical disability hip fracture and death Postmortem studies have determined that these lesions form primarily due to ischemia especially larger lesions 3mm and lesions found in depressed individuals The observational study enrolled 227 older adults 60 years above and assessed food and supplemental calcium intakes Participants with supplemental calcium use above zero were categorized as supplement users Lesion volumes were assessed with MRI scans Key findings were Greater lesion volumes were found among calcium supplement users than nonusers The influence of calcium supplements was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of high blood pressure hypertension a wellestablished risk factor for lesions The study found that the amount of calcium used was not associated with lesion volume and that even lowdose supplements by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes Even after controlling for food calcium intake age sex race years of education energy intake depression and hypertension the association between calcium supplement and lesion volumes held strong The study details were summarized as follows In the present crosssectional clinical observational study the association between Cacontaining dietary supplement use and lesion volumes was investigated in a sample of 227 older adults 60 years and above Food and supplemental Ca intakes were assessed with the Block 1998 FFQ participants with supplemental Ca intake above zero were categorised as supplement users Lesion volumes were determined from cranial MRI 15 tesla scans using a semiautomated technique volumes were logtransformed because they were nonnormal ANCOVA models revealed that supplement users had greater lesion volumes than nonusers even after controlling for food Ca intake age sex race years of education energy intake depression and hypertension Ca supplement use   034 SE 010 F1217 1098 P 00011 The influence of supplemental Ca use on lesion volume was of a magnitude similar to that of the influence of hypertension a wellestablished risk factor for lesions Among the supplement users the amount of supplemental Ca was not associated with lesion volume    0000035 SE 000 015 F1139 006 P 081 The present study demonstrates that the use of Cacontaining dietary supplements even lowdose supplements by older adults may be associated with greater lesion volumes Evaluation of randomised controlled trials is warranted to determine whether this relationship is a causal one What is the mechanism beneath this association The researchers discussed the already established link between calcium supplementation and increased ischemic stroke risk indicating that calcium supplementation may contribute to calcium deposits in the vasculature ie arterial calcification mainly in the fatty deposits atheromas that contribute to blocking the opening lumen of the blood vessels They state that this process can lead to lack of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation ischemia ultimately leading to the development of brain lesions Another mechanism by which excess calcium may have a direct neurotoxic effect on the brain is the influx of excess calcium into brain cells which lead to cell death This possibility is greatly increased if the bloodbrain barrier is compromised The researchers also highlighted the importance of the finding that calcium supplementation may have as significant a deleterious effect on brain lesions as high blood pressure hypertension If this finding is confirmed in longitudinal studies it could have important health implications  because it is obviously much easier to cease Ca supplement use than to medically manage hypertension In other words hypertension is often caused by toxic antihypertensive drugs that may actually increase the risk of cardiac mortality  Why not remove one of the modifiable causes calcium supplementation which would strike to one of the root causes of the problem and resolve it The researchers concluded their study as follows The use of Ca calcium containing dietary supplements by older adults was found to be associated with greater brain lesion volumes even after controlling for the usual amount of dietary Ca intake Interestingly neither the amount of supplemental Ca nor the duration of supplemental Ca use was associated with lesion volume These findings indicate that adverse biochemical effects of supplemental Ca use may exist in older adults regardless of the dose So what do we do instead of taking calcium supplements First consider why you think you need calcium supplements Is it because of the dairy industry promoting for decades the concept that we need calcium from milk Or is it because your doctor is throwing around terms like osteopenia and osteoporosis carelessly without explaining to you that the present day bone mineral density BMD reference ranges assume that aging is a disease and even if you are 60 or 100 for that matter you are still supposed to have the BMD of a 25year old young woman an absurd and dangerous idea Please read the expose  Osteoporosis Myth The Dangers of High Bone Mineral Density  in order to understand how millions of healthy women were made to believe that aging is a disease with worse health outcomes as a result of overdiagnosis and overtreatment Now when it comes to calcium focus on food sources The site NutritionDatacom lists about 1000 of the highest calciumcontaining foods categorized by food group Foods highest in Calcium  Also remember that the accelerated bone loss that occurs later in life in women is triggered by hormonal changes associated with the exhaustion of the ovarian reserve Nature however provides back up support for the ovaries in the form of pomegranate  Other hormonemodulating foods include the fermented soy food miso  prunes  and even vitamin C  which has recently been found to regenerate steroid hormones  For a far more extensive research resource on bone health you can view our page dedicated to the topic here Bone Health   November 2 2016
