solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOPs establishment He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23These are all of our stories Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia These are who we are as Americans And yet for so many Americans the promise of America seems more and more distantBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White HouseSo ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again Trump told the crowd at his announcementTrump flung criticism at politicians spanning the spectrum from presidential primary opponents Jeb Bush and Ben Carson to the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and the man he hopes to succeed President Barack Obama in an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper that aired Sunday on State of the UnionAnd he lamented the House Select Committee on Benghazis questioning of Clinton  a hearing he called very partisan that hurts both parties and hurts the countryThe level of hatred between Republicans and Democrats was unbelievable The level of  Ive never seen anything like it Trump said Im going to unify This country is totally divided Barack Obama has divided this country unbelievably And its all its all hatred what can I tell you Ive never seen anything like itIve gotten along with Democrats and Ive gotten along with Republicans And I said thats a good thingTapper asked Trump if his presidency would result in an era of bipartisanshipI absolutely think so he said adding I will be a great unifier for our countryStill for all the talk of bipartisanship and unity Trump did not pull punches as he vigorously took on his opponentsTrump hit Bush the former governor of Florida and Carson a retired neurosurgeon with the same line of attack  one he has frequently used against Bush but has only just begun using against Carson whose reserved and calm tone strongly contrasts with Trumps brash appealBush is a lowenergy person By the way Ben Carson is a very lowenergy person We need highenergy people Trump told Tapper I think Ben Carson is a very lowenergy person Actually I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb if you want to know the truth We need strong energyTrump also knocked both Bush and Carson for the support they receive from super PACs groups that can take in unlimited amounts of moneyThe developer dinged super PACs as a big fat scam and a disaster in the State of the Union interview a line of criticism that he brought out more arduously than ever this weekend just days after the super PAC backing his candidacy shuttered its operation after the groups ties to the campaign drew scrutiny last weekBut Trump suggested that he may turn his sights away from Bush and toward CarsonThats because Carson is now the man to beat in Iowa stealing first place from Trump who was relegated to second place in two polls released Thursday and FridayThe thing with Ben is hes got a very good PAC and hes got people running his PAC and in my opinion hes got people all over Iowa from his PAC and they are running  Ben doesnt even go to Iowa that much And hes doing well in Iowa Trump said I did talk about Jeb because I thought Jeb was going to be the frontrunner Obviously hes no longer the frontrunner I probably wont talk about him so much anymoreTrump tied in his lowenergy attacks with what he dubbed the medieval times that the world is currently living in  saying that as ISIS beheads people the US needs a strong leaderBut as to whether he would approve a special forces operation to rescue hostages being held by ISIS  similar to the one that resulted in the death of an American soldier this week Trump demurredI think I might but Id have to look at the situation Trump saidPushed further to explain what the Trump doctrine would be in such situations Trump explained that it is very simpleIts strength Its strength Nobody is going to mess with us Our military is going to be made much stronger Trump said
