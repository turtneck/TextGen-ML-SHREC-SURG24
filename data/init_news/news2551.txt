The Donald Trump campaign is setting a high bar for the Republican nominees next debate performanceCampaign advisers and surrogates believe the town hall format of Sundays forum will be advantageous for Trump who feeds off energy from crowds and will showcase his nontraditional campaign style Trump is also going to rehearse for his second showdown with Hillary Clinton after appearing unprepared in his first matchup with a town hall Thursday night in New HampshireMr Trump does very well in town halls Thats because he connects with real people Thats because hes not a politician Jason Miller the campaigns communications director said after Tuesday nights vice presidential debateThe largely wellreceived performance by running mate Mike Pence in his matchup with Tim Kaine adds pressure to the man on the top of the ticket The Indiana governor excelled on the debate stage in areas Trump did not  namely refusing his opponents bait and deflecting criticisms Pence sat in stark contrast to Trump in terms of his ability to stay steady and stridently on message and some conservatives delighted in his articulation of conservative principles and topics that have been generally ignored by the GOP nomineeIn many ways Pence provided a map for Trump and shifted the discussion if even for a moment away from the worst several days of the candidates campaign The vice presidential candidates showing lays the groundwork for Trump who has little room for error on deliveringBut the campaign has also been careful to draw a distinction between the two men on the GOP ticket Asked whether Pence would be helping Trump with debate preparation or giving advice campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told RealClearPolitics there were no plans to get the governor involved because they are different candidates with different styles and personalities During interviews Conway dismissed the notion of Pence upstaging the top of the ticket and argued that the governors performance displayed Trumps good character judgmentIndeed Trump took credit for the debate Mike Pence did an incredible job and Im getting a lot of credit Trump said during a campaign rally in Nevada on Wednesday noting the governor was his first hire after clinching the GOP nomination He was cool he was smart  Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of presidential debatesPence played the good soldier afterward From where I sat Donald Trump won the debate he said Wednesday kicking off a bus tour in Virginia before routing through Pennsylvania and OhioPence displayed his loyalty to his ticket while also buying some protection for his own future in politics defending his running mate through deflection He denied controversial statements made by Trump regarding women Mexicans nuclear weapons and Russian aggression among other issues He went so far as to dismiss his own past praise of Vladimir Putins leadership in Russia a statement that is easily accessible online At the same time he showed daylight between himself and Trump at points calling Putin small and bullying for example But the dismissals and denials were often overshadowed by his ability to quickly turn back to prosecuting ClintonIf Pence offered lessons in debating and preparation its not clear whether and how Trump will take them He figures to give some indication Thursday night through an invitationonly town hallstyle forum in New Hampshire a state he won in the primary and where he visited just last weekWhile Trump gains energy from crowds at large rallies he is less practiced at some of the more intimate town hall events During the general election he has participated in televised formats with Fox News host Sean Hannity but those contained more favorable crowds and questionsThe town hall format ideally helps showcase a candidates relatability says GOP strategist Kevin Madden who was a top adviser for the Mitt Romney campaign Trump is very good when it comes to connecting with large crowds and feeding off of their energy The town hall format is more sedate It also requires a lot of prep and Trump has shown an aversion towards prepThe Trump team though isnt using the candidates inexperience with the format to set low expectations as campaigns typically do Conway said on Fox News Wednesday morning that Trump will deliver a powerful performance on Sunday night in St Louis Its a much better format for him than Hillary Clinton Hes more practiced dealing with people one on one Hes going to take the case right to herThe more intimate and personalityrevealing format could pose challenges for Trump who has talked about raising the specter of former President Bill Clintons infidelities He will have to answer questions from voters who may not agree with him or support him The setting also places an emphasis on body languageand movement around the stageThe Clinton campaign seeing an uptick in polling after the first debate is helping to set the higher expectations for TrumpWe are expecting him to be better prepared for the next debate campaign manager Robby Mook said Tuesday night We know that there is a calm cool and collected Donald Trump that can show up and we expect that thats what will happen He has stated that he will make all sorts of  attacks We actually dont expect that We think that he understands that that is not the right strategy
