Los Angeles CNN Hillary Clinton is on the cusp of declaring victory as the Democratic nominee after a long and protracted battle with Bernie Sanders But she has one very serious problem The Vermont senator isnt giving upClinton and her husband have barnstormed across California at a furious pace in recent days  seeking to avoid yet another humiliating defeat by Sanders on the same night she should easily win the delegates needed to go past the 2383 mark and clinch the nominationIm very proud of the campaign were running here and I believe on Tuesday I will have decisively won the popular vote and I will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority Clinton said on CNNs State of the UnionBy all objective measures she and her allies argue that the race is over The delegate math the money the millions of votes in her column  all point to her inevitability as the nomineeSanders however shows no sign that he is preparing to exit the stageFacing a strong possibility that he could carry in California he vowed in no uncertain terms this weekend to lead his movement on to the convention in PhiladelphiaAt a news conference in LAs Little Tokyo Saturday he railed against the press and the news networks for counting superdelegates in their talliesIt is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night Sanders said At the end of the nominating process no candidate will have enough pledged delegates to call the campaign a victory That will be dependent upon superdelegates In other words the Democratic National Convention will be a contested conventionThe first female presidential nominee of a major political party could find herself shadowed by Sanders intensive campaign to sway hundreds of superdelegates despite winning fewer contests and votesSome Democrats worry that would put the Democratic Party at a disadvantage by making it harder for Clinton to unify the party and turn her full attention to Donald TrumpFrom a pure mathematical perspective the Democratic Primary in Puerto Rico Sunday leaves Clinton on the verge of becoming the nominee 29 delegates shy of the magic number according to CNN estimates On Tuesday 694 delegates will be at stake in the Democratic contests  including 475 in California alone but Clinton is likely to win many of themWhile the math is not on his side Sanders showed defiance and determination as he swept through California all weekend charging Trump with trying to divide the country and Clinton with advocating for small incremental changes when We want to transform this nationA robust showing Tuesday could give Sanders a strong closing argument in his pitch to superdelegatesSpeaking for more than an hour Saturday night outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the flame of the Olympic torch flickered brightly above him he urged his followers to dismiss those who claim his path is impossibleIf we can win and win big here in California and in the other states and in Washington DC we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum Sanders told thousands of young supporters many of whom were wearing Bernie or Bust buttons With your help I believe we will come out with the nominationFor Sanders the long Democratic primary is coming to an end amid feelings of astonishment and regret When he launched his presidential bid a year ago advisers say winning wasnt his chief goal He wanted to make sure Clinton had a competitive race And that he has done in spadesWhile advisers say he is serious about taking the primary fight to the Democratic convention he also is mindful of keeping his pledge to keep Trump from winning the presidency He has yet to reconcile those competing forces aides say but that rests at the heart of what he decides to do nextSanders refuses to say what his goal would be if he does not win the nomination He will not even engage on those kinds of questions at this point in the processAdvisers say he is intent on trying to change the Democratic nominating process particularly the superdelegate system and the series of closed primaries in states across the country But that could be a tall order considering he just joined the party to run for presidentWhile this week will almost certainly decide the race Sanders supporters insist that it will result in nothing more than a mathematical muddle Whatever the networks decide to do in terms of calling the race Sanders adviser Tad Devine said I dont think thats going to affect thingsThe networks or the press can characterize what happens in any way they like  you guys have a right to do that  and so do we he saidSanders argument for continuing on Devine said is pretty straightforward that the delegates that have been elected by voters  no one has enough of them to claim the nomination of the partySo if youre going to win the nomination of the party youre going to win it with superdelegates and even the Democratic National Committee  officially their spokesperson  is out on the record saying that superdelegates votes should not officially be counted until the convention itself Devine saidSanders advisers also note that regardless of the results on Tuesday nightwhen voters go to the polls in California Montana New Jersey New Mexico North Dakota and South Dakotathe Vermont senator intends to compete in Washington DC on June 14 when it holds the final contest of the primary seasonThey believe they have a strong case to make to superdelegates that Sanders has gained strength over the course of the primary process while Clintons candidacy has weakenedThey note that while Clinton for example dominated in large states with diverse populations early in the process polls show Sanders leading Clinton among young minority voters in California by a wide margin Beyond that Sanders has continued to pound the argument that potential general election matchups show that he would be a stronger candidate against TrumpIf the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House and regain the Senate and win governors chairs all over this country we are that campaign Sanders said at a rally in San Diego Sunday nightClinton has pointed out that in 2008 she was in Sanders position in second place after a hardfought campaign against Barack ObamaBy some standards I actually led a little bit in the popular vote but I fell a little short in the pledged delegates she said on State of the Union So I had a decision to make A lot of my supporters said hey lets keep going lets make sure that we go to the convention I said no I ran to become president because I have deep values and beliefs about what should be done in our countryWhile Sanders next moves are difficult to predict the bigger obstacle for Clinton may be the fervency of his supporters particularly those who constitute the contingent who call themselves Bernie or BustA Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found that a quarter of Sanders supporters nationally said they would not support Clinton in a general election against Trump while 75 said they wouldThe Clintonresistant contingent of Sanders supporters was even higher in California in the recent USC DornsifeLA Times poll In that survey  which may have prompted Clinton to ramp up her campaign schedule hereSanders led Clinton 44 percent to 43 percent among registered voters The Vermont senator led her by double digits among voters who decline to state a partyAmong voters who are supporting Sanders in the primary only 65 said they would support Clinton in NovemberThose diehard Sanders fans were out in force at his events in Los Angeles this weekend In interviews many said they either planned to either write in Sanders in November or vote for the Green Party ticketIve been watching the Clintons for a very long time and I think there are some serious integrity issues and some character flaws Ill say to be nicewhich Bernie doesnt have Hes been consistent for 40 years and thats something I have to respect said Danny Garcia a 36yearold business consultant who said he has been a LibertarianRepublican for most of his life before supporting SandersIm Bernie or Bust theres no Hillary on my agenda said Garcia who was signing up volunteers to go to Philadelphia during Sanders rally Saturday night Shes using her usual tactics which are to manipulate the populace discourage voters stop people from getting out and trying to control the media narrative which shes been pretty good atCourtney Wold a 25yearold filmmaker from Los Angeles said though she likes and respects Clinton she plans to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in November if Sanders does not clinch the nominationThe first rally he had me in tears along with everyone that was around us We were all collectively crying about how profound the message was Wold said as she waited for Sanders to speak at the Coliseum this weekend My generation  not speaking for the generation entirely but for me specifically  I feel sort of disenfranchised I went to school I got a college degree and then I left with a huge amount of debtIve sort of come to terms with the fact that Ill never own a home Wold said But I dont want that for my children  and Bernies the only one who truly spoke to that We like Hillary We think shes done a lot for women  and I think thats great  but Im not voting based on my gender Im voting based on a platformMany Sanders backers recoil at the notion that he should bow out Tuesday once Clinton has mathematically clinched the nomination with a combination of pledged delegates and superdelegates They will be with him they say all the way through Philadelphia and beyondAbsolutely he should stay and fight said Gary Frazier a leader of the group called Black Men for Bernie Whether he will or not that remains to be seen But you cannot start a political revolution that exposes the corruption in the political system and then expect us to get behind that same political system
