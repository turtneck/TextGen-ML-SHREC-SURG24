Moscows first gay pride parade was held in May 2006 thirteen years after homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia It was supposed to be a joyous occasion the beginning of a new era of openness for the LGBT communityIt didnt quite work out that way LGBT marchers that day clashed with riot police who tried to stop the event We disturbed something very deeply rooted in Russian society some very evil power of intolerance and violence says Nikolai Baev a prominent LGBT rights activist who attended the marchOnly a few months later Russia saw its first regional antigay law passed in Ryazan 200 miles east of Moscow It was the first official sign that the Russian authorities would resist the LGBT movementa resistance that has grown and become increasingly violent as LGBT activism has grown over the last decadeThat violence hit Dmitry Chizhevsky in November 2013 when he attended a weekly meeting for the LGBT community and friends called the Rainbow Tea Party in Saint Petersburg It was a place to socialize drink some tea and play some games Chizhevsky says It wasnt a political event and Chizhevsky wasnt much for protestsThe old town had a hectic feeling that weekend as the 10 th Annual March Against Hatred took place in the citys gracious main streets The next day on November 3 the tea party was more crowded than usualI saw two guys next to the door wearing masks Chizhevsky recalls After that I heard shots The first one hit my eye They yelled Where will you run faggot and one hit me several times with a baseball bat Then the attackers ran away One of the small balls from a pneumatic pistol stayed behind my eye The police ran a rather lackluster investigation and no one was ever arrestedHe became an unsolved statisticjust one of a growing number in Russias LGBT community whove been attacked or harassed in what has become an unprecedented crackdown In most of the West gay rights has seen startling breakthroughs in the last decade Russia has not just been left behind but has become demonstrably worse and more dangerous according to more than two dozen individuals we spoke with in five Russian cities over six weeks of reporting On the local and national level a series of socalled antigay propaganda laws were passed that made it illegal to discuss LGBT themes with minors or to distribute such information to them even if it dealt with health issuesIn a country that increasingly punishes the other and where violence against select groups and individuals is often toleratedand even encouragedby the state theres become no greater target than being LGBT A community that was just beginning to organize found itself under assault the target of a deepseated Russian homophobia that had now been embedded in lawAnd for Chizhevsky although he thought about staying in his native land the price of being gay in Russia was ultimately just too high Like more and more gays and lesbians over the last two years Chizhevsky had had enough of Russia a place where his sexual orientation alone seemed to make him an enemy of the stateSometimes I dont know how I feel about it Chizhevsky says about the trauma of that day I feel that I have gotten used to it over the past year I am thinking more about the opportunities ahead and the future I want to build in the United States In July 2014 a little more than six months after the attack Chizhevsky arrived in New YorkA selfeducated software developer Chizhevsky made his way to Washington DC where he discovered an LGBT community that was out and open and living without fear Chizhevsky decided to try to make a life here and to seek political asylum in the United StatesHe was one of many Russian gays and lesbians to make that trek US asylum applications from Russians rose 15 percent overall in 2014 when there were 969 new cases The US government does not release the reasons people seek asylum but asylum seekers like Chizhevsky say the spike is at least in part a result of the crackdown on the LGBT communityEveryone says that my case is not very difficult because it has been so well documented Chizhevsky says over coffee at Busboys and Poets on 14 thStreet in Northwest DC Even the United Nations asked Russia about my casea fairly typical part of the process since asylum seekers need to prove that they are in danger at homeDespite the trauma Chizhevsky is one of the lucky ones LGBT activists interviewed in Moscow Saint Petersburg Kazan and Archangelsk say there is a pitched level of anxiety for those who stay behind All of a sudden people started calling us Sodomites says Tatiana Vinnitchenko 41 a lesbian activist with a group called Rakurs Perspective Rakurs is a nonprofit nongovernmental organization that provided legal advice and community centers for the LGBT community in Arkhangelsk which lies some 600 miles from Moscow and is the site of Russias first major seaportVinnitchenko says she expects to be fired this monthfrom her job as a professor at Northern Arctic Federal University because of her activism A Russian language instructor Vinnitchenko says shes been given an ultimatum I had to leave my job or stop my activities in Rakurs Leonid Shestakov the acting rector at the university says there have been conversations of a personal nature held with Vinnitchenko but focused only on the performance of her duties
