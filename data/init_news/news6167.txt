Republican groups are moving to the next phase of their plan to take down Hillary ClintonAfter spending much of the year focused on her use of a private email server as secretary of State as a way of raising doubts about her ethics and honesty outside GOP groups are pivoting to her record as the nations top diplomat to call into question her leadership abilitiesThe focus on national security and foreign policy following the Paris terror attacks and the San Bernardino Calif mass shooting has created a natural opening for Clinton to highlight her experience as secretary of State under President Obama Its also brought a sense of urgency to GOP efforts to turn whats long been considered an asset into a liability by highlighting what they say was Clintons role in the presidents failed policy approaches  especially in Libya as it becomes a safe haven for Islamic State militantsAmerica Rising PAC an outside Republican group is blasting out missives about Clintons role in the US intervention in Libya Iraq Syria and the release of Guantanamo Bay detainees Other groups are also expected to spend millions on television ads next year American Crossroads is combing through digital archives and poll testing for spots that may begin next year said Crossroads spokesman Ian PriorA newly formed super PAC called Future 45 ran its first round of ads in Iowa and New Hampshire using her comments before a special House Benghazi committee that I was responsible for quite a bit of Obamas foreign policy Her tenure of secretary of State is a vulnerability not an asset and it merits serious scrutiny said Dan Conston a senior adviser to the group which is planning additional spotsOn Monday Jeb Bush told an Iowa audience that the Islamic State is taking hold in Libya This is the place that Hillary Clinton even in the debate in Las Vegas said was an example of success in foreign policy of smart power Really said Bush Libya today is completely chaoticPolls show voters trust Clinton more than any of the Republican candidates none of whom have similar foreign policy experienceYet much like 2004 Democratic nominee John Kerry found himself playing defense on national security issues despite extensive foreign policy credentials Republicans see an opportunity to tarnish ClintonDemocrats say Republicans are grasping for a new line of attack because voter interest in her private email server has waned after her testimony before the House special Benghazi committee failed to produce any major revelations about the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya Further Clinton began her campaign with an advantage even greater than Kerry on foreign policy according to polling which Democrats say makes it unlikely the strategy can work the way it did in 2004Its classic Karl Rove Hit your opponent where shes strong said Heather Hurlburt a former speechwriter to Secretary of State Madeline Albright referring to President George W Bushs former chief political strategist They have no choice but to try to tear her down she saidRepublicans acknowledge that this portion of their strategy will be the hardest to execute because it will require significant investments in paid media to make their caseYet there is an opening Beginning with attacks leveled by her Democratic challengers in the most recent debate Clinton is facing increased scrutiny over Obamas 2011 decision to along with a large number of nations intervene in Libya without a plan to fill the void left after the ouster of Moammar GaddafiObama himself has called the ensuing chaos a lesson I had to learn about the need to manage new transitions to democracyIn a Monday interview with CBSs Charlie Rose Clinton repeated that Gaddafi had American blood on his hands and was a threat to the broader region Now the international community needs to join together as do the armed groups unallied with the Islamic State to defeat the terrorist network she saidMichael OHanlon a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution says Libya is the biggest trouble spot for Clinton I do think shes got to maybe rethink her argument right now he said I certainly dont think one can evaluate it as a success he saidYet Republicans have already spent a significant amount of time on Benghazi and they are circulating talking points on controversies that may be harder to sellFor instance that Clinton also misjudged Syrian president Bashar alAssad having referred to him as a reformer and different from his father They are also focused on the administrations drawdown of troops in Iraq which they say left a vacuum for terrorist activity to grow They say Clinton advocated against leaving a residual force in 2011Republicans are also zeroing in on Clintons decision against labeling Boko Haram responsible for many more deaths than the Islamic State a terrorist group  a decision they say allowed terrorist activity to multiplySome of the accusations concerning highlevel national security decisions made in the most private of meetings are difficult to prove while others arent meaningful to the public said Grant Green a former national security official under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W BushIts got to be something that the guy out in Omaha can understand he said Meantime Its easy for her to go out and say Im the only one with significant foreign policy experience said GreenAs you get further into the general campaign and people start paying closer attention she can pick these apart one by one  said OHanlon a nonpartisan expert On issues of Iraq and Syria its pretty clear shes a little more hawkish and shes being vindicated she saidDerek Chollet who served on Clintons policy planning staff from 2009 to 2011 said no one takes pride in what Libya has become Yet inserting US troops after the fact would have overruled the wishes of another sovereign government he said Its hard to find a compelling path that would have prevented what happened said Chollet who is now advising the campaignOn Iraq he said the US timetable for withdrawal was negotiated by the previous administration and that former Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki did not grant legal authority for a continuing troop presence Chollet who worked closely with Clinton at the time said she was very worried about the security of the US embassy and diplomatic facilities absent a US troop presenceThere was an intense debate through the administration on the slope of the withdrawal We were constrained by the limits of the strategic framework Bush had signed he said
