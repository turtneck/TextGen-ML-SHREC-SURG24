The Senate moved closer Tuesday to a deal to avert a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security but the proposal faced an uncertain future in the House where Republican leaders conspicuously refused to embrace itSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy told reporters he was prepared to move swiftly to extend funding for DHS through the fiscal year in a bill that is not contingent on Republican demands to repeal President Obamas executive actions on immigrationUnder McConnells proposal the Senate would vote first on the funding measure and then hold a separate vote on a bill to undo Obamas new immigration initiatives McConnell hopes to assuage conservatives who are determined to confront the president on what they see as abuse of his executive authorityI dont know whats not to like about this McConnell said This is an approach that respects both points of view If successful the proposal will break a twomonth deadlock over funding for the agency that is responsible for border security airport security checks and a range of other functionsBut House Speaker John A Boehner ROhio did not immediately warm to the proposal and it was not clear whether he could marshal enough backing in his chamber to complete the deal to keep DHS open beyond Friday when its spending authority expiresHouse Republicans will huddle behind closed doors Wednesday morning The unsettled DHS debate is expected to be the central focus of their discussionThe stalemate has tested Republicans ability to govern now that they are in full control of Congress Senate Democrats have blocked four attempts by McConnell to move forward on a House bill that would fund the department but that ties that funding to a repeal of the presidents immigration actions which would allow millions of undocumented immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportationAgain on the brinkMcConnells move represented a concession in a fight that has threatened to shut down the agency less than a year and a half after a budget standoff shuttered a broad swath of the federal government for more than two weeks in October 2013Senate Minority Leader Harry M Reid DNev said Democrats want assurances from Boehner that a clean funding bill will pass the House before they will support McConnells plan and allow the votes to move forwardNow all eyes are on Speaker Boehner said Sen Charles E Schumer DNYAsked about the emerging Senate plan Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said by email The speaker has been clear The House has acted and now Senate Democrats need to stop hiding Will they continue to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security or notExiting a House leadership meeting later on House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions RTex said he did not support approving McConnells plan Instead Sessions said Congress should pass a temporary extension of funding for up to six weeks and convene a HouseSenate conference to try to hammer out the differences between the two chambersDHS is scheduled to begin furloughing nonessential workers if Congress does not extend its 40billion budget by FridayAt the White House Obama prepared to inject himself more forcefully into the debate with a townhallstyle forum planned for Wednesday in Miami which has a heavily Latino population The president is expected to address the funding standoff and his immigration plan The administration has appealed a federal judges decision last week temporarily blocking the deferred deportations program under which up to 5million of the nations 11million undocumented immigrants would be eligible for renewable threeyear deportation waivers Many could receive work permitsAs the president tries to rally the public however Obama and his aides have limited their dealings with Capitol Hill White House and Democratic aides said there is little the president can do because he will not undo his immigration actions It is up to Republicans to decide whether they are willing to shut down DHS over the issue the aides saidThis is not a battle with the White House This is a battle taking place on Capitol Hill a White House official said speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking Legislators on the Hill need to work on this  What youre going to see from the administration on DHS up until Friday is continuing to call attention publicly to the potential impact of shutting down DHSTo that end Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and two predecessors from the George W Bush administration  Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge  will attend a news conference scheduled for Wednesday to warn of problems that could occur if the agency is forced to begin furloughsEssential personnel as many as 200000 employees would continue to report to work without pay during a partial shutdown Although Johnson and the White House have said that national security would not be jeopardized they have warned that longterm planning could be affected In an interview Chertoff warned of morale problems in the agency and said he thinks a shutdown would no doubt adversely affect the nations securityA couple days of delay of pay will not make a difference but if it starts to mount up and theres real uncertainty people will start to feel demoralized and that could have an impact over a long period Chertoff said You wouldnt do this to military troops in the field send them into combat but not get paid They need to take this seriouslyDoubts on the rightWhile McConnells plan to split off the immigration issue into a standalone measure opened the door to winning over Democrats conservatives were skepticalSenators arguing fund DHS but vote a separate bill to defund executive amnesty Have you heard of Obama veto Think we were born yesterday Rep Steve King RIowa a staunch opponent of Obamas immigration actions wrote on TwitterMeanwhile the administration has struggled to explain how a partial shutdown would affect national security White House press secretary Josh Earnest asked repeatedly about it Monday declined to say that the nation would be more at risk Rather he said the situation would not improve the nations safetyIts hard to imagine a good time for Congress to be mucking around with the funding of the Department of Homeland Security Earnest said But now seems like a particularly bad onePolitically the standoff could help the White House and Democrats Republicans drew the brunt of public anger over the 2013 shutdown and administration aides believe the same will happen if DHS is affected at weeks endIt is not lost on White House allies that the president is traveling to Florida a key swing state in presidential races for the Wednesday event cohosted by MSNBC and TelemundoIn our travels to the immigrant community the faith community the law enforcement community and the business community they want someone in DC to do something said Ali Noorani executive director of the National Immigration Forum The president has done something The political risk to the administration is only there if they stop doing something Right now its on Republicans to kind of meet the barSenior administration officials are scheduled to appear at another immigration forum hosted by Univision on Sunday in Los Angeles the city with the largest number of immigrants potentially eligible for deportation relief under Obamas executive actionsFor the first time in a long time the immigrant community and advocates are very aligned with the White House said Marielena Hincapi executive director of the National Immigration Law Center I think the fact that hes coming to Miami to meet with immigrant community members and take questions directly from folks speaks volumes
