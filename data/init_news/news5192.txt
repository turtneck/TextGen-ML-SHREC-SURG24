Miami CNN There were few softballs Wednesday night for Hillary Clinton and Bernie SandersClinton was asked whether she lied about Benghazi whether she might be indicted over her emails and why shes seen as so untrustworthy Sanders was pressed on comments he made in the mid1980s about Fidel Castro and pushed to defend his 2007 vote against an immigration reform billOne day after Sanders stunning win in Michigan both candidates were on their game in their only debate before next Tuesdays critical votes in Florida Ohio Illinois and North CarolinaHere are five takeaways from Wednesday nights debate hosted by Univision and The Washington PostNo more middle ground on immigrationClinton and Sanders both broke with the Obama White House and pledged to halt the deportations of undocumented immigrants who dont have criminal recordsI can make that promise Sanders saidI do not want to see them deported I want to see them on a path to citizenship That is exactly what I will do Clinton saidAnd both candidates dismissed Donald Trumps proposal to build a big beautiful wall along the USMexico border as blusterAs I understand him hes talking about a very tall wall  a beautiful tall wall better than the Great Wall of China Clinton said Its just fantasyIt exposed a huge divide between the two parties The Republican frontrunner wants mass deportations The Democratic contenders want no deportations at all Theres no middle ground anymoreThe evaporation of any sort of common ground on the issue of immigration helps explain the political plight of Republican candidates who have supported comprehensive reform measures like Florida Sen Marco Rubio and the departed South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham and former Florida Gov Jeb BushIt also underscores why 2016s election is so much about motivating each partys base rather than appealing to voters in the middle The center didnt holdIt was just days ago that Clinton riding a wave of Super Tuesday victories was dropping her attacks on Sanders looking for ways to appeal to his supporters and casting her eyes on Republicans  particularly Donald TrumpIf shed pivoted into general election mode she went right back to the primary on Wednesday nightOn the heels of her loss in Michigan Clinton was set on attacking Sanders on every question  and most of the time Sanders gave her the clash she wantedClinton cast Sanders as an enemy of liberal icon Ted Kennedy noting that hed voted against Ted Kennedys immigration reform which hed been working on for years before you ever arrivedShe hit him for opposing the auto bailout even though factcheckers had already pointed out that attack amounted to cherrypicking one item out of a much larger bank bailout bill  using that issue to frame Sanders as someone so rigid in his ideology that he cant get things doneIll tell you it was a hard vote A lot of the votes you make are hard votes Clinton said But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that billIt was all a reminder that the Democratic presidential contest might not be anywhere near its end Next Tuesday  when Florida North Carolina Ohio Illinois and Missouri vote  was the day Clinton hoped to knock Sanders out Now Sanders poses a serious threat across the MidwestSure both candidates took their shots at Trump Clinton called him unAmerican and Sanders called him someone who insults Mexicans who insults Muslims who insults women who insults AfricanAmericansBut Clintons strategy was all about taking down SandersClinton made an unusually frank admission when she was pressed on why so many Americans find her untrustworthyI am not a natural politician in case you havent noticed like my husband and President Obama So I have a view that I have to do the best I can Clinton said adding that she hopes people will see I am fighting for themIt was an effective moment  an introspective acknowledgment from a politician who has struggled to project authenticityAnd it came right on the heels of a touching moment between Clinton and a woman who had discussed her hardships after her undocumented husband was deportedPlease know how brave I think you are coming here with your children to tell your story This is an incredible act of courage that Im not sure many people really understand And I want you to know that Clinton saidIt wasnt Bill Clinton personalizing the national debt in a 1992 debate by talking about the people he knows who have lost jobs But Hillary Clinton doesnt necessarily need that knack for making the audience feel a struggling Americans pain the way her husband did She just has to make sure her economic message connectsWhen Clinton attacks she lays out a detailed pointbypoint case on why Sanders was wrong  as if she were delivering the audience a PowerPoint presentationAnd then Sanders just changes the subjectThe simplicity of his overall message and the skillfulness with which he deploys it when hes under attack makes it difficult to land an effective blow on the Vermont senatorFor the second straight Democratic debate Clinton tried to hit Sanders for opposing the ExportImport Bank  noting that hed broken from Democrats and joined with hardline conservatives and Koch brothersbacked groups in voting to abolish itHis rebuttal It is corporate welfare and yes I oppose corporate welfareShe attacked his support for a Medicareforall health insurance system arguing that Sanders idea is too pieinthesky and that Democrats just won a hardfought battle for ObamacareWhat Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all of its people Sanders shot back getting the crowd roaring with a rant about prescription drug companies hold on Capitol HillIts not just a stylistic difference Sanders policy positions are uncompromising and Clintons arentSanders showed what an asset that can be on the debate stage for most of the night  and then what a liability it can be if not among Democrats then in the general election in the closing minutesHe was shown a video of himself in the 1980s and asked about the differences between socialism and communism Sanders answered that he was opposing US intervention in Latin AmericaThe episode opened the door for an attack from Clintons campaign over Sanders refusal to disavow the Castros  whom he had praised decades earlier  and served as a reminder that his activist past is fertile ground for attacksIt was the most tedious unloading of opposition research on a presidential debate stage yet this yearThe candidates even seemed to sense it  tiptoeing into their attacks initially before throwing their best punchesClinton hit Sanders for his vote against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform billJust think  imagine where we would be today if we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago Imagine how much more secure families would be in our country no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one no longer fearing that they would be found out she saidSanders responded by blasting that 2007 measures guest worker provisions saying that workers were abused and if they stood up for their rights they would be thrown out of the country Of course that type of effort leads to a race to the bottom for all of our peopleHe also hit Clinton for opposing drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants and Clinton hit Sanders for voting in 2006 to protect a vigilante border group the MinutemenIt felt like New Jersey Gov Chris Christie  famous for bashing his Senate colleagues tussles over the exact details of bills and amendments on the Republican debate stage  might have been about to dart onto stage to shout them both downTheir debates about old bills were all beside the point when it comes to where the candidates stand in 2016 They largely agree on immigrationrelated issues In fact their real target within the Democratic Party is Obama whos been much more aggressive about deporting undocumented immigrants than Sanders and Clinton say theyd be
