Posted on October 27 2016 by Melissa Dykes This Is Horrifying In another Wikileaks email  this time from Chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council Marc Stanley to Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta dated February 11 2016 Stanley lays out his best argument for why voters should choose Hillary over Bernie click to enlarge He writes I tell the voter that I like Bernie and I like Hillary but thats not what matters What matters to me is that there are 4 justices on the Supreme Court who will be in their 80s and be replaced by the next president  and that President will appoint 40 year old Justices and they will serve for 30 or 40 years He goes on to say that voters shouldnt want Republicans making decisions about issues like Obamacare Citizens United voter rights etc and that Bernie is a 201 horse versus Hillary as a 11 or even 21 horse Can you imagine it Hillary being able to personally nominate four out of nine Supreme Court justices for life  Hillary will own half the Supreme Court and for long after shes gone Thats seven out of nine or the entire Supreme Court basically Think about that for a second Just let it sink in Melissa Dykes is a writer researcher and analyst for The Daily Sheeple and a cocreator of Truthstream Media with Aaron Dykes a site that offers teleprompterfree unscripted analysis of The Matrix we find ourselves living in Melissa and Aaron also recently launched Revolution of the Method and Informed Dissent  Wake the flock up Dont forget to follow the DC Clothesline on Facebook and Twitter PLEASE help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks Share this
