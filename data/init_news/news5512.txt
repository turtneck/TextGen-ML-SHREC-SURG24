Conservation has long been about protecting communities of plants and animals where they are But climate change is leading to a nascent form of conservation that embraces change and seeks to provide a thriving stage on which it can happenGobble Mountain in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts is distinct in that its soil and bedrock are volcanic in origin as opposed to the limestone formations elsewhere in the Berkshires That distinction has led the Nature Conservancy to protect itIts a lateJuly morning and Andy Finton works his way up a trail in western Massachusetts Berkshire Hills walking beneath a canopy of sugar maple ash beech and basswoodAt one point Mr Finton pauses and announces with a chuckle Congratulations Youre on a steep slopeFinton who works for the Nature Conservancy was pointing out something more profound than his announcement might suggest A steep slope is a crucial element of an emerging vision to help plants and animals survive and adapt to a warming world while maintaining high levels of biological diversityConservation efforts typically have focused on maintaining a pristine forest or wetland or preserving specific species or communities of species where they areYet a growing body of research shows that when you scratch the surface of a biodiverse region youll generally find diverse soil types elevation ranges bedrock types and features such as canyons cliffs ravines and Fintons steep slopesThe new approach focuses on conserving landforms in a region that incorporate these diverse geophysical traits  which act as stages on which biological diversity thrives And it focuses on setting up corridors between the stages to allow for species migrationAs the scientific evidence of global warming has mounted conservation often has focused on finding ways to help species or communities of plants track their preferred climate conditions where possible For example a certain tree species might need to move about 30 miles a year higher in latitude to stay within its preferred climate rangeBy focusing instead on conserving diverse settings species may be able to find refuges closer to homeThe tree species might not have to move 30 miles a year to survive Finton says It just needs to move around to the north side of the mountainThe approach is just now gaining momentum The Berkshire Hills trail winds up a hill at the southern end of one of four areas from West Virginia to Maine being targeted for natures stage style conservation by the Open Space InstituteThe Nature Conservancy is using the approach in its landacquisition decisions and advocacy and states such as Maine Massachusetts and Tennessee are beginning to embrace the ideaAdoption is slow acknowledges Peter Howell of the Open Space Institute in New York But youre starting to see an uptick as scientific information is making its way to conservation groups and the foundations that help fund them he says Editors note The original version misstated Mr Howells nameThe concept initially appeared in conservation circles in 1988 At that point ecologists were already moving from efforts to save individual species to efforts to preserve the broader communities in which species livedA trio of scientists from the University of Maine and Brown University suggested that given climate change physical environments  not plant communities  provided the best basis for identifying land to conserve They noted that the plant communities that emerged since the last ice age still havent stabilized change is the norm and this would become even more pronounced amid an era of global warmingInstead the team argued the focus should be on conserving physical settings and corridors connecting them That approach will embrace the communities youre interested in conservingThe approach recognizes that changes to climate alone dont determine where plants insects and ultimately animals will migrate if they can Soil types topography underlying bedrock types and latitude exert the most significant influence on a landscapes potential to host a rich mix of speciesIn western Massachusetts the journey up the steep slope reveals the relationship between biological diversity and landforms The basswood and ash trees for example prefer the accumulated soils and nutrients found at the hills base Higher up slope these and other trees give way to mountain maple and oak which eventually yield to pitch pine The pitch pine can survive in the shallow dry soils at the summitLater in the day along a dirt road that tracks Sanderson Brook Finton points to patches of stinging nettle and explains that the plant is found in flood plains but not on the hills slopesClimate still plays an important role on a range of scales  from the regional down to individual mountainsides Diverse settings can set up their own microclimates which can provide refuges for plants threatened by regional climate changeThe new approach offers hope for helping existing species cope with climate change up to a pointIf climate change is too severe no strategy is going to work says Mark Anderson science director for the Nature Conservancys eastern regionBut how do you determine which physical settings you want to preserveIn 2010 two different research groups came to similar answers and published their conclusions within 45 days of each otherIt was uncanny says Paul Beier a forest ecologist at Northern Arizona UniversityHis team gauged what it called geodiversity by an areas underlying bedrock topography and specific landformsMeanwhile Dr Anderson used satellite data to map different landscape types across the US Northeast and eastern Canada to see which factors best corresponded with biological diversityHis team found for example that range of elevations across a landscape and high limestone levels in the bedrock were among the four best predictors of high biodiversity And all four factors were geophysicalFor its part the Open Space Institute is using these principles  and a 12 million grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation  to help build a network of climateresilient landscapes in four areas in the US Northeast and SoutheastThe institute parcels out the money as grants to local land trusts that want to set aside land and have adopted naturesstage criteria They also work with state and local agenciesFor all its recent progress however the naturesstage concept carries caveats notes Jacqueline Gill a paleoecologist at the University of MaineFor instance climate change itself can change landforms as morefrequent and moreintense rains accelerate erosion in some regionsMoreover the approach may not be appropriate for keystone species which still may require speciesspecific interventionThe iceage record tells us that losing large keystone animals like mammoths and giant ground sloths has significant consequences for the rest of the ecosystem and were only just beginning to understand those consequences she saysElephants represent one current example of keystone species that require a custom conservation touch Elephants create a great deal of habitat on which a range of plants and animals relies Dr Gill notesIts not a popular idea necessarily but not all species are created equal she saysAnd scientific questions about the approach have yet to be answeredThe question wed really like to answer says Gill is whether geodiversity has corresponded to biodiversity through time  and how landform durability influences biodiversityA project in the Amazon could begin to provide answers The project aims to test the idea that the rise of the Andes Mountains some 10 million years ago essentially doubled the diversity of plants in Amazonia by among other effects providing a narrow slice of unique microhabitats along the ranges eastern slopes as it roseThe region hosts some 90000 plant species says Christopher Dick an evolutionary biologist at the University of Michigan and one of the projects coinvestigators Of those 45000 appeared with the uplift of the Andes The rest appear in the Amazon basin which by some estimates is between 50 million and 100 million years oldThe basin is something of a museum for large numbers of very old species Dr Dick says The slopes of the Andes are where morerecent evolutionary action has occurred  driven the team posits by changes in the geophysical settingBack in the Berkshires Finton sums up the goals behind conserving natures stage Were trying to prevent extinction in the face of climate change
