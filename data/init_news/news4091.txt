Before a critical round of primaries on Tuesday the Republican presidential field gathered for a debate in Florida site of perhaps next weeks most pivotal contestHere are the top takeaways from Thursday nightsdebateYoud be forgiven if you assumed Thursdays debate would be something akin to a professional wrestling cagematch After all it was just a week ago that Trump was nottoosubtly defending his manhood in response to a recent jab from Marco Rubio about the size of his hands There was none of that at the University of Miami To be sure there were shots at Trump and he returned in kind but they were mostly policyorientedRubio hit Trump on Social Security the numbers dont add up he said of Trumps proposals Both Rubio and Ted Cruz took on the frontrunner for being insufficiently supportive of Israel On Israel Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians Cruz said As president I will not be neutral Thats a far cry from the tone and tenor of recent debates and perhaps a recognition by all the candidates  and particularly Trump the favorite to emerge as the nomineeof a need to change the publics perception of the GOP campaign has voters look ahead to NovemberTrump perhaps the ultimate provocateur of the 2016 field seemed almost stunned by what was happening on stage So far I cannot believe how civil its been up hereIt doesnt take sophisticated political analysis to understand that Rubio needs to win in his home state of Florida next Tuesday to maintain any semblance of a path forward particularly after poor showings in this weeks contests The Florida senator has clearly moved away from the more personal assault on Trump an approach he in recent days acknowledged he regrettedOn Thursday night he aimed to take on Trump by more by demonstrating a superior understanding of policy whether on entitlements or foreign policy Rubio the son of Cuban immigrants also sought to draw a contrast with Trump on the restoration of relations between the United States and Cuba Trump said he wouldve focused on making a better deal with the Communist nation Rubio countered Heres a good deal Cuba has free elections Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out Cuba has freedom of the press   Thats a good deal Earlier pushing back against Trumps boasts against political correctness the Florida senator scored some points with this lineIm not interested in being politically correct Im interested in being correctPolls paint a bleak picture for Rubios hopes of overtaking Trump but his more subdued controlled approach to taking on the frontrunner may at least give voters a glimpse of the candidate who at leastfor a time seemed to be the GOP establishments best chanceCruz and Trump havent found much to agree on recent weeks but they did find common cause on one issue Thursday night delegate mathI guess theres two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment Trump said referring to himself and Cruz as the only two GOP hopefuls who can still win the nominationDonald is right Cruz said There are only two of us that have a path to winning the nominationDonald and myself Indeed Trump and Cruz are far ahead in the delegate race with the New York billionaire at 458 and Cruz with 359 according to the most recent Associated Press tally more than 200 delegates ahead of Rubios 151Cruz clearly wants a oneonone battle with Trump who likewise doesnt want delegates scattered so widely that it could increase the likelihood of a contested convention that ultimately turns against him To that end Trump laid down a marker for how he thinks the nomination should be decided regardless of whether someone gets secures a majority 1237 through the primaries which he called a very random numberI think that whoever gets the most delegates should win Trump saidThats what I thinkOhio Gov John Kasich like Rubio faces a mustwin in his home state on Tuesday In the University ofMiami debate he sought as he has throughout the campaign to highlight his experience He cited the support he had from 55 of the foreign policy experts in this country and detailed his many years on the House Armed Services CommitteeHe also defended some of his views that arent exactly in sync with many of the partys most conservative activists On Common Core he said all Im in favor of in Ohio is high standards Contrast that with Cruz who called Common Core a disaster On the environment Kasich said I do believe we contribute to climate change but I dont think it has to be  either youre for some environmental stringent rules or you know youre not going to have any jobs The fact is you can have bothThese positions might be seen as heretical among some conservatives but if and its a giant if he can survive in the race long enough for states with larger segments of more moderate voters to hold contests those views could position him as a more viable alternative to Trump or Cruz
