CNN The Republican establishment is making the most of the chance it had long sought to finally say this to Donald Trump You crossed the lineEver since announcing his presidential run last month the brash unfiltered billionaire businessman has created headaches for the party Particularly his comments equating some Mexican immigrants to rapists and criminals left GOP leaders struggling to appease those Trump had offended without alienating conservative voters attracted to his views on combating illegal immigrationBut on Saturday Trump seemed to hand party bosses and the pack of 2016 Republican presidential candidates a golden chance to take him down at almost no political cost  while making themselves look magnanimous The spark for the latest political firestorm came when the New York real estate billionaire questioned on Saturday whether Arizona Sen John McCain a Vietnam War veteran who languished in a prisoner of war camp for more than five years was a genuine war hero because he was capturedI like people that werent captured OK Trump said drawing gasps and boos from a conservative crowd in IowaWhat transpired within minutes of those inflammatory comments was telling The GOP pileon was swift and outspoken McCain might be a controversial figure with plenty of enemies in Washington but hes universally regarded as a rare example of pure heroismThe Republican National Committee which stays neutral in the GOP primary and rarely weighs in on political debates made the unusual move of publicly condemning Trumps remarksNo place in our partyThere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said on TwitterWhile the GOP was shy in responding to Trumps tirade against Mexico it became clear on Monday that the partys hierachy was not going to be bitten by the Donald againRight now what you are seeing is the party taking a dramatic shift this weekend  taking Donald Trump head on Mitt Romneys former senior political advisor and CNN contributor Kevin Madden told Wolf Blitzer This is their chance to really draw some stark contrasts about the direction of the party This is an opportunity for a lot of these candidatesOne after another Trumps fellow GOP presidential candidates were quick to go after the former host of the reality TV show The ApprenticeEnough with the slanderous attacks former Florida Gov Jeb Bush tweeted South Carolina Sen Lindsey Graham a close friend of McCains said Trump had crossed a line today that will offend most every one that I know and predicted that American voters would only have this message to Trump Youre firedFlorida Sen Marco Rubio said that Trumps shot against a man who refused to take early release from the infamous Hanoi Hilton prison because his comrades could not come too disqualifed the billionaire as a potential commander in chiefFormer Texas Gov Rick Perry an Air Force veteran  who is languishing in the polls and needs every headline he can get  upped the ante  calling on Trump to immediately withdraw from the 2016 race altogetherTrump by alienating sectors of the GOP electorate is already breaking all the normal political rules so its not surprising he didnt choose to return to the high ground True to form he decided to intensify the row rather than walk away or simply apologize penning an opinion piece in USA Today that was scathing of the media the establishment and McCainThe reality is that John McCain the politician has made America less safe sent our brave soldiers into wrongheaded foreign adventures covered up for President Obama with the VA scandal and has spent most of his time in the Senate pushing amnesty He would rather protect the Iraqi border than Arizonas Trump wroteOne Republican candidate chose not to join the torrent of criticism of Trump Texas Sen Ted Cruz was effusive in praise of McCain who once called him a wacko bird but trod carefully on Trump possibly hoping to appeal to the billionaires supporters should he eventually exit the raceI recognize that folks in the press love to see RepublicanonRepublican violence and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else he said Im not going to do itHillary Clinton enjoying a rare moment out of the political spotlight also took a chance to have a shot at the hate Trump is spewing towards Mexicans and stood up for her old Senate buddy McCainEven the Obama White House no friend of McCain pounced on the opportunity to fan the flames of a controversy that Democrats hope will damage the Republican political brand Spokesman Josh Earnest praised McCains remarkable serviceThe GOPs swift and nearly unanimous criticism of Trumps remarks about McCain was particularly striking in light of how the party dealt with an earlier political row set off by his highly controversial comments  even if it marked an easy political choiceIn his presidential announcement speech last month Trump said that some people entering the United States from Mexico were rapists criminals and drug dealers The comments flew in the face of the GOPs desperate need to improve its standing with the increasingly influential demographic of Hispanic voters which are vital in general election swing states like Florida Nevada and ColoradoThe episode suggests that though candidates like Bush and Rubio know very well the perils of estrangement from the community they are not yet at ease with the base of their own party which remains vociferously opposed to any immigration reform that would bring millions of illegal immigrants  eventually  into the US foldMore immediately there is increasing speculation on whether Trumps broadside against McCain would turn out to be the moment when the billionaires political bubble bursts  in a way that would offer some relief to the GOP leadershipA new ABCWashington Post National poll on Monday had Trump leading the Republican field on 24 but his number dropped into the single digits in samples taken on Sunday following his McCain comments albeit in a small sample sizeMadden predicted that Trumps bombast would indeed sooner or later begin to take a toll on his poll numbersIts the beginning of the end  part of the process This information is going to start to get to voters he said They are going to see a revelation in his character right now as well as his temperament that is going to lead them to look at other candidatesWhile it could be the case that Trumps remarks could narrow what many analysts already think is a virtually nonexistent path towards the GOP nomination that doesnt necessarily equate to an early exit for the reality show starFor now the McCain clash seems to leave Trump where he most likes to be  in the middle of a raging storm of publicity generated by himself about himself while taking shots at the media and the Republican political establishment Its the kind of behavior that gave his presidential run a fast start among a certain sector of the Republican electorate in the first place
