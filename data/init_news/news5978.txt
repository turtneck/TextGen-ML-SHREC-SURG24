This item has been updatedHouse Republicans voted Wednesday to undo years of President Obamas immigration policies launching a fresh attack on his executive actions as part of a plan to renew funding for the Department of Homeland SecurityBut in doing so Republicans exposed fresh rifts in their expanded ranks as more than two dozen members mostly from suburban districts in swing states voted against plans to end a program granting temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of dreamers  or children brought to the country illegally by their parents who have served as the emotional centerpiece of the yearslong debateHouse approval of the spending bill is just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February when homeland security expires Legal challenges to Obamas immigration orders led by Republican state attorneys general are underway A senior GOP lawmaker suggested Wednesday that House and Senate leaders might also file suitThe bill passed 236 to 191 with the support of two moderate Democrats But 10 Republicans voted against the final bill Earlier 26 Republicans  including several new members from suburban districts around Chicago Las Vegas Miami and Philadelphia  joined Democrats in voting against a proposal to end Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programRep Mario DiazBalart RFla a veteran Miami Republican who was among those to vote against the bill and the DACA amendment said that his party wont be able to settle the immigration fight until it negotiates a bipartisan compromise with ObamaRegardless of what happens this week this month on this issue it will not make the issue itself go away he saidBut Rep Robert Aderholt RAla said he was encouraged by the strong support the bill received from fellow Republicans He was lead author of an amendment that would effectively invalidate the executive actions taken by Obama in November and his policy instructing federal immigration officers to focus their efforts on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds The amendment passed with GOP supportIt was a strong vote I think it sends a message to the Senate as it goes forward And were optimistic about it he saidIn the wake of terrorist attacks in France last week Republicans have faced criticism from Obama and congressional Democrats for delaying swift passage of new security funding Some party leaders and operatives also worry that the aggressive nature of the bill will once again spoil GOP attempts to appeal to Hispanic and Asian voters in the 2016 president election But GOP congressional leaders have said that the legislation is designed only to respond to Obamas executive overreachWe do not take this action lightly but there is simply no alternativeSpeaker John A Boehner ROhio said ahead of the vote as he recounted the 22 times he said Obama has raised doubts about his ability to change immigration policy through presidential powers Enough is enough he added laterThe White House denounced the House vote saying Republicans were putting homeland security funding training and longrange planning at risk Obamas top domestic policy adviser Cecilia Muoz reiterated Obamas threatened vetoThe House GOP is interested in debating immigration but only interested in debating it if they undo the most significant and constructive actions that have taken place in many years she said in a conference call with reporters Republicans are doing nothing on immigration that would move the country forwardGil Kerlikowske the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection said Obamas executive actions are aimed at allowing the department to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed felonies or have terrorist ties rather than those who are living in the country illegally but do not break other lawsPrioritization is critical for any law enforcement agency he saidWhile 218 Republicans voted for the amendment ending DACA the no votes came from newlyelected Reps Bob Dold RIll from the Chicago suburbs Cresent Hardy RNev from the Las Vegas suburbs Ryan Costello RPa and Tom MacArthur RNJ from the Philadelphia suburbs Carlos Curbelo RFla who represents a Miamiarea district Martha McSally RAriz who won her election by fewer than 200 votes and Rep John Katko RNY from an Upstate New York district that has switched parties several times in recent yearsThey were joined by senior Republicans in their state delegations including Floridas Mario DiazBalart and Ileana RosLehtinen Adam Kinzinger of Illinois New Jerseys Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo New Yorks Chris Gibson Richard Hanna and Peter King Pennsylvanias Patrick Meehan and Charlie Dent and Nevadas Mark Amodei and Joe Heck Other members including Reps Jeff Denham RCalif Devin Nunes RCalif David Valadao RCalif Fred Upton RMich and Mike Coffman RColo also voted noIn the Senate Republicans control 54 seats but 60 votes will be needed to advance the bill and no Democratic senator has expressed support for it The impasse means Republican leaders will need to negotiate a watereddown bill that can earn Democrat support pass the Senate and be sent back to the House before current homeland security funding expires on Feb 27If Republicans fail to block Obamas immigration policies through legislation House and Senate leaders may team up on a new federal lawsuit challenging him House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte RVa said Wednesday Noting that several states are now challenging Obamas immigration actions in court he said a similar suit might be brought by GOP lawmakers in the House and SenateNo decision has been made about that he said at a reporter breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor adding that its likely to be the subject of talks at a twoday GOP policy retreat that begins Thursday at a conference center in Hershey PaCongress has the right to write the laws and appropriate funds to programs under Article I of the Constitution and if we are successful in using that legislation and make it clear that there is no legal authority for the presidents actions then we dont need to get to litigation he addedSean
