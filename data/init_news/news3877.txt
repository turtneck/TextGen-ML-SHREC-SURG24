uproar this week over his comments about Heidi Cruz and over his handling of an incident involving his campaign manager and a female reporter that led to an arrest summonsOf course Trump has shown himself to be an unstoppable force who has offended pretty much everyone at this point without much harm to his poll numbers But for Republicans worried about the damage Trump could do at the top of the ticket with offthecuff or controversial quotes Democrats including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton  gave a harsh reminderThe Republicans all line up together Clinton said in an interview with CNNs Anderson CooperNow maybe they arent quite as open about it as Donald Trump was earlier today but they all have the same position she said noting antiabortion positions taken by both John Kasich and Ted Cruz  If you make abortion a crime  you make it illegal  then you make women and doctors criminalsWednesdays controversy unfolded less than a week before the April 5 Wisconsin primary

an argument that his opponents have been making for some time to little effectAsked Wednesday by MSNBCs Chris Matthews whether a woman who got an abortion illegally should face punishment the current GOP frontrunner said he supported that ideaYes there has to be some form of punishmentTrump said adding that he didnt know what form of punishment would be acceptable He also said that men involved in an unwanted pregnancy that led to an abortion would not face any type of punishmentIts the latest demonstration of how little Donald has thought about any of the serious issues facing this country Cruz said after taping an appearance on ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Live Wednesday nightI am prolife Being prolife means standing and defending the unborn Cruz added But it also means defending moms Defending women And defending the incredible gift women have to bring life into the world And Donalds comments they were unfortunate they were wrong and I strongly disagree with itThe antiabortion group Susan B Anthony List framed Trump as a candidate who is new to the issueAs a convert to the prolife movement Mr Trump sees the reality of the horror of abortion  the destruction of an innocent human life  which is legal in our country up until the moment of birth Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the group said in a statement But let us be clear punishment is solely for the abortionist who profits off of the destruction of one life and the grave wounding of anotherAbout three hours after he spoke to MSNBC Trump reversed course issuing a statement saying that his prolife position has not changedIf Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible not the woman the statement said The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her wombThat didnt mollify opponents who have seen him as a fake conservative who has been a noshow on the big conservative fightsWhile Trump has since clarified this position on punishing women his statements suggest he should spend more time with prolife conservatives to gain a better appreciation of what their goals and objectives really are said Tony Perkins Family Research Council Action president and Ted Cruz backer The prolife movement values both mother and child and seeks to uphold the dignity of both by seeking to protect both from the damage of abortion and the predatory abortion industry
