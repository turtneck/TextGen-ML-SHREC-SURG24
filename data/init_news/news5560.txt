TheAffordable Care Act has now survived three Supreme Court challenges and countless Republican repeal votes in the House With Obamacares place seeminglycemented in history the laws architects are quietly crafting the next Democratic healthcare agenda lowering costsA halfdozen key Democratic policy influencers from the head of Hillary Clintons 2008 policy team to former Obama administration officials are starting to plan for a postObamacare Washington In recent interviews they describe twin goals  improving quality of care while making it cheaper  that will require building a coalition quite different from the one that supported health reform in 2010The ACA is here to stay and we should assume that but that doesnt mean everyone is satisfied says Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden who has close ties to Hillary Clinton after running her policy staff in 2008 Health expenditures are a big problem from the individual perspective If you look at public opinion and what people are most anxious about its still health care costsThe ACA is here to stay but that doesnt mean everyone is satisfiedObamacare faced ferocious opposition from the right but the underlying idea  get more people signed up for coverage  was one that public health advocates and liberals could rally behind Now as the priority shifts to quality and cost the policy problems become much more difficult to tackle and the solutions less clearPolicies that reduce cost systemwide often leave consumers paying more outofpocket for health care That can split coalitions that came together around the more unifying goal of covering the uninsuredWere trying to get groups that represent consumertype constituencies to begin a much more significant focus on quality and cost says Ron Pollack president of the nonprofit Families USA a group that was instrumental in organizing advocates and industry in support of the Affordable Care Actthe policy problems will become more difficult  and solutions less clearBuilding coalitions in the multibillion healthcare industry where each stakeholder has different priorities is excruciating work A litany of failed attempts at health reform including Hillary Clintons own 1994 efforts provide a gloomy backdrop So some are skeptical that after the Obamacare battle left many badly bruised health care will become a prominent agenda item on the next Democratic presidents docketThey will do everything they can to not use the phrase health care Obamacare Medicare period says Bob Kocher a former Obama administration official The standard talking points will be that were proud we expanded coverage to all Americans and that we want to protect thatThere are myriad thorny health policy issues that Democrats could tackle everything from getting coverage to the millions of Americans still uninsured to reforming medical malpractice laws But the increasing consensus is that the next effort will have to focus on reducing costs for one simple reason Health care in the United States is expensive Insanely outlandishly expensiveThe United States spends 28 trillion on healthcare annually That works out to about onesixth of the total economy and more than 8500 per person  and way more than any other country The average American spends 735 annually on outofpocket health care costs which is spending above and beyond monthly premiumsThe past five years have brought a glimmer of good newshealthcare costs have grown at a slower pace After years of rising faster than the economy health spending has grown at the same rate as other sectors since 2009But consumer advocates are concerned that the individuals arent seeing enough of that slowdown show up in their wallets  that health insurers and hospitals rather than consumers have reaped most of the benefitsWorkers contributions to their insurance benefits have increased 81 percent over the past decade the Kaiser Family Foundation recently found Employers contributions rose too but more slowly 65 percentThe percent of workers in a plan with a deductible over 1000 has risen from 6 percent in 2006 to 32 percent in 2014 the same study showedThis is the paradox of cost control in the healthcare system so much of the spending is hidden from patients and so many of the costcontrol efforts rely on making that spending more visible to patients that successful efforts to cut costs can feel to patients like cost increasesWe want to ensure that the benefits of slower cost growth actually drive towards individuals Tanden says Theyre the only people who arent benefiting right nowJust like Obamacare the battle to lower costs will require new coalition building and risks turning onetime friends into enemies The doctors and hospitals who benefit from expanded coverage  and a wave of new consumers  are the exact same constituencies that stand to lose the most if America spends less on medicineIn the leadup to the Affordable Care Act debate Families USA organized a series of strange bedfellows meetings with health care groups across the political spectrum This helped get everyone from unions to insurers to doctors onboard behind the concept of expanding coverageFour years later in 2013 Pollack quietly worked on what he calls a miniversion of the same meetings He held about a dozen meetings with Karen Ignagni chief executive of Americas Health Insurance Plans and officials from the Pacific Business Group on Health which represents employersSome of these groups arent necessarily the ones who were our strongest allies on the Affordable Care Act Pollack says Insurers were a bit leery of the health reform effort which would force them to accept the very sick customers that their individual market plans typically rejectedthe bedfellows get rearranged depending on what is going onBut in this new round of reform insurers arguably stand to be one of the biggest winners They benefit if costs go down because they can sell less expensive coverage  and that makes them the more natural partner of Democrats in this new era of reformThis is an issue where the bedfellows get rearranged depending on what is going on says Zeke Emanuel a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and former Obama advisor on health policy Doctors and hospitals are a big part of the area where we have to reduce costs They may not be so friendly to every industry on that scoreThe hospitals who embraced Obamacare quickly may approach this new effort skeptically cuts to overall health spending could translate into cuts to their bottom linesExactly how to control health care costs will be a matter of debate among policy experts over coming months but some ideas are already beginning to emerge in advance of the 2016 electionFamilies USA outlined its priorities in a January 2015 paper tiled Health Reform 20 which included ideas like giving public programs the authority to negotiate lower drug prices and putting lower caps on deductibles in Obamacare plansTanden says CAP will release a similar paper later this year though she declined to comment on particular policy approaches until then But there is a paper that Tanden and many other CAP fellows coauthored in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012 which gives some clues about their current thinkingThe list of 23 authors on the paper titled A Systemic Approach to Containing Health Care Spending reads like a whos who of the Democratic health policy establishment At least half have spent time in the Obama administration It suggests full transparency on health care prices allowing the government to competitively bid for the medical equipment it buys Medicare patients and increasing the scopeofpractice for lowerlevel providers like nurse practitionersTo effectively contain costs they write solutions must target the drivers of both the level of costs and the growth in costs Solutions will need to reduce costs not only for public payers but also private payers Finally solutions will need to root out administrative costs that do not improve health statusPapers like this come out all the time in Washington But one with so many CAP coauthors is especially important because of the think tanks close ties to Hillaryland Its founder John Podesta has already been announced as the chair of her notyetexistent campaign And Tanden was policy director for Clintons 2008 campaignMost groups CAP included are also enthusiastic about proposals that would tether more health care dollars to the quality of care that patients receive  an idea the Obama administration has taken up in recent months In January Health and Human Services set a goal of having at least 90 percent of all Medicare payments related to quality by 2018A new Democratic administration would likely take leadership on how to make sure hospitals and doctors actually hit that benchmarkHow quickly Democrats could  or would  move on health care remains an area of debate The president and Democratic legislators have had to spend five years now dealing with the fallout of passing a divisive law that has not become more popular since the day it passedBut others argue that health care is an inevitable agenda item for any president Democratic or Republican The fact that health care costs consume onesixth of the American economy makes them a huge budgeting concern  whether a president is enthusiastic about the inevitable political battles or notThere is sometimes a Washington perspective that the Democrats did health care Emanuel says You dont do health care once You do health care forever Its not a marathon Its life
