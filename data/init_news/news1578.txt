Based on the possibility that you will become the nominee of the Republican Party and perhaps the president of the United States I offer you the following thoughts on what you need to do as this unusual primary season approaches its homestretchI do this out of dedication to my country and Party I want Republicans to win the presidency and I am worried about the harm that will be done if Secretary Hillary Clinton becomes presidentYour loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday is a sign that your style of campaigning is catching up to youYou have done a powerful job of energizing some 35 to 40 percent of Republican primary voters and you have made the Republican Party more attractive to lowerincome working Americans who typically question whether the GOP cares about them But getting to 50 percent is your problem and many of your recent statements and tweets are driving away the people you need to close the dealIf you want to close the gap and win a majority of the Party you need to1 Stop fighting with everyone and dont be so nasty When you tweet unflattering pictures of Senator Cruzs wife and threaten to spill the beans about her question Ben Carsons faith offer to pay the legal bills of those who engage in violence fault POWs or accuse President Bush of being a liar you push away voters you need to get to 50 percent If you keep acting like this you will keep your 40 percent  they love it  but youll never hit 50 percent Its too hot too much too often Pick smarter fights and do so in a less belittling and pejorative manner You can make provocative points and be true to yourself if you would only be smarter about how and when you fight2 Get your facts right Think about how much stronger you would be if you supported your statements with accurate facts or anecdotes If you had said a small group of Muslims cheered from rooftops in New Jersey on September 11th no one could have faulted you Same thing when you say we send nothing to Japan or when you misstate the trade deficit with China You often fudge up your poll numbers too You regularly show that facts are malleable to you and that raises doubts about your substantive knowledge on all sorts of matters3 Learn more policy Your comments about abortion were a doubleedged disaster You alienated everyone They showed you are not familiar with the background of an important emotional issue Anyone aware of Right to Lifes thinking knows mothers are not criminals You need to take the time to learn a variety of issues You might think everyone in Washington is stupid but there are a lot of smart people in that town who actually care about issues and you should find the ones you trust and listen to them No one expects you to memorize arcane policy points But it will be harder for you to reach 50 percent if voters think you cant demonstrate sufficient knowledge to sit in the Oval Office4 Make policy announcements Youre an outsider with business experience and people want to hear what you would do if elected beyond building a wall On energy policy corporate welfare agriculture policy and dozens of other matters you would surprise people and grow your support if you gave a small number of actual policy addresses The point will be less what you say about each specific matter so long as you demonstrate some level of fluency and expertise and more that youre capable of doing it Some onethird of the Party supports you because they think youre tough You would make inroads with other voters if they thought you were thoughtful5 Stop citing polls Politicians who talk about polls do so to show the election is all about them But elections are not about politicians Elections are about the hopes and dreams of the voters and especially now voters want someone who can lift up our country defend us and grow the economy I get that you talk about the polls to show youre a winner But if and when you start losing more contests the polls will define you as a loser What will you talk about then Its better to knock it off now And of course all the recent polls show you are losing to HillaryYou got yourself to where you are today by demonstrating an uncanny powerful outsiders bravado But the gap between 40 percent and 50 percent support is immense The higher hanging fruit is tough to get and you wont likely earn that support if you stay on your current pathThe Super Tuesday news conference you held at MarALago and your policy speech on a TelePrompter to AIPAC were your two best moments demonstrating there is more to you than bravadoWhatever you do just remember you cant win if you cant
