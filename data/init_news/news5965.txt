Headlined to H3 102616  Advertisement  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act aka ObamaCare was intended to dramatically increase the number of Americans with health coverage while bending the cost curve that is reducing the expected increases in price over time The plan managed the first goal at least in the short term Unsurprising isnt it that more people get coverage when the law requires them to buy it penalizes those who wont and subsidizes those who cant afford to But the progress on that metric is beginning to disintegrate and were moving in the other direction Bloomberg reports that 14 million Americans in 32 states will lose the health plans they now have next year as major providers pull out of the ObamaCare exchanges because theyre losing money Apaprently a business has to take in more than it spends if it wants to remain a going concern Im sure Ive read that somewhere As far as bending the cost curve is concerned  well  according to the US Department of Health and Human Services cited by US News  World Report  average premiums rose by 75 last year and will rise by 25 in 2017 Price inflation for most consumer goods over the 20152016 period averaged a little more than 1 Forgive me for thinking that when costs increase at 725 times the rate of inflation thats not really a lot of bend to the curve In 2009 I described the then notional yet to be passed into law ObamaCare as government feeds you to the insurance companies while simultaneously feeding the insurance companies to you The state takes home a doggie bag Which is about the size of it and I was far from the only person who noticed and warned that the plan not only wouldnt work but COULDNT work if the goal was reducing costs and increasing access to health care Artificially increasing demand relative to supply can only have the opposite effects Since 2010 Republicans who by the way first proposed the individual mandate scheme have slowly but surely retreated from the idea of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with nothing instead proposing various schemes for keeping government as involved as possible in health care while pretending to return it to the free market there hasnt been a free market in health care for more than a century since the American Medical Association got licensing schemes imposed by the states so that it could limit the number of doctors and thereby keep their salaries high  Advertisement  Most Americans are now worse off vis a vis health care than they were six years ago The only winners have been government health bureaucrats And unfortunately the politicians dont seem to be interested in getting out of the way and letting the market fix things Next stop Single payer  Advertisement
