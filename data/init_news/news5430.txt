In the first and only VP debate Tuesday night Tim Kaine and Mike Pence made up for lost opportunities in the first presidential debateDemocratic vice presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine l and Republican vice presidential nominee Governor Mike Pence discuss an issue during their vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville Va on Oct 4 2016No vice presidential debate has ever swung a presidential race And in 2016 with two largerthanlife characters at the top of the Republican and Democratic tickets that truism will surely holdBut on the biggest night of their political lives Gov Mike Pence R of Indiana and Sen Tim Kaine D of Virginia still performed a valuable service for Republican Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton They advanced the story lobbing fresh attacks on each others bosses and delving into policy differencesFor Governor Pence the debate was a welcome opportunity to move beyond the worst week of the Trump campaign Mr Trump was widely seen as having lost to Mrs Clinton last week in their first debate and made matters worse by continuing for days to go after a former Miss Universe whom he had once mocked Then The New York Times got hold of bits of an old Trump tax returnPence faced a barrage of incoming from Senator Kaine and in many cases declined to defend Trump That in fact may have been the smart strategy Otherwise Pence might have spent the entire debate playing defense responding to accusations about Trumps taxes admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin demeaning comments about women and birtherismInstead Pence deflected and ignored much of Kaines assault When Kaine asked Pence why he wasnt defending Trump Pence replied Im happy to defend him  and then continued to not defend him on many of the pointsWhen Kaine accused Trump of running an insultdriven campaign Pence ignored the vast catalog of evidence and turned the slam back on his opponent Ours is an insultdriven campaign Pence interjected with mock incredulityThen he ran for daylight What about Clinton calling half of Trump supporters a basket of deplorables Pence counteredIt was a comeback that Trump had failed to make in his debate against Clinton  one of many missed opportunities that night But one by one Pence checked off those boxes also raising the controversies around Clintons private email server and the familys charitable foundationIn a way for Pence it was a doover debate  a way to score some points against Clinton that Trump failed to do last week and show him how to keep his cool during a debate Clinton and Trump face off again on Oct 9And if Pence has his eye on 2020 as many observers suspect he may well have helped himself At the very least Pence is now positioned to play a major role in helping the Republican Party pick up the pieces if Trump losesFor Kaine the debate was a chance to unload a torrent of sound bites against a Trump candidacy loaded with vulnerabilities But he came in so aggressive and interrupted so much especially at first that Pence was widely seen as winning on temperament  an important measure of whether a candidate is presidentialKaine got off some obviously rehearsed oneliners that may turn up in future Clinton campaign ads More than once he referred to Trump as the youre fired candidate and Clinton the youre hired candidate And he accused Trump of having a personal Mount Rushmore  President Putin Kim Jongun Muammar Qaddafi Saddam HusseinThe tenor of the debate shifted markedly when the subject of faith came up Both men are deeply religious  Kaine is Roman Catholic Pence is a bornagain Evangelical  and they spoke from the heartModerator Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked each to discuss a time when faith conflicted with governing Kaine spoke of his struggle as governor of Virginia with the death penalty which he opposesIt was very very difficult to allow executions to go forward but in circumstances where I didnt feel like there was a case for clemency I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law and I did Kaine saidPence didnt offer a similar example and instead used the opportunity to speak on the sanctity of life He also offered warm words for Kaine I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaines sincere faith I truly do he saidPence then turned to the ClintonKaine tickets support for abortion rights including socalled partialbirth abortion which Kaine had in fact once opposedBut it was a respectful critique And in a campaign nearly devoid of discussion on issues that matter to religious conservatives a crucial element of the Republican base Pence surely in that moment did his ticket some good
