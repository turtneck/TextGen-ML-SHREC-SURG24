Boulder Colorado CNN The Republican presidential campaign is entering a decidedly more combative phase as candidates prepare to take the debate stage on Wednesday nightThe GOP field is seeing a shakeup after remaining static for weeks Longtime frontrunner Donald Trump no longer appears invincible thanks to the climb of Ben Carson Jeb Bush has hit hard times but promises to show a more muscular side Carly Fiorina failed to turn her strong debate performances into winning poll numbers And since the last debate in midSeptember Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker has left the raceHere are six things to watch in the CNBC debateFrom his perch at the top of the Republican field Trump had largely declined to go after Ben Carson training his fire instead on other more seasoned politicians like Bush Marco Rubio and Rand Paul Referring to Carson as a good person who he admires personally Trump has even fueled speculation the retired neurosurgeon could be on his vice presidential short listBut those days of playing nice are overAn abrupt shift in tone came after a series of consecutive polls showed Carson had overtaken Trump in Iowa relegating the businessman to second place Then on Tuesday Trump even lost his first place spot in a national poll trailing Carson 26 to 22 according to Tuesdays CBSNew York Times pollIf the last week offers any indication Trump is expected to throw multiple punches at Carson on the debate stage The attacks could get personal The real estate mogul appeared to suggest over the weekend that Carsons religious affiliation  hes a Seventhday Adventist  was extremeBut it will take a whole lot more to get Carson firing back Known for his reserved and calm demeanor the candidate has repeatedly said he has no interest in becoming an attack dogBen has said hes going to stay who he is and he wouldnt want to get elected being somebody else said Ryan Rhodes Carsons Iowa state director He does not need to tear someone else down to build himself upWhen Bush steps onto the stage Wednesday night there will be visual confirmation of his recent struggles Rather than take the podium immediately next to Trump Bush will be two spots removed from the GOP frontrunner for the first timeThe former Florida governors national poll numbers seem permanently stuck in the single digits behind political novices like Trump and Carson Last week the campaign announced new costcutting measures followed by a weekend Bush family confab in HoustonHe needs to have a performance that stands out from the crowd He wont be center stage this time so he need to in words and actions figure out how not to fade into the wings said Katie Packer deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign Packer is neutral in the race but is a founding partner of WWP Strategies which works for Rubio in MichiganBushs advisers are suggesting Bush may try to do just that on Wednesday by showing off his more fiery and loose side The campaign is tearing up the script and preparing to simply let Jeb be Jeb sources told CNNs Jamie GangelTheres no question that Carly Fiorina is the star of the Republican debate teamWhats less clear is whether she can translate the momentum from her primetime performances into a lasting boost for her candidacyThe former HewlettPackard CEO used a breakout performance in the last CNN GOP debate to propel herself from a littleknown firsttime presidential candidate to a toptier contender But that surge in the national polls has all but vanished she fell from 15 in September to 4 in last weeks CNNORC surveyHer campaign has pushed back on any suggestion that Fiorina may be going from one breakout moment to the next and instead emphasized that shes focused on winning over voters at a slow and steady paceIm glad people liked her debate performance and liked her message but one debate does not win the thing deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores saidDebt ceiling To raise or not to raiseIn a debate thats promising to focus on jobs and the economy one issue could divide the Republican candidates on the stage Wednesday the debt limitRaising the debt ceiling is a Congressapproved maneuver that essentially allows the US government to carry more debt in order to allow the Treasury Department to continue paying its bills The issue has become highly divisive among Republicans in recent years Fiscal conservatives argue they would rather let the country default on its financial obligations than increase national spendingThis week congressional leaders and the White House reached a twoyear budget deal that would raise it through early 2017Raising the debt ceiling is politically explosive on the right Some candidates pander and say they never will raise it said Douglas HoltzEakin president of the American Action Forum and economic adviser to John McCain in 2008 Others will invoke something like the Boehner rule and argue that spending cuts will make it worth it But the real test is who will say yes we have to raise itOf the 10 Republicans participating in the primetime debate these four rank at the bottom Mike Huckabee Chris Christie John Kasich and Rand Paul And theyve been there most of the raceAccording to CNBCs average of recent national surveys each of those Republicans poll around 3 With the Iowa caucuses now just three months away these candidates are under pressure not only to boost their rankings but also to persuade donors to keep funding their bottomtier campaignsChristies campaign raised just over 4 million in the third quarter while Kasich raised around 44 million since launching his campaign Thats not much more than the 39 million Trumps campaign raised without actually trying Meanwhile Rand Paul raised 25 million last quarter while Mike Huckabee pulled in 12 millionWill there be much of a debateEvery candidate faces a shared challenge Wednesday night persuading viewers not to change the channelAfter coming under fire from candidates like Trump and Carson CNBC agreed to keep Wednesdays prime time debate to just two hours commercials included The network also agreed to allow opening and closing statements for each candidate which means even less time for the White House hopefuls to tackle questions go after rivals and make a splashThe first two GOP debates were recordsetting blockbusters pulling in an unprecedented 24 million and 23 million viewers eachNot only are those numbers becoming increasingly hard to beat as the novelty of the debates wears off but the debate also happens to collide with Game 2 of the World Series between the New York Mets and the Kansas City Royals
