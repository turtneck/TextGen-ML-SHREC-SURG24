told CNN on Thursday nightTracking dogs picked up the scent of prisoners Richard Matt and David Sweat at the station and followed it east toward the town of Cadyville Wylie saidThere is also a Subway sandwich shop at the gas station and Wylie said the prisoners might have been looking for food in the trash binThe store opens at 4 am so it would have been staffed about the time officials believe the convicted killers broke out There is limited security video from the store and authorities were reviewing itWylie said the dogs were still on the scent Thursday evening and they were working their way in from the perimeterIf this is an actual true lead that the dogs are following on we hope to be successful in the next 24 hours he saidEarlier Thursday law enforcement search crews converged on a

relationship between prison seamstress Joyce Mitchell and one of the two escaped inmates according to a state official briefed on the internal investigationWylie confirmed the inquiry to CNNs Anderson Cooper 360 but said the allegation was unfoundedThere wasnt enough evidence to support a finding inside the department of corrections Wylie saidBut he added I dont believe that the information was

denied her involvement in the breakout  because of the earlier complaint the source saidState corrections officials declined to comment because of the ongoing investigationNew York State Police Superintendent Joseph DAmico has said Mitchell an industrial training supervisor at the prison had befriended the men and may have had some sort of role in assisting themThe state police

minute Her cell phone was used to call people connected to Matt according to another source Its unclear who made the calls when they were made or whether Mitchell knew about themMitchell told investigators that Matt made her feel special though she didnt mention being in love with him a source familiar with the investigation saidWhile she didnt warn authorities about the escape she has answered all their questions each time theyve gone back to her a New York state official saidAuthorities are holding off on charging her with being an accomplice hoping instead to have her continued cooperation a New York state official told CNNWylie the Clinton County district attorney said his office is considering possibly charging her with felonies One would accuse her of being an accessory to the escape and the other would be for promoting prison contrabandMitchells family is standing behind her with her daughterinlaw telling CNN that 95 of what is being said is not truePaige Mitchell denied that her motherinlaw was to be the getaway driver and that she helped provide the power tools used in the escape She added that Matt may have persuaded her motherinlaw to contact people for him
