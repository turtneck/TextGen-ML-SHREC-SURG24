What If The Supreme Court Had Gone The Other Way On ObamacareThis post was updated at 1215 pm ET to reflect the Supreme Courts rulingThe Supreme Court ruled Thursday that statebased subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are legal A different decision could have affected the health care of millions of Americans In King v Burwell the court chose to allow the exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act Obamacare to many to continue operating asis It could have ended the subsidies in most states allowing many lowerincome Americans to afford the insurance offered through those sitesAt issue in the case was a phrase in the law stating that the government will subsidize patients in exchanges established by the state In King v Burwell the question was whether those subsidies should then go to people participating in the exchanges in the 34 states that didnt set up their own  that is in states where the exchanges are federally run to some degreeThere are two broad paths the Supreme court could have taken here but within those there is a lot of room for variationEverything stays the way it is  people keep getting their subsidies in all states regardless of whether the government the state or a mix of the two runs their exchangesObamacare customers in states using federal exchanges would have likely lost their subsidies altogether That means an estimated 64 million people could have lost the tax credits that helped them pay for their insurance through the exchangesBut there were other potential more mixed outcomes in which fewer people would have lost their subsidies Because there were different configurations of federalstate cooperation residents of some states could have kept their subsidies while others could have lost them For example five states have staterun marketplaces using federal websites  it was possible that the court could have decided either way on those states as they use federal resources even while operating their own state marketplacesSo what could have ended up mattering here was the question of what a staterun exchange is It was possible the court could have defined that but it could have also sent it to the administration And depending on how the administration set the bar on what makes a staterun exchange this path could have led to still more litigation from Obamacare opponents challenging how the administration set that definition explains Linda Blumberg at the Urban InstituteIn the 16 states plus the District of Columbia with staterun exchanges nothing would have changed with this outcome But the effects in the other 34 states could have gone beyond just more expensive health care One study from the Urban Institute estimated that 82 million more people would have joined the ranks of the uninsured in this case Not only that but because so many healthy individuals would have exited the exchanges premiums would have gone up by an estimated 35 percent for people remaining on the exchanges in the states that lost their subsidiesFlorida by far leads the pack in having the most people who were at risk of losing their credits There a staggering 13 million people could have lost subsidized health insurance missing out on an average subsidy of 294 per month according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation In Alaska fewer than 17000 people could have been affected but their price tags could have grown in a huge way  by 536 per month on averageWith reporting from Gisele Grayson and Joe Neel
