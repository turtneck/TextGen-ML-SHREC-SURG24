Home  POLITICS  FBI FOUND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS BELONGING TO HUMA ABEDIN ON WEINERS LAPTOP FBI FOUND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS BELONGING TO HUMA ABEDIN ON WEINERS LAPTOP 5 SHARES 102916 With furious Democrats  and the Clinton Campaign  now openly blasting the FBIs reopened investigation as Republicans take delight for once in having a government agency reinforce their side of events the question turns to just what emails were found on Weiners laptop and how damaging their contents are for the FBI to take the unprecedented step of intervening in a major political event just days before the national election We first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday  when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at  courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release some 110 emails  twothirds of the total  were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clintons private clintonemailcom to transact State Department business One email from May 15 2009 was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clintons private email server at  Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving timetables and deliverables for her review via Alec Ross a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton However while forwarding Hillarys emails to her personal email server for convenience is one thing what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiners computer in the above example the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted with PAGE DENIED stamped across the first redacted page An argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission This is a nuanced point being pushed by Hillary Clinton supporters such as Newsweeks Kurt Eichenwald who in an article yesterday tried to make a case citing sources even though the FBI said that nobody has seen the content of the WeinerAbedin emails that  no emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton  Post navigation
