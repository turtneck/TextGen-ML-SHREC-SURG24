Accuracy in Media At this time in history organizations like Accuracy in Media are needed more than ever The bias in the media has been exposed as a poison that undermines the publics right to know and threatens the future of democratic selfgovernment Our duty is to tell the American people what has happened to their oncegreat country In his letter to Donald J Trump New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said Congratulations on a tremendous campaign You have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully Belichick is not alone Poll after poll has confirmed that the American people understand and recognize the problem of liberal media bias In fact the bias is just one aspect of the corruption that surrounds us and infects the government A Quinnipiac University poll found that 55 percent of voters told pollsters that Trump was right when he charged the media were biased against him An Associated PressGfK poll found that Overall 56 percent of likely voters say the media is biased against Trump One cannot say with certainty that the media bias in the 2016 campaign was worse than say the elections of 2008 or 2012 Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton enjoyed extraordinary media bias in their favor One difference this time around is that the media bias has been extremely welldocumented by the emails released from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta We have seen the evidence of how the collusion and collaboration occur The evidence shows that journalists work secretly with one major political party the Democrats against conservatives and Republicans Needless to say all of this is a blatant violation of the ethical standards that journalists profess to uphold The preamble of the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists says they believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy Ethical journalism strives to ensure the free exchange of information that is accurate fair and thorough An ethical journalist acts with integrity Instead they have compromised their integrity in order to elect a woman whose record as a security risk should make her ineligible to seek the presidency But its worse than being unethical We see in one of the emails that Washington Post journalist Dana Milbank was in touch with the Democrats about crafting one of his antiTrump columns This email proves that Milbank has been functioning as an operative of the Democratic Party Of course those of us who have watched his appearances at conservative events over the years had suspected what was going on Now we have the proof of the actual collaboration The email portrays help for Milbank as a research request from the columnist In other words he couldnt even write his own columns He was lazy and liberal What this suggests is that Milbanks function was to write or put his name on certain articles in order to divert attention away from scandals involving Democrats In the latest case  in order to justify a Post blackout of Danney Williams charges that he was Bill Clintons black son Milbank would cover his news conference and make fun of the event Such an attack serves two purposes One it justifies the Posts decision not to cover the event as a legitimate news story Second it scares others away from covering it How many conservatives in the media shied away from the story In his landmark book The Corrupt Society  Robert Payne wrote There are many weapons that can be used to prevent the corruption of societies The most powerful of these weapons are vigilance and knowledge Hence the importance of the press radio and television to break through all imposed restrictions to discover how the government works how it arrives at its decisions how it manages its defenses how it deals with traitors especially the traitors in its midst Payne dedicated his book to Richard Nixon That was a joke of course because Payne found Nixon and his administration to be utterly corrupt Nixon was forced from office for covering up a burglary into the offices of the opposition political party the Democrats Stories in The Washington Post sparked his resignation in the Watergate scandal Victor Laskys book It Didnt Start With Watergate  proved that Democrats had done similar things In 2016 the Democrats nominated a candidate whose corruption made Nixon look like a choir boy Nixon was ruthless but he was determined to promote American interests in the world He was critical in exposing State Department official Alger Hiss as a Soviet spy By contrast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is one of those traitors Payne had warned about Her illegal private server full of classified information was open to hacking by foreign governments Her top aide Huma Abedin arranged for some of Mrs Clintons emails to be stored on a computer shared with her pervert husband The Clinton Foundation laundered money to her husband on behalf of foreign governments seeking favors from the State Department And the FBI at this late date refuses to hold any of them responsible for undermining the security of our nation Meanwhile The Washington Post facilitates this corruption in government by failing to expose it And one Post journalist has been exposed as a lazy liberal pawn of those who were in charge of getting Mrs Clinton into the White House The Christian existentialist philosopher Soren Kierkegaard wrote about the corruption in the church and how church and state had become one In his critique of the Danish State Church he said everyone knew privately that the system was rotten and corrupt but they would not say so publicly Just as one says that death has marked a man so we recognize the symptoms which demand to be attacked It is a battle against lies he said The problem we face today is not just media bias but corruption in government and the media that runs so deep that it is uncomfortable for some to even talk about it publicly Cliff Kincaid Cliff Kincaid is the Director of the AIM Center for Investigative Journalism and can be contacted at cliffkincaidaimorg View the complete archives from Cliff Kincaid  0
