CHARLESTON SC  Emanuel AME Church swung open its doors for services Sunday four days after a 21yearold white man who told police he wanted to start a race war allegedly killed the pastor and eight congregants attending a Bible study in the church basementHundreds lined up in the hot Charleston sun to climb the stairs to the sanctuary of Mother Emanuel one of the countrys oldest African American churches and one with a rich history of resilience The organist played and church bells chimed as the choir sang Blessed AssuranceWorshipers from Charleston and across the country filled the pews and balcony of the church Some watched the sermon from seats in the fellowshiphall basement  where the shooting occurred WednesdayThis is our house of worship said the Rev Norvell Goff presiding elder of the Edisto District of the State Conference of the AME Church addressing the congregants The doors of the church are open praise be to GodNo evildoer no demon in hell or on Earth can close the doors of Gods churchMany in the pews fanned themselves furiously beating back a thick heat and their fragile emotions People fought tears rocking back and forth Some comforted each other in long embraces Ushers passed out bottles of cold water And above them all loomed the pastors usual seat empty covered by a black clothIn Emanuel AMEs nearly 200yearold history the congregation has withstood slavery segregation racially motivated laws to keep worshipers from meeting and fires set by angry white mobs But the massacre Wednesday of state Sen Clementa C Pinckney who was the churchs pastor and eight church members left many wondering how such a horrible tragedy could occur in a place they consider a safe havenFor Charlestons Emanuel AME Church shooting is another painful chapter in rich historyIt has been tough its been rough and some of us have been downright angry But through it all God has sustained us and encouraged us Goff said When times of trouble come into our lives how do we respond Do we respond by being afraid Or do we respond in faithGoff encouraged the congregation to continue to pray and look to God for healingThe blood of the Emanuel Nine requires us to work for not only justice in this case but for those living on the margins of life he said We must stay on the battlefield until there is no more fight to be foughtReporters he said had asked him how some grieving family members who attended the bond hearing of suspect Dylann Roof could say they would forgive him Roof who was arrested Thursday in Shelby NC about four hours away from the church was charged with nine counts of murder and possessing a firearm in the commission of a violent crimeThe families Goff said were holding on to a strong faith that teaches them to love their neighbors God is our refuge and our strength Goff said We ought to put our hope and trust in GodDaniel E Martin Jr 52 who said his family has been on the membership rolls of Emanuel for more than 100years said the church would heal and grow stronger Its painful and difficult but if you know anything about the people of faith Charlestonians members of the church you will understand when we come to church we receive the word of GodHis wife Reba Martin 54 a steward in the church said when she walked in the church Sunday she thought she saw Pinckney Pastor was so tall she said I can almost see him standing there with all the people who sat next to him in the pulpitReba Martin said the congregation full of people who had come to share in the service was an answer to Pinckneys dream of getting more people to come to church When pastor first came our congregation was so small he would say One day you will see the church full to the rafters That happened todayOn Saturday Charleston police gave church leaders permission to open the church Church leaders met in the basement which police had cleaned covering bullet holesI was pleased when authorities made a phone call and said you can go back in Mother Emanuel Goff said The open doors of Emanuel on this Sunday sends a message to every demon in hell that no weapon formed against me shall prosperMany members said they looked forward to the church opening its doors Others were still hesitantHow do you bring yourself to a place where tragedy struck said Brandon Robinson 26 minister of music of Little Emanuel a sister church There is an opened wound Someone lost a brother a husband a father a sister and auntieBefore sunrise Sunday sextons  keepers of the church  began clearing a path amid hundreds of flower bouquets left on the church steps by mourners Some lit white votive candles and prayed Others threaded longstemmed red and pink roses through the bars of the churchs gatePolice officers swept the church early in the morning and screened worshipers as they filed in No backpacks were allowed in the building At least half a dozen officers stood watch sometimes passing out water and butterscotch candies to churchgoersPeople shaken by the tragedy stood looking up at the churchs white steeple and prayedYou have individuals across the country asking How could God allow something like this to happen said the Rev Branden Sweeper 30 who was close friends with Pinckney Church is still the best place to beMother Emanuel as members call the church founded in 1816 is one of the oldest and largest AME churches in the South The white stucco church with towering steeples wooden rafters and arched stainedglass windows sits in downtown Charleston on Calhoun Street The church was the site where in 1822 Denmark Vesey a freed slave planned one of the biggest slave insurrections in US historyWhen authorities were made aware of his plot Vesey and a number of his followers were executed according to the book African Methodism in South Carolina a collection of histories compiled by the AME ChurchThe church was burned down by white crowds And even more strict regulations were imposed on Charlestons Black Churches the book said By 1834 all black churches were closed by state law Some members of the church joined white churches and others continued the tradition of the African church by worshiping underground In 1865 Emanuel AME resurfaced with 3000 membersWith the latest tragedy still looming large in the church Sunday some members doubled over in grief weeping for the victimsThere they were in the house of the Lord studying your word praying with one another but the Devil also entered an elder said in a prayer Sunday And the devil was trying to take charge But thanks be to God  hallelujah  that the devil cannot take control over your people and the devil cannot take control of the churchEartha Ugude drove eight hours Saturday from Port St Lucie Fla compelled to be in the service I felt such a tremendous loss she said from her seat 10 rows from the pulpit I felt helpless and tired  one more tragedy against our peopleThe shooting she said was cowardly The gunman sat amongst themNight of SC killings started with prayers and a plot against humanityGoff preached that the members should not respond to the tragedy with fear Do we respond by being afraid Or do we respond in faith Goff asked As for me and my household we will serve the Lord because it is by faith we are standing here this morningAcknowledging the congregation has difficult days ahead Goff said The only way evil can triumph is for good people to sit down and do nothing We are children of God We will march on to victoryThe service ended with a prayer May the people of God say Amen Members who filed out of the church said they were encouraged by the sermonMarlene CoakleyJenkins whose sister Myra was killed in the church basement said she was inspiredI think the message was powerful positive and compassionate CoakleyJenkins said on the church steps Everything the family needed at this particular time It gave us strength and faith It allowed us to have all the emotions that an experience like this might conjure and moreSomeone asked her whether she was thinking of the shooter I pray at some point he finds Gods mercy she said Gods mercy is even there for him We cant afford to lose one soul
