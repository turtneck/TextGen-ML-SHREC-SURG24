In contrast to Obamacare the Bush health plan envisions a much smaller role for government and a much bigger role for individual choice and competition in the marketplace Bush health care differs from Obama health care in five significant waysWithout the employer mandate all of the antijob provisions in Obamacare would be gone Right now employers have perverse incentives to keep the number of employees small to reduce their hours of work and to use independent contractors and temp labor instead of full time employees Under the Bush plan no employer would be punished for creating jobsWithout the individual mandate families would be free to buy insurance that meets individual and family needs rather than the needs of politicians What woman would willingly choose to buy health insurance that offers free mammograms while she is healthy but makes her pay full price if there is a symptom of something wrong Thats only one of the many needlessly wasteful and expensive consequences of letting health insurance benefits be determined by the political systemAlso without the individual mandate there is no reason for anybody to remain uninsured The Bush tax credit is equal to the average tax subsidy received by employees who get their heath insurance at work Lets say a family for whatever reason had no additional disposable income It would still be able to buy a health plan with its tax credit Lower income families could qualify for additional help I suspect they would always be able to buy Medicaidlike insurance with no additional cash outlayBut dont we need mandates in order to keep people from gaming the system We have found better ways in Medicare Part B Medicare Part D and with Medigap insurance In those markets if you dont buy when you are eligible you can face penalties In most places if you dont sign up for Medigap insurance when you are first eligible you can be individually underwrittenThe uniform tax credit is also a huge improvement Because Obamacare conditions its subsidies on income it raises the marginal tax rate for middle income families by six percentage points and in some cases far more At 400 percent of poverty a family can lose more than 10000 in subsidies if it earns one additional dollar At other cliff points families can be subjected to thousands of dollars of additional exposure higher deductibles and copayments as a result of earning one more dollar All these perversions vanish if everyone gets the same subsidy regardless of incomeAlso if the subsidy doesnt vary by income all kinds of technical problems with healthcaregov would vanish in a heartbeat Virtually all the technical problems in the exchanges stem from the need to verify income That means that the computers run by the exchanges have to interface with the computers of the IRS and other government agencies Yet in the main government computer systems dont know how to talk to each other and thats a problem that may never be solvedIf every one of the same age gets the same subsidy the exchange doesnt have to check with the IRS to verify income Next April 15 there wont be a plethora of additional taxes and refunds because almost everyone wrongly predicted his income for the previous year According to HR Block as many as 34 million people got reduced refunds this year because they underestimated their income when they enrolled in ObamaCare insurance plansThe portability provision is another huge improvement over the current system Right now if employers give employees pretax dollars to buy their own insurance in the individual market the Obama administration is threatening to fine them 100 per employee per day If you think thats overkill it tells you just how much the current administration dislikes employees buying and owning their own insurance With the Bush plan all the antiportability provisions in current law will be gone
