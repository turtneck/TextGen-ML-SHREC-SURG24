The Obama administration says new visa rules passed by Congress could undermine the Iran nuclear deal But Congress embraces its role as a watchdogThe Iran nuclear deal may be signed sealed and on the road to implementation but there are signs that the sparring between the Obama administration and Congress is merely taking new formsThe newest flashpoint is a new visawaiver law designed to reduce the risk of terrorists entering the country The measure appears to force anyone who has traveled to Iran since 2011 to get a visa before visiting the United StatesSome administration officials worry that this kind of provision could be opponents way of undermining an agreement that they couldnt defeat outright Secretary of State John Kerry responded by telling Iran that President Obama would waive the provisions that might interfere with the nuclear dealFor their part critics see Mr Obamas proposed waiver as another sign that hes going soft on Iran in order to preserve a major piece of his foreign policy legacyThe tension points to the deep mutual suspicions that remain on Iran As a result the path forward could be a narrow one with Congress embracing its role as an Iran watchdog while Obama pushes for the space to allow the agreement to take holdFor the moment some officials say the administration is eyeing upcoming parliamentary elections in Iran The hope is that smooth implementation of the nuclear deal will boost moderate candidates in the February votingBut others say this is the wrong time to be placating IranSecretary Kerrys promise suggests the administration will bend over backwards to implement the nuclear deal when actually this is the time when the US should react stronger and show more firmness towards Iran says Alireza Jafarzadeh deputy director of the National Council of Resistance of Iran in Washington an opposition group of exiled Iranians Otherwise theyll pave the way to further Iranian defianceThe new visa law was passed amid heightened concerns over visaless travel in the wake of the Paris and San Bernardino Calif terrorist attacks It affects the citizens of 38 countries whose citizens do not need visas to enter the United States Under the new law citizens of those countries will now need to obtain a visa if they are also citizens of Iraq Sudan Syria or Iran Moreover some interpret the law to mean that anyone who has visited those four countries since 2011 will also need a visaIran officials worry that the new law could hurt the Iran economy Business representatives who know they could have a harder time entering the US could be deterred from visiting Iran they sayIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the New Yorker the new visa provisions were absurd adding no Iranian or visitor to Iran had attacked the West Whereas many people have been targeted by the nationals of your allies or people visiting your allies So youre looking at the wrong addressThe comment seemed a thinly veiled reference to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan whose nationals or recent visitors were involved in the Paris and San Bernardino attacksKerry pledged in a letter to Mr Zarif that the US would implement the new visa rules so as not to interfere with legitimate business interests in Iran and was looking into ways to waive any aspects that violated the nuclear dealAdministration officials say they have no intention of going soft on Iran Indeed they recently held a closeddoor briefing for members of Congress at which they laid out actions undertaken to counter Irans efforts to spread its influence in the Middle East The officials revealed the recent US intercept of a shipment of Iranian arms destined for Houthi rebels fighting a war against the USbacked government in YemenNuclear deal critics like Mr Jafarzadeh say they cringed at Kerrys quick reassurances to Iran It was very troubling to say the least to see Secretary Kerry rush to send a letter to Zarif that gives unwarranted promises of multipleentry business visas to a government whose economy is run by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps an organization whose agenda includes terrorism buying influences in international affairs and exporting Islamic fundamentalismEven some congressional supporters of the nuclear deal are warning that strict vigilance of Iran must continue Members of Congress have expressed particular concern about two Iranian ballistic missile tests in recent weeks At least one of them violated a Security Council resolution barring Iran from testing missiles that could potentially carry nuclear warheads according to the United NationsOn Thursday Sen Chris Coons D of Delaware  a backer of the deal  warned against anything short of relentless implementation of the agreement and aggressive enforcement of separate sanctions aimed at curbing Irans support for terrorism human rights violations or their ballistic missile programIf we take our eye off this ball he said they will take that as a clear signal that  they have carte blanche to continue their actions that are antithetical to our values and interests
