A few hours before the start of this weeks Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas the tweets started to pour inThey all had the same strange hashtag FeelTheChafe a reference to the FeelTheBern Bernie Sanders supporters were using to rally around their candidate But it had a snarky twist for Lincoln Chafee the former Rhode Island governor and senator whos been so far a much less popular presidential candidateBy the end of the night FeelTheChafe had gone from being a hashtag Twitter assumed was made by Chafee supporters to being one used to soundly ridicule the manBy the next day the hashtag had even made it to TV becoming part of a Jimmy Fallon riff on his latenight show And a lot of people were asking the same question who in the world on Chafees team thought that hashtag was a good ideaHeres the thing though From what we can tell it was not actually his teams idea At some point over the last few months the occasional Chafee supporter began using FeelTheChafe seemingly positivelyHow did it all change And perhaps an even better question how did it all startWell NPR found the first person on Twitter to actually use the hashtag FeelTheChafe when talking about the Chafee campaign That tweet occurred on May 29 of this year from an account belonging to Greg Newburn NPR reached out to Newburn to see what inspired himNPR It seems as if you were the first person on Twitter to use the FeelTheChafe hashtag in relation to Chafees bid for president Before that it was used when ladies were talking about working out in yoga pants and stuff So talk about that first tweet you did with the hashtag I think you posted it soon after Chafee announced he was running Do you recall thatNEWMAN Yeah I do recall that If I recall correctly that was right around the time that the FeelTheBern hashtag was just taking off among some of Bernie Sanders most diehard and early supporters on Twitter And I follow several of them so I was familiar with the FeelTheBern hashtag And when Lincoln Chafee announced someone tweeted it his announcement and it just sort of clicked it just made sense to me It was just some sort of throwaway joke reallyDo you like Lincoln Chafee Oh I guess from what I know about him sure he doesnt seem like a bad guy But to tell you the truth I havent thought too much about him one way or the otherWhen you tweeted the hashtag for that first time was it meant to be a positive thing or a negative thing or just a funny thingYeah it was not negative nor positive I thought it was funny so I tweeted itWho are you supporting for PresidentI dont really have a candidate to be honest I like several of the Republican candidatesBut not the Dem candidates No I dont think I like any of the Democratic candidates Jim Webb I guess a little bit Im a Republican Ill probably vote RepublicanHave you been following the FeelTheChafe hashtag I was shocked at how many people have used it cause I didnt follow it Like I said it was a joke And I tweeted it Im not even sure I saw anything about Lincoln Chafee between the time I tweeted that and then the debate the other night I dont think I saw him in the news even once I was surprised to see so many people using it  Im just under the assumption that someone else independently came up with the same hashtag and it took off from there probably someone with considerably more followers than I haveYouve seen what this hashtag has become Its kind of been used to ridicule this guy Does that make you feel bad Laughter I dont like it when anyone gets ridiculed I guess But hes a politician and hes in the public sphere so I assume he can handle this type of criticism And Im reasonably certain that whatever the intent its probably in good fun its probably in good faithIf you were in a room with Lincoln Chafee and he was like Oh hey youre the guy that did that hashtag what would you say to him Well I guess it would depend on what his reaction to the hashtag is I would hope that he would understand that it was all in good fun and certainly not political in any meaningful way And then I would probably ask him if he supports sentencing reform Newman is the Florida State Policy Director of Families Against Mandatory Minimums And if he does I would say Yay thank youIf you could do it all over again and if you knew that your hashtag would take off so much would you have crafted that tweet differentlyNo I would have written it the same way I think its funnyNPR also reached out to the Chafee campaign to see what it thought of the hashtag gone wrong Team Chafee confirmed it did not start the hashtag and did not know who did When we asked if it had been following FeelTheBern and how they felt about it we got this from campaign spokeswoman Debbie RichGovernor Chafee applauds any political involvement in general and the creative attention to his campaign in particular
