The Israeli leader may be able to form a more stable government than his last but he had to run hard to the right in the campaign and reverse his stance supporting a Palestinian stateIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greets supporters at the partys election headquarters in Tel Aviv Wednesday March 18 2015 Netanyahus ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the countrys election final results showed Wednesday a stunning turnaround after a tight race that had put his lengthy rule in jeopardyIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus 11thhour campaign decision to swerve deep into rightwing territory  reversing his support for a Palestinian state and urging supporters to counter droves of Arab voters  has paid off in a stunning victoryHis Likud party trailing its leftist opponents in the final polls not only closed the gap but surged to a sixseat victory over the Zionist Camps 24 seats in national elections Tuesday according to a nearcomplete tally Wednesday morningThe clear margin will almost certainly give Mr Netanyahu a fourth term as prime minister And while President Reuven Rivlin called Tuesday night for the two top parties to form a national unity government both rejected the ideaNetanyahu now looks much better positioned to build a rightwing nationalist government that would allow him to govern unfettered by the wide ideological differences that doomed his previous coalitionDear friends against all odds we got a great victory for the Likud party he said in a jubilant election night speech at Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv to chants of Bibi Bibi BibiThe fiercely fought campaign which just days before the election seemed headed toward a major political upheaval was in many ways a referendum on Netanyahu The two main campaign slogans were Only Netanyahu and Just not NetanyahuWith turnout increasing to 684 percent and nearly a quarter of the votes cast for Likud the voters answer was clear But the political and social cost  never mind the 60 million pricetag of holding elections  remains to be seen Once the confetti settles and Netanyahu turns to the task of actually trying to rule a deeply fractured country besieged by enemies he will be facing many of the same challenges  but with few fresh ideas and perhaps fewer friendsI was very disappointed with the fact that there was no real discussion about the issues Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein of the Likud party told reporters Tuesday night in Tel Aviv It was probably one of the lowest campaigns we had and we wasted the opportunity as a country and a society because when exactly are we going to discuss the real issues if not during an election campaignNetanyahu called early elections last fall after firing two of his coalition partners Finance Minister Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni of the Hatnua party He argued that he couldnt govern effectively with such an ideological gap One of the divisive issues was the coalition parties opposition to a bill that would have formally identified Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people a move some saw as undermining its democratic nature and marginalizing the countrys 20 percent Arab populationAt the time another Netanyahu victory seemed a pretty sure bet But Ms Livnis decision to partner with the Labor partys Isaac Herzog gave the prime minister a run for his money attracting voters with their more moderate position on Palestinians as well as their commitment to socioeconomic issues As of the final polls last Friday they were projected to win by three to four seatsSo Netanyahu widely recognized even by his foesas a shrewd politician abruptly switched tack After weeks of promoting himself as the only leader who could protect Israel against Iran Hamas and the Islamic State he started talking about the things that were hurting Likuds traditional bluecollar base the skyrocketing cost of housing and groceries He vowed to appoint as finance minister Moshe Kahlon of the Kulanu party a former Likudnik from a humble background whose monopolybusting policies reduced charges for cellphone plans by 90 percentNetanyahu also openly cannibalized votes from estranged rightwing allies like Naftali Bennetts Jewish Home party and Avigdor Liebermans Israel Beitenu A day before the vote he declared that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch reneging on a 2009 pledge of support for the twostate solution to the Middle East conflictThat puts him on a collision course with the Obama administration which is already fuming over his bombastic speech to Congress two weeks ago in which he criticized a potential Iran nuclear deal But the reversal appears to have played well with his baseAs early indications Tuesday showed an uptick in Israeli Arab voter turnout Netanyahu warned his supporters that Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls putting a rightwing government in danger if they didnt get out of their homes and voteWhen exit polls came in Tuesday night it was clear that his tactics had paid off All three Israeli TV news channels showed him pulling even with the Zionist Camp led by Mr Herzog and Ms Livni with each party getting 27 of the Knessets 120 seats and one poll putting Likud at 28But only Wednesday morning was the full picture clear With 99 percent of the votes counted Likud is projected to get 30 seats to the Zionist Camps 24 Its victory came at the expense of estranged Netanyahu allies Mr Bennett a rising star in the last elections had to settle for eight seats Mr Lieberman was relegated to a recordlow of six Mr Lapid of Yesh Atid who as a rookie in 2013 captured 19 seats also suffered and was downsized to 11We had an atmosphere of a neckandneck race and when you have such an atmosphere we know that  first of all you increase the turnout says Abraham Diskin a political scientist and former statistician for the Central Elections Committee Second the two really leading parties are gaining power from the satellite parties and that  really happened hereThe two ultraOrthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism got seven and six respectively and could well become coalition partners for Netanyahu He is also courting Mr Kahlon whose Kulanu party secured a solid 10 seatsThe Joint List a bloc of Arab parties made history by becoming the thirdlargest bloc for the first time with 14 seats while the leftwing Meretz party barely squeaked into the Knesset with fourProf Avi Degani a pollster and president of the Geocartography Knowledge Group told reporters Wednesday morning that the unexpected surge from Likud was due in part to inaccurate polling that may have galvanized longtime Likud supporters who were on the fencePeople who supported Likud got scared They say I leave my fear and my inability to decide and Im going to save the right and the LikudThat certainly describes voters like Ran Ohayon who was considering abandoning Likud but changed his mind on the eve of electionsTheres a serious threat he said sipping a foamy coffee outside a trendy Tel Aviv caf on Tuesday We havent been in this situation since the 1973 Yom Kippur WarTheres a lot of people thinking like me and you will see that in the election he saidAnd he was right
