National  Since FBI Director James Comeys bombshell announcement Friday that the bureau was reviewing new evidence regarding Hillary Clintons email tar baby many questions have arisen among the Naked Capitalism commentariat as well as more widely about the scope and details of the Presidents pardoning powers There are a few things to clear up right away because Ive seen a considerable amount of misinformation bandied about as to what the United States Constitution permits Readers will please indulge me if in the interest of keeping this post short and sweet I dont debunk each and every wrong argument Ive seen since Friday If I responded to all the crazypants stuff out there tempting as that might be Id never get to my main points Article II Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States except in cases of impeachment  So allow me to summarize the salient points Absolute Power Can Neither Be Reviewed nor Overturned As a Matter of Law The Presidents pardoning power is absolute Pardoning decisions are not subject to judicial review nor can any individual pardon be overturned by an act of Congress The pardoning powers also unlimited as to offenses against the United States so in theory at least as a matter of law a President could pardon someone for committing any offense against the United States  I leave to one side the question of whether such an action would be politically possible A President could also at least in theory pardon him or herself for anything except in cases of impeachment No Indictment Necessary Its not necessary for someone to be charged or convicted of a crime against of the United States for the President to pardon that person The most famous example of a President granting a pardon in a case where no indictment had been brought is President Gerald Fords September 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon shortly after he resigned the office of President Allow me to quote at length from Proclamation 4311 Granting Pardon to Richard Nixon  Richard Nixon became the thirtyseventh President of the United States on January 20 1969 and was reelected in 1972 for a second term by the electors of fortynine of the fifty states His term in office continued until his resignation on August 9 1974 Pursuant to resolutions of the House of Representatives its Committee on the Judiciary conducted an inquiry and investigation on the impeachment of the President extending over more than eight months The hearings of the Committee and its deliberations which received wide national publicity over television radio and in printed media resulted in votes adverse to Richard Nixon on recommended Articles of Impeachment As a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from the Office of President Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial for offenses against the United States Whether or not he shall be so prosecuted depends on findings of the appropriate grand jury and on the discretion of the authorized prosecutor Should an indictment ensue the accused shall then be entitled to a fair trial by an impartial jury as guaranteed to every individual by the Constitution It is believed that a trial of Richard Nixon if it became necessary could not fairly begin until a year or more has elapsed In the meantime the tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost by the prospects of bringing to trial a former President of the United States The prospects of such trial will cause prolonged and divisive debate over the propriety of exposing to further punishment and degradation a man who has already paid the unprecedented penalty of relinquishing the highest elective office of the United States NOW THEREFORE I GERALD R FORD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II Section 2 of the Constitution have granted and by these presents do grant a full free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he Richard Nixon has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20 1969 through August 9 1974 What Can Congress Do Article section 4 of the US Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach any federal officeholder The President Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of Treason Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors Further note that Article I Section 1 specifies The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments When sitting for that Purpose they shall be on Oath or Affirmation When the President of the United States is tried the Chief Justice shall preside And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present Judgment in Cases of Impeachments shall not extend further than to removal from Office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor Trust or Profit under the United States but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment Trial Judgment and Punishment according to Law A few considerations to note here even though an extended discussion of impeachment is beyond the scope of this post First impeachment is a political process with the penalty to reiterate from above limited to to removal from Office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor Trust or Profit under the United States A party that has been convicted by the Senate in an impeachment proceeding shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment Trial Judgment and Punishment according to Law Second although were all well aware of the history of impeachment proceedings and the presidency eg involving Andrew Johnson Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton Congress can actually pursue impeachment proceedings against all civil officers of the United States And in fact theres a long common law tradition of such proceedings I mention impeachment only in passing because such power lurks in the background particularly in divided government situations but I defer a more comprehensive discussion of impeachment issues in the current context until we know who has been elected President and what the partisan composition of each house of Congress will be What Will the Obamamometer Do Back to the pardoning question So now that Ive outlined the constitutional authority for pardoning the main issue I wish to address is What Will the Obamamometer do On first glance its obvious that a President who has been at least to my mind unduly concerned with his legacy and who also fetishizes the concept of bipartisanship would not want to touch the issue of pardoning Hillary Clinton with a barge pole I should also point out that the Obamamometer has been an unusually timid politician and has often articulated soaring rhetoric thats never backed by bold action In other words all hat not cattle What the Obamamometer wil do I believe hinges on the outcome of the election If Hillary Clinton Wins If Hillary wins next Tuesday I believe the Obamamometer will not grant her a pardon for the simple reason that she wont ask for one To accept a pardon from Obama would be tantamount to an admission of guilt for her email practices the Clinton Foundations activities  influence peddling and paytoplay among other issues  Hillary Clinton as President can probably get away with foregoing a pardon at least with respect to herself After all does anyone seriously believe that she will nominate candidates for highlevel Department of Justice positions that will vigorously pursue investigations into her and hear activities prior to becoming President I dont think so The more interesting question is whether shell be able to contain investigations that have already started and will no doubt draw in members of her inner circle Im going to put these questions aside for the time being I promise readers I will revisit them if theyre not moot after the election But in the interests of keeping this post short and confining its focus on the main question at hand the Obamamometers options Im not going to delve further into these issues now If Donald Trump Wins If Donald Trump wins were in a completely different ballpark Trump promised in the second debate to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clintons alleged corruption although I think the Wikileaks revelations should dispense with the need to put in an alleged even in parenthesis I believe he will have to follow through on this pledge His smart move would be to ask his Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor nominally a Democrat who has extensive experience investigating complex financial frauds misuse of information and influence peddling And if Hillary Clinton also understands this to be Trumps next move this would leave her in the market for a pardon Now theres a lot of chatter out there that suggests the Clintons hate the Obamas and that the Obamas hate the Clintons Ive also heard it said that theyre all great pals For the purposes of my argument however it really doesnt matter one way or the other I think Hillary will ask for a pardon and the Obamamometer will grant it It will be justified on the grounds that shes suffered enough in losing the election and that shes been the subject of an unprecedented political vendetta The Democratic nomenklatura laid the groundwork for this point in the immediate aftermath of the second debate where Trump was lambasted for calling for appointing a special prosecutor if he were elected into Clintons activities This pledge was taken as a beyondthepale statement of vindictiveness rather than as a logical followthrough to investigations launched during the administration of a President of the same party as the candidate into serious allegations involving mishandling of classified information and other offences And I might add Comeys late innings interjection should suggest that these investigations were neither comprehensively conducted nor concluded Given that Trumps next move is fairly obvious I predict that the Obamamometers is too Hillary will seek and he will grant a pardon while promoting the line that shes suffered enough in not getting her turn to be President and that further shes exposed to extreme vindictiveness from Team R The unlikely outcome of a Trump victory will undoubtedly shake up the political economic and cultural elite It will trigger widespread concern that they might have to pay for their past sins In order to forestall the possibility that punishment will indeed be meted out to fit crimes wagons will be circled The Obamamometer covets a reserved place at the top table and to attain that will have to deliver on a solution and protect poor Hillary Otherwise no more summers on the Vineyard The more interesting question is how far the Obamamometers pardoning power will extend will he provide getoutofjail free cards to Huma Abedin John Podesta Doug Brand Cheryl Mills any other Clinton minions even the Big Dog himself I do of course realize Bill is probably untouchable I dont think so Because although I have and will continue to criticize the Obamamometer for being politically timid not to mention intellectually not all hes been touted as being I dont think hes personally corrupt in the narrow influence peddling sense So lets hope he takes the legacy stuff seriously enough to hold the line at a tightlydrawn pardon for Hillary only in the unlikely event Trump wins next week As for the broader political issues what Congress will do to address these issues these will depend on the election results Again I defer further analysis until we see the election returns
