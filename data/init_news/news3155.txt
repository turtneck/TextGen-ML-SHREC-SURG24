Many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason I have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists The usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the Fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kickingI am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosivenessAnecdotes Perhaps youve heard of this manThat is of course Jamaicas Usain Bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple Olympic records Also worth noting is that in an interview Mr Bolt revealed that he squats 400 pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen And hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any Olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellowsSimilarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense Im using the European term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles Or you can take my word for it at my best I had a one rep max squat of 320 pounds and had a 38 inch vertical leap I am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over 2ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at 38 inches In fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing Olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe rAnyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strengthThe Science As I elaborated in this article  as well as in the free PDF I offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic More accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports These three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersRedor slowOxidative Fast Glycolyticor White and Fast Oxidative Rather than rehash an article that Ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic This is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leapOr to put this into terms of Newtons second law of motion AccelerationForceMass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate And yes I am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting thisWhich Exercises To Do It is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire If you read my articles regularly you will know what I am likely to saycompound free weight liftingIn fact Ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise Training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this ruleIf you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep Ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effectSimilarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you throughSo for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truthRead More Improve Your Weightlifting With A Video Camera
