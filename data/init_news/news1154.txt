In last Fridays press conference President Obama called Vladimir Putins incursion in Syria an act of weakness Its his pat answer when Putin misbehavesThe White House likes to portray the Kremlin as a place filled with petulant children who dont understand whats in their own best interest and will one day rue their misguided behavior A mixture of condescension and patience may be an appropriate tactic in child rearing But in a dangerous world its a lackadaisical prescription for disasterMr Obama sees Putins military adventure as a quagmireinwaiting for the Kremlin In the end he believes Moscow will lose more than it gains and find itself isolated and censured by the international community This he concludes will leave Putin weaker than when he startedBut theres a problem with the presidents line of thinking Actually there are severalFirst there is no reason to believe that just because entering a hot war in Syria is a bad idea Putin wont pursue it with singleminded determination After all that is exactly what the Russian strongman did in Ukraine Back then Mr Obama said it was a mistake and Putin would pay a price And Putin did The West tsunamied Russia with sanctionsThe problem is Putin hasnt stopped He is still meddling in Ukraine Hes also messing with Georgia In fact most Central European countries are on Russia watchSecond powers inclined to act out of weakness can take some very dangerous and destructive steps when undeterredThats what happened Dec 7 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor out of weakness It was a foolish and risky overreach that eventually doomed the fortune of the Axis powers But thats cold comfort for the 2403 who died in the attack or the millions who had to go to war to make things rightSometimes it might make sense to give some actors space to learn their lesson But its simply irresponsible to let dangerous powers run amok in dangerous places responding only with assurances that everything will work out in the endIn fact Putin is using Syria as a distraction to get Europe and the US to back off on countering Moscows mischief in Ukraine In the Kremlins calculus the best way followup bad behavior is more acting badlyThe White House of course cant really keep Moscow and Tehran from propping up Syrian notsostrongman Bashar Assad if that is what they really want to do In fact Mr Obama has effectively encouraged them to do so by negotiating at least 150 billion in sanctions relief for Iranmoney that Tehran can use to bankroll the effortAnd lets face it the Syrian civil war is going to get worse The US lacks a compelling vital interest that demands we solve the problem Nor does it make much sense to fight it out with Moscow and Tehran over DamascusThat said it would be wrong to ignore this disaster And it would be wrong to condone Putins irresponsible military gambit to bolster Assad one of the top mass murderers of the 21st centuryInstead the White House should be taking reasonable steps to keep the region from getting worse bolstering allies on the frontline working with the Europeans to stem the flow of refugees defeating ISIS and marginalizing Russian and Iranian influence in the regionThe president has a long Middle Eastern and European todo list But thats largely the result of his failed foreign policy which has helped empower all the wrong people while offending our best friendsMr Obama has a little over a year to make amends He needs to get started nowJames Jay Carafano is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies The Heritage Foundation Follow him on Twitter JJCarafano
