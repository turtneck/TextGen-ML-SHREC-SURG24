Donald Trump Ted Cruz and John Kasich have all backed away from a pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee The reasons go deeper than mere personal pique to the soul of the partyHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves as he walks onstage before speaking at a campaign event at St Norbert College in De Pere Wis on Wednesday March 30When Donald Trump signed a loyalty pledge with great fanfare last September promising to support the eventual Republican presidential nominee few took him seriouslyBecause no one tells Mr Trump what to do He even said so at the timeNow Trump has formally rescinded his pledge and the remaining GOP competitors Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov John Kasich have come close refusing to say whether they would honor their own loyalty pledges at a CNN town hall Tuesday nightIn a way the death of the pledge is merely symbolic Its already been clear for some time that the Grand Old Party is coming apart at the seams with a presidential frontrunner who barely adheres to Republican philosophy and yet commands a big loyal followingBut that symbolism is important After all what is the point of having a political party if its members dont intend to support one anotherThe unraveling of the pledge is clarifying says Republican strategist Ford OConnell It tells us how much these men cant stand each otherThe reasons go deeper than mere personal pique The end of the pledge speaks to the hollowness in the very soul of the Republican Party A sizable slice of GOP voters are so fed up with business as usual theyre willing to take a chance on a political novice with some unorthodox views for a Republican and whom many women and minorities find offensiveThe pledges demise is premised on the possibility of a Trump nomination When asked about the pledge in the CNN town hall Cruz said he was not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family Kasich also hedged If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the country and dividing the country I cant stand behind them but we have a ways to goA logical answer might be for Cruz and Kasich to form a strategic alliance in an effort to knock out Trump But thats not in the works Each believes he should be the nominee coming out of a contested convention And theyre not a good fit stylistically or ideologically Cruz is a hardline conservative who does not brook compromise while Kasich is more mainstream with a history of working across the aisleTaken as a group the three remaining GOP candidates represent a microcosm of todays fractious Republican Party and given the underlying animosity theres little hope for comityThis is a party that looks like its headed for a crackup says Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics Theyre not going to support one another and if they issued a new pledge it wouldnt mean anythingIf Trump gets the nomination millions of mainstream Republicans will not vote for him Professor Sabato adds If Cruz gets it millions of Trump supporters will not vote for himNormally loyalty pledges dont even come up during presidential primaries Loyalty is assumed and a given But this cycle isnt normal Trumps incursion into the race brought the issue to the fore amid speculation that he would run as an independent if he didnt get the nomination  and didnt feel the Republican National Committee was treating him fairlyTrumps definition of unfair implies a scenario in which he goes into the convention with the most delegates but not a majority and does not win the nomination That could happen But whether Trump is willing to spend the money and mount the organization necessary to pull off a credible independent bid is an open questionSo for now it would appear loyalty has given way to every man for himself And its the Republican Party that loses
