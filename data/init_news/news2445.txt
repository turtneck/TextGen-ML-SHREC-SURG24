A white police officer in North Charleston SC was charged with murder Tuesday after shooting and killing a black man following a routine traffic stop over the weekendThe decision to charge the officer Michael Thomas Slager came after graphic video footage emerged depicting Slager firing a volley of bullets into the back of Walter Scott who was running awayOfficers rarely face criminal charges after shooting people a fact that has played into nationwide protests over the past year over how the police use deadly force Yet this case took a swift unusual turn after a video shot by a bystander provided authorities with a decisive narrative that differed from Slagers accountIt wasnt just based on the officers word anymore said Chris Stewart an attorney for Scotts family People were believing this storyAuthorities on Tuesday also pointed to the video as a turning point in this case and apologized to the family for the shootingWhen youre wrong youre wrong North Charleston Mayor R Keith Summey said at a news conference If you make a bad decision dont care if youre behind the shield  you have to live with that decisionThe Justice Department said Tuesday that the FBI would investigate the shooting along with the departments Civil Rights division and the South Carolina US Attorneys OfficeThe Department of Justice will take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case the department said in a statementSummey and the citys chief of police announced at a news conference that Slager 33 would be charged and arrested Slager who has been fired was arrested by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division the agency investigating the shooting and booked into the Charleston County jail shortly before 6 pm on Tuesday He faces a possible death sentence or life in prisonIts been a tragic day for many Eddie Driggers the police chief said at the news conference A tragic day for manyHow the shooting reignites the debate over body camerasTheshooting began with a routine traffic stop after 930 am on Saturday morning After Slager stopped a vehicle he began chasing Walter Scott 50 and fired his Taser according to the incident report and city officialsFootage of the shooting first obtained by the New York Times and the Post and Courier newspaper showed Scott fleeing from Slager across a treelined patch of grass Slager fires a series of shots at Scott who appears to be unarmed striking Scott multiple times in the back according to anaffidavit filed Tuesday eveningSlager told thedispatcher Shots fired and the subject is down he took my Taser according to the portion of the report filled out by another officer who relayed what he heardThe videoshows Slager picking upan item and placing it near Scott though it is unclear if this is the Taser or something elsePolice later said that Scott was hit with the Taser at least once because part of it was still attached to him when other officers arrived on the scene But city officials said that Scott was clearlytoo far away to use a Taser if he did have itI can tell you that as a result of that video and the bad decision made by our officer he will be charged with murder Summey said at the news conferenceAfter Slager shot Scott the officer handcuffed the mans hands behind his back and he remained there The police report says that several officers gave Scottfirst aid but it does not state how long it took them to administer that aidThis shooting comes after incidents in Ferguson Mo and New York among other places have drawn heavy scrutiny over confrontations that ended with black men dead The unrest has continued into this year as a shooting in Madison Wis was followed by lengthy protestsHow many police shootings a year No one knowsNorth Charleston the thirdlargest city in the state has a different demographic breakdown than the rest of South CarolinaTwothirds of South Carolina residents are white whileNorth Charleston has more black residents 47 percent than white residents 41 percent according to the US CensusBut the citys police force does not reflect that breakdown as four out of five North Charleston officers last year were white according to the Post and CourierThe citys police department announced in February that it would obtain 115 body cameras for its officers after obtaining 275000 in state fundingAuthorities stressed that the episode in South Carolina was not indicative of the citys entire police force of 342 remainingofficers instead calling this a singular bad decision made by one officerI think all of these police officers men and women are like my children Driggers said So you tell me how a father would react  Ill let you answer thatCurrent law gives police wide latitude to use deadly forceScotts family praised the decision to charge Slager with the shooting and was grateful someone came forward with the video footage an attorney saidThey were sad Stewart the family attorney said in a telephone interview Tuesday evening from Scotts mothers home There is nothing that can bring their son and brother back but they are relieved that charges were filedScotts family members had gathered at the home on Tuesday evening including Scotts four children and three brothers His family and attorneys held a brief news conferenceTuesday night saying that they planned to file a lawsuit against the city and police departmentAll we wanted was the truth and through the process weve received the truth said Anthony Scott Walters brother I dont think that all police officers are bad cops but there are some bad ones out thereSlager was initially represented by David Aylor a local attorney who in a statement provided to local media soon after the shooting said I believe once the community hears all the facts of this shooting theyll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding this investigationBut onTuesday shortly before Slagers arrest was announced Aylor told The Post that he is no longer representing the officerI dont have any involvement in that case moving forward he said No involvementWhy South Carolina indicted three other white officersin four monthsThis was the 11th time an officer has shot someone in South Carolina so far this year according to Thom Berry a spokesman for the state Law Enforcement Division Berry said that the investigation into this shooting is still very much in progress so he declined to comment on details of how the agency obtained the video footageAlthough officers fatally shoot and kill hundreds of people each year only a handful of cases result in the officer facing criminal charges Video recordings of the fatal encounters are becoming pivotal factors in whether prosecutors and grand jurors bring charges experts saidVideo has changed everything because it provides documentation that was never available before said Philip M Stinson a criminologist at Bowling Green State University Now everyday citizens when they recognize there is a dispute they start recording video with their smart phonesHowever these recordings do not always result in officers being charged Footage of a New York City police officer placing Eric Garner in a chokehold last summer provoked widespread outrage but the grand jury decided not to indict the officer That decision like that of the Missouri grand jury that did not indict the white police officer who shot an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson sparked a national wave of protests aimed at the way African American men are treated by policeOfficials and activists in South Carolina said they were asking the community to keep calm in the wake of the videos release and the decision to seek murder charges against himWe want to ask the community to remain calmElder Johnson of National Action Network said Tuesday
