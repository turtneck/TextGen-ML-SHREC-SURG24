LAS VEGAS  The first Democratic presidential debate is in the books and for the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton took on her upandcoming main challenger Sen Bernie Sanders IVtGoing in the odds were on which of Clintons challengers might attack the frontrunner But it was Clinton who mixed it up accusing Sanders as being weak on gun controlSenator Sanders did vote five times against the Brady Bill Since it was passed more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented Clinton saidWhat I can tell Secretary Clinton is that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing Sanders rebuttedAnd it wasnt only the participants who put Clinton put on the spotJust for the record are you a progressive or are you a moderate CNN moderator Anderson Cooper probedIm a progressive But Im a progressive who likes to get things done Clinton retortedShe also faced questions about reversing positions on issues like the recent trade agreementDo you change your political identity based on who youre talking to Cooper askedNo I think that like most people that I know I have a range of views but they are rooted in my values and my experience Clinton repliedAs for the big controversy regarding the private email server she used as secretary of state  it not only wasnt an issue in this debate it actually gave Clinton one of her best moments as Sanders came to her defenseWell Ive taken responsibility for it I did say it was a mistake Clinton explainedLet me say something that may not be great politics But I think the secretary is right and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails Sanders exclaimedThat friendliness came to an end when the conversation turned to the Vermont senators selfdescribed socialist viewsHow can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States Cooper askedWhat democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top onetenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent  almost  own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent Sanders explainedI think we should look to countries like Denmark like Sweden and Norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people Sanders continuedI think what Senator Sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have But we are not Denmark I love Denmark We are The United States of America she arguedThat exchange led to Sanders accusing Clinton of being too cozy with Wall Street and big banksSecretary Clinton you do not  Congress does not regulate Wall Street Wall Street regulates Congress Sanders saidHe and Clinton also seemed to differ on how NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden should be viewed after giving away American secretsHe broke the laws of the United States Clinton saidSanders differed saying I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being underminedThe other players on stage like former Virginia Sen Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov Lincoln Chafee really couldnt break through  though former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley took a dig at Clintons call for a nofly zone right now in SyriaI believe that a nofly zone in Syria at this time actually secretary would be a mistake You have to enforce nofly zones and I believe especially with the Russian air force in the air it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret OMalley saidAs Democrats move forward in the nomination process you could compare Clintons campaign to the Hoover Dam The famous landmark controls floodingFor Clinton she not only has to contend with some incoming water from Sanders but the floodgates may open even wider if Vice President Joe Biden gets into the presidential raceThat would raise this contest to a whole other level
