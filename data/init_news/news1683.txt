posted by Eddie In an email between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta the former first lady and secretary of state cites  Western intelligence US intelligence and sources in the region  to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of  providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL or ISIS and other radical Sunni groups in the region  Citing the need to  use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets  the candidate told Podesta the current developments in the Middle East were  important to the US for reasons that often differ from country to country  In the same email Clinton seemed to claim Turkey needed to be reassured of Americas willingness to  take serious actions  an effort that  could be sustained to protect our national interests  in the region In another piece of correspondence from 2012 the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation Amitabh Desai  claimed the Ambassador from Qatar would  like to see Bill Clinton for five minutes in NYC to present 1 million check that Qatar promised for his birthday in 2011  adding that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would  welcome the Clinton Foundations suggestions for investments in Haiti  particularly on education and health  Desai added that while Qatar had already  allocated most of their 20 million  they were happy to consider projects we suggest  Al Jazeera  a Qatarbased statefunded news organization recently ran a list of  revealing juicy and quirky emails  leaked by WikiLeaks In its list the news organization went over the payforplay scheme involving the Clinton Foundation going so far as to mention an email confirming the king of Morocco offered 12m for the endowment  as long as Clinton was willing to take part in a meeting Nevertheless the statefunded broadcaster failed to bring up the Qatar connection Unfortunately for the organization Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission In a post on Facebook  the WikiLeaks official page said  Al Jazeeras list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS  Bill Clinton  On Twitter the convenient lapse wasnt forgiven Promptly after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission users began pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton Despite the public outrage few if any news organizations reported on Al Jazeera s bias In a period of Americas history in which news organizations parrot what one of the most powerful political dynasties in the country keeps on repeating to exhaustion  accusing foreign governments of rigging the US election without offering any proof to back their claims  its interesting to observe that the mainstream media failed to pick up on this story Is it that Qatars and Saudi Arabias involvement with ISIS  while backing their favorite candidate  is a difficult issue to report on Or is the medias refusal to cover this topic rooted in fear that thoroughly addressing it will help her lose the presidential election Only time will tell
