Tweet Home  Gold  Gold News  Currency Crisis Alasdair MacLeod On The Vexed Question of the Dollar There is little doubt that the rapid expansion of both dollardenominated debt and monetary quantities since the financial crisis will lead us into a currency crisis We just dont know when and the dollar is not alone From Alasdair Macleod  All the major paper currencies have been massively inflated in recent years With the dollar acting as the worlds reserve currency where the dollar goes so do all the other fiat monies  Until that cataclysmic event we watch currencies behave in increasingly unexpected seemingly irrational ways The fundamentals for Japan are not good yet the yen remains the strongest currency of the big four The Eurozone risks a systemic collapse overwhelmed by political and financial headwinds yet the euros exchange rate has proved relatively impervious to this deep uncertainty The British economy is strongest yet sterling is the weakest of the four majors If nothing else todays foreign exchanges are evidence that subjectivity triumphs over macroeconomic thinking Mackays Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds beats computer modelling every time Furthermore any official attempt to establish a rate for the dollar has to address two separate questions the value of the dollar relative to other currencies and its purchasing power for goods and services The chart below indicates how the dollar has behaved against other currencies over the last five years both on a trade weighted and on a predefined currency basis DXY It should be noted that the dollar has risen on both these measures by roughly 18 since early 2014 At the same time the Chinese yuan has fallen against the dollar by about 12 so it has actually risen slightly against the DXY basket as a whole particularly against the euro component where it has gained 12 since early 2014 This matters because far from devaluing which is what we are routinely told by dollarcentric analysts the yuan has been relatively stable over time against a basket of currencies It has been weak against the dollar and yen but strong against both the euro and sterling We should look at this from the Feds Federal Open Market Committees point of view America runs a record trade deficit with China and the only major economies where Chinas terms of trade have improved are with the US excepting Japan  Therefore the Fed is bound to be very sensitive to the dollars exchange rate with Chinas yuan Furthermore on two occasions when the Fed had signalled it was going to raise the Fed Funds Rate it backed off when the Chinese lowered the rate at which it had pegged the yuan to the dollar Chinese devaluation against the dollar is obviously a prime concern for the Fed The situation becomes better understood when the Peoples Banks position is taken into account The bank has been selling US Treasury stock in large quantities stockpiling commodities and oil with the proceeds though it has been diversifying into Japanese Government bonds as well Chinas dollars have been welcomed by markets which are short of both quality collateral and raw currency However Chinas supply of both has failed to stop the dollar rising against the yuan Furthermore China isnt the only Asian and Middle Eastern state selling American paper so the demand from other international players on the buy side has been immense enough to determine the underlying direction of the dollars exchange rate The situation is being exploited by the Peoples Bank In effect the Peoples Bank is in a position to dictate Fed policy by adjusting the rate at which it is prepared to supply dollars into the market So long as the dollar remains fundamentally strong it only has to slow the pace of Treasury and dollar sales for the dollar to rise and therefore the Feds planned interest rate rises to be deferred This is not understood properly by western commentators who erroneously think China is being forced to defend a declining yuan Nothing could be further from the truth It will be interesting to see whether this happens again ahead of the December FOMC meeting when for the umpteenth time we have been promised a rise in the Fed Funds Rate A major consideration behind Chinas foreign exchange policy is the outlook for the euro The Eurozone represents a market as large as the US with the added importance of being tagged onto the Asian continent There can be little doubt that China sees her own longterm future being aligned more with Europe than America despite Europes current troubles It is if you like a situation that is primarily of strategic importance Europes economy will need rescuing at some stage and is therefore a future opportunity for Chinas intervention That plan is for the long term and becomes increasingly valid the deeper the hole the Eurozone digs for itself A disintegration of the EU would also be beneficial for Chinese ambitions Meanwhile in the shortterm the euro has broken a crucial trendline against the dollar having completed a continuation headandshoulders pattern targeting the 10600 area which is the previous low seen in March and November 2015 This is our second chart Neither the Peoples Bank nor the Fed need to be chart experts to see whats happening Brexit was very bad news for the euro because it is a racing certainty that the event will turn out to be just the start of a new round of political and economic trouble for the Eurozone The Italian economy in particular is imploding with a nonperforming loan problem that is roughly 40 of private sector GDP So China can for the moment steer a course for the yuan between the euros devaluation and the dollars rise The Fed sees in euro weakness an increase of currencyinduced deflation for the US economy and a loss of competitiveness for US exports Chinese exporters are obvious beneficiaries as well so the blame for deflation will be on Chinas foreign exchange machinations Anyway China probably cares less than she ever did about the longterm consequences of her actions on the US economy China has been selling her US Treasuries and reducing her dollar exposure to add to her stockpiles of raw materials and oil She wants to keep her overindebted businesses trading by maintaining a favourable exchange rate with the dollar particularly given the developing train wreck thats the Eurozone And theres not a lot the Fed can do about it Gold and commodities The principal driver for the gold price is the prospect of monetary inflation transmuting into price inflation and the inability of central banks to respond to this threat by raising interest rates sufficiently to control the balance of consumer preferences between goods and holding money We are of course measuring gold in dollars because the latter is the reserve currency for all the others But as stated above there are two exchange considerations the first being the dollar against other currencies and the second the dollar against a basket of commodities And here we should note that over the longterm the prices of commodities measured in gold are considerably more stable than the prices of commodities measured in fiat currencies China has behaved as if she is thoroughly aware of golds pricing attributes and has a deliberate policy of dominating the market for bullion This is very different from the USs domination of gold paper markets Not only has China invested in unprofitable gold mines to become the largest producer at about 450 tonnes annually but the state monopolises Chinas refining capacity She also imports dor for refining from other countries and without doubt since 1983 has accumulated substantial quantities of bullion not included in monetary reserves Furthermore it is the only country that has encouraged its population through television and other media to accumulate physical gold Make no mistake for the last thirtythree years the Chinese government has made a credible attempt to gain ultimate control over the physical gold market and to extend golds protection to her own citizens China does not manipulate the gold price Instead as described earlier she is manipulating the dollar by regulating the exchange rate and by discouraging the Fed from raising interest rates It is a temporary balancing act that only continues so long as desperate banks and their indebted borrowers continue to scramble for dollars and China knows it The Fed for the moment appears to be powerless to manage economic outcomes and is firmly trapped by Chinas currency management with interest rates stuck at the lower bound And to make it worse the weak euro against which the dollar index DXY is very heavily weighted 57 threatens to force the DXY index even higher The result inevitably is that monetary policy cannot be used to address future price inflation which virtually guarantees there will be a higher gold price in 2017 and beyond This is why despite American wishful thinking gold remains at the centre of the financial system It is central partly because Chinas ensures it is and it is also Chinas ultimate money for commodity and trade purposes China most likely has enough gold to fully compensate for her reserve losses from the destruction of the dollar and the other fiat currencies on her reserve book She is deliberately selling down her dollar exposure anyway while she can Lest we forget communist economists in China were taught that capitalism destroys itself For them there is no clearer proof than the performance of the US economy and the dollar and they do not intend to get caught up in its demise Understand this and you understand all While the monetary role of gold in the future has yet to be determined by China and it will be China or the markets that make the decision for the moment it can be regarded as the ultimate insurance against global currency failure
