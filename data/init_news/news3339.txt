Two historic events are in progress today August 14 The first is the arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry in Cuba The second is President Obamas continued campaign to secure Congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with Iran These two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic moral and economic notion that has driven President Obamas foreign policy and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the worldTo fully understand what were dealing with in regards to Iran and Cuba we have to understand who were dealing with In Iran we face radical Shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of Islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the West These leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill Americans and wipe Israel off the mapIn Cuba we face proudly antiAmerican leaders who continue to work with nations like Russia and China to spy on our people and government who harbor fugitives from American justice and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people preventing democratic elections and depriving their nations economy of freedom and opportunityCenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example while the worst is through weakness and concession Yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administrationPresident Obama has not only permitted Iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure he has also endorsed the construction of a fullscale industrialsize nuclear program within 15 years He has conceded a vast enrichment capacity preserved Irans fortified underground facility and failed to secure anytime anywhere inspections He has virtually guaranteed Iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build longrange missiles capable of hitting the US homeland And on top of all this he wants to hand Iran 100 billion in sanctions relief which will be used in part to fund Hamas and Hezbollah promote instability in Bahrain and Yemen and prop up Bashar alAssad in SyriaThe negotiations with Cuba have proven equally onesided President Obama has rewarded the Castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent patient opposition to American interests He has unilaterally given up on a halfcentury worth of policy toward the Castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties He has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the Cuban people which has only increased since the President announced his new policyBeginning on day one I will undertake a threepart plan to roll back President Obamas deal with Iran First I will quickly reimpose sanctions on Iran I will give the mullahs a choice either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program but you cannot have both I will also ask Congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism Second I will ensure our forces in the Middle East are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option Third after imposing crippling sanctions on Iran I will link any talks to Irans broader conduct from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against IsraelI will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back President Obamas concessions to the Castro regime First on day one I will give the Castros a choice either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by President Obama or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased US trade investment and support Second I will restore Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations helping North Korea evade international sanctions or harboring fugitives from American justice Third I will do everything in my power to provide support to Cubas prodemocracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the Cuban peopleThese are the actions required to restore the safety and security President Obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators When it comes to the challenges posed by Iran and Cuba our task is straightforward  we must prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the United States stands on the Cuban people not their oppressors But we also know that straightforward is not a synonym for easy Our safety and security will require what it has always required strong principled leadership And that is exactly what I intend to offer our nation and the world in the years aheadRepublican Marco Rubio represents Florida in the US Senate He
