Income inequality is back in the news propelled by an Oxfam International report and President Barack Obamas State of the Union address The question is whether government needs to do something about thisor whether government needs to undo many thingsMeasuring income inequality is no simple thing which is one source of disagreement between those who think inequality is a problem and those who think it isnt But it is possible to cut through the underbrush and make some points clearWe can identify two kinds of economic inequality and lets keep this in mind as we contemplate what if anything government ought to doThe first kind we might call market inequality Individuals differ in many ways including energy ambition and ingenuity As a result in a marketoriented economy some people will be better than others at satisfying consumers and will hence tend to make more money The only way to prevent that is to interfere forciblywith the results of peaceful positivesum transactions in the marketplace Since interferencediscourages the production of wealth the equality fostered through violence will be an equality of impoverishmentIs it better that people be equally poor or unequally affluent This is theimportant question that political philosopher John Tomasi author of Free Market Fairness puts to his classes at Brown University Would they prefer a society in which everyone has the same low income or one in which incomes vary perhaps widely but the lowest incomes are higher than the equal income of the first societyWhich would you choose Lets remember that it is entirely possible for the poorest in a society to become richer even as the gap between the richest and poorest grows Imagine an accordionlike elevator that is rising as a whole while being stretched out putting the floor further from the ceiling Would such a society be objectionable Why is the relative position of the poorest more important than their absolute position Is concern about relative positions nothing more than envyWe could argue about that all day but a much more urgent subject is politicaleconomic inequality This is the inequality fostered through the political system Since governments distinctive feature is its claimed authority to use force aggressively as opposed to defensively this second sort of inequality is produced by violence which on its face should make it abhorrentPoliticaleconomic systems throughout the world including ones typically thought to be marketoriented or capitalist such as in the United States are in fact built on deeply rooted and longestablished systems of privilege Favors which the rest of us must pay for one way or another typically go to the wellconnected and prominent business executives have always been well represented in that groupIn the United States this has been true since the days of John Jacob Astor the fur trader who had the ears of such influential politicians as James Madison James Monroe and John Quincy Adams Government was little more than the executive committee of leading manufacturers planters and merchants to risk opprobrium by paraphrasing Marx As Adam Smith put it in The Wealth of Nations in 1776 Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen its counsellors are always the mastersWhile business interests today are not the only ones that get consideration in the halls of power its a mistake to think they do not retain major influence over government in economic and financial matters Regulatory capture is a wellknown phenomenon and ostensible efforts to limit it always failUnlike market inequality politicaleconomic inequality is unjust and should be eliminatedHow By abolishing all direct and indirect subsidies artificial scarcities such as those created by socalled intellectual property regulations which inevitably burden smaller and yettobelaunched firms more than lawyeredup big businesses eminent domainand permit requirements zoning and occupational licensing which all exclude competition These interventions and more protect incumbent firms from conditions that would lower prices to consumers create selfemployment and workerownership opportunities and improve bargainingconditions for wage laborInstead ofsymbolically tweaking the tax code to appear to be addressing inequalitythe politicians charadepoliticaleconomic inequality should be ended by repealing all privileges right nowThis column originally appeared at the Future of Freedom Foundation
