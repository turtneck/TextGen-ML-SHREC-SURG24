With just three months to go before the long national nightmare that is Election 2016 transmogrifies into a either a Hillary Clinton or a Donald Trump presidency lets take a latesummer moment to squeeze some lemonade from lemons Whatever happens in November all of us who have political perspectives that are routinely discounted or dismissed by the RepublicanDemocratic duopoly should thank Donald Trump for creating a blueprint to power for usPull yourself out of the news cycle that he has been so expert in dominating with a dailysometimes hourlyspew of sensational utterings proclamations and halfbaked policy plans Extreme vetting Mexican rapists Crooked Hillary When hes not creating outrage himself he brings it in other people such as when his supporters get egged at rallies or unflattering naked statues of the billionaire crop up in cities around the countryThe simple fact is as conservative commentator and Finding Mr Righteous author Lisa De Pasquale writesThere has been much handwringing among the right on where Republicans go now that Trump has destroyed the party They complain that the Republican Party has left them while millions of Trump voters and libertarians believe party leaders and professional pundits left them decades ago Regardless of whether the NeverTrump crowd has valid points it is clear that Trump has done libertarians a favor in busting the Old Guard of Republican kingmakers The Old Guard isnt mad that Trump doesnt represent their principles but that they no longer hold any power in picking the top of the ticket The proof is that rather than get behind Gary Johnson theyd rather trot out a candidate with zero name recognition or campaign infrastructureBeyond revealing the emptiness of the power bases in the existing Republican Party and party members absolute lack of interest in moving toward their ostensible principles of limited smaller government De Pasquale argues that Trump is the shape of better things to comeThe Trump campaign has been a battering ram for libertarians In just over a year Trump has succeeded in what the Libertarian Party hasnt been able to do in the 35 years since it was conceived Not only has he upset traditional party politics but hes also paved the way for nontraditional candidates Who needs stuffy party leaders and pundits when you have social media and 100 name recognition In the current political climate personality authenticity and even celebrity reign Trump has shown that at least in the primaries the absence of a traditional ground game and campaign budget can be overcome Libertarians have an advantage because we already know theyre authentic by going against the dominant parties Libertarians also have a good celebrity bench that could help them replicate the Trump campaign I wouldnt necessarily endorse famous libertarian Vince Vaughn for president though I would endorse myself as First Lady but I would enthusiastically get on the Peter Thiel Train Set aside policy disagreements libertarians have with Trump They should be thankful that Trump has created a new path for national office He built libertarian candidates a path to success and he paid for itRead the whole piece and start thinking Who are the agents of libertarian influence that can either transform the existing major parties and bring a bold new free minds and free markets sensibility to independent runs at all levels of government Better yet who are the crossover figures that might do for the Libertarian Party what athletes such as Joe Namath did for the old AFL by legitimizing an upstart league as a major forceIts a given that Americans know nothing and care even less about history Thats certainly true when it comes to journalism generally and political journalism specifically Did you ever wonder just why every election is the most important one in our lives The answer is only mysterious to deadenders within those group and to journalists both of whom have no sense of history and really think that everything is on the line every four years and that whatever happened 10 20 or 30 years ago is irrelevant to understanding the current moment For the most part we have simply been repeating the same play over and over again but to lessandlessengaged audiencesAs Matt Welch and I wrote in The Declaration of Independents How Libertarian Politics Can Fix Whats Wrong With America all the trends of the past 40 to 50 years show that Americans have weaker and weaker ties to the Republican and Democratic Parties just as we do with all consumer brands Whatever postwar coalitions those parties once represented no longer exist Everything in American life is vastly different than it was in say 1964 when the current identities of the GOP and Democrats were being formed These parties are designed to groups of people that either no longer exist in the same numbers as they once did privatesector union members and socially conservative Christians say or who dont link issues the way they used to whats the necessary connection between before for marriage equality and higer marginal tax ratesYet most party leaders and media ignore the atornearhistoric lows in voter identification with the Democrats and Republicans They also act as if the ideologies and policy platforms of parties cant or dont change over time The result is a conversation about politics that is less and less moored to basic reality We need a new operating system for politics in the 21st century but the people most invested in the current one dont want to migrate or upgrade to anything different We need Windows 10 but theyre fine sticking with 31 thank you very muchTrumps riseand the semisuccessful insurgency of Bernie Sanders tooputs the lie to the idea that the power structure is capable of maintaining a status quo that serves fewer and fewer people Given his absolute lack of consistent coherent policies and his radically backwardlooking agenda antitrade and migration in an increasingly globalized world he is not the future of anything but the last gasp of a 20thcentury politics that in one final push was able to reduce at least one of the major parties to rubble Its up to those of us who actually want a new operating system for American governance to determine what comes next
