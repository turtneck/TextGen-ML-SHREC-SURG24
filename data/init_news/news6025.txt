No not the number of primaries hes won or the number of votes hes gotten or the number of delegates he has I mean the poll numbers that show the Ohio governor is well ahead of Hillary Clinton in a November matchup while she beats mogul Donald Trump and Sen Ted Cruz Theres even one that shows him dead even with Clinton in the deep deepblue state of New Jersey Isnt that exactly the kind of candidate delegates would and should turn to if they become unbound after the first ballot Well thats his argument anywaySorry Gov Kasich but history says youre wrong And there may be good reasons why the Im electable argument is less potent than it might appearFor party delegates deciding how much electability matters its important to remember that such springtime numbers have a fragile halflife As Trumps supporters keep reminding us Ronald Reagan was running anywhere from 18 to 23 points behind President Jimmy Carter in the spring of 1980 One reason exPresident Gerald Ford flirted with entering the raceapart from a grudge from 1976was that as Time magazine noted at the time Ford shares the fears of many Republicans that Reagan cannot win if the Democrats renominate Jimmy CarterThen in 1992 even as Bill Clinton was firming his grip on the nomination the polls told a dismal story about his prospective election In June he was running third behind President George HW Bush andin first placeTexas businessman Ross Perot Note Springtime polls often elevate independent candidatesin 1980 John Anderson was running as high as 24 per cent against Carter and Reagan So theres reason for Republicans looking at Kasich to be skeptical about these numbersEven if the numbers are sound theres a reason that they might spell out the wrong strategy for the campaign Electability isnt the message that galvanizes a party base and for good reasonIn 2000 every survey showed that Sen John McCain would run far better against Vice President Al Gore than did George W Bush Around the time of New Hampshire McCain had an 8point lead while Bush and Gore ran evenBut McCain was a heretic He opposed the mammoth tax cuts proposed by Bush and congressional Republicans preferring to see some of the surplusyes there was a surplus back thengo toward reducing the debt And hed teamed up with Sen Russ Feingold the most liberal Democrat in the Senate to write a bill banning most soft money from campaigns this was the law ultimately eviscerated by the Supreme CourtThats one of the reasons McCain won Republican voters only in New Hampshire and in his home state of Arizona His margins elsewhere came from independents For Republicans he did not represent them as well as Bush didAnd that goes to the heart of the issue A party is more than a collection of individuals looking for an appealing candidate Its an organization searching for the person who the best embodies their beliefs When the party faithfulthe people who are delegatespull the lever theyre going to be thinking about what kind of Republican Party they want not just which horse is likely to finish firstIt makes sense for the party to think this way Why Because choosing a nominee simply on the basis of electability may wind up impeding the goals of that partys base Dwight Eisenhower was far more electable than conservative hero Robert Taft in 1952 but his two landslide elections wound up solidifying the expansion of the federal government under FDR and Harry S Truman rather than advancing the agenda of the Republican Party From the perspective of a Republican loyalist opposed to that expansion Ikes victories achieved almost nothing And if you throw in his appointment of Earl Warren and William Brennan two of the most liberal Supreme Court justices in history you could well argue that Eisenhowers terms greatly expanded the liberal causeThats why The New Republic in 2012 could look back on that era and conclude that the relationship between the 1950s conservative movement and its contemporaneous Republican president was one of mutual illwill Conservatives had expected that Eisenhower as the first Republican president since 1932 would repeal the New Deal instead he augmented and expanded programs like Social Security thereby giving them bipartisan legitimacy  He approved antirecessionary stimulus spending extended unemployment compensation and raised the minimum wage He pioneered federal aid to education and created the largest publicworks program in history in the form of the interstate highway system He levied gasoline taxes to pay for the highway construction and believed that cutting income taxes when the federal government was running a deficit would be an act of gross fiscal irresponsibilityFrom that perspective its unimaginable that todays GOP which is far more conservative than it was in Ikes time would turn to such an ideologically suspect candidate no matter how electable he or she was In that sense the GOP base shares the view expressed by exSen Jim DeMint when he said hed rather have 30 strong conservatives than 50 centrist Republicans And a lot of Republican delegates will be thinking just that way as they head into the convention in Cleveland in JulyBy contrast Bernie Sanderswho in some polls runs better against Trump and Cruz than does Clintonhas at least a plausible argument that his candidacy better reflects where the Democrats are goingleftand that the new younger voters he would draw make a good fit with that direction For Sanders the electability argument could workbut only because hes already made the liberal base happyThere is one thing that Kasich does have in his favor however the argument that Trump doesnt really channel the party base either at least when it comes to ideas Trump too is an apostate on free trade which has been a core GOP plank until now and seemingly on health care Trump also may have done himself no favors by embracing an exception to the draconian abortion plank of the GOP platform It may appeal to independents but thats not where the base of the party isat least not if you judge by the past 32 years of party platformsBut despite his long history in the conservative movement especially as a key player in the rise of Newt Gingrich as House speaker in the 1990s Kasich has come to be seen as a heretic too his decision to accept Medicaid expansion made him a pariah to those in his party who believe that anything associated with Obamahealthcareidea should be shunned like the devils brew A year ago he told a few of us journalists that I think I have the right to try to define what conservatism means But if the primaries are any evidence he has failed to do that with the rank and file of his own partyKasichs argument that he has governed as a conservative has had no impact in a primary where the experience of governing is apparently seen as a liability as Scott Walker Chris Christie and Jeb Bush learned He has tried for example to argue that his Medicaid expansion is conservative at heartit saves money it keeps lowerincome workers off welfare it gets drug addicts out of jail and into treatment in the spirit of conservative support of prison reform But this argument has found no resonance in his partyMoreover Cruzs constant pursuit of a no enemies to the right strategy has made it all but impossible for the Ohio governor to make any inroads among true believing conservativesKasich has almost no line to the nomination but if hes to have any hope at all he ought to minimize his electability pitch and rejuvenate the idea that he speaks for the base Because theyre the ones who will decide and right now theyre thinking of the vote that happens in July not the one in November
