The Cuban and American delegations sat at parallel tables eight wary diplomats on each side facing each other across a distance of about six feet and a gulf filled with more than a halfcentury of grievancesIn separate news conferences afterward at the end of their first round of talks Thursday both sides pronounced it productive respectful and positiveBut both acknowledged that profound differences remainWhat you have to recognize US Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson said after the initial session is that we have  to overcome more than 50 years of a relationship that was not based on confidence or trustJosefina Vidal Jacobsons counterpart at Cubas Foreign Ministry stressed the importance of approaching each other on the basis of equal sovereignty and avoiding any interference in each others internal affairsLike Jacobson Vidal stressed that reopening embassies that were closed in 1961 was just the first step in a complicated process of normalizing relationsEven that will require further negotiation For example Vidal said it would be very difficult to explain that there has been a resumption of diplomatic relations  while our country unjustly continues to be included on the US list of state sponsors of terrorismThe sober descriptions of what still divides the two governments deflated some of the enthusiasm for rapid change that has been building on both sides But the delegations said they would set an early date for another meeting and were committed to the public pledge made by President Obama and Cuban President Ral Castro last month to restore diplomatic relations and then begin to tackle other areas of discordIf body language and ease of public presentation was any guide Vidal clearly on her own turf seemed far more forthcoming than Jacobson in addressing the dozens of US journalists who have traveled to Cuba to cover the talks along with other international news media She took more questions than Jacobson and translated her own Spanish into fluent EnglishBut her remarks were also more specific on areas of discord including what subjects they discussedObama who announced relations would be restored in a Dec17 speech has said that US human rights concerns would be directly raised in conversations with CubaAfter the morning session Jacobson said she had raised the issue Vidal said it did not come upDuring a second session in the afternoon the talks moved away from the embassies to areas of current and future cooperation including counternarcotics law enforcement the environment and international health issuesBut in a statement distributed in Spanish after the talks ended at 7 pm the US side said it had pressured Cuba on issues of human rights and free expression In a solo evening news conference Vidal said the word pressure was not spoken in the afternoon session Thats not a word used in these kinds of communications she said and Cuba has a long history of not responding to pressureVidal said that Cuba had some concerns of its own about human rights in the United States and had renewed a proposal it made a year ago for a separate dialogue in which each country could express its views on the subjectUS officials later said they had erred in using the Spanish verb presionar meaning to pressure in the statement The English version said that we pressed the Cuban government for improved human rights conditions including freedom of expression and assemblyVidal also said that Cuba was still studying the new trade and travel rules the Obama administration announced last week particularly those opening the door for US telecommunication companies to do business in Cuba Havana she said was willing to  explore possibilities of doing business with them that would benefit both sidesAfter the Thursday morning meeting on embassies Vidal said that a complete lifting of the 1960 US embargo was essential for further normalization but that Cuba recognizes the willingness of the US president to have a serious and honest debate with Congress about it taking action to lift the embargoBut the terrorism list is a different story Obama has the power to remove Cuba from the list if he determines that Havana has not engaged in terrorism in the recent past and is unlikely to do so in the future He has asked the State Department to review Cubas status and provide a recommendationIts presence since 1982 on the list which includes Iran Sudan and Syria is more than a significant irritant to Cuba Based on an uptick of Obama administration penalties imposed on foreign banks whose business with Cuba has passed through US financial institutions  a practice banned for all on the list  Buffalobased MT Bank dropped the Cuban Interests Section in Washington last year as a clientSince then US banks have decided to err on the side of caution in avoiding any dealings with Cuba and none has been willing to open an account for the USbased diplomats who must conduct all of their transactions in cashIf its officials were unable to conduct US bank transactions for diplomatic purposes Vidal and other Cuban officials said the United States would not be complying with the international conventions on diplomatic practices that both delegations on Thursday said they had agreed would govern their new embassiesOnce he receives States recommendation Obama must transmit his decision to Congress Assuming a positive outcome there is a 45day waiting period before implementation of any removals from the listIn the streets of Havana this week Cubans seemed to talk of little else but the opening between the two governments Cuban news media covered the statements of both sides Thursday and those issued following lowerlevel talks Wednesday on migration issuesAfter the Americans had departed the conference hall Vidal was asked what she thought was the main news of the day The news is that Cuba and the United States met for the first time she said and were checking their calendars to schedule the next session
