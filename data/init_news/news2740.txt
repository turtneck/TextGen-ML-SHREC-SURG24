Even 24 hours ago there was the faintest hope he could be the nominee Now Bernie Sanders is shifting gearsDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders listens as audience members cheer during an election night campaign event at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena Tuesday in Huntington WVaBernie Sanders knows he cant win the Democratic presidential nomination He said as mucheven before losing decisively to Hillary Clinton in four out of five primaries TuesdayYet Senator Sanders remains in the race But he now fills a wholly different niche than he did even 24 hours ago Gone is Sanders the candidate with a slim remaining hope that he could still be the Democratic nominee Enter Sanders the message candidateAnd the message is this that Sanders has tapped into a current of discontent within the Democratic base particularly among young people thats not going away And he intends to press his agenda all the way to the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this summerThe people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be Sanders said in a statement Tuesday night Thats why we are in this race until the last vote is castThe intent he added is to fight for a progressive party platform that includes a 15 minimum wage an end to our disastrous trade policies Medicare for all breaking up big banks ending fracking free public college and a carbon tax to address climate changeThe upside for Sanders is that he keeps his issues on the public radar and continues to nudge the more moderate Mrs Clinton to the left The risk is that he looks like a sore loser as some have called him and prevents the Democratic Party from fully focusing on the task at hand defeating the Republicans in NovemberClinton  who won Tuesday in Pennsylvania Maryland Delaware and Connecticut and lost only in Rhode Island  pivoted anyway toward a message of Democratic unity and toward a general election fight in which she hopes to attract independents as well as Republicans uncomfortable with the direction of their partyIf you are a Democrat an independent or a thoughtful Republican you know their approach is not going to build an America where we increase opportunity or decrease inequality Clinton said So instead of us letting them take us backwards we want America to be in the future businessIn her pitch to Sanders supporters Clinton sought to portray herself as a progressive with a pragmatic streakWe have to be both dreamers and doers she saidClinton also reminded voters of the historic nature of her candidacy now placing her firmly in position to become the first female majorparty nominee in American history and potentially the first woman president In the process she took a dig at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump who swept all five states TuesdayNow the other day Mr Trump accused me of playing the quote woman card Well if fighting for womens health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card then deal me in Clinton saidFor Sanders a selfdescribed social democrat who has fought for decades on the issues now at the heart of his campaign the 2016 race remains in a way a dream come true The onceobscure senator from Vermont is now a national figure with a national platform to press his causeAnd for many reasons he truly has no reason to drop outExhibit A is his incredible fundraising Most candidates will stay in a race as long as they have two nickels to rub together and Sanders has plenty He has outraised Clinton three straight months  average donation 27 as the rally chant goes  and his take is accelerating In March alone he raised 44 million a monthly record for the Vermont social democratExhibit B is his huge rallies Who can argue with theexhilarationSanders must feel when he takes the stage to address thousands of screaming fansExhibit C is his party affiliation  or lack thereof Sanders isnt really a Democrat He may say he is sort of for the purposes of this presidential race but when faced with pleas to step aside for the good of the party he shrugs In his world the party is the establishment and thats what hes fightingExhibit D is the what ifs There remains a chance that Clinton could be indicted over her use of a private email server and her handling of information now deemed classified while she was secretary of State The financial doings of the Clinton family foundation represent more unknown territory with potentially bad opticsIf Clinton were forced from the race Sanders would be the last person standing for the Democratic nomination True Vice President Joe Biden could jump in though that would offend many voters sense of fairness  especially the Sanders voters whose support will be needed in November no matter who wins the Democratic nominationExhibit E is history Many a pundit has pointed out that in 2008 after a spirited primary season thenSenator Clinton dropped out of the presidential race and embraced her rival Barack Obama But that didnt happen until June of that year after all the primaries were over ThenSenator Obama still won the electionSo for now at least its probably too soon to claim that Sanders is doing irreparable harm to Clintons campaign Clinton has high negatives for a likely nominee but the Republicans are pounding her much harder than Sanders is Remember that Sanders took one of Clintons biggest Achilles Heels  her emails  off the table in their first debateRemember also the PUMAs of 2008 Its an acronym whose meaning isnt suitable for a family newspaper but it stood for Clinton voters claiming theyd never vote for Obama simply for the sake of party unity Most Clinton voters ended up backing Obama anywayLets also be clear Even if Sanders doesnt actually intend to take his challenge of Clinton all the way to the convention floor in Philadelphia why should he and his strategists say that now In politics candidates are fully in it until theyre notSanders in a way can already claim victory He has already pushed Clinton to the left on trade chances are she would not have rejected the Obamabacked TransPacific trade deal absent Sanderss objectionsSanders has also established 15 as the liberal benchmark for raising the minimum wage no doubt a spur toward Clintons support for the Fight for 15 advocacy campaign Clinton prefers to push for a 12 federal minimum wage citing political feasibility but has said shed sign a bill raising the federal minimum wage to 15Sanders says hes waiting to see what a Clinton platform looks like before he decides how much to campaign for her In an MSNBC interview last week Sanders called the process a twoway street suggesting she has to move more toward his philosophy before hell help herI want to see the Democratic Party have the courage to stand up to bigmoney interests in a way that they have not in the past take on the drug companies take on Wall Street take on the fossil fuel industry and I want to see them come up with ideas that really do excite working families and young people in this country Sanders saidIn an interview on ABCs Good Morning America last week Clinton said that when she dropped out of the 2008 race 40 percent of her supporters were unwilling to vote for Obama So she got to workI nominated him at the convention I went from group to group even as late as the convention convincing people who were my delegates to come together to unify she saidIts also worth pointing out that by facing a competitive primary to the bitter end Obama was in fighting trim for the general election  and organized in all 50 states Clinton may not be happy with Sanderss continued campaign but he has at least given her a window into how a sizable portion of her partys voters see the worldFor now Sanders holds a lot of power He can join hands with Clinton at the convention or he can keep fighting If he chooses the latter path he could do serious damage to the Democratic Party But the more likely scenario say Democratic strategists is that Sanders declares moral victory and backs Clinton  if not enthusiastically
