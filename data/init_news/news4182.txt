East Central Asia issues protest movements in the Balkans migration crises and others In addition they provide military operations analysis the military posture of major world powers and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media Arab Spring and the WashingtonBrusselsRiyadh Axis By South Front on November 5 2016 from SouthFront When the end of history meaning the establishment of a permanent Western hegemony over the entire international system was proclaimed in the early 1990s it was not yet obvious how the pursuit of said hegemony would evolve over the succeeding decades The velvet expansion of the 1990s into the postSoviet vacuum gave way to the iron fist for which the 911 terror strikes provided the excuse and which meant invading whichever country Washington desired However the iron fist efforts in the post911 world demonstrated Wests weakness  as sustaining operations in Iraq and Afghanistan proved too much for NATO This failure ushered the postpost911 world and the Arab Spring became the first though far from the only demonstration of the evolved Western strategy which fuses the earlier approaches The velvet aspect is still there Western entities claim they are promoting universal human values which evidently is the end that justifies all means and which automatically means it is impossible to commit war crimes in its pursuit Also by implication anyone who stands in the Wests way operates under the presumption of guilt In order to promote said universal values the West identifies creates or even invents a political movement which although it consists of corrupt opportunists and outright criminals ostensibly stands for universal values This entity then receives overwhelmingly positive media coverage to the point of referring to any police or military response to the violence it perpetrates as war crimes in order to shape the public opinion in favor of limited military intervention in the form of airstrikes and a small number of special operations troops Then one merely needs an excuse a small incident an insignificant act of violence by the target countrys law enforcement of the kind that happen in the US in a daily basis in order to start beating the war drums against the bloodsoaked regime This approach was pioneered in Bosnia and Kosovo the early exceptions to the velvet policy but was then shelved in the post911 era when it seemed that Wests aims could be achieved through more directand brutalmeans only to be resurrected by the Obama Administration and applied in Libya Syria and Ukraine with only minor variations But the universal values rhetoric is only camouflage aimed at securing the support of the liberal wing of the elite and obscuring the real aim of the aggression the seizure of key national assets be it petroleum or in the case of Ukraine farmland to bolster the fortunes of dominant sectors of Western economies including finance and energy and to preserve the fading Western hegemony It is also evident Western powers are in an informal but very close alliance with the highly repressive governments of Gulf Arab states which also stood to gain from eliminating the political competition posed by Libyas government and from building pipelines to Europe over the corpse of the Syrian state This alignment was made necessary by the Wests need for boots on the ground which can accomplish that which airpower alone cannot with ISIS AlNusra Free Syrian Army and other such formations being a NATOtrained and NATOequipped force which can be sent where NATO soldiers cant go due to the domestic opposition such a move would provoke The insights into the finances of the various Clinton foundations provided by Wikileaks clearly show the inner workings of this alliance The leaks also illustrate the key aspect of this alliance namely the secretive and conspiratorial machinations of a small group of influential actors as opposed to the broad elite consensus that existed during the Cold War Nevertheless this small group of conspirators on three continents now amounts to a defacto WashingtonBrusselsRiyadh axis It is a relatively recent creation dating to only the beginning of the Obama Administration It did not exist during the George W Bush Administration Saudi Arabia was aghast at the idea of toppling the Sunni rule in Iraq and the EU was mostly opposed to invading Iraq Which made the EUs embrace of regime change in Syria Libya and Ukraine all the more startling though not entirely surprising Just as the US foreign policies are driven by the fear of being eclipsed by rising or recovering powers like China or Russia the 2008 crisis bared the EUs weakness and thus provided an incentive for EU hardliners engage in reckless policies in the hopes of staving off its collapse Is the game worth the candle Considering the shrillness of the prowar propaganda in both the US and the EU today to the point of risking World War 3 the imagined benefits of regime changes must have been enormous Stamping out the last truly sovereign states of the Middle East would have strengthened the Wests claim on global hegemony The failures Ukraine and in Syria and ultimately also in Libya therefore place Western powers facetoface with the prospect of historic decline Related Posts No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT VT authors
