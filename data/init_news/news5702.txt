Email Despite the fact that voting is the cornerstone of our democracy only 60 percent of eligible voters turn out in a presidential election But this year we may see that number spike because groups of incredible volunteers are doing everything they can to get out the vote Theyre hitting the road and oiling up the sidewalks to help voters slide uncontrollably to their polling places Democracy FTW You might not know their names but these hardworking men and women are out there in the trenches from Maine to California slathering thick black oil on the ground so every American can skid down the road windmilling their arms wildly to try and stay upright and careen straight through the doors of a voting booth Republican or Democrat these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place Yes These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it Rather than letting our election be decided by a select few people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks welllubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible As of this morning footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking until they crash facefirst into a registered polling location We might live in a democracy but we wouldnt have a truly representative election without the help of a select few everyday heroes So when the polling stations close and every last slippery oilcovered voter has put their ballot in the box and slid back out the door remember those brave volunteers because we couldnt do it without them
