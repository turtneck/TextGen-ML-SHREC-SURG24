The Duggars delivered a stunning display of deflection the longest exercise in selfabsolution since Gov Chris Christies twohour pity party when Bridgegate was revealed The right wing Christian activists and LGBT antagonists found unbelievably creative ways to minimize what son Josh did when he molested four of his sisters and a baby sitter in seven separate incidentsWhat Josh did was not rape Jim Bob said None of the girls who were molested were aware of Joshs wrongdoing Michelle added In fact they probably didnt even understand it was an improper touch The improper touching mostly took place over clothes oh and the few times it was under clothes It was like a few secondsAnd when he molested his babysitter It was more just like a fondling a touch while they were asleepfor most of themThen there was two other incidents that were when they were awake And it was just a bad thingLooking back we did the best we could under the circumstances Jim Bob told Kelly He and Michelle did what every parent would do Nothing really the first couple of times Josh himself confessed the abuse Well not exactly nothing They prayed and then they took him to a state trooper who gave him a stern lecture Then they got him counseling with an accredited agency but they wouldnt say what it wasAs parents were not mandatory reporters Jim Bob shared Thats a reference to laws requiring adults  teachers coaches counselors neighbors  who learn about child sexual abuse to report it to authorities Good to know the Duggars find solace in the lawThey took other big steps to prevent further abuse We dont let boys babysit Michelle explained They dont play hide and seek together two dont go off and hide There are just a lot of things that weve put in place For anyone who grew up playing with their brothers and boy cousins as I did that sounds insaneMegyn Kelly can tell herself she asked all the tough questions And she did ask some But she mostly came off as an ally determined to help the Duggars fight their liberal persecutors She regularly constructed straw men Many observers have questioned why the Duggars brought Josh to visit a state trooper who was later sentenced to 56 years for child pornography no one suggested as Kelly claimed that they chose that guy because they thought he would be sympathetic Kelly did ask Michelle Duggar about the robocall suggesting transgender people were child molesters but Jim Bob stopped her I think you actually said pedophile in that and actually a pedophile is an adult that preys on children Joshua was actually 14 and just turned 15 when he did what he did And I think that the legal definition is 16 and up for being an adult preying on a child So he was a child preying on a child Thanks for clearing that up Jim Bob In the home stretch Kelly let the Duggars tee off against their critics I feel like this is more about there is an agenda and there is people that are purposing to try to bring things out and twisting them to hurt and slander Michelle said Her daughters she said have been victimized more by what happened in what has happened in these last couple weeks than they were 12 years ago It has been an unprecedented attack on our family Jim Bob agreed And this information was released illegally And so Im wondering why all this press is not going after the system for releasing these juvenile records That is a huge story The Duggars then blasted Fox News for suggesting Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown had juvenile records Kidding But none of this was the worst The worst was when Kelly teased her interview with two of Joshs sisters who were victims We got to see them cry  and indeed blame the familys enemies for their suffering But we just got a snippet  because Kelly was promoting the show that wont air until Friday night Tune in Personally Ill skip it Breaking my usual rules I gave Fox an hour of my life Ill never have back There are times Kelly behaves like an actual journalist and questions the toxic narratives her network peddles This wasnt one of them
