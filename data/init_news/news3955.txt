Through his chief of staff President Obama is strongly countering rhetoric from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a twostate IsraeliPalestinian solutionAn occupation that has lasted for almost 50 years must end and the Palestinian people must have the right to live in and govern themselves in their own sovereign state Denis McDonough President Obamas chief of staff said Monday at the annual conference of J Street a leftleaning proIsrael groupHe added President Obama still firmly believes what he said in Jerusalem two years ago  that peace is necessary just and possible Peace is necessary because it is the only way to ensure that a secure state of Israel is both Jewish and democratic Israel cannot maintain military control of another people indefinitely Thats the truthIts not the first time the word occupation has been used by an Obama official In fact in 2013 President Obama used it himselfThe Palestinian people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it Obama said in Ramallah during a joint appearance with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud AbbasMcDonoughs remarks continued the White Houses pushback against Netanyahus comments before his reelection that a twostate solution was off the table Netanyahu has since walked back the remarksOver the course of President Obamas administration McDonough said most recently with the tireless efforts of Secretary Kerry the United States has expended tremendous energy in pursuit of this goal That is why the prime ministers comments on the eve of the election  in which he first intimated and then made very clear in response to a followup question that a Palestinian state will not be established while he is prime minister  were so troublingMcDonough said the Obama administration will continue to oppose Israeli settlement expansion because it undermines the prospects for peaceHe also made the case for what he called a realistic and achievable Iranian nuclear deal with Iran in some of the most frank comments on the subject by an Obama administration officialA scenario where Iran forgoes domestic enrichment capacity for all time would surely be ideal but its not grounded in reality Not even our closest partners support denying Iran the ability to pursue peaceful nuclear energy forever and Iran already knows how to enrich uranium We cant turn back the clock on that An absolutist position makes for good rhetoric but as Ambassador Rice said sound bites wont stop Iran from getting a nuclear weaponThe bottom line is this  compared to the alternatives diplomacy offers the best and most effective way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and this is our best shot at diplomacyIts all part of a White House push to keep the possibility of a nuclear deal alive and not have it tabled by Congress
