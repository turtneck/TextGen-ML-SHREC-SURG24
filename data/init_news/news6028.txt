Some of the biggest issues facing America this year have the State Department at the center Iran Cuba the climate talks in ParisOne that hasnt been resolved The State Department itselfThe department hasnt been reauthorized by Congress in more than a decade The last time Congress passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act which sets rules for State was in 2002so long ago that the law refers to wwwstategov as an Internet websiteThe lack of authorization doesnt mean the department cant operate it still gets money every year But every two years lawmakers are supposed to update Americas overseas priorities and how theyre executed The last time that happened Saddam Hussein was still alive and the Department of Homeland Security didnt existIf you have a reauthorization thats 12 or 13 years old said Scott Adler a political scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder who has written a book on reauthorizing agencies that was a completely different worldWithout a reauthorization bill Congress exerts ad hoc power over State appropriators can specify funding for different agencies and attach restrictions to the money lawmakers also find other routes to push their foreignpolicy agendas like inserting provisions into the Pentagon authorization Meanwhile the 116page document thats supposed to govern State grows slowly obsoleteWhenever Congress does take up the law it tends to get hung up on politics and then flame outoften over suspiciously domesticseeming issues like money for groups that favor abortions overseas Partisan fights over the USs role in the United Nations have also killed legislationA bigproblem is that the members of Congress who head the foreignpolicy committeeslike Joe Biden and John Kerry when they were in the Senatetend to ignore the grunt work of the law and instead focus on the theater of the hearing roomGuys like Biden and Kerry cared less about an authorization bill and more about their ability to impact foreign policy by being a diplomat and being a part of the group of unique statesmen apart from the administration that could still represent the United States globally said Ilan Goldenberg a senior fellow at a Center for a New American Security who has worked for State and Department of Defense and was previously a staffer at the Senate Foreign Relations CommitteeUPDATE After deadline aState Department official defended Kerrys work as chair noting he introduced a reauthorization bill in 2012The fact that the State Authorization bill wasnt passed by the full Senate during his tenure is more a reflection of Senate dysfunction and politics than it is of his leadership and priorities as Chairman the official wrote in an email And Philip Arsenault pointed out that Bidenchaired the foreign relationscommittee whenthe 2002 reauthorization passedIn the past its been the Senate where the bill gets held up in 2013 a year after the attacks on the US embassy in Benghazi the House passed a State reauthorization that strengthened embassy security by a lopsided 38437 vote The Senate never took it upThis year theres actually been some Senate movement on the issue The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on State Department reauthorization in April and unanimously passed legislation in June Senator Bob Corker the chair of the committee wants to increase security for overseas embassies and streamline agency operations Among other provisions the bill requires the White House to designate an interagency hostage recovery coordinator which the administration has created on its own requires the government to create a strategy for the Middle East in the event of a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran and expresses concern about Russias actions while reaffirming support for postSoviet nationsBut Corkers effort to attach the legislation to the National Defense Authorization Act failed and his office declined to say what his next move would beFor Statewatchers its just another example of a long and humbling truth Washington cares more about the military than statecraft While State hasnt been reauthorized in 13 years the Department of Defense has been authorized every year for 53 years in a rowI chalk it up number one to the American public and Congress cares as a whole less about funding the State Department and more about the Pentagon said GoldenbergThe Pentagon he said is much sexier stuff
