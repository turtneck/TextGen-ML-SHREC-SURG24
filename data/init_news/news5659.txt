After months of looking like bit players in the Republican presidential race Governors Chris Christie John Kasich and former Governor Jeb Bush all delivered their strongest debate performances yet Saturday night in New Hampshire But the object of their attacks was not Donald Trump the irascible billionaire who maintains a doubledigit lead in the primary state Instead they focused their fire on Marco Rubio turning his aggressively rehearsed talking points against him and exposing the vacuity of his campaign in a series of devastating exchanges that threaten to blunt his recent momentumRubio has long faced criticism for his robotic approach on the campaign trail where he regularly reproduces the same practiced phrases There is something to be said for staying on message especially when that message appears to be working But the Florida senators reliance on prescripted lines backfired dramatically when Christie called him out for using the same line twice and Rubio responded like a broken record by repeating it again and againLets dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing He knows exactly what hes doing Rubio said early in the debate arguing that Obama far from being incompetent was actually engaged in a systematic effort to change America and that he would do a better job a president Christie ripped the answer calling Rubio inexperienced and drawing applause for accusing him of truancy in the Senate Rubio shot back that New Jerseys credit rating had been downgraded nine times under Christie Then inexplicably he repeated his previous answer But I would add this Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing He knows exactly what hes doingChristie pounced Thats what Washington DC does he said deconstructing the Rubio machine in realtime The driveby shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him The crowd went wild as Christie twisted the knife See MarcoMarco the thing is this When youre president of the United States when youre a governor of a state the memorized 30second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one person Rubio appeared to panic almost immediately returning to the same line a third time Heres the bottom line This notion that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing is just not true He knows exactly what hes doingThere it is Christie interjected The memorized 25second speech There it is everybody Rubio unsure how to respond went for round four I think this is an important point We have to understand what were going through here We are not facing a president that doesnt know what hes doing He knows what he is doing Christie quipped that he gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points but that didnt stop Rubio from repeating the line a fifth time before the debate ended I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isnt doing what hes doing on purpose doesnt understand what were dealing with here he said apparently still rattled This is a presidentthis is a president who is trying to change this countryIt was a bizarre performance for the freshman senator who has soared to second in the polls in New Hampshire after a surprisingly strong thirdplace finish in the Iowa caucuses last week In the last several days the Republican establishment has rallied to Rubios side seeing him as the sole candidate capable of mounting a credible challenge to Trump and Ted Cruz both of whom are considered unelectable by many party leaders But with the New Hampshire primary just days away the confidenceshattering exchange could derail Rubios shot at holding on to his secondplace position creating an opening for Christie Kasich or Bush to pull ahead and prolonging an already damaging intraparty fight to consolidate the crowded establishment laneRubio wasnt the only one to come under attack Saturday night In what is certainly a first in the history of presidential debates Donald Trump lashed out at the audience after he was booed for trying to shush Jeb Bush Thats all of his donors and special interests out there he said like a standup comedian taking on a heckler Thats who it is he continued as the crowd grew louder The RNC told us We have all donors in the audience And the reason theyre not loving me  excuse me The reason theyre not loving me is I dont want their money Im going to do the right thing for the American public I dont want their money I dont need their money And Im the only one up here that can say that
