There was much hubbub in late 2012 when President Obama made four recess appointments during a short recess between two proforma sessions of the Senate in January of that yearThe case later went to the Supreme Court and the maneuver was ruled to be unconstitutionalThe key in the 2014 Supreme Court decision regarding the presidents appointments to the National Labor Relations Board over the threeday break was that the justices found the executive branch determined what it interpreted as a recessBut Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion that under the Constitution the Senate is in session when it says it isObama said Saturday night that he would submit an appointment to the Senate as part of his constitutional obligation but in due timeBut now we have a completely different set of parliamentary circumstances Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy has indicated that he thinks that the nomination of a new justice should wait until the election of the next presidentBut if the White House does take that to heart  and knows there would be an unprecedented attempt of filibuster a Supreme Court nominee until next year  Obama has a rare opportunity to make a Recess appointment in the coming daysThis window is open next week and this week onlyIn short Both bodies of Congress are operating in the perfect parliamentary status in which a recess appointment would be applicable The last such appointment to the high court came by President Eisenhower in 1956 when he appointed William BrennanArticle II Section 2 of the Constitution states that The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the SenateThis could be the window of time in which Obama has his chance to maneuver a recess appointment to the high courtArticle I Section 5 of the Constitution states Neither House during the Session of Congress shall without the Consent of the other adjourn for more than three days nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sittingThat means that so long as both the House and Senate havent jointly agreed to adjourn for a stretch longer than three days then there appears to be no way the president could make a recess appointmentBut the House and Senate are not operating under those circumstances right now Both bodies of have adjourned until later this month for the Presidents Day recessThe Senate last met on Thursday When doing so it approved a conditional adjournment resolution for the Senate not to meet again until Monday Feb 22 The House met on Friday and at the close of business adopted the same adjournment resolution to get in sync with the Senate The House is out until Tuesday Feb 23So the House and Senate will not be meeting in the coming days This is an adjournment and is not challengeable in court the way the NLRB recess appointments were because both bodies have agreed with each other to adjournThis is a true recess and an opportunity for the president should he elect to take it  considering the political realities of the Senate and the position of its majority leader to potentially make a recess appointmentKeep in mind that this window will close later this month Then GOPled House and Senate can effectively block the president with another recess appointment gambit in the future by agreeing to meet every three days even if members arent really hereBut obviously nobody anticipated Scalias deathThus the president could in fact take advantage of this rare opportunity because he wont get it again after February 2223 if McConnell sticks to his guns
