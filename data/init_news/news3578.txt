Before he got to repealing ObamaCare before he got to dumping Common Core before he got to abolishing the IRS Ted Cruz talked about JesusIn kicking off his presidential campaign Monday at Liberty University Cruz began with his father a Cuban immigrant who washed dishes in Texas for 50 cents an hour who drank too much along with his wife who left home when Ted was 3 but came back because God transformed his heart  Were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ I would have been raised by a single momThat introduction part of a passionate speech delivered without notes in Lynchburg Va helps explain why many in the mainstream media dont quite know what to make of the Texas senator  or view him as a fringe figureOn the Today show Kelly ODonnell said hes 44 only been on the national scene a couple of years MSNBCs Jonathan Alter while not counting him out also said hes only been in the Senate for two yearsPerhaps they had forgotten that Barack Obama was 45 and had spent just two years in the Senate when he kicked off his presidential candidacyCruz is a hero to the Tea Party right and his speech hit many of its themes against samesex marriage protecting the right to bear arms reclaiming the Constitution But the very things that make him popular could in the medias telling be campaign obstaclesCruzs downtheline appeal to the GOP base may prove to be his calling card in the primary battle to come but its also led him to pick fights with the party brass that could ultimately undermine his candidacy His ability to raise money secure endorsements and build the kind of infrastructure necessary to win a national primary may be hampered by his lack of support among the establishment And his ideological rigidity has sown doubts among some Republicans about how competitive Cruz would be in a general electionIn the twominute NBC report there were sound bites of Cruz reading Green Eggs and Ham from his 21hour filibuster that preceded the government shutdown and warning the world is on fire prompting a question from a 3yearold girlI wrote last week that the many in the MSM went way overboard in using that incident to portray Cruz as a frightening figure despite the fact that the girls mother said she wasnt scared at allLook at how the Huffington Post frames its setup piece for the Cruz kickoffMuch of the rest of the country including Republican leaders in Congress viewed Cruz as a vaguely scary renegade and the GOP establishments official grumpy grandpa Sen John McCain Ariz dismissed him as a wacko birdBut the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System Uncorked anger doesnt usually win presidential nominations let alone presidencies People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage The president is the person who is supposed to make things work To some the 44yearold Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menaceUncorked anger Cheerful menace You might get the impression that HuffPost just doesnt like the guyAnd this happens to reflect the line of the Democratic Party which in an email calls Cruz in bold letters really really scaryPolitico also emphasizes the theme that Cruz ticks people offHis own colleagues in Washington have frequently been disdainful of Cruz since he helped instigate the 2013 government shutdown And his hardline views and uncompromising style have disqualified him even in the eyes of more conservative elements of the political class who are concerned about electabilityBut Cruz is embracing that outsider status just as he did in Texas where in 2012 he beat out the presumed Republican Senate nominee former Lt Gov David Dewhurst and became a hero to that conservative states tea partyThe Washington Post says this is one of five things you need to know about the senatorCruzs often tells the story of his father Rafael  also the senators given name  leaving Cuba as a young man with 100 sewn into his underwear Rafael Cruz an evangelical pastor has a history of making headlinegrabbing statements They include telling an audience that President Obama should besentback to Kenyaassertingthat the Bible tells you exactly who to vote forSo his dads an issue tooSlate says that Cruz spouts bizarre nonsense on climate changeIn case you havent heard Sen Ted Cruz RTexas is not a fan of realityThe reality of science that isHe has a history of saying global warmingdenying talking pointsand used some of his political power just this past weekto pressure NASA into downplaying its role in measuring the effects of global warming on the planetJust for good measure Morning Joe panelist Donny Deutsch likened Cruz to Sarah PalinMy take is that the mainstream media always gravitate toward establishment candidates in part because these politicians excel at fundraising and endorsements which journalists highly value Thats why the media consistently underestimate such insurgent candidates as Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum before they catch fireBut recent history suggests that the establishment Republican prevails in the end Mitt Romney John McCain George W Bush Bob Dole The question for 2016 up against Hillary is whether this time could be differentHow about a conservative view Heres Allahpundit on Hot AirThe problem with finding a path for Cruz next year though is that as the field narrows and losers drop out the primaries inevitability become a referendum on electability and acceptability I can see Walker stumbling I can see Jeb flaming out from voters Bush fatigue I can see Paul stuck at 20 percent unable to add to his libertarian base and I can see Rubio never quite contending because he cant scrape the votes he needs from the center and right What I cant see is all of those things happening and realistically theyd all have to happen to make Cruz the nomineeIts a crowded field to be sure The thing that brought Cruz national fame was the filibuster and his leading role in the 2013 shutdown To his supporters Cruz was fighting for conservative principles against ObamaCare To his critics Cruz was pursuing a kamikaze strategy that could never have succeeded because the Democrats controlled the White House and the SenateThe coming campaign will be a test of whether Cruz can break out beyond his evangelical base But it will also be a test of the media establishment that views him mainly as a bombthrowerHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He
