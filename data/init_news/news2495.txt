Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruzs Canadian birthplace was a very precarious issue that could make the senator from Texas vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nomineeRepublicans are going to have to ask themselves the question Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years Thatd be a big problem Trump said when asked about the topic Itd be a very precarious one for Republicans because hed be running and the courts may take a long time to make a decision You dont want to be running and have that kind of thing over your headTrump added Id hate to see something like that get in his way But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passportCruz responded to Trumps comments on Twitter later Tuesday evening by referring to an iconic episode of the sitcom Happy Days in which the character Fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis The image has become a symbol of something shopworn and overdoneTrumps remarks  part of a backstage interview before a rally here Monday night  come as Cruz is rising as a serious threat in the presidential campaign especially in Iowa where some polls have shown Cruz eclipsing the billionaire mogul The two have had a cordial and at times even friendly relationship over the past year but they are competing intensely for the support of conservatives as the Feb 1 Iowa caucuses draw nearThere have been recent signs of tension At a rally last month in Iowa Trump told voters of Cruz Just remember this  youve got to remember in all fairness to the best of my knowledge not too many evangelicals come out of Cuba okay Just remember that  just rememberIn the interview with The Washington Post Trump said he was providing a candid assessment of his leading opponent rather than initiating a personal attack and reviving the birther debate that he once led against President Obama He repeatedly said he is hearing chatter on the topic among voices on the right People are bringing it up he saidTrump has veered from shrugging off the issue to raising more questions himself In an interview with ABC News in September Trump said he did not think Cruzs birthplace was an issue I hear it was checked out by every attorney and every which way and I understand Ted is in fine shape he saidBut months earlier in Iowa Trump told reporters that it could be a difficult problemHes a friend of mine I have great respect for him  certainly its a stumbling block and hes going to have to have it solved before he goes too far Trump said according to the Dallas Morning NewsSpeaking late Tuesday in Sioux Center Iowa Cruz laughed off questions about Trumps comment saying he would let his campaigns Happy Days tweet speak for itselfWhen pressed Cruz turned it back to the media saying the focus should be on substantive issuesAnd one of the things that the media loves to do is gaze at their navels for hours on end by a tweet from Donald Trump or from me or from anybody else Who cares he said When asked why he would tweet a video clip he said Why do it Because the best way to respond to this kind of attack is to laugh it off and move on to the issues that matterDespite this Cruz maintains he still likes Trump and doesnt intend to throw insultsThe Constitution requires a president to be a naturalborn citizen Anyone born to a US citizen is granted citizenship under US law regardless of where the birth takes place as long as the citizen parent has resided in the United States or its territories for a certain period of time At the time of Cruzs birth the required period was at least 10 years including five years after the age of 14Cruzs mother was a US citizen when he was born in Calgary in 1970 his father was born in Cuba Cruz has long said that because his mother is a citizen by birth he is one as well and fits under the definition of a naturalborn citizen Since his election to the Senate Cruz has released his birth certificate and renounced his Canadian citizenshipLegal scholars agree that Cruz meets the Constitutions naturalborn citizenship requirement though it is untested in the courtsSeveral previous presidential candidates have run for office with similar backgrounds such as Sen John McCain Ariz the 2008 Republican nominee who was born in the Panama Canal Zone to US citizensIn the interview Trump alluded to an ongoing lawsuit in Vermont where a man is trying to keep three Republican presidential candidates including Cruz off the ballot According to the Rutland Herald the lawsuit names state officials as defendantsTrump has long flirted with birtherism questioning Obamas love of country and legal claim to the presidency He supported efforts to investigate Obamas birth in Hawaii and often suggested that the president was born outside the countryTrumps crusade reached its zenith in 2011 when Obama felt obliged to publicly release his longform birth certificate The president then mocked Trump over the issue at the White House Correspondents Association dinner that year Since then Trump has quieted his speculation about Obamas birth while still declining to accept Obamas legitimacy as presidentKatie Zezima in Sioux Center Iowa contributed to this report
