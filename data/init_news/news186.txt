Six days ago Bernie Sanders pulled off one of the great upsets in modern politics  surging from more than 20points behind in the polls to edge out Hillary Clinton and win Michigans Democratic presidential primaryIt was remarkable It was historic And it netted him four more delegates than Clinton in the state Meanwhile in Mississippi Clinton won with more than 80percent of the vote  and gained 28more delegates than SandersOn the best night of the Sanders campaign to date he fell 24 more delegates behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nominationThat increasingly challenging math is what Sanders must confront Tuesday as voters in several large states  including Florida Illinois and Ohio  go to the pollsClinton leads Sanders by more than 2 to 1 in Florida PostUnivision poll findsAs of today Clinton has 1231 delegates to Sanderss 576  a lead of 655 That means that Clinton has 517 percent of the 2383 delegates she needs to become the Democratic Partys nomineeSubtract superdelegates  Clinton is dominating even among this group of elected officials and party luminaries  and she has 766 delegates to Sanderss 551 a margin of 215 Worth noting That is a wider lead than the margin by which Clinton ever trailed thenSen Barack Obama in the long slog of the 2008 primary raceThat lead may not seem momentous After all almost 3000 delegates are yet to be allocated in the primaries and caucuses to come The problem for Sanders is that Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally in every state  meaning that between now and when the process ends June7 there is no state where Clinton will be shut outWinning then is not enough for Sanders He has to win by alot to make up any real groundClinton has already done that Take for example Alabama She won there March 1 by 59points and gained 38 more delegates than Sanders Or Georgia on thatsame day beating Sanders by 43points and netting 55 delegates Or the aforementioned Mississippi where Clintons 66point win translated to a net gain of 28 delegatesSouthern states help Clinton extend her lead over SandersSanderss one big win came in New Hampshires primary But his 22point margin translated to a net delegate gain of zero because six superdelegates pledged to Clinton bringing her delegate gain up to match his Similarly in the Colorado caucuses Sanders won by 19points but the superdelegate math meant the candidates each took 38 delegatesLook at the next set of big contests to be held Tuesday Four states have more than 100 delegates to give out Florida 246 Illinois 182 Ohio 160 and North Carolina 121Polling released Sunday morning suggests that Sanders has a big hill to climb Clinton leads the senator 61percent to 34percent in Florida and has an edge of 58percent to 38percent in Ohio according to NBC Marist surveys The race in Illinois according to NBCMarist is closer with Clinton at 51percent and Sanders at 45percentBut wait you say Polling in Michigan had Sanders down 20 points and he won there So this polling could be wrong tooSure It could The problem for Sanders is this Lets say each of the NBCMarist surveys is off by 20 points in Clintons favor Note that this is a thought experiment I very much doubt a credible pollster such as this one would be off by even close to that amount That would mean Sanders loses Florida by single digits essentially ties Clinton in Ohio and wins Illinois by 15 points The delegate allocation from that trio of results It would almost certainly favor ClintonSanders is in a position where winning states is not close to enough if he wants to be the partys nominee He needs to start winning big states by big margins As in winning Illinois or Florida by 30 or 40 pointsThat seems very unlikely either Tuesday or beyond If past votes are any guide it will be a tough road for Sanders There have been seven election nights in the race so far Clinton has netted delegates in six of them while the two candidates fought to a draw in the seventh New HampshireNone of this means that Sanders cant  and wont  keep running Winning states matters in terms of perception and keeps the wolves from his door But winning states and emboldening your supporters arent the same as taking concrete steps to reduce or eliminate Clintons delegate leadThat looks to be a nearimpossible task for Sanders unless the numbers in the states to come start changing quickly
