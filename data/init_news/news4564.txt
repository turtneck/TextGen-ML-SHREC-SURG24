Just how far could Republicans go to deny Donald Trump the partys nominationA delegate to this summers convention in Cleveland asserts that the GOP gathering could do anything it wantsCurly Haugland a GOP national committeeman from North Dakota told Morning Edition on Thursday of his interpretation of party rules Not for the first time Haugland declared that party rules do not bind any delegate to vote for any particular candidate He argues that even delegates who are pledged to Trump or other contenders due to state primary results are in reality free to do as they likeCustom Haugland said may dictate that delegates should support the winners of their state primaries But the reality of the rules is that primary votes are absolutely irrelevant come convention timeNo matter what the popular belief might be he said there is no connection between primaries and the actual conventionIn our interview and in other conversations Haugland has cited the GOPs convention Rules 37 and 38 He interprets these convoluted rules to mean that delegates may vote their conscience The rules do not explicitly say this Rule 37 is a detailed explanation of the procedure for roll call votes However Rule 38 does say that no delegate may be bound by the unit rule meaning that delegates from a state cant all be forced to vote the same wayHauglands interpretation is by no means a unanimous view Its more widely accepted that delegates currently pledged to Trump Ted Cruz John Kasich or others must support them at least on the first ballot But if no candidate received a majority delegates would necessarily vote in different ways on later ballots in order to resolve the impasseAnother of Hauglands points is indisputable When the convention convenes he said the delegates adopt their own rules which havent been adopted yet There is a standard template for conventions but delegates could tweak the template changing the game in any way that they want The only real constraint is that their actions would be publicly known and therefore open to criticismThe latitude afforded delegates explains why its considered significant that Senator Ted Cruz has outmaneuvered Trump in several states ensuring that as many delegates as possible are Cruz supportersHaugland says his personal goal is to adopt a rule that assures delegates the chance to choose from a wide range of alternatives including candidates such as Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio who have suspended their campaignsListen to our conversation at the link above
