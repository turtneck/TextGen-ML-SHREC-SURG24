One of the core purposes of the Affordable Care Act is to expand health care to people who previously lacked it and today GallupHealthways released new numbers showing once again that the law is accomplishing this goalBut buried in the data is an indicator of a different kind of success Republican resistance to the law at the level of states is also having a substantial impact by limiting the drop in percentages of uninsured people keeping the uninsured rate higher than it might otherwise have beenHeres how Gallup tells me that the numbers show that the drop in uninsured due in particular to the Medicaid expansion has slowed significantly since last year  because far fewer new states have expanded Medicaid in recent months compared to the block of states that did so initially at the start of 2014First Gallups topline findings which show a clear decline in the uninsured rate since the law took effectWhile Gallup concludes that the improving economy may be playing a role it also notes that the uninsured has now dropped significantly lower than it was in early 2008 before the worst of the economic crisis suggesting that the law is a key factor And Gallup adds that the drop in the uninsured rate is particularly pronounced among lower income Americans down 87 percentage points since the law went into effect African Americans down 73 points and Latinos down 83 pointsThats great But Dan Witters the research director of the GallupHealthways WellBeing Index tells me the numbers also clearly show a dropoff in the impact of the Medicaid expansion on the uninsured rate  a dropoff that coincides with the slowdown in GOP states opting into the expansionWitters says that Gallup data  which are extremely extensive a key reason why this polling is the gold standard for measuring the law  showed that last years drop in the uninsured rate which was 46 percentage points was heavily fueled by the Medicaid expansion The expansion was responsible for around 40 percent of the newly insured he saysBut this year the drop has thus far been only 15 points  in part because of the Medicaid expansion slowdown The data show that the fall in the rate in uninsured this year due to the Medicaid expansion is only about threetenths of a percentage point he saysThe states that are expanding Medicaid in recent months have only been trickling in  there are fewer new states expanding Medicaid in 2015 as opposed to 2014 Witters says That has sucked the air out of the rate of decline this time relative to the last The rate of decline in the uninsured has dropped across all American adults in part because fewer states are joining in the Medicaid expansionAfter a number of states expanded Medicaid last year in 2015 the push for the expansion has stalled in places like Florida Tennessee Alaska Missouri and Utah due to conservative legislative opposition and an aggressive campaign against it by the Kochfounded Americans for ProsperityWitters says the data suggests that if the expansion had proceeded at a comparable clip this year the uninsured rate would have shown an even more accelerated decline this time a decline pretty close to what we saw the first time around He adds Wed probably see around another point shaved off  and every percentage point is another 24 million American adultsFlorida might end up opting in to the Medicaid expansion GOP governor Rick Scotts sudden reversal on the expansion has put the states budget negotiations  including planned tax cuts a major GOP priority  in peril and some GOP legislators are insisting on the expansion to move the budget process forward which suggests its fiscal logic may ultimately carry the day That logic may yet prevail in other states where the expansion is being debatedBut its very possible the Medicaid expansions could remain on hold And beyond that of course looms the Supreme Courts pending decision in the King v Burwell lawsuit which could gut subsidies for millions in the three dozen states where governors have declined to set up exchanges possibly driving the uninsured rate back up again Which is to say that even if the law currently is accomplishing one of its core goals GOP resistance to it is accomplishing one of its core goals too  and the resistances achievements could only grow more impressive in the months ahead
