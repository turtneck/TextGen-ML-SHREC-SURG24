By Sarah Jones on Tue Nov 1st 2016 at 126 pm Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the US presidential election and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as partisan Share on Twitter Print This Post Russia did hack the Democrats So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the US election But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the US presidential election and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as partisan Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov 8 election officials familiar with the deliberations told the Washington Post These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of Russian interference under the radar but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of Clintons emails which resulted from a Republicanled bogus overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter Comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already compromised Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation Not sure Im buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious There might well be good reason for this  after all this is the FBI and they cant tell us everything but as of right now Comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now He is under fire for good reason as the explanations hes giving for these decisions dont make sense and are contradictory
