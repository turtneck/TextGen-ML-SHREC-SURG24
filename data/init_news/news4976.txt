Washington CNN Bernie Sanders campaign on Friday sued the Democratic National Committee in federal court after the party organization withheld the campaigns access to a crucial voter databaseThe internal warfare exploded after the DNC cut off Sanders from the database and said the Vermont senators presidential campaign exploited a software error to improperly access confidential voter information collected by Hillary Clintons teamThe revelation poses a setback for Sanders who is mounting a liberal challenge to the former secretary of state The DNC database is a goldmine of information about voters and being blocked from it could complicate Sanders outreach efforts The timing is also challenging just weeks before Clinton and Sanders are slated to compete in the Iowa caucusesAnd coming the day before a Democratic debate the developments fueled a longheld belief in the Sanders camp and among his allies that the DNC has stacked the deck in favor of ClintonAt a press conference in Washington on Friday Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver accused the DNC of trying to sabotage the campaignThe DNC in an inappropriate overreaction has denied us access to our own data Weaver said In other words the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is actively trying to undermine our campaignTwo senior Democrats familiar with the program and the investigation told CNN that the Sanders campaign accessed turnout projections for Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary a key piece of strategy the Clinton campaign has been working on with modeling and analyticsThe Sanders team which consisted of four people ran multiple searches in Iowa New Hampshire Nevada South Carolina and about 10 March states including Florida and Colorado In Iowa and New Hampshire the Clinton campaign has ranked voters on a scale of 1100 for turnout enthusiasm and support the senior Democrats said The Sanders campaign ran two searches Show me all the Clinton people rated higher than 60 and Show me all the people rated less than 30 This would be a key way of knowing who Sanders should target in the final weeks before voting Ignore those above 60 while focus on those below 30 because they are looking for a Clinton alternative and might be open to SandersThe investigation into what information was lifted should only take a few days as there are audit logs and trails of the activity which took place beginning around 1040 am and lasting for about 40 minutes the senior Democrats saidThey added that the Clinton campaign views this as a big deal but will not say so publicly because it will fan the flames of liberal groups trying to fight with the DNCIn a statement released Friday afternoon the Clinton campaign called for the Sanders campaign and the DNC to work expeditiously to ensure that our data is not in the Sanders campaigns account and that the Sanders campaign only have access to their own dataAt Fridays press conference Weaver said The DNC is clearly acting in a heavyhanded way in an unprecendented way I would like to see another instance where a presidential campaign had their data  their own data  withheld under similar circumstancesThe Sanders campaign sought an injunction against the DNC Friday afternoon claiming irreparable harm and seeking immediate access to the voter file system A campaign aide said earlier Friday that there was no expectation the DNC would grant access before the close of business FridayWeaver said the original problem with the databases security which did not involve the current database access company NGP VAN dated back to OctoberWe were very concerned that large amounts of our own data was being downloaded and we contacted the DNC to remedy the situation he said We talked to them and we were assured that this was going to be taken care of But apparently they are not competent in terms of maintaining the security of their data between the campaignsThe DNC however had a very different storyShortly after Weavers press conference DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said suspending the Sanders campaigns access was the only way to ensure the voter file was properly safeguardedThat is the only way that we can make sure that we can protect our significant asset that is the voter file and its integrity Wasserman Schultz said on CNNShe said multiple staffers from the Sanders campaign downloaded information that they did not have the right to collectThey not only viewed it but they exported it and they downloaded it Wasserman Schultz told CNNs Wolf Blitzer We dont know the depth of what they actually viewed and downloaded We have to make sure that they did not manipulate the informationShe added That is just like if you walked into someones home when the door was unlocked and took things that dont belong to you in order to use them for your own benefit Thats inappropriate UnacceptableThe DNC also sent out a strongly worded message from Wasserman Schultz to its members accusing the Sanders campaign of improper conductOver the course of approximately 45 minutes staffers of the Bernie Sanders campaign inappropriately accessed voter targeting data belonging to the Hillary Clinton campaign Wasserman Schultz said in the messageOnce the DNC became aware that the Sanders campaign had inappropriately and systematically accessed Clinton campaign data and in doing so violated the agreement that all the presidential campaigns have signed with the DNC as the agreement provides we directed NGP VAN the vendor that supplies access to the database to suspend the Sanders campaigns access to the system until the DNC is provided with a full accounting of whether or not this information was used and the way in which it was disposed she addedWe knew there was a security breach in the data and we were just trying to understand it and what was happening Uretsky saidHe said that none of the data the Sanders campaign accessed on Wednesday left the system that day and denied that he or his staff downloaded any individual level voter file dataUretsky said he and his team downloaded only phone numbers but did so to alert the DNC and NGP VAN that the Sanders campaign was aware the campaigns voter info in the DNC database wasnt being properly protectedWe knew that what we were doing was being recorded he told CNN We didnt try to be sneaky at all They can argue that we shouldnt have done it but we did not in any way try to deceive them We created the records of it having been done and we did not make any attempt to use it for strategic purposesEthan Roeder Barack Obamas data director in 2008 and 2012 said the biggest problem created by being barred from the database is the fact that Sanders volunteers will not be able to use the voter file to make calls and knock on doors for at least the next few daysI think the pain is compounded each additional day that they dont have access to the file Roeder said It definitely has an impact on their operations Especially as close as we are to caucuses and primaries it becomes a serious problemNGP VAN the database vendor issued a statement Friday saying the DNC had instructed the company to remove the Sanders campaigns access to the databaseWe are confident at this point that no campaigns have access to or have retained any voter file data of any other clients with one possible exception one of the presidential campaigns the company said adding that it was investigating the breach and would report back to the DNCSanders supporters and liberal groups have reacted to the news of Sanders campaign being punished by questioning the neutrality of the DNC hinting that the body is in the tank for ClintonThe Democratic National Committees decision to attack the campaign that figured out the problem rather than go after the vendor that made the mistake is profoundly damaging to the partys Democratic process said Charles Chamberlain executive director of Democracy for America a liberal group that endorsed Sanders this weekDNC leaders should immediately reverse this disturbing decision before the committee does even more to bring its neutrality in the race for President into question he addedWeaver the Sanders campaign manager said of the DNC In this case it looks like they are trying to help the Clinton campaignWe are taking on the establishment and Im sure there are people within the Democratic establishment who are not happy about the overwhelming success that Bernie Sanders is having all across this country he added But we are determined to win this campaign and were going to win this campaign by talking about the issues that are important to the American people To do that we are going to need our data which has been stolen by the DNC
