As a long time observer of the political process and as someone who served twice in the White House I remember the great anticipation for past State of the Union speeches It was an activity wheremany hundreds of hours and top level staff worked on the speech for many months before it was delivered It was to be a recap of what had been accomplished and an agenda for the futureI remember the excitement of the president going to Capitol Hill to address the nation standing before the other branches of the government the Congress and the Supreme Court and either inspiring or informing all of just what the title states this is the State of the UnionPart of the drama has been the grand entrance into the peoples House the House of a Representatives and the president being mobbed by members trying to shake his hand or pat his back and for this one night he is treated like a rock star or to be more current like a reality TV starThe repeated standing and applauding for the key phrases that appeal to the partisans in his party and the negative responses from the oppositionEveryone is thereAnyone of importance in our government along with the ambassador contingent from the diplomatic community is there on display for the nation to seeThis has historically been an opportunity for a dramatic speech to the nation and the world and without question as important as any that a president might deliver Tuesday night was the last of these that President Barack Obama will ever giveAs I watched the visuals the new young Speaker Paul Ryan sitting alongside the vice president whom he tried to replace in the last election Biden realizing daily that this is his last hurrah  and privately telling people he wishes he would have run one more time against the faltering Hillary ClintonSpeaker Ryan who now holds more power than anyone except maybe the lame duck president sits in a seat he never anticipated a year ago He will be the one who sets the legislative agenda for the future and the presidents only retort is his veto penI watch the one Socialist member of Congress Senator Bernie Sanders mix and greet the members of the Joint Chief of Staffs of our military with their stars on their uniforms and rows of medals on their chestsThere is not a member in this chamber who would ever have thought a year ago that Sanders would be viewed as a serious challenger to Hillary Clinton as he now isFor someone as skilled at giving a speech as our fortyfourth president Mr Obama failed miserably at either inspiring or informing us of the real State of the UnionWhat he did do is give a political campaign speech It was disjointed irrelevant and disappointing He is not running for a third term and the agenda he laid out is not what the country wants or feels He looked tired and ready to move onHe talked about how great we are as a nation True but what he didnt do was set an agenda for his final year or for his legacyHe set goals but failed to explain how we can accomplish them He talked about leadership but has failed miserably as a leaderOn the very day the president is delivered his speech the Iranian Navy captured two US Navy ships that allegedly were incapacitated and drifted into Iranian waters Now Iran is holding these sailors hostage Yet there was no mention of this incident in the presidents speechThis is an escalation of hostile behavior by the Iranians who just last month fired unguided missiles at our aircraft carrier  the Harry S Truman in the same watersI cant imagine if he was still with us that President Truman would disregard these acts of hostility He was a man of strength With the country feeling that terrorism is one of our top problems the president dismissed our concerns Dont worry Weve got the strongest military in the world We got Bin LadenThis is what he said about Iran Thats why we built a global coalition with sanctions and principled diplomacy to prevent a nucleararmed Iran As we speak Iran has rolled back its nuclear program shipped out its uranium stockpile and the world has avoided another warI dont think so Bad behavior by Iran is dismissed because President Obama wants to protect his sacred and risky dealThe number one concern of the country is fighting terrorism The recent home grown action by the terrorist killings in San Bernardino California has made this more of a concern But in spite of thisjust this week the president is to release more prisoners from Guantanamo It is still his top priority to close this prison in spite of strong objections from the Congress the military and law enforcement officersMany of the prisoners already released have returned to the terrorist battlefield That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo its expensive its unnecessary and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemiesThis is a speech that will not be remembered and will historically be irrelevantThe man who was the most partisan president in recent history talked about how disappointed he is that the partisan divide has not healedThe office of the presidency has been diminished under Barack Obamas two terms His party has been demolished at the State house level and in the loss of both Houses of Congress But he still panders onThis is not an historic presidency and he exemplified his leading from behind with a very forgettable farewell State of the UnionNo wonder the country is desperately looking for new leadershipEdward J Rollins is a Fox News contributor He is a former assistant to President Reagan and he managed his reelection campaign
