Two weeks after the Secret Service forced out four of its top officials lawmakers are questioning whether the agency should have ousted one more  its influential secondincommandMembers of Congress from both parties are concerned that bykeeping in place Alvin AT Smith the Secret Service stopped short of fully reforming upper management following a string of embarrassing security lapses according to government officials familiar with the discussionsSmith as a top official for nearly a decade and the deputy director since 2012 has managed the agencys daytoday operations and was a key architect of its budgets and policies He has overseen the departments responsible for the missteps and is now helping to engineer the agencys overhaulSmith is the highestranking official to survive a series of management shakeups that began in October with the resignation of Director Julia Pierson and continued this month with the ouster or retirement of six assistant directorsThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee plans to invite Smith and acting director Joseph P Clancy to appear at a February hearing focusing on the core reasons behind security breaches involving the White House and the president according to people knowledgeable about the panels plansCommittee members have heard from agency whistleblowers who have complained that Smith approved policy changes that they say weakened the agency according to these people Lawmakers have also quietly expressed concern to administration officials in recent days about Smiths continued presence in the agencys top leadershipIm worried that AT Smith is part of the problem not part of the solution said the committees chairman Rep Jason Chaffetz RUtah He seems to be in the middle of most of these really bad decisionsSmith and Clancy declined to comment Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan also declined to discuss Smiths role but said the deputy director has a proven record of accomplishment and professionalismThe discussions regarding Smiths role underscore a dilemma facing the Obama administration as it attempts to turn around the beleaguered protective agency how to clean house in the upper ranks without losing the unusual expertise required for the highly specialized work of protecting the White House and national leadersSmiths allies say that ousting the 28year Secret Service veteran would strip the agency of the little remaining continuity and institutional knowledge remaining after the shakeup in leadershipHes a pivotal peg in the foundation said Jon Adler president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association If he gets pulled Im concerned there would be a need for a complete rebuild We dont have luxury for a rebuild because the bad guys arent going to wait for us to do a complete overhaulA reminder of the Secret Services continuing challenges came this week when an errant recreational drone evaded detection and crashed on the White House grounds The device was not a threat but the agency has studied the White Houses vulnerability to a drone attack for years and has yet to find a solution This weeks incident came four months after a knifewielding man was able to jump the White House fence and race into the front door and through much of the main floor  a humiliation for the Secret Service that exposed poor training and numerous breakdowns in communications and proceduresSmith 56 who started his law enforcement career as a Greenville SC sheriffs dispatcher and joined the Secret Service in 1986 as a special investigator in the Miami field office knows the inner workings of the agency better than anyone according to several current and former managersHe also has made political connections as he has risen through the ranks serving during the 1990s as head of the protective detail for thenfirst lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Smith married President Bill Clintons cousin Catherine Cornelius in 2000 and Bill andHillary Clinton attended the wedding at Foundry Methodist Church near the White HouseSmith has received a number of awards during his career particularly related to his time heading the New York field office and managing major security events New York agents applauded his steady hand in rebuilding the agencys flagship field office after its headquarters at the World Trade Center was destroyed in the Sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks and one of its officers was killedThe George W Bush administration honored him with a merit award in 2004 for his handling of security at the Republican National Convention at New Yorks Madison Square Garden Smith received the Secretarys Silver Medal from Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff for coordinating security for the 60th anniversary of the UN General Assembly in 2005 at the time the largest security event the agency had ever managedBut Smith is also directly responsible for some of the decisions cited as contributing factors in recent security lapses including the Sept 19 fencejumping incident and the failure of the security system at Vice President Bidens Delaware home when shots were fired near the house this monthSmith signed off on canceling academy classes for new recruits and regular training for officers which resulted in the White House being guarded by a team of Secret Service officers who were stretched thin and often unsure of their specific duties in responding to an intruder He also approved cutting back on funds meant to replace aging technology and alarmsHis management decisions came under scrutiny after he authorized a special operation in 2011 that diverted agents from a White House surveillance post to monitor the wellbeing of the Secret Service directors administrative assistant who was in a dispute with her neighborThe agencys inspector general later concluded that Operation Moonlight was improper and represented a serious lapse in judgment in removing agents from a key post Smith defended his actions telling investigators that he felt it was appropriate for the Secret Service to be concerned about the welfare of a staffer particularly one who held a White House pass and worked closely with the agency directorSmiths critics say he is one of the central architects of an insular management structure that has lost the trust of rankandfile employees according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former personnelMany inside were shocked that Smith was not forced out along with the top managers People were holding their breath for two months one veteran agent said Now they are wondering Why isthe core of the problem still thereA special panel appointed by the Department of Homeland Security recommended last month that the White House pick a new director from outside the Secret Service describing the agency as starved for dynamic leaders with fresh ideasIn recent weeks Smith has provided close counsel to Clancy who has said he is seeking to repair management problems and repair the battered image of a oncerevered agencySmith was involved in the recent departures of senior managers And last week he helped choose five new assistant directors to fill the new vacancies almost all of whom served with Smith on previous assignments
