5 Questions That Now Loom Over Tonights DebateIts hard to be any more gobsmacked about the state of the presidential race right now after a video of Donald Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday prompting more than 30 prominent Republicans to call for him to step aside as the nominee Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is also in headlines for a WikiLeaks email dump that included alleged excerpts of her speeches to Wall Street banksBut there is a debate Sunday night so its time to pick our jaws off the floor and contemplate 5 things well be watchingThis is the big question of the night Trump as usual has given conflicting clues In a video statement posted on Facebook he said he was sorry I said it I was wrong I apologize but also pivoted to an attack on Bill and Hillary Clinton saying he abused women and she intimidated Bills accusers Later he retweeted messages from Juanita Broaddrick who claims Bill Clinton raped herSo what does Trump prioritize contrition or defianceTrump tweeted The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN MAGAMike Pence in an extraordinary show of disloyalty for a vice presidential candidate briefly jumped off the tightrope hes been walking for weeks and issued Trump an ultimatum for the debatePence said he and his family were offended and said we look forward to the opportunity he has to show whats in his heart tonightSomething else might be going through Trumps mindThe list of Republicans calling on Trump to step aside is growing but the number is still tiny compared to the GOP leaders who prefer to condemn Trumps words while maintaining their support House Speaker Paul Ryan for example said he was sickened by Trumps comments about grabbing womens genitals but he has not unendorsed or called for him to step aside as the nomineeRyan was heckled by Trump supporters at a campaign event in Wisconsin Saturday which gives you an idea of how deep the split is inside the GOP Trumps diehard supporters are still the majority of the GOP baseThe administration believes Russian security agencies authorized the hacking of Democratic party officials emails in order to influence the US elections and hurt ClintonWikiLeaks posted emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta  including ones from his gmail account that contain excerpts allegedly from Clintons paid speeches to Wall Street banksIn them she says shes for free trade and open borders and shows some sympathy for Wall Street bankersThey represent views that she subsequently moved away from as the campaign progressed but you can see why she chose not to release the transcripts during her primary battle with Bernie Sanders The hacked emails could hurt her with Sanders supporters although Sanders himself has dismissed them younger voters and bluecollar DemocratsIf there is a contest for the October Surprise prize Trumps hot mic probably beats WikiLeaksStill tonight Clinton will need to come up with a good explanation for why she said those things to a private room filled with Wall Street bankersThe debate format is unusual and presents lots of pitfalls for both candidatesThere are two moderators ABCs Martha Raddatz and CNNs Anderson Cooper but half the questions will come from ordinary votersIts harder to attack your opponent in a room full of real people who want you to tell them how you will make their lives better And any question from a voter has the presumption of validity  making it hard to ignore or to pivot away to boilerplate speech chunks or talking points a favorite tactic of presidential candidatesBut both campaigns claim this is a great format for their candidateTrump has spent more hours in front of a TV camera than any Republican presidential candidate other than Ronald Reagan Even so Trumps practice town hall in Sandown NH on Thursday night did not show that Trump has learned how to connect with people the way a town hall format demandsThe audience was handpicked supporters the questions were vetted friendly and read from notecards by the moderatorThe Clinton campaign says the town hall format is a good one for Hillary Clinton since she prefers small listening sessions and roundtables with small businesspeople or working moms over big set piece speeches at ralliesBut most of the questions she gets in those forums are friendly softballsClinton has been preparing diligently  as usual  for this debate She presumably is working on better answers to questions about her emails the WikiLeaks revelations and the line that was the most effective for Trump in the first debate  that he represents change and she is the staus quoWinning means different things for Clinton and TrumpTrump has a monumental task Even before the Access Hollywood hot mic audio was leaked he was in a hole  a hole that he dug and kept digging for himself because of his poor performance in the first debate his subsequent feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and the story about his 916 million dollar business losstax deductionSo tonight Trump needs a performance so unexpectedly good that it will reverse that downward spiralClinton on the other hand comes into the second debate with a small but growing lead in the polls She needs to connect with voters and show them shes not the dishonest unlikeable person they think she is But most of all her goal is to not screw upA large number of issues have simply been absent from the conversation this campaign  such as health care energy job creation and economic growthWill voters tonight ask for specifics on any of these topics or are they happy to watch another chapter in the food fight that campaign 2016 has becomeThe debate will begin at 9 pm ET You can
