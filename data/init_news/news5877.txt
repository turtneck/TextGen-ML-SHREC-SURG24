Posted on October 30 2016 by Dr Eowyn  12 Comments On Friday FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that the agency is reopening its criminal investigation of Hillary Clintons unsecured and illegal private email server as a result of the FBI discovering 650000 emails of Hillarys closest aide Huma Abedin on a laptop computer that Abedin shares with her nowestranged husband the disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner See  Weinered FBI reopens investigation into Hillary Clintons emails  Experts such as Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein say that only the discovery of something truly awful would lead the FBI to reopen its investigation at such a late date with just days to go before the election Now a major US newspaper  the Chicago Tribune that endorsed libertarian candidate Gary Johnson for president  is saying what needs to be said Democrats should ask Hillary Clinton to step down or risk her being elected President who begins her term of office facing a criminal investigation Note Founded in 1847 Chicago Tribune is the 8th largest newspaper by circulation in the United States Below is Chicago Tribune reporter John Kass stunning article in its entirety Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside by John Kass  October 29 2016 Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president even after Fridays FB I announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state Well find out soon enough Its obvious the American political system is breaking down Its been crumbling for some time now  and the establishment elite know it and theyre properly frightened Donald Trump the vulgarian at their gates is a symptom not a cause Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect FBI director James Comeys announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious This cant be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl But it can be about the laptop of Weiners wife Clinton aide Huma Abedin and emails between her and Hillary It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been reckless with national secrets but said he could not recommend prosecution So what should the Democrats do now If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process They would demand that Mrs Clinton step down immediately  and let her vice presidential nominee Sen Tim Kaine of Virginia stand in her place Democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea Since Oct 7 WikiLeaks has released 35000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta release another 15000 emails What if she is elected Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls wringing her hands The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now  It would be the most responsible thing to do if the nation were more important to them than power And the American news media  fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs Clintons political action committee  should begin demanding it But what will Hillary do Shell stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey For Hillary and Bill Clinton it has always been about power about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence Shell remind the nation that shes a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked the Clintons should probably leak it now Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims which she has never been  Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the Year of the Woman Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him But the political left  most particularly the women of the left  defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas If you take a step back from tribal politics youll see that Mrs Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record Shed never be hired As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the homebrew server in her basement which is against the law She lied about it to the American people She couldnt remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers Her husband Bill met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a halfhour and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids And there was no prosecution of Hillary That isnt merely wrong and unethical It is poisonous And during this presidential campaign Americans were confronted with a twotiered system of federal justice one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants Ive always figured that as secretary of state Clinton kept her homebrew email server  from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information  so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes The Clintons werent skilled merchants They werent traders or manufacturers The Clintons never produced anything tangible They had no science patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars All they had to sell really was influence And they used our federal government to leverage it If a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates then well learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days wont we John Kass concluded his article with the observation that a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates  So what do the comments from some of the readers of Kass article say about the people and this country Below is a sample MerryPrankster Real journalists should ask John Kass to step aside millekj61 Do you actually think before you write There are 9 days to go before the election who do you suggest they substitute for her pagewerks Did you even do the slightest research The email scandal youre panting over is nonexistent and apparently has to do with another investigation But dont let that stop you from making a damn fool of yourself MChicago99 What is unfathomable about this column and the comments is how disconnected from reality and truth it and the comments are There has been no reopening of the investigation THE emails in question are probably all duplicates of emails the FBI has already examined The FBI did not find anything illegal in Clintons use of the personal server Just a desperate ploy to throw last minute obstacles into the election process Wavo I believe it is time for you to retire from your establishment job at the Tribune John Your shtick is tiresome and inflammatory Maybe you should consider a second act over at Breitbartthey and their readers seem to love your work larrywesbsite You Trumpites actually want national socialism under a national socialist leader who will ride roughshod over the Constitution seeking what you think are simple fast answers to complex difficult questions and problems Maybe you will learn or just blame Trump and move on to the next demagogue All of us will pay the cost for your mistakes dsm606 Sorry angry old white man Im still not voting for Trump Nice try though Jim Kaestner I am tired of tribune columnists telling me how to vote who to support Go tell Trump to quit he has admitted to sexual assault bluedemondan Excuse me you sure this isnt The Onion I usually confuse The Onion with the Tribs editorials JNAlbukerk Kass have you no shame sir Convicting someone with no evidence Clinton is the most vetted and experienced candidate in history Until you have evidence otherwise it is you who should step aside as you have abused the power your employment has granted you You can reach
