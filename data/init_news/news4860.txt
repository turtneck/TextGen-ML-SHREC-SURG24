doubts grow  Be the bearCARLYS MOMENTUM KEEPS GROWING No candidate in the Republican field has had a better two weeks than Carly Fiorina Gallup polling out today compares views of the Republican contenders before and after the Aug 6 Fox News debate in Cleveland Favorable views of Fiorina are up an eyepopping 15 points 3 points more than the two other debate winners Ben Carson and John Kasich  I went into the debate thinking this was an opportunity An opportunity to introduce myself to Republican people Fiorina said in an interview on Power Play with Chris Stirewalt It was an opportunity I was going to take full advantage of  But there were others who hoped for and needed standout showings They saw sentiment collapse Gallup shows Rand Paul Rick Perry Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham took doubledigit nosedives Other mostly betterknown candidates saw little change Donald Trump 17 percent net favorability and Jeb Bush 27 percent net favorability were essentially unchanged  Fiorina shot past Trump and Bush to a net score of 37 percent but along the way earned the enmity of Trump whom she whacked for his postdebate comments Trump has made attacking Fiorina a standard part of his speeches and interviews since then often complaining about the sound of her voice  Were not actually solving problems when we just hurl insults each others way Fiorina said in the interview I think we need a leader who will actually honor citizens by reengaging them in the political process and in their government  The poll shows Fiorina still has room to grow  After the debate an alltime high of 51 percent of Republicans expressed familiarity with her name That brings her near toptier contender Scott Walker who is still a relative unknown to 40 percent of his party But she is still less known by 20 points than Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio 30 points less than Bush and 40 points less than Trump  It was my personal relationship with Jesus Christ that saved me  In her interview Fiorina also responded to those who have questioned her faith and resolve to fight Islamist militants because she once spoke in praise of the enlightenment of the medieval Ottoman Empire No one needs to question or tell me about my faith Ive been through some hard times in my life Ive battled cancer Weve lost a child to the demons of addiction So I understand in deeply personal terms that it was my personal relationship with Jesus Christ that saved me that saved my family So its unfortunate when people throw stones at anyone but politics has sort of become that hasnt it And we have candidates who encourage it  SOUTHERN MAN TRUMP HEADS TO MOBILE FOR MEGA RALLY In what is set to be a scorcher down South today Donald Trump plans have his biggest rally yet After moving venues to the University of

rulebreaking Those stamps are new it says and do not mean the information was classified when Clinton the Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election first sent or received it But the
