ISIS is making enemies in Syria and theres a need to ramp up efforts to train them Thats where the new Special Operations forces fit inPresident Obamas announcement Monday that 250 Special Operations Forces will be headed to Syria suggests that a start small approach to combatting the Islamic State might be showing signs of promiseLast fall Mr Obama sent 50 special operators to Syria as trainers as a proof of concept of sorts says Melissa Dalton a former intelligence analyst for the Defense Intelligence AgencyThe goal was to see if the United States could use the training to gain traction with Kurdish fighters and Arab Sunnis on the ground she saysOn Monday Obama offered his verdict saying that the expertise of the Special Operations Forces already in Syria has been critical as local forces have driven the Islamic State out of key areasMondays decision then appears to be an attempt to hit the fast forward buttonIt seems to reflect that this proof of concept works adds Ms Dalton Theres been some positive momentum built up with the idea now being OK if we expand that out a bit further  multiply the amount of trainers in the country  then perhaps we can multiply the effects There are questions At a time when a diplomatic ceasefire is faltering the US seems to be doubling down on a military strategy even as it has failed to define what a realistic end state might be Dalton saysWhere are we building to Is this the first of many plusups happening incrementally  and to what endBut building out the program bit by bit makes sense say others It gives the US the potential to empower antiIslamic State forces in a proven way without becoming embroiled in a Mideast warIn this case incrementalism is the right approach says Nicholas Heras a Middle East analyst at the Center for a New American SecurityMondays decision mirrored another made last week with more US troops on their way to Iraq in newlyexpanded roles that will bring them closer to the action as Defense Secretary Ash Carter put itWith Obama making no secret of his desire to keep US out of another war in the Middle East this increase in Syria from 50 to 300 Special Operations Forces is seen as a relatively lowrisk gambitIn the past the US has made much more grandiose efforts at fighting the Islamic State also known as ISIS Before the US sent over its 50 special operators last fall it attempted a 500 million effort to train Syrian antiISIS forces The result four or five fighters on the battlefield Gen Lloyd Austin told Congress last SeptemberBut still the Syrian rebels in the program were getting terrific training Christine Wormuth the Pentagons policy chief assured lawmakersThe answer was to pivot to the 50 special operators who have worked on refining their message to potential recruitsThey are explaining the benefits They get training they get US airstrike support US logistical support and the tacit idea that while ISIS is the primary objective the US isnt going to complain if these groups fight back against Syrian president Bashar alAssad Mr Heras saysThe trainers have also had some success in expanding the number of Syrian Arabs within the Syrian Democratic Forces Heras addsThats important in building some degree of trust among antiISIS forces Kurds have proven to be US forces mostreliable partners but Syrian Arabs distrust them to the point that Sunni Arab families were fleeing deeper into ISISheld territory for fear of Kurdish forces Amnesty International reports The Kurdish forces were accused of ethnic cleansing and forcibly removing Sunni Arabs from their homesKurdish forces ultimately want an autonomous region of their own within Syria a goal that many Sunni Arabs do not support notes Jenny Cafarella a fellow at the Institute for the Study of WarBut a greater ethnic mix of forces battling ISIS could help in the long run If these troops can ultimately take back control of their hometowns then they must find a way to live together and govern  an even trickier proposition than winning on the battlefieldAnd the pool of recruits is growingIn the first trainandequip mission the emphasis was on fighters that had been recommended by Syrians on the ground often with the Turks acting as intermediariesNow the latest pool includes guys who were expelled from ISIScontrolled territory so they have a sense of vengeance  theyre on a mission Heras says For them its ISIS thats the major impediment to them being able to go back home to build up their own government he adds For them its ISIS thats the main enemy
