Jeb Bush may have cooler things to do than mix it up in tonights Boulder bash but hed better come to play anywayThe former governor is riding a huge wave of bad press after slashing campaign spending and sounding petulant about the campaign ordeal telling an audience he could be doing better stuff and to elect Trump if they want entertainment and gridlock It was the opposite of the joyful run he had promised and there are even dumb unfounded rumors that he might drop outSo Bush not only needs a strong performance at the CNBC debate in Colorado he needs to do well in the spin cycle that follows these faceoffsThe Republican debates have assumed an outsize importance this year First there are so many candidates that they are having an unusually strong winnowing effect remember Scott Walker Second they are drawing massive audiences 24 million and 23 million for the Fox and CNN debatesAnd third there are so few of them that each one has a Super Bowl quality The onceamonth schedule is the brainchild of the RNC which thought fewer debates would help the party consolidate around a frontrunner But in a cycle dominated so far by Donald Trump and Ben Carson its having the opposite effectJeb just hasnt looked comfortable on stage in either debate and now that hes sunk to singledigit status hes under enormous pressure to punch his way back into contention He knows policy inside out but his message is diffused by a diffident mannerTrump who no one would accuse of being low energy will need to deal with his emboldened rivals as well as the CNBC moderators He cant just be seen as reciting his greatest hits on Mexico China and our incompetent leaders The debates focus jobs and the economy should play to his strengthBut he is trailing Carson for the first time 26 to 22 percent in yesterdays New York TimesCBS poll which has a symbolic value even though its within the margin of error Even more noteworthy is that 55 percent of Trump supporters in the survey said they are firmly behind their man while 80 percent of Carson backers said its early and they could change their mindsTrump will be standing next to Carson but attacking the doctor will call for surgical precision and The Donald tends to favor blunt instrumentsCarson is generally overshadowed on a debate stage He is softspoken lowkey occasionally witty but doesnt interrupt or deliver zingers He avoids what he calls the mud pit And yet that doesnt seem to hurt him at all In fact Carsons quiet dignity may be precisely what his fans likeMarco Rubio has had two solid debates but they havent given him much of a bump He is drawing more attention nowRubio is third in that CBS poll with 8 percentand is a better communicator than Bush in front of an audience But with that poll rise may come tougher debate questions perhaps including the Washington Post report that he cant stand the Senate and so wants a promotionCarly Fiorina may be the best debater in the bunch having fought her way into the CNN debate won it hands down and then catapulted herself into the top tier But the former CEOs surge didnt last and she seemed to fade from the political conversation since the Reagan Library event She will surely try to elbow her way back into the spotlightAs will the others Ted Cruz Chris Christie John Kasich Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee havent gotten much time in the earlier debates and they will be looking to seize a breakout moment In a Trumpian media environment there just arent many opportunities to reach the whole countryA couple of the candidates who dont score well in Boulderor at the Fox Business Network event in Milwaukee on Nov 10may not be with us much longer Thats why the stakes are unusually high in this third presidential debateHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
