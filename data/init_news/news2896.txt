President Obama promised on Monday that Russia would suffer consequences for its continued aggression in eastern Ukraine but he made one thing explicitly clear He was in no rush to push America deeper into the conflictCaution has been the hallmark of the presidents foreign policy for much of the past six years Obama spent months reviewing his Afghanistan strategy in 2009 before settling on the troop surge he went back and forth over whether to bomb Syria after the government there used chemical weapons on its own people and in the early days of the Arab Spring he straddled the line between protesters and thenPresident Hosni Mubarak for weeks before deciding it was time for the dictator to goObama has held his careful deliberations up as a point of pride contrasting them with the actions of his predecessor President George W Bush whom he blamed for rushing the country into an unwise war in IraqAmid rising calls to send weapons to Ukraines armed forces Obama suggested Monday that he was still thinking about it What Ive asked my team to do is look at all options  what other means can we put in place to change Russian President Vladimir Putins calculus  and the possibility of lethal defensive weapons is one of those options thats being examined he saidThe presidents ambivalence regarding arms for Ukraine has separated him from many of his traditional Democratic supporters including some who served in his government and now are questioning his priorities Obama has often seemed reluctant to plunge too deeply into a conflict that he doesnt view as a major threat to the US homeland or the nations securitySome of the presidents hesitancy could also stem from the high priority hes placed on reaching an agreement this year with Iran to end its nuclear program Putin and Russia have played an important role in keeping the pressure on Tehran during the delicate negotiationsThe conflicting priorities have left some of the presidents backers asking whether he has played down the threat posed by PutinThis is a damned serious thing said a former senior administration official who worked on the Ukraine issue speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the presidents policy Theres a sense that the president doesnt agreeObama isnt alone in his reluctance to send weapons to Ukraine Even the most ambitious plans to arm the Ukrainian military wouldnt give the country the firepower it needs to resist the Russian army Sending more arms into the country could inflame an already violent conflict and prompt Putin to mount even more aggressive attacks in support of the separatist rebelsThose concerns have led most European leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel to come out against the idea of sending American arms to UkraineBut Obamas reluctance to ship weapons to Ukraine is also reflective of a broader foreign policy philosophy that recognizes that the United States despite its vast power also has limited resources and as a result must be disciplined in setting priorities and exercise strategic patienceOn Friday Susan E Rice Obamas top foreign policy adviser introduced the presidents new National Security Strategy  his first in five years  and laid out one of the main lessons the administration has learnedToo often whats missing here in Washington is a sense of perspective said Rice Obamas national security adviser We cannot afford to be buffeted by alarmism in a nearly instantaneous news cycleBy the new strategys reckoning most of the threats that consume Washington such as an aggressive Russia dont rise to the level of dire threats to the nation Even the Islamic State whose fighters have taken over large swaths of Iraq and Syria doesnt pose a real danger to the American way of lifeYes theres a lot going on Rice said in introducing the new strategy While the dangers we face may be more numerous and varied they are not of the existential nature we confronted during World War II or the Cold WarInstead the presidents strategy asserts that lesstraditional threats such as climate change global pandemics and cyberattacks represent the most pressing longterm dangers to the nation and deserve more focusThe strategy has put the president at odds with some of his longtime supporters in the traditional Democratic foreign policy establishment Nowhere has the break been more apparent than on the issue of arming Ukraine The list of prominent Democrats who have called for shipping weapons to Ukraine includes former secretary of state MadeleineK Albright liberal Sen Sherrod Brown DOhio and even Ashton Carter Obamas choice to be secretary of defenseAt issue is whether Obama can afford to play for time in Ukraine Almost a year after the Russian militarys moves into Crimea and Ukraine the conflict is by most measures worse than ever The sanctions that Obama hoped would force Putin to reverse course have punished the Russian economy but havent changed the leaders calculusThe president spoke out forcefully Monday about the need to check Putin saying that the world could not stand idle and simply allow the borders of Europe to be redrawn at the barrel of a gun But Obama also has suggested that the weakness of the Russian economy which has been battered by sanctions and Putins isolation will eventually force him to back off his aggressive stanceObamas calls for patience however have led some to question whether hes underestimating the costs of inaction The problem with assuming weakness and letting the situation play out is that Putin can still wreak a lot of damage said Dennis Ross a former administration official and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy
