WASHINGTON  Experts have a pretty good sense of what will happen if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in King v Burwell cutting off Obamacares tax credits in roughly twothirds of the states Without that financial assistance most of the people now buying insurance through healthcaregov the online marketplace run by the federal government wouldnt be able to pay for their coverage anymore  A ruling wouldnt affect people living in states like California and Kentucky which operate their own insurance marketplaces But the results in the rest of the country would be dramatic and visible More than 8 million people would end up uninsured according to estimates by the nonpartisan Urban Institute Economic disarray would follow as panicked insurance companies hiked premiums and pulled out of markets suddenly bereft of customersWhat the experts cant say is how people would feel about such a shock because its hard to think of a time when government took away benefits from so many people across such a large swath of the country within such a short time There just isnt a great historical analogue for predicting how people would react  or for that matter how that reaction would affect politics Even veteran strategists seem stumped  But one recent episode may offer some clues It comes ironically enough from Obamacares own history  In the fall of 2013 insurance companies canceled coverage for millions of Americans either because the old policies werent up to Obamacares standards or because the insurers decided the old policies were no longer profitable to sell The cancellations surprised most Americans not least because President Barack Obama had famously promised that people who liked their old insurance plans could keep them You couldnt turn on the television without hearing from somebody dismayed angry or scared about what was happening Looking back at 2013 its hard to remember a time when for better or worse a change in domestic policy created so much turmoil  The differences between 2013 and a potential Supreme Court decision are large enough to make direct comparisons impossible Thats particularly true when it comes to figuring out who an angry public would hold responsible this time around The courts conservative majority for issuing such a decision Republicans for backing this case and trying to take away peoples insurance Obama and the Democrats for creating the law in the first place  But if the 2013 controversy doesnt indicate much about the shape of a reaction to a Supreme Court reaction it may say something about the scale  and why the intensity of reaction this time whatever its direction is likely to be even larger than it was last time  One reason for this is the raw numbers involved Nobody knows exactly how many policies insurance companies actually canceled in the fall of 2013 At one point The Associated Press compiled an estimate based on reports from state insurance officials suggesting that the number was close to 5 million But subsequent estimates suggested that number was far too high One of the most thorough examinations available came from Lisa ClemansCope and Nathaniel Anderson at the Urban Institute They concluded that cancellations probably numbered around 26 million Jon Gabel from the University of Chicago came up with an even smaller number 19 millionYou shouldnt take either figure as gospel In both cases the scholars in effect juxtaposed survey data with estimates of the number of people with nongroup insurance which itself has been difficult for experts to measure But even if the Urban Institute and Gabel estimates are low by a million or two  which would be a huge error  itd still be far less than the 77 million who would instantly lose insurance from an adverse ruling in King v Burwell  to say nothing of the millions more who would have to pay higher premiums in the future because state insurance markets would be in such trouble  And the people who got cancellation notices last time didnt necessarily end up in worse shape On the contrary a large percentage of the people with canceled policies became eligible either for Medicaid which is basically free or subsidized insurance which cost much less than the old unsubsidized policies Exactly how many has been difficult to pin down because the data on what people were paying before the change  and what they were getting for that money  is so spotty But some of the best information available comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation which surveyed people buying coverage in the new markets Fortysix percent of respondents whod lost noncompliant plans said they had found new policies that cost less while another 15 percent said they found new policies that cost roughly the same Just 39 percent  a significant fraction but still a minority  ended up paying moreBy contrast if the Supreme Court yanks tax credits in the states using healthcaregov then 100 percent of the people who were receiving that assistance will see their premiums go up The increases will not be small Calculations from the Kaiser Foundation suggest that for people who now rely on tax credits premiums would rise on average by 268 each month  enough again to make the cost of maintaining coverage prohibitiveAnd that ultimately is the biggest difference between the 2013 cancellations and what would happen this summer if the court strikes down subsidies in the healthcaregov states Two years ago if you were one of those people who lost your coverage you were still able to find an alternative And thanks to the laws regulations  yes the same ones that sometimes made coverage more expensive  you at least knew that your new policy was comprehensive It had to include all essential benefits including mental health and prescription coverage And it had to limit your outofpocket expenses This summer if the Supreme Court takes away your coverage youll end up with  nothing Just like that youll go from the ranks of the safely insured to the ranks of the uninsured  a far more drastic and hazardous transition than people experienced because of plan cancellations in 2013To be clear forcing millions of people to change insurance policies back then was plenty disruptive far more so than the laws advocates realized it would be But that disruption was part of a transition to a new environment for health insurance  one in which more people had coverage and those with coverage were more secure By contrast the considerably greater disruptions from a Supreme Court decision eliminating tax credits would signal a return to the preObamacare status quo  an environment in which many fewer people had insurance and those with coverage couldnt be as confident it would pay for their needs   Such a transformation could be a nightmare for whichever politicians the public holds responsible  to say nothing of the people who suddenly find themselves with no way to pay their medical bills
