The last Texas Republican to occupy the Oval Office George W Bush took 49 percent of the states Hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential reelection setting a relatively high bar for the handful of Texasborn or raised Republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016Republican presidential aspirants with ties to the Lone Star Statemust figure out how to hold the GOP base and attract conservative Hispanics if they want to be successful in Texas political observers saySo how do the partys four most prominent Texas affiliated mightbe candidates  former GovRick Perry Jeb Bush the son and brother of two former presidents from the state Texas junior US senatorTed Cruz andUS Sen Rand Paul of Kentucky  stack up in the early goingFor Republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012 when presidential nominee Mitt Romney took only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into Hispanic communities and truly connect with voters said Hector De Leon cochairman of theAssociated Republicans of Texas which reaches out to Hispanic votersIts all about paying attention De Leon saidHispanics made up10 percentof the nationalelectorate in the 2012 presidential election But in Texas they make upalmost onethirdof eligible voters And theres plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout Only 39 percent of Texas Hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012Political observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of George W Bushs playbook on Hispanic outreach Hesolidified hiswinning recordwith Hispanics with help fromLatinomedia guruLionel Sosawho told The Texas Tribune he has been in talks with Jeb Bush about his possible presidential bidSosa helped George W Bushs campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood Hispanic cultureThe candidate who can mobilize onthefence Hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the stateI do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency said Sylvia Manzano a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions In Texas thats 10 million people Thats a number that cannot be ignoredThough its still early in the game many political observers say Jeb Bush is best positioned at the moment He grew up in Midland spent much of his childhood in Houston and is consideredfriendlyto the Hispanic community both personally and politicallyJeb Bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics Manzano said He knows better than thatBut this far out all is speculation As the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate heres how several political experts handicap the fieldAlreadyholding a political advantagebecause he is fluent in Spanish the former Florida governor has experience winning over Hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population During his1998 reelection campaign Bush won an impressive 61 percent of Floridas Hispanic electorate Its worth noting though that Floridas mostly Cuban Hispanic population differs from Texas where a majority of Hispanics have roots in MexicoWhat the experts sayFor Bush reaching out to Texas Hispanics would be an extended family affair Aside from benefiting from thegroundworkhis family has done in the state expect to see Bush campaigning with his Mexicanborn wife Columba and his son Texas Land CommissionerGeorge P Bush at his side George Pis also fluent in Spanish and helped found Hispanic Republicans of Texas a political group that recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for public officeBushs record on issues that resonate with Texas Hispanics particularly immigration reform could prove attractive to this voting group He has urged Congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as akey issuein helping Republicans win Hispanics He also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an act of love for their familiesAs the states longestserving governor Perry has long courted Texas Hispanics He has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the Hispanic vote when he defeated Hispanic businessman Tony Sanchez of Laredo in 2002 By the time he was reelected in 2010 Perry pulled in 38 percent of Hispanic votersWhat the experts sayPerrys efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the Texas Dream Act during his 14year tenure Though the future of the law granting instate tuition to some undocumented immigrants isunclear Perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home During a 2011 presidential debate Perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart More recently as the states new GOP leadership works to overturn the law Perry has been vocal about hiscontinued supportfor itBecause hepresided overthe states economic boom in the last decade Perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to Hispanics on economic issues If Perry can convince Hispanic voters that they benefited from the socalled Texas Miracle he may be able to sway some onthefence voters his wayThough he is the only Hispanic in the group  and the first Hispanic senator from Texas  Cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his fathers journey to the United States from Cuban as an exile in 1957 Still he has done well with Texas Hispanics In 2012 he outperformed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney taking 35 percent of the Hispanic vote according to a Latino DecisionspollWhat the experts sayCruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting Texas Hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care He has been vocal in his opposition to President Obamas executive order on immigration which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings The order is widely popular among Hispanics On health care Cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal Affordable Care Act Texas Hispanics  who make up a large portion of the states uninsured population overwhelmingly supportthe health lawThough Paul was elected to the Senate from Kentucky where Hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population he grew up in Lake Jackson Texas where Hispanics are onefifth of the population Paul has spent the last few months preaching amessage of Hispanic inclusionwithin the Republican ranksWhat the experts sayPaul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to Texas Hispanics because of his views on growing the GOPs number of Hispanic supporters Because he is largely unknown among Texas Hispanics Paul also has some room to improve his standing A November 2014 poll by Latino Decisions found that almost a third of Texas Latino voters have no opinion of Paul
