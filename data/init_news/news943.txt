If youre looking to stop Trump history wont be providing you with any roadmapsLets say youre a Republican who is looking with abject terror at the thought of a Donald Trump nomination You look at poll numbers from upcoming statesTrump by six Trump by eight You read and hear about vectors and glide paths and you start looking for reassurance that its still early that the last shall be first Examples abound in sportsdidnt the Red Sox trail the Yankees 30 in the 2004 League Championship Series Werent the New York Giants 13 12 games out of first in 1951 Surely there are cases where a doomed candidate turned the campaign around rightWellsort of There are any number of primary campaigns that saw a significant shift of fortunes but they provide cold comfort for the antiTrumpeteers Why Because 1 they happened a relatively long time ago 2 they all happened in twocandidate races and 3 none of them resulted in a victory for the comefrom behind candidateWhen President Gerald Ford barely beat exCalifornia Governor Ronald Reagan in New Hampshire in 1976 it might have been seen as a strong showing against a sitting President But because the Reagan campaign had touted his strength there the close finish was portrayed as a loss When Ford won the next four primaries including a landslide win in Illinois Reagans challenge was on lifesupportIn North Carolina however a combination of Senator Jesse Helms organizational muscle and a halfhour TV speech centered on foreign policy gave Reagan a victory that kept his campaign alive Over the next 10 weeks Reagan won 10 primaries turning the fight into a delegatebydelegate battle In the end the power of incumbency and a lastminute flip by the Mississippi delegation on a crucial rules fight gave the nomination to Ford We have not seen a genuinely contested nomination fight sinceOf the first ten contests he won only his native Massachusetts With polls showing him headed to a big loss in New York his campaign prepared to fold its tents But the polls were wrong Kennedy won the state by an 18point landslide That gave his campaign enough energy to keep the fight going all the way through the primarieshe won California New Jersey and seven other statesand the convention He was never able to close the gap but with more than a third of the delegates Kennedy was able to win platform concessions and a muchcelebrated primetime speech He was also able intentionally or not to subject Carter to the humiliation of pursuing him at the rostrum in an attempt to stage a handsclasped unity photo opportunityFew campaigns have seen more twists and turns than the 1984 Democratic primary What began as a ceremonial coronation of former Vice President Walter Mondale was upended with no advance warning when Senator Gary Hart and his new ideas campaign won a landslide in New Hampshire He followed that with five wins in the next two weeks only Mondale victories in Georgia and Alabama with crucial margins provided by black voters kept him afloatThen a triedandtrue pattern  rise scrutiny declinekicked in Hart unlike Reagan and Kennedy was a relatively unknown political commodity When the spotlight turned on him questions great and small arose Why had his changed his name from Hartpence Why was his real age a mystery More seriously did the core of the Democratic Party freely want to nominate a figure who regularly challenged liberal orthodoxy Were not a bunch of little Hubert Humphreys he once said to a party that revered Humphreys liberal passionsWith bigcity Democrats labor and AfricanAmericans rallying to his side Mondale won Illinois and then New York by a landslide Once again the nomination seemed to be in Mondales grasp But Hart then won a string of primaries in May and in June beat Mondale in California Preprimary polls also showed Hart with a big lead in New Jersey But when he told a California audience by telephone that he was consigned to a toxic waste dump in New Jersey Garden State Democrats responded by giving Mondale a 16 point win But for that careless comment Hart might well have turned the convention into a genuine battleThat was more than thirty years ago And in the decades since theres been nothing like a sharp turn of fortune in any nominating contest There have been early challenges to favorites there has been at least one caseClinton in 1992where it took a month or so for the ultimate nominee to win his first primary There have been years2008 for Democrats 2012 for Republicanswhen it took months for the nominee to claim enough delegates to end the contest Moreover theres no historical parallel to todays Republican race Far from being an unknown commodity like Hart in 1984 Trump is better known than any of his rivals And given that what he has handily survived it is hard to imagine what he might say or do that could properly be described as selfdestructiveThis doesnt mean a Trump nomination is a done deal With a majority of the party still opposing him a twoperson race offers a theoretical possibility There may be enough left of traditional Republicans that a unified chorus proclaiming Trump a disaster could prove effective But if youre a Republican looking to find a clue to derailing Trump history is not going to offer you anything like a roadmap
