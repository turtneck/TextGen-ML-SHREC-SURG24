Donald Trump would not commit Wednesday night to accepting the results of the presidential election if he loses on Nov 8 in a striking moment during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that underscored the deepening tensions in the race  as the bitter rivals defined the choice for voters on an array of issues not three weeks from Election DayThe debate in Las Vegas moderated by Fox News Chris Wallace started with a measured discussion on policy disputes ranging from gun rights to abortion to immigration But it ended with the candidates hurling a grabbag of accusations and insults at each otherTrump called Clinton a nasty woman Clinton called Trump the most dangerous person to run for president in modern historyThe most pointed moment came when Trump  who for weeks has warned of a rigged election  was asked whether he will commit to accept the results of the electionI will look at it at the time Trump said citing his concerns about voter registration fraud a corrupt media and an opponent he claimed shouldnt be allowed to run because she committed a very serious crime with her emailsPressed again whether hes prepared to concede if he loses Trump again said I will tell you at the time Ill keep you in suspenseThat is not the way our democracy works she said He is denigrating hes talking down our democracy and I for one am appalledTrump responded by calling the Justice Departments handling of her email probe disgracefulThe exchange was among many contentious moments at Wednesdays debate which covered several issues including the national debt that have gotten little attention in the race so far  but flared with arguments between the candidates over WikiLeaks over Russia over the Clinton Foundation and over womens allegations of groping against TrumpThrough the thicket of accusations and personal animus  they never shook hands on stage  the candidates tried generally to mount a closing debatestage argument about experienceFor 30 years youve been in a position to help  The problem is you talk but you dont get anything done Hillary Trump said If you become president this country is going to be in some mess believe meClinton countered by contrasting some of her experiences against Trumps She said when she was monitoring the Usama bin Laden raid in the Situation Room He was hosting The Celebrity ApprenticeIm happy to compare my 30 years of experience  with your 30 years and I will let the American people make that decision Clinton saidTrump meanwhile again disputed the multiple allegations of groping that women have leveled against him since the candidates last encounter He also said he thinks the Clinton campaign is behind the claims charging They either want fame or her campaign did itClinton said Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger Trump repeated that nobody has more respect for women than himTrump then shifted to blast the Clinton Foundation as a criminal enterprise He pointed to donations from countries like Saudi Arabia to question Clintons commitment to womens rights He asked her if she would return money from countries that treat certain groups of people horribly which she did not answer directlyThe candidates third and final debate now sets a bitter tone for the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign  a race that already stands out as arguably the most personal caustic and unpredictable White House battle in modern politicsTrump slipping in the polls amid various campaign controversies said at the last debate that Clinton should be in jail Clinton has blasted Trump all along as temperamentally unfit for officeSince the second debate numerous women have come forward to accuse Trump of groping them allegations he denies WikiLeaks also has embarrassed the Clinton campaign by releasing thousands of hacked emails purportedly from her campaign chairmans account FBI files alleging a State Department official sought a quid pro quo to alter the classification on a Clinton server email added to the campaigns  and Obama administrations  woesThe WikiLeaks controversy came up Wednesday night when Clinton asked if Trump would condemn Russian espionage He denied knowing Vladimir Putin but said the issue is the Russian president has no respect for herThats because hed rather have a puppet Clinton shot backTrump later said he condemns any interference by Russia in the electionThe candidates also sparred over gun rights with the Republican nominee charging that the Second Amendment is under absolute siege and would be eroded if his opponent winsWe will have a Second Amendment which will be a very very small replica of what we have now if Clinton wins Trump saidThe Democratic nominee countered I support the Second AmendmentIn a graphic exchange Trump said Clintons position on abortion is nearing a point where one could rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month Clinton accused him of scare rhetoricThey also clashed on immigration with Trump saying they need to deport drug lords and deal with bad hombres in the country Clinton said violent offenders should be deported but then mocked Trump for not pushing his controversial border wall proposal during his highprofile meeting with the Mexican president He choked she saidTrump said Clinton wanted a wall when she voted for an immigration overhaul a decade ago  and now wants open borders which she deniedTo date the mounting controversies facing both campaigns have appeared to hurt Trump more than Clinton who gradually has expanded her lead over the GOP nominee in recent pollsA Fox News national poll released on the eve of the Las Vegas debate showed Clinton with a 6point 4539 percent lead over Trump in a matchup that includes Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill SteinTrump in the final three weeks is thought to be zeroing in on several key battlegrounds including Florida Ohio and North Carolina  but the polls suggest his path to the presidency remains narrow as even oncereliably red states like Texas are being contested by the Clinton campaign
