Editors note The following column appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHillcomBlackLivesMatter is fast becoming its own worst enemyIt lacks an agenda it is antagonizing the black communitys top white political allies including Democrats running for the partys 2016 presidential nomination and it is not finding common ground with any of the Republican majority in CongressThe catalyst for the movement was outrage over the deaths of young black men like Freddie Gray Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police officers who arguably used excessive even deadly force But where is the list of solutions to the injustices it so often decriesThe movements failure to get its collective act together carries real danger for the political clout of the AfricanAmerican community in the 2016 elections and beyondWith the movement potentially discouraging black American trust in Democrats BlackLivesMatter is increasing the odds of a sharp drop in black voter turnout in 2016 Already Democrats privately worry that without President Obama on the ballot the black vote will decrease the turnout needed to keep the White House and win back the SenateThat is more likely to happen if black voters get caught up in the anger that the BlackLives movement has directed at the political structure The potential absence of black voters who have become discouraged  about a quarter of the nations Democrats  would be more devastating than any Republican plan to require voter identification reduce the number of polling places in black neighborhoods or cut back on early votingWhen BlackLives activists denounce the Democratic National Committee for issuing a resolution in support of police reform they are hurting themselves with party officials When they say that all political parties try to control or contain black liberation they are also damaging faith in the political system especially among young peopleWhen they interrupt Democrats running for the presidential nomination such as Bernie Sanders and Martin OMalley they are alienating longtime political allies and their supporters When they videotape Hillary Clinton after she generously agrees to meet with them privately  in an apparent attempt to embarrass her  they are distancing themselves from the likely Democratic nominee And imagine how local and state officials will react now to any request for a meeting with the groupMeanwhile they are not finding common cause with Latinos even as immigrants are being attacked by the Republican candidates for the presidential election Have you seen BlackLives interrupting Donald Trumps events Where is the outreach to RepublicansSen Rand Paul RKy is one the most outspoken leaders in either political party on the racial inequities of prison reform I see an America where criminal justice is applied equally and any law that disproportionately incarcerates people of color is repealed he said in his announcement speech If change is the goal where is the alliance with the senatorNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie a former federal prosecutor has declared on the campaign trail that the war on drugs has been a failure He told an audience last month everyone makes mistakes and that society needs to reach out and embrace those people and say If youre not a violent offender if youre not dealing drugs to our children we need to get you treatment rather than prison Earlier this year the Brennan Center for Law and Justice published a collection of essays highlighting the bipartisan consensus among national politicians that there is a need for sentencing reform called Solutions American Leaders speak out on Criminal Justice Clinton OMalley Paul Christie and fellow presidential candidates Jim Webb Ted Cruz Mike Huckabee Scott Walker and Marco Rubio each penned essays for the Brennan Center on the need for reformAnd its not just those running for the Oval Office  leading congressional Republicans like Speaker John Boehner ROhio Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley RIowa and Tea Party favorite Sen Mike Lee RUtah have all endorsed proposals to relax the federal sentencing laws Grassley has said he wants to move on a bill this year to do just thatA bipartisan bill the Safe Accountable Fair and Effective SAFE Justice Act authored by Republican Rep Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Democratic Rep Bobby Scott of Virginia has about threedozen bipartisan cosponsors in the House already If BlackLivesMatter protesters were chanting Pass the SAFE Justice Act now they could find themselves in position to make significant change Somehow they are blind to the opportunityIt has been said that politicians see the light once they feel the heat If only the energy and passion of BlackLivesMatter protesters could be harnessed in something constructive rather than destructiveLobby Congress hold voter registration drives quiz candidates on their plan for sentencing reform but dont heckle the candidates and incite violence by calling for copkilling The movement could be critical to securing and mobilizing black support for criminal justice reform that actually would improve black livesI am reminded of something my father who trained boxers once told meHe said even the best fighters know fear is like fire It can cook your food and light your home It can also burn your house down and kill you The key to controlling fear or fire is turning it to a constructive purposeNow if only BlackLivesMatter will harness its own fire into the urgent cause of criminal justice reformJuan Williams is a cohost of FNCs The Five where
