at a Los Angeles press conference by attorney Gloria Allred said she was later offered a lowerpaying job at a Trump golf courseYou do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star Zervos said at the press conference addressing TrumpLate Friday the Trump campaign released a statement purporting to be from statement in which a cousin of Zervos said he was shocked and bewildered by her accountJohn Barry of Mission Viejo Calif said in the statement that Zervos spoke glowingly of Trump until the real estate mogul rebuffed an invitation to visit her restaurant during the primary campaignI think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV and in an effort to get that back shes saying all of these negative things about Mr Trump Barry said Thats not how she talked about him beforeTrump himself issued a statement saying thathe never met Zervos at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago That is not who I am as a person and it is not how Ive conducted my life He added that Zervos had emailed Trumps office this past April 14 to ask if he could visit her restaurant in CaliforniaAllred who frequently represents women bringing sexual harassment and assault claims said many more women have contacted her regarding the Republican nominee after a video emerged of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005  comments Trump apologized for but dismissed as locker room talkAllred said Zervos is not filing a suit at this timeEarlier FridayThe Washington Postreported on a womans claim that Trump put his hand up her skirt and groped her at a Manhattan nightspot in the early 90sAccording to the PostKristin Anderson claimed that while she was at the Manhattan nightspot in the early 1990s Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt and fondled herCampaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks called Andersons claim a total fabrication She said in a statement It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in ManhattanThe new allegations capped a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Trump who has faced a daily dripdrip of allegations even as he has tried to focus on Bill Clintons female accusers  and the massive leak of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaksAs Zervos was making her accusations Friday Trump was at a rally in Greensboro NC rejecting all the allegations against him as total fictionI have no idea who these women are Trump said The stories are total fiction Theyre 100 percent made upHe continued to expand on his argument that the claims are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he calls the corrupt media  in particular the New York Times which kickstarted the reports of sexual misconduct earlier this week Trump previously threatened to sue the Times over allegations they published from two women who claim Trump groped themOn Friday Trump went after the Times again suggesting the reporters were acting at the behest of billionaire Carlos Slim the largest shareholder in the TimesNow Carlos Slim as you know comes from Mexico Hes given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives Trump said Reporters at The New York Times theyre not journalists Theyre corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary ClintonTrump then claimed the controversy was a total setup consisting of lies spread by the media as a way to undermine his campaign He went so far as to mock his accusers making fun of one who told the Times he groped her on an airplane in the early 1980sThe only way they can figure they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say Oh I was with Donald Trump in 1980 he said putting on a voice mocking his accusers I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane Yeah Im gonna go after youBelieve me he added She would not be my first choice I can tell youOne of the accusers who came forward earlier this week Mindy McGillivray of Palm Springs Fla told the Palm Beach Post Friday that she was planning to leave the United States because she feared for her familys safety She told the paper cars had been driving around her houseAs Trump ratched up his
