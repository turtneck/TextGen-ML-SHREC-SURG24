Watch the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday at 830 pm ET live on CNN and CNNgo  join the conversation at DemDebateWashington CNN The shadow boxing that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have played at for months  theyve barely mentioned each other on the campaign trail  will give way to more direct jabs Tuesday nightThats when the two rivals line up on stage at the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign sponsored by CNN and Facebook The encounter will provide a crucial opportunity for Clinton and Sanders  the leading Democratic contenders  to contrast their personalities experience and approach to the key issues in the campaignThough Clinton and Sanders have rarely mentioned each others names they are clearly reacting to each other and their rivals potential weaknesses Sanders took aim at Clintons Wall Street record and Iraq vote over the weekend she put him on the defensive on guns and his poor standing with minority votersUntil now they have each had good reason for avoiding full contact with the other Clinton hasnt wanted to elevate Sanders and his surprisingly strong poll numbers while Sanders has wanted to maintain his untraditional abovethefray imageOn Tuesday that calculus will change And the distinctions theyve subtly staked out on a range of issues are only likely to grow sharperIn the weeks leading up to the debate in Las Vegas the two Democrats have been carefully finessing their political positions in relation to each other and their partys wide coalition offering clues about how they will spar Tuesday nightSanders has been signaling he will try to strike a contrast with Clinton on reining in Wall Street and on her record of support for military interventions overseas The former secretary of state meanwhile is under pressure to prove to progressives who have flocked to Sanders that she genuinely cares about the middle class Shes expected to highlight her differences with her rival on gun control and to demonstrate the broad support she has among minority voters  a key sector of the Democratic coalition where Sanders is strugglingAs he limbered up for their clash Sanders threw down the gauntlet on the Iraq War  a thrust that Clinton has struggled to counter in the past  hinting that she has hawkish views that are out of step with the majority of Democratic votersHis campaign issued a statement reminding voters that he then a member of the House of Representatives voted against authorizing the Iraq war in late 2002 At the time he argued that the conflict would destabilize the Middle East kill large numbers of Americans and Iraqi civilians and hamper the war on terror against al QaedaThe statement did not once mention Clinton  but it did not have to The thenNew York senator did vote to authorize the Iraq war and that vote was one of her greatest vulnerabilities in the 2008 Democratic campaign against Obama who also opposed the warThe Sanders statement raised the possibility that Clintons vote could haunt her for a second presidential campaignDemocrats are no more fond of the Iraq war now than they were back then That could be a problem Peter Beinart a foreign policy expert and CNN contributor said Monday He added that another Democratic candidate former Virginia senator and Vietnam war veteran Jim Webb who was also against the war could doubleteam with Sanders to cause trouble for Clinton on the issueSanders has also been staking out territory to Clintons left on Syria The former secretary of state recently distanced herself from Obamas muchcriticized policy on the vicious civil war by calling for a nofly zone to be set up to shield refugeesSanders issued a statement earlier this month pointing out that he opposes such an idea warning that it could get us more deeply involved in that horrible civil war and lead to a never ending entanglement in that regionThe statement appeared to be a clear appeal to Democrats who share Obamas antipathy toward getting the United States entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict and who are wary of Clintons more activist instincts on foreign policySanders is not alone in seeing Clintons foreign policy record as a vulnerability Another Democratic candidate former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley also picked up on her Syria position Sunday  saying on CNNs State of the Union that a nofly zone was not advisable and warning that the former secretary of state was always quick for the military intervention apparently referring to her previous support for military action in nations such as Iraq and LibyaAnother area where Sanders seems more in tune with the progressive Democratic base is on Wall Street especially since he has raised most of his money from small donors  unlike the former secretary of state who has been relying on big budget fundraising events with rich contributors Even with his smalldonor focus Sanders is nearly neckandneck in the fundraising race with ClintonClinton has made strenuous attempts to connect with what her campaign has called regular Americans stressing the need to raise up the middle class to feel the benefits of the economic recovery But Sanders has said that she hasnt done enough an argument he may expand upon on the debate stagePeople will have to contrast my consistency and my willingness to stand up to Wall Street and corporations with the secretary Sanders said on NBCs Meet the Press on SundayThe Vermont senator also will likely draw an implied contrast with Clinton on two other issues  the TransPacific Partnership trade pact the United States and 11 other nations reached this month and the Keystone XL pipeline designed to carry oil from Canadas tar sands across the United StatesClinton now says she is a no on both issues but she took months to get there  despite fervent opposition to both projects from the left flank of the Democratic PartyI am glad that she has reached that conclusion said Sanders in Washington last week when asked about Clintons opposition to a trade agreement she championed repeatedly as secretary of state This is a conclusion that I reached from day oneYet Sanders is not alone in curating the battlefield for the Democratic debate Clinton while getting in line with progressive Democratic positions on big issues has also been preparing to strike key contrasts with SandersGuns are one policy issue where Sanders is not completely in sync with the Democratic base so Clinton is likely to exploit it on Tuesday nightShe has been promising a forthright effort to enact new gun control laws after a string of recent mass shootings It partly seems to be an attempt to focus attention her rivals record on guns which recently saw him express his openness to reforms that would hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed with their weaponsClinton has also spent the runup to the debate cementing her links to key voting blocs of the Democratic coalition  especially in sectors of the party where Sanders is weak She can point to broad appeal in the party which could be key to eventually blunting the challenge from Sanders after earlyvoting contests in the less diverse states of Iowa and New Hampshire where he is strongIn recent weeks Clinton has met representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement and has even criticized Obama for not going far enough in changing immigration lawsHillary has done a lot of work leading up to this debate that has pretty much gone unnoticed Patti Solis Doyle Clintons 2008 campaign manager said on CNN on MondayShes rolled out Latinos for Hillary she has rolled out Women for Hillary she has met with the leadership of Black Lives Matter she has checked a lot of boxes walking into this debate she noted I think she is going to display tomorrow night Tuesday her vast support among this coalitionThe challenge that Sanders faces reaching out to minority voters who are a vital part of the Democratic Party voting bloc was underscored by a new CNN poll Monday finding that only 1 of nonwhite voters in the important early voting state of South Carolina favor himThat is a showing that Sanders must improve on if he is to come from behind and beat Clinton for the nomination
