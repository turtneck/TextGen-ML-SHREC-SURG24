The drone strike that US officials believe killed Jihadi John the Islamic State executioner whose beheading of Western hostages came to symbolize the militants brutality appeared this week as a rare success in the struggling US campaign against the groupMore than a military feat the death of the Islamic States most wellknown spokesman if confirmed would be a step forward in the US effort to counter the groups sophisticated socialmedia operations and to up the ante in a twoway propaganda warSpeaking the day after the strike in Raqqa the Islamic States de facto capital in Syria US military officials said they were reasonably certain that the two Hellfire missiles fired from an American MQ9 Reaper drone late Thursday killed the British militant whose real name is Mohammed Emwazi and a second individualArmy Col Steven Warren a US military spokesman did not give details about why military officials were confident that Emwazi 27 was dead but he said the drone strike was carried out as plannedWarren said officials were now working to definitively establish that Emwazi was killed His death would be a blow to the Islamic States public image Warren said even if Emwazi was not a top operational commander This guy was a human animal he saidIn London British Prime Minister David Cameron lauded the operation which he described as a combined effort between US and British forces If this strike was successful and we still await confirmation of that it will be a strike at the heart of ISIL he said using an acronym for the Islamic StateA senior US defense official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters said three drones took part in the operation one of them British An American plane conducted the strikeIn a statement at 10 Downing Street Cameron described Emwazi as a barbaric murderer who was the Islamic States lead executionerThis was an act of selfdefense It was the right thing to do he saidUS officials said the car believed to have been carrying Emwazi and another person pulled up at a two or threestory building a business around 11 pm local time Thursday Emwazi went inside the building for a short time came out and got back in the car At that moment the American missiles destroyed the vehicleThe Syrian activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently which monitors events in the city reported that a drone strike targeted a car near the Islamic court in downtown Raqqa shortly before midnight It was among a dozen blasts heard during an intense wave of airstrikes the group said on its Twitter feedEmwazi appeared in a video in August 2014 as the unknown masked man with an English accent who beheaded American journalist James FoleyEmwazi subsequently beheaded Steven Sotloff another American journalist and appeared in a video in which American aid worker AbdulRahman Kassig was decapitated He also killed David Haines and Alan Henning both British aid workers and Japanese journalist Kenji GotoIt is a very small solace to learn that Jihadi John may have been killed by the US government Foleys parents John and Diane Foley said in a statement His death does not bring Jim back If only so much effort had been given to finding and rescuing Jim and the other hostages who were subsequently murdered by ISIS they might be alive todayArt and Shirley Sotloff the parents of Steven Sotloff said Emwazis death would change nothing for them Its too little too late Our son is never coming back they said More importantly today we remember Stevens remarkable life his contributions and others who have suffered at the hands of ISISThe Obama administration attempted to rescue the Americans during the summer of 2014 when Delta Force commandos stormed a prison where they were thought to be held Officials later concluded that the prisoners had been moved days before the raidUS officials have said that confirmation of Emwazis death will probably require information gleaned from intercepted militant communications They say it is probably impossible to obtain a DNA sample making it more difficult to establish his death conclusivelyWe could potentially never know with certainty another defense official saidThe moment Jihadi John may have become a terroristEmwazi is the bestknown militant the United States has killed in more than a year of airstrikes against the group in Iraq and SyriaEmwazi was born in Kuwait but grew up in London He studied computer programming before gradually becoming radicalized In 2010 British authorities detained Emwazi and barred him from leaving the country He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and later joined the Islamic StateEmwazi was one of a group of Englishspeaking militants that former hostages dubbed the Beatles Those former prisoners described Emwazi as a frequently brutal captor who took part in waterboardings and beatings Its not clear if one of the socalled Beatles was the other passenger in the destroyed carWhile the stature of Emwazi and his fellow Englishspeaking militants was enhanced by the propaganda effect of the execution videos which drew intense international attention his operational influence was limitedPeter Neumann director of Kings Colleges International Center for the Study of Radicalization said Emwazi was a lowranking officer Symbolically Neumann said his death would show that the Islamic State is reeling which could undercut recruitmentIt feeds into the narrative of ISIS in its core territory losing he saidWhile the Obama administration has said it has contained the expansion of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria local forces have been unable to dislodge militants from important cities At the same time Islamic State affiliates have spread across the regionFaysal Itani a Middle East expert at the Atlantic Council a Washington think tank cautioned that the Islamic State still counts on substantial support in the regionKilling a highprofile propagandist is in itself a significant propaganda win Itani said But this organization is extremely adaptable and so long as it has access to an aggrieved Sunni population will always reemerge in one way or anotherWitte reported from
