Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and nongamechanging to happen Adding a bit over 200000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boomDive deeper into the data and the basic lack of surprises only continues Labor force participation is up but only very slightly Hourly wages are up but only very slightlyTheres nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserves mind about anything and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction Those who think the Feds current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that Those who more correctly think the Feds current course is unreasonably inflationaverse will keep thinking that as well Janet Yellen will keep thinking shes on the right trackWage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession but far below what was considered normal before the recession Partially offsetting this overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20somethings have been entering the workforceOverall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout Even the strongest wagegrowth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007 years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American workerPerhaps the clearest sign of how notyetcompleted Americas recovery comes from looking at the level of fulltime jobs which is still well below where it was in 2007The population needless to say has grown in the intervening years meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rankandfile workers to gain bargaining leverage
