Donald Trump has dominated theGOP presidential race for seven months Nothing  not his many offensive comments not his mediocre debate performances and not the oncefeared GOP establishment  has been able to stop his riseBut on February 1 all that could change when Trump faces by far his biggest challenge yetthe Iowa caucusesThe results in Iowa  the first time a states actual voters weigh in in the presidential nomination contest  can make the national contest turn on a dime Barack Obama won Iowa in 2008 and he suddenly shot up to become competitive with Hillary Clinton in national polls John Kerry came out of nowhere to win Iowa in 2004 and the presumed leader Howard Deancollapsed with astonishing speedAnd Trump could be vulnerable in Iowa Hehas taken the lead in recent polls but there have been anecdotal reports suggesting that Trumps ground game  crucial in the lowturnout caucuses  is laughably inferior toTed Cruzs So in the first contest that really counts Trump could end up a loser Yet if he manages to pull off a win  watch outBut lets step back for a minute and askWhy do the quirky Iowa caucuses have this tremendous impact on the race anywayWhat is the difference between first place and third place in Iowa going to be 4000 votes Its like a student body electionThe state is small Its population is overwhelmingly white Turnout for the caucuses is absurdly low Democrats dont even get a secret ballot And vanishingly few of the delegates who will actually determine each partys nominee at the national conventions will be from Iowa So why do we care so much about who winsAs Ill explain Iowa became super important because we  the media party insiders activists the candidates themselves and even voters to an extent  gradually decided to make it so important These key players think the caucus results reveal a great deal about which candidates can win elections elsewhere and the contest for Iowa isnt really a contest for delegates  its a contest to look good in their eyesBut does Iowas prominence make sense Or could the obsession with its results from the media and insiders alike be a tremendous overreaction bordering on a bizarre mass delusion  one that could end up distorting who gets nominated for presidentWhat is the difference between first place and third place in Iowa going to be4000 votes Its like a student body election says Stuart Stevens who was Mitt Romneys chief strategist in 2012You have to respect the absurdity of it he continues Or itll drive you crazyThe Iowa caucuses are the first time actual voters all across any US state get up and go say who they want to be presidentAnd these voters do literally have to get up and go  to an inperson event held at a specific time in the evening at one of 1681 precincts across the state Theres no absentee voting so if youre bedridden or out of the state youve historically been out of luckThe caucuses are administered separately by each major party and Republicans and Democrats have quite different rules This year the GOP contest is simple After some opening rigmarole at their caucus sites an ordinary secret ballot vote on presidential candidates will be conducted and the totals will be tallied statewideIts kind of like a carnival where the candidates supporters say Come over to usThe Democratic caucuses are far more complicated  theyre rowdy hourslong public affairs with backandforth debate among attendees who have to go physically stand with other supporters of their preferred candidate Its kind of like a carnival where the candidates supporters say Come over to us to our group says Drake University political scientist Dennis GoldfordTheres no secret ballot and if a Democratic candidate doesnt get enough supporters in a precinct 15 percent of attendees he or she is eliminated reality show style Heres a video showing how one precincts caucus went down in 2008Like it or not the Iowa results appear to be hugely important in determining who the major parties presidential nominees will be  particularly when considered alongside the impact of fellow early state New Hampshire Its not remotely a national primary These national polls mean nothing The nation isnt voting says Stevens Instead its Iowans who get the first sayAnd importantly even if the Iowa victor doesnt end up winning the nomination in the end the states results can dramatically shake up the presidential contest  knocking some candidates out of the race entirely while elevating others to toptier status in the eyes of political elites and future votersYou think about the number of people who participate  usually a little over 100000 people per party meaning around 20 percent of eligible caucusgoers  and Iowa has just an amazing outsize impact on the country says Democratic pollster Stan GreenbergLike you and I the political world is obsessed with the question of who can actually win in each presidential nomination race And a large part of that world has come to believe that the caucus outcomes help shed some important light on that question Remember before Iowa assessments of who can win are mainly based on polls  and polls of course can be wrongIowa has just an amazing outsize impact on the countryIts pretty weird Essentially the Iowa caucuses are important because the media the candidates and the political world more broadly all treat their results as greatly important in determining who can win And this plays out in several interacting waysAll of these dynamics it should be noted also apply to New Hampshire and to a decreasing degree to other states as the process continues The media the candidates political elites and to a certain extent voters elsewhere all act on the signals they believe Iowa and New Hampshire are sending them And thats how these early state contests dramatically reshape the nomination landscape long before the vast majority of the American people get to weigh inThe earliest case in which Iowa changed everything was littleknown former Georgia Gov Jimmy Carters victory in the 1976 Democratic caucuses This was only the second time Iowa went first and Carter calculated that if he won there hed get so much media coverage that hed be catapulted from obscurity to national fame So he essentially camped out in Iowa for a year and his strategy worked like a charm when he wonCarters subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped him narrowly carry New Hampshire and then 11 of the next 12 contests followed by the nomination and the White House Jimmy Carter would say he would never have become president without the Iowa caucuses says Jerry Crawford a longtime Iowa Democratic organizer now working for the Clinton campaignIowa convinced people that Obama was more than just a media phenomenonBarack Obama too relied on Iowa for his first victory for his campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008 On the day of the caucuses he trailed Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points in national polls But days after he won there he shot up to within 5 points of herThe results of Iowa were validating for us says Larry Grisolano who consulted for Obamas campaign that year People became convinced that Obama was more than just a media phenomenon  and that he was a candidate who could attract votesObamas win there made him surge to within striking distance of Clinton in national polls and far above her in another important early contest South Carolina Iowas peculiarities played to his strengths Grisolano adds I dont know how it wouldve turned out if we started in a place that was more advertisingcentricEven when the Iowa winner doesnt end up winning the nomination as with Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum the two most recent GOP winners the caucus results can shake up the race by elevating them rather than other candidates to prominence in the contestThe caucuses are about who exceeds expectations and who fails to And who sets expectations You and I doBut its important to understand that not every candidate is affected equally by the caucuses Iowa matters primarily because of how it changes the perceptions of the political world And candidates are in large part judged by whether their caucus performance meets the expectations of the media and political elitesFor instance in the 2008 GOP caucuses Mitt Romney came in second and John McCain came in fourth Yet Romney was portrayed as a big loser since he had been campaigning hard in Iowa and had once seemed the favorite to win McCain meanwhile hadnt really been trying to win Iowa and was focusing instead on doing well in New Hampshire so his fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted as a stunning setback for himEvery candidate in Iowa has the same opponent and that opponents name is expected says Goldford The caucuses are about who exceeds expectations and who fails to And who sets expectations You and I doEssentially Iowa moved its caucuses to the front of the line at the perfect moment It happened back in 1972 just while the Democratic Party was overhauling its nomination process to give actual voters not just party bosses more of a say Thats how the presidential nomination system we know today  the monthslong sequence of staggered primaries and caucuses in every state and territory  came about Republicans adopted very similar reforms soon afterwardBut for 1972  the first nomination contest under the reformed system  Iowa Democrats slated their usual caucuses for the unusually early date of January 24 People offer various different explanations for why they did so a deliberate effort to help a favorite son who was considering running for president an arcane party rules change that required that 30 days pass between various state and local events or even that a lack of available hotel rooms in Des Moines that summer necessitated an earlier state convention date which then necessitated an earlier caucus dateWhatever the reason the Iowa Democratic caucuses moved ahead of the New Hampshire primary which had traditionally been the nations firstPeople in the political community concluded What happened out there told us somethingAt first few people outside Iowa noticed or cared and the 1972 caucus results got little attention nationally But in retrospect after George McGovern shockingly won the Democratic nomination insiders secondguessing about why they failed to predict his rise concluded that they should have paid more attention when he finished a surprisingly strong second in IowaPeople in the political community concluded What happened out there told us something It told us about a weak frontrunner It told us about the energy of the antiwar movement says David Yepsen a former political reporter for the Des Moines RegisterSavvy Iowans of both parties worked hard to promote this idea that Iowa was an early bellwether Democrats arranged the event so topline results could be easily reported to the national press and Republicans moved their caucuses to the same day to create a unified event that would get lots of media buzz As Tom Whitney then state Democratic chair later told Iowa Public TelevisionSo Carters victories in Iowa and the general election werent just great for him  they ended up being great for Iowa which could now claim to be a kingmaker Future candidates in both parties spent more time and money there and the national press started regularly covering the results as a major event Party insiders and voters in other early states began taking Iowas results more and more seriously tooEver since the state parties have tenaciously and successfully fought to keep their caucuses first helped by the new precedent they had set as Brookings fellow Elaine Kamarck chronicles in her book Primary PoliticsNot at all Many critics including Voxs Dylan Matthews argue that Iowas population is unrepresentative of the country as a whole  the state is much more white and more rural and has fewer foreignborn peopleOthers criticize the caucus setup itself The events take a long time theyre scheduled at a specific time in the evening and theres been no absentee voting in the past all of which depresses turnout and could make it even more unrepresentative Four out of five registered party members in Iowa and the vast majority of independent voters there usually dont show upI think Iowa distorts the process in a good way says an operative in the stateFurthermore Democrats dont even get a secret ballot which means social pressure could skew their results On the GOP side turnout has recently been dominated by evangelical activists many of whom have opted for candidates that lack national appeal like Huckabee and SantorumAnd presidential candidates of both parties have long felt compelled to voice fealty to powerful interest groups in the state like Big Corn though Peverill Squire convincingly argues that procorn policies are mainly driven by Congress not the White HouseFinally it seems just plain unfair to a lot of people in other states that Iowa gets such powerCaucus defenders respond by saying that Iowa does skew the results  positively I think it distorts the process in a good way says Crawford the Hillary Clinton organizer Thats because Iowas a state where retail campaigning and oneonone interactions with voters rather than simply big money and ad buys matter Its voters have shown that they dont just follow the prevailing national winds  theyre more willing to give littleknown and poorly funded challengers a chance which helps ensure a more democratic contest overall Iowas a level playing ground says Iowa GOP operative Eric Woolson And Iowa has an electorate that pays attention to whats going onIn any case every attempt to supplant Iowa has failed because neither national party can agree on who else should be first in line or on an alternative way to do things entirely And states that have tried to jump the line  like Louisiana in 1996  have had their contests boycotted at Iowa pols behest and deemed meaningless by national elites and the pressEventually the national parties accepted that Iowa and New Hampshire were hellbent on going first and second  and that the vast majority of other states didnt care all that much So the parties began harshly penalizing other states that tried to move their own nomination contests too early Accordingly nobody even bothered to try to leapfrog Iowa this time aroundOnce again its the lessons the political world takes away from the caucuses that are really important  not how the delegates end up allotted Everyone is anxious to see how the actual Iowa results measure up to their expectations to help them better understand who can actually win And theyll be looking for a few major thingsIn the GOP contest everyone is anxiously awaiting the answer to one key question Can Donald Trump get people to actually vote for him Because despite Trumps monthslong lead in national polls theres still a great deal of skepticism from elites about him Perhaps polls overstate his support perhaps his campaign doesnt have a good ground game perhaps his supporters who arent regular GOP primary or caucus voters wont bother to show up or perhaps the electorate will flock to a more seemingly electable candidate at the last minuteIf Trump wins Iowa prepare for a media frenzy like youve never seen beforeSince caucus turnout is difficult for pollsters to model and since Ted Cruz is perceived as having a better organization than Trump much of the political world has long expected Trump to finish second behind Cruz Yet Trump has taken the lead inall the most recent polls  which has had the perverse effect of raising expectations for him Now a second place finish would be viewed as a disappointment for him And if he comes in third or worse hell be portrayed as a loser who went down to a pathetic defeat But if he does manage to actually win the caucuses hell debunk much of that skepticism mentioned above prove he wont be vanishing from the contest anytime soon  and unleash a media frenzy like youve never seen beforeThe Iowa results will have big implications for other GOP candidates too Since Ted Cruz led polls there until recently a loss there would be perceived as a serious blow to his candidacy Marco Rubio meanwhile is currently polling in third place so thats where people expect him to end up If Rubio manages to surprise people by placing second or even first hell get a huge amount of positive buzz going into New Hampshire But if he somehow falls further behind  especially if another establishmentfriendly candidate like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie passes him  whispered doubts about his campaigns competence will be vindicated and whoever beats him will have the momentum of media coverage and buzz among elites in the week before the Granite State contest And if some other candidate entirely manages to surge late in Iowa as Rick Santorum did in 2012 expect him or her to be a major player in the next contests tooMeanwhile on the Democratic side Bernie Sanders has suddenly surged in Iowa polls after a full year of trailing Clinton Since hes long been ahead in New Hampshire hes now positioned to seriously compete in both early states But with this comes raised expectations If Clinton wins both contests outright Sanderss movement could well fizzle out and she could wrap up the nomination quickly If Sanders wins either though or even comes very close in Iowa expect a pitched battle between the two that will last quite some time And unless Martin OMalley vastly exceeds his current low singledigit percent support in Iowa expect him to drop out soon afterwardThe nightmare scenario for Clinton at this point  which is not all that implausible  is that Sanders wins both Iowa and New Hampshire If that happens political elites and the press will mercilessly mock and secondguess the Clinton campaign for weeks Yet insiders also understand that both states are heavily white and not representative of the more diverse Democratic electorate overall So the big question is whether the positive coverage Sanders gets will improve his performance among nonwhite Democrats who have seemed uninterested in his candidacy so far  and that will be put to the test in the next contest South CarolinaIts a goofy way to do it I agree But absent a clear alternativeIf you feel like you needed a decoder ring to make sense of all that youre not alone No one sat down and designed our bizarre presidential nomination system  indeed even Iowans admit that no one would ever sit down and design this exact system from scratch Its a goofy way to do it I agree says Yepsen But absent a clear alternative the process continues Candidates keep investing their time and money the media keeps giving saturation coverage to the results and political elites keep on believing that Iowa matters  so Iowa just keeps on matteringThis article was originally published on January 25 2016 It has
