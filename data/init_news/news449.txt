While Donald J Trump refuses to release his federal tax returns saying his tax rate is none of your business a USA TODAY analysis found Trumps businesses have been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses oweTrumps companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s until as recently as March the analysis of court cases property records and other documents across the country shows At least five Trump companies were issued warrants totaling more than 13000 for late or unpaid taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015 according to state records This spring as Trump flew to campaign rallies around the country aboard his trademark private jet the state of New York filed a tax warrant to try to collect 8578 in unpaid taxes from the Trumpowned company that owns the Boeing 757 The company has since paid that tax billAs recently as last week Trump said he was willing to pay more taxes personally and that taxes for the rich will go up somewhat if he becomes president But the lawsuits and other taxrelated disputes show a different reality for his businesses They illustrate a pattern of systematically disputing tax bills arguing for lower property assessments and in some cases not paying taxes until the government takes additional action At least three dozen times Trump companies unpaid tax bills have forced the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance to go to local courts to get liens against his properties to try to collect overdue bills New Jersey also had to go to court for a lien to collect a Trump companys unpaid tax bill Eventually those disputes were resolved and his companies paid some amount of taxesThe disputes surrounding Trumps business taxes are uncharted territory for the presidential nominee of a major party The GOPs 2012 nominee Mitt Romney also had extensive business interests as the leader of a privateequity fund But Trump has a network of complicated real estate and other investments and some of the tax disputes are ongoingTrump has acknowledged that he tries to pay as little taxes as possible and the public records across the country shed light on how he does it In documents rarely seen by the public Trumpsbusinesses regularly minimize the value of his properties for tax purposes

track record as a business taxpayer found not just court actions but dozens of additional tax disputes with local authorities that didnt reach the courthouse in states including New York Nevada Florida and New Jersey In some cases Trumps businesses have disputed tax assessments in others they have simply not paid the tax bill until after the government took additional actionIn New York for example there are dozens of tax warrants against Trump businesses Tax warrants are filed only after the state has exhausted all other options to collect whats owedYou have to ignore us to end up with a tax warrant said Geoff Gloak spokesman for the state Department of Taxation and Finance We try to work with taxpayers to resolve the debt long before it becomes a warrantIf the tax warrant is ignored the state can choose to take the matter to court  and in some cases hasIn addition to the five tax warrants since his announcement there are additional New York state tax warrants dating to the years before Trump became a candidate including 1580 in unpaid taxes in 2010 for Trump Mortgage his failed mortgage venture and 1747 in unpaid taxes in early 2015 against Trump Entrepreneur

business strategyI fight like hell to pay as little as possible he said at a New York news conference announcing his own tax plan in September I fight like hell always because its an expense And you know I feel  and I fightI have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight and I pay But its an expenseTrumps boasts about his wealth have sometimes undercut his attempts to slash his taxes In 1985 Trump scooped up MaraLago the opulent estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in Palm Beach Fla for 10 million bragging in his 1989 book The Art of the Deal that it was a sweet deal worth far more than he paid When the property was assessed at 115 million and later 17 million Trump objected Litigation dragged on until 1993 over the tax billsA settlement hinged on Trump agreeing not to develop the MaraLago land into individual lots said Jay Jacknin outside counsel for Palm Beach Countys appraisals office Last year the county assessed the property at about 20 million  though Trumps federal financial disclosure form values it at more than 50 millionSimilarly just up the road in Jupiter Fla Trump bought the RitzCarlton Golf Club and Spa in 2012 for a reported 5 million then renovated it For the past three years his team has appealed the assessed value of 137million as of 2015 In his financial disclosure forms Trump claims that the course on 285 acres is worth more than

I see people playing there The club looks fabulous It certainly isnt falling into disrepairThe Trump teams lowball valuation follows a pattern similar to other assessment battles His camps estimate appears to be a mere opening bid in a negotiationTrumps attorney Jeff Rodner acknowledges that he is sure the property is worth more than the 14 millionMaybe its worth 12 million maybe 13 million Rodner told The Journal News Now my value is my opinion until its proven otherwiseThe Briarcliff property is among 20 developments on Trumps financial disclosure report that he values at more than 50
