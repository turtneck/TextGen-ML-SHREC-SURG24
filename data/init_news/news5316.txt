In the time since Justice Antonin Scalias passing on Saturday the hardworking folks at The Monkey Cage have already done some yeoman work offering up five separate posts about the politics of it The Volokh Conspiracy not to be outdone has 10posts up on the topic With apologies to all of them their takeawaymessage isI dont disagree with a single thing that Mike Bailey wrote at The Monkey Cage or that SCOTUSblogs Tom Goldstein wrote about how to game out the strategies of both Obama and Republicansenators It all makes sense Its all very savvy and very politicalSupreme Court nomination process sure to be an epic debateReading through them however there was just one small teeny tiny detail that kept nagging at me No matter how this plays out the Supreme Court losesThe hardworking staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been banging on periodically about the erosion of trust in American political institutions The Supreme Court has not been immune to that trend Heres the General Social Survey dataTo be fair the Supreme Court is still more widely respected than either Congress or President Obama But if you think about it thats a really low barThe sources of this decline are likely myriad but a big part of it is that the court is increasingly viewed through a partisan lens and no partisan has liked the Roberts court in recent years Indeed the combination of divided government and political polarization forced the Supreme Court into a more overtly political role thereby guaranteeing it would serve as a wedge issue going forward Democratsdidnt love this court because Republicans appointed a majority of the justices leading to rulings like Citizens United and Heller Republicans didnt love this court because its rulings on gay marriage and Obamacare shifting the political status quo to the leftWere at the point in this country where partisanship is now the last socially approved form of discrimination As Paul Waldman noted over at The Plum Line the trend on Senate confirmation votes of Supreme Court justices sustains this pointClarence Thomas excepted through the Clinton administration justices got nearunanimous votes Then things changed starting with the George W Bush administration While Democrats did their best to find some dirt on John Roberts and Samuel Alito and Republicans did the same to Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan none of it amounted to much of anything Yet in all those cases most of the opposition party voted against the nominee And its likely to get even worseThe GOP Senate caucussimmediate reaction to Scalias passing is simply the latest iteration of this dynamicWhether due merely to partisan sorting or true ideological polarization the erosion of trust in the Supreme Courtreflects decadeslong trends so the flapdoodles and arglebargle of the past few days were probably inevitableBut as Dara Lind noted over at Vox its a shame that political leaders havent focused a wee bit more on one of Scalias more gracious attributes Scalia was clearly able to separate the political from the personal His close friendship with Ruth Bader Ginsburg the Ralph to his Sam attests to that As Lind concludesI get why this seat is such a highstakes political battle for everyone involved Politics aint beanbag But the battle that is about to ensue over Scalias seat is going to be nasty Its part of a secular trend that will only furtherthe erosion of public trust in the Supreme Court And thats the bigger problem with how this will play out
