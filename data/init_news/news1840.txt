The Supreme Court on Monday made it harder for prosecutors to convict those who make violent statements on Facebook and other social media saying it is not enough that an ordinary person would find the rants threateningIn its first examination of the murky rules regarding conduct on the Internet the court moved cautiously while throwing out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man whose postings delivered in raplyric style suggested killing his estranged wife federal law enforcement officials and even a kindergarten classChief Justice John G Roberts Jr noting that Anthony Douglas Elonis had said he intended his postings to be fictitious and even therapeutic said a defendants state of mind had to be consideredBut the opinion offered little in the way of specifics about what must be proved for a conviction and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr criticized the opinion as more confusing than enlighteningThis failure to decide throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of uncertainty Thomas wrote in dissentThe narrow opinion said it was not necessary to address whether the First Amendments guarantee of free speech protected Eloniss Facebook statements The opinion also declined to take a position on whether it would be enough for a conviction to show that a defendant had been reckless in making inflammatory statements as Alito proposedFor the justices it was sufficient for now Roberts wrote to correct a misinterpretation by most lower courts that the posters intent is immaterial and what matters only is how the message is receivedRoberts defended the majoritys goslow approach Such prudence is nothing new he wroteSteven R Shapiro legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union said the law for centuries required the government to prove criminal intent before putting someone in jail That principle is especially important when a prosecution is based on a defendants wordsHe added The Internet does not change this longstanding ruleGroups battling domestic violence and advocating for victims said they worried the ruling would make it harder to convict those who make threats and said the ease and accessibility of social media have made the problem worseThe Internet is the crime scene of the 21st century The laws governing social media require swift interpretation to keep pace with the everadvancing criminal activity in this space said Mai Fernandez executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime She said the justices had left victims in jeopardyThreats play a central role in domestic abuse and is a core tactic that many abusers employ said Kim Gandy president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence adding that threats cause devastating harm regardless of whether the abuser intended to threaten or only intended to vent or to make a jokeWriting about his estranged wife Tara Elonis had posted Theres one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you Im not going to rest until your body is a mess soaked in blood and dying from all the little cutsAt oral argument six months ago justices seemed to agree there was a need for more than the reasonable person standard  which says that a reasonable person would consider a particular statement to be a threat  but there was no consensus on exactly what that standard should be The limited ruling issued Monday and the length of time required to produce it indicated that no such agreement on a different standard had emergedRoberts said there is no dispute that the stateofmind requirement is satisfied if the defendant transmits a communication for the purpose of issuing a threat or with knowledge that the communication will be viewed as a threatBut Alito who agreed the case should be sent back to lower courts said the decision left too many unanswered questionsThe court refuses to explain what type of intent was necessary Alito complained Did the jury need to find that Elonis had the purpose of conveying a true threat Was it enough if he knew that his words conveyed such a threat Would recklessness suffice  Attorneys and judges are left to guessSupreme Court case tests the limits of free speech on Facebook and other social mediaParaphrasing the famous holding from Marbury v Madison that it is the courts prerogative to say what the law is Alito said the court was announcing It is emphatically the prerogative of this court to say only what the law is notThe justices were considering a federal law that makes it a crime to communicate any threat to injure the person of anotherProsecutors said there was no doubt Elonis was doing that on his Facebook feed during a twomonth period in 2010 His wife had left with their two children and Elonis then 27 and working at an Allentown amusement park grew increasingly despondent and angryHe was fired and responded with a post about being a nuclear bomb about to explode He pondered making a name for himself by shooting up an elementary schoolThat brought a visit from an FBI agent and the prolific Elonis later posted a fantasy about slitting the agents throat and turning her into a ghostElonis was convicted after a judge told jurors that the government needed to prove only that Elonis made the statements and that a reasonable person would foresee that the words would be interpreted as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individualElonis served three years of a 44month sentence before being released from prisonThe Philadelphiabased US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit upheld the conviction saying Eloniss subjective intent in writing his postings did not matterThe Morning Call reported in April that Elonis had been arrested by police in Freemansburg Pa on charges of hitting his girlfriends mother with a potThe cases is Elonis v US
