When national media outlets need to know whats going on in Nevada politics they often turn to Las Vegasbased journalist Jon Ralston whos developed a strong track record of calling elections in the stateAnd now that Nevada early voting has come to a close Ralston isnt mincing words about how he sees Donald Trumps prospects Trump is dead Ralston tweeted Saturday He elaborated on his blog that from the early voting numbers so far the GOP nominee would need a miracle to win Nevada at this pointThe polls have tended to put Nevada as a pure tossup state and a few recent ones have even shown Trump ahead there Accordingly it hasnt generally been considered part of Hillary Clintons swing state firewallBut Nevada is a famously difficult state for national pollsters to get right Its population is transient and many work at night Furthermore its population is more than onequarter Hispanic and its often challenging for Englishlanguage polls to sample Hispanic voters accuratelyIn both of the past two presidential elections polls underestimated Barack Obamas eventual margin of victory in the state And in Harry Reids 2010 Senate campaign the polls utterly whiffed suggesting hed lose to his challenger Sharron Angle when he ended up winning by nearly 6 pointsSo in previous years analysts like Ralston have found success in reading tea leaves from Nevadas early voting numbers instead And all week Ralston has been warning of danger signs for Trump The partisan and geographic breakdown of early voting turnout has looked similar to 2012 when Obama won the state by 65 points But the final day of early voting Friday was Ralston writes cataclysmic for RepublicansRalston is looking at two main things  the numbers of registered Democrats who have voted compared with registered Republicans and the geography of the turnoutThough the statewide early voting numbers arent yet finalized Ralston estimates that registered Democrats will have a 6point lead on registered Republicans among early voters Since registered partisans tend to overwhelmingly vote for their own party Trump probably either needs to dominate among early voters associated with neither party or else make up the gap on Election DayRalston flags the numbers from Clark County which contains Las Vegas and threequarters of the states population and is where Democrats have drawn much of their support So far he writes 73000 more registered Democrats turned out than registered Republicans in Clark  and if those voters back their partys candidates thats a big lead in raw votes that will be very difficult for Republicans to overcome with the more sparsely populated counties elsewhere In 2012 Obama beat Mitt Romney statewide by about 70000 votesAnecdotally there appears to have been very high turnout among Hispanic voters in Clark on Friday which led Ralston to tweetWe should caution that we do not technically know whom these people voted for If these registered partisans did not vote overwhelmingly for their own party if nonpartyaffiliated voters break overwhelmingly for one candidate or if Election Day turnout looks dramatically different Ralstons call might not pan outBut ballots equivalent to well over twothirds of the total 2012 turnout in Nevada have already been cast So if Trump has indeed fallen significantly behind in the early vote it will be very challenging for him to catch up
