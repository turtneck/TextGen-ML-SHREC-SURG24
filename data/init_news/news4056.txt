The poll from Hispanic Leadership Network and Resurgent Republic found that a majority of Latino voters in Florida Colorado New Mexico and Nevada prefer Democrats and a number of Democraticsupported policies even on key Republican priorities such as bringing down the deficit and helping small businessThe results of the survey were sobering Resurgent Republic board member Whit Ayres told reporters at a press conference Wednesday For one more than half of Latino voters polled in each state said the GOP doesnt respect the values and concerns of their communityRepublicans are in a hole Theres no question Republicans are in a hole he said Were not sugarcoating that But theres also no question that Republicans have enormous potential to do far better than theyve doneThe poll found that a plurality of Latino voters in each of the four states said they are more likely to vote for a Democrat than a Republican in the 2016 presidential election But nearly a third of those voters in New Mexico and Florida said they would consider both parties showing there is potential for the GOP to improve its standing In Colorado and Nevada closer to a quarter of Latino voters said they would consider both partiesPresident Barack Obama won a larger proportion of the Latino vote than previous Democratic presidential candidates did in 2008 bettering his own numbers 2004 and 2000 One reason according to most exit polling and the speakers on Wednesday was former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romneys harsh rhetoric and hardline stances on immigrationI call it the immigration earmuffs Hispanic Leadership Network executive director Jennifer Korn said Even though you might agree on jobs the economy national security if the tone is harsh on immigration theyre not going to listen to you on the other issuesAnother potential problem for Republicans could be social issues such as samesex marriage which a plurality of Latino voters said they support Its a common trope among Republicans that Latino voters are conservatives who just dont realize it in part because many are Catholic But many are also younger than the average Catholic population and their views on samesex marriage align more with their age cohort than their religious oneThis is where things start to get a little discomforting for me as a Republican Ayres said Because these are issues on which you would expect Republicans to do relatively better  Democrats considered to have ideas that help small business Now come on we are the party of small business right But we still havent made that sale yet in the Hispanic communityDespite all the obstacles representatives for the two groups argued there is potential for Republicans to win a larger proportion of the Latino vote particularly those who said they consider themselves conservatives but voted Democratic anywayThe Republican brand among the Hispanic Latino community is not a good brand Its in terrible disrepair and is in need of a substantial uplift and needs substantial resuscitation The patients not dead but its on life support said former Sen Norm Coleman RMinn who is chairman of the American Action Network We believe the good news is  that there is a path to tap into the Latino community
