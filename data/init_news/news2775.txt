Washington CNN Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton start the race to November 8 on essentially even ground with Trump edging Clinton by a scant two points among likely voters and the contest sparking sharp divisions along demographic lines in a new CNNORC PollTrump tops Clinton 45 to 43 in the new survey with Libertarian Gary Johnson standing at 7 among likely voters in this poll and the Green Partys Jill Stein at just 2The topsyturvy campaign for the presidency has seen both Clinton and Trump holding a significant lead at some point in the last two months though Clinton has topped Trump more often than not Most recently Clintons convention propelled her to an 8point lead among registered voters in an earlyAugust CNNORC Poll Clintons lead has largely evaporated despite a challenging month for Trump which saw an overhaul of his campaign staff announcements of support for Clinton from several highprofile Republicans and criticism of his campaign strategy But most voters say they still expect to see Clinton prevail in November and 59 think she will be the one to get to 270 electoral votes vs 34 who think Trump has the better shot at winningNeither major third party candidate appears to be making the gains necessary to reach the 15 threshold set by the Commission on Presidential Debates with just three weeks to go before the first debate on September 26The new poll finds the two major party candidates provoke large gaps by gender age race education and partisanship Among those likely to turn out in the fall both candidates have secured about the same share of their own partisans 92 of Democrats back Clinton 90 of Republicans are behind Trump but independents give Trump an edge 49 say theyd vote for him while just 29 of independent voters back Clinton Another 16 back Johnson 6 SteinWomen break for Clinton 53 to 38 while men shift Trumps way 54 to 32 Among women those who are unmarried make up the core of her support 73 of unmarried women back Clinton compared with just 36 of married women Among men no such marriage gap emerges as both unmarried and married men favor TrumpYounger voters are in Clintons corner 54 to 29 among those under age 45 while the older ones are more apt to back Trump 54 to 39 among those age 45 or older Whites mostly support Trump 55 to 34 while nonwhites favor Clinton by a nearly 4to1 margin 71 to 18 Most college grads back Clinton while those without degrees mostly support Trump and that divide deepens among white voters Whites who do not hold college degrees support Trump by an almost 3to1 margin 68 to 24 while whites who do have college degrees split 49 for Clinton to 36 for Trump and 11 for JohnsonSupport for Johnson seems to be concentrated among groups where Clinton could stand to benefit from consolidating voters Although direct comparison between the polls twoway headtohead matchup and its fourway matchup doesnt suggest that Johnson is pulling disproportionately from either candidate his supporters come mostly among groups where a strong thirdparty bid could harm Clintons standing Younger voters particularly younger men whites with college degrees and independents notablyThe poll follows several national polls in August suggesting that the margin between the two candidates had tightened following the conventions A CNN Poll of Polls analysis released Friday showed that Clintons lead had been cut in half when compared with the height of her convention bounceSpeaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane Tuesday Clinton shrugged off a question about the CNNORC surveyI really pay no attention to polls When they are good for me  and there have been a lot of them that have been good for me recently  I dont pay attention Clinton said When they are not so good I dont pay attention We are on a course that we are sticking withWhile enthusiasm for the campaign has continued to inch up it remains well off the mark compared with this point in other recent presidential election years In the new poll 46 say they are extremely or very enthusiastic compared with 57 at this point in 2012 60 in early September of 2008 and 64 in September 2004Further nearly half of voters say they are less enthusiastic about voting in this election than they have been in previous years while just 42 say theyre more excited about this years contest Although this question hasnt been asked in every presidential election year in CNNORC and CNNUSA TodayGallup results dating back to 2000 this poll marks the first time that a significantly larger share of voters say they are less enthusiastic about this years election The lack of enthusiasm spikes among Clinton supporters A majority of Clintons supporters say theyre less excited about voting this year than usual 55 while most of Trumps backers say theyre more excited this time around 56That could be contributing to Trumps slim advantage among likely voters Among the broader pool of registered voters Clinton edges Trump by 3 points The shift among these voters since the convention is largely due to a rebound in Trumps numbers rather than a slide in Clintons Hes gone from 37 support then to 41 among registered voters nowTrump holds an edge over Clinton as more trusted to handle two of voters top four issues  the economy 56 trust Trump vs 41 Clinton and terrorism 51 Trump to 45 Clinton Clinton holds a solid edge on foreign policy 56 trust her to Trumps 40 and the public is divided over the fourth issue in the bunch immigration On that 49 favor Clintons approach 47 Trumps At Trumps recent campaign appearances he has argued that he would do more to improve life for racial and ethnic minorities but voters seem to disagree 58 say Clinton is better on that score vs 36 who choose Trump and among nonwhites 86 choose Clinton to just 12 who think Trump would better improve their livesTrump has his largest edge of the campaign as the more honest and trustworthy of the two major candidates 50 say he is more honest and trustworthy vs just 35 choosing Clinton and as the stronger leader 50 to 42 Clinton continues to be seen as holding the better temperament to serve effectively as president 56 to 36 and better able to handle the responsibilities of commander in chief 50 to 45On honesty Clintons backers express greater skepticism about their candidate than do Trumps supporters When asked which candidate is more honest and trustworthy 94 of Trumps backers say he is while just 70 of those behind Clinton choose her with 11 saying Trump is more trustworthy and 17 saying neither of them are And when voters were asked to name the one issue that would be most important to their vote for president 5 named honesty or trustworthiness as their top choice ranking it on par with foreign policy and jobsBoth candidates remain largely unliked with majorities saying they have an unfavorable view of each candidate in the new pollThe CNNORC Poll was conducted by telephone Sept 14 among a random national sample of 1001 adults The survey includes results among 886 registered voters and 786 likely voters For results among registered or likely voters the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 35 percentage pointsCorrection The CNNORC Poll topline document released Tuesday contained an error numbers showing the partisan makeup of the sample on the methodology page were transposed The correct party makeup of all adults in the poll is 32 Democratic 28 Republican 40 independent or something else This is a similar Democratic tilt to the previous CNNORC Poll in which 28 of respondents described themselves as Democrats and 24 Republicans and on par with the average across all CNNORC Polling conducted this year which yields a 5point Democratic advantageAmong those determined to be likely to vote 36 described themselves as Democrats 32 as Republicans
