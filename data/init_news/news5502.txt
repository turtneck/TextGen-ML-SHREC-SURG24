According to numerous scholars who have weighed in since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia over the weekend historical and constitutional precedent indicates that the president of the United States is elected for a fouryear term and does not stop being president until he or she um actually leaves office Thats a hot take on a controversial topic I know Its nearly as confusing as the question of who was president at the time of the 911 attacks which Marco Rubio seems to think took place during some extended Bill Clinton prequel to The Hangover while George W Bush wore funny costumes and did nonalcoholic JellO shots and kept forgetting he had taken the oath of officeBut historys bunk as Henry Ford sorta kinda said nearly a century ago And so is reality at least when it comes to politics in 2016 a year whose revolutionary strangeness demands a new descriptive term Postmodern is way too oldfashioned too 90s Our politics are increasingly postpartisan postrational postfactual and even postpolitical Even the New York Times has noticed In a story published Tuesday about the running battle over judicial appointments between the Obama administration and the Republican leadership of the Senate reporter Charlie Savage wonderingly observed that history is no longer a guide in a polarized Washington where partisan warfare over judicial nominations has been escalating for more than a generationThat qualifies as what Friedrich Nietzsche would have called a daybreak moment the dawning of a new awareness I agree that I quote him too much thats it for now Please notice the inherent contradiction in Savages sentence History is no longer a guide because it is no longer history that is because the lessons that a mainstream commentator is supposed to draw from history no longer reflect what has actually happened The Republican Partys longterm strategy of paralysis refusal and denial  of crushing all lingering vestiges of democracy under a sodden weight of nihilism and apathy  is the new normalThat strategy stretches back at least as far as the Bill Clinton years and has gone into Kochfunded steroid overdrive in the Citizens United era As its zillionaire funders clearly grasp that strategy represents the GOPs best hope for repeated midterm victories and a stranglehold on congressional power into the indefinite future Its the strategy that produced the Koch brothers greatest single victory to set against their more visible record of bankrolling losers like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush and most likely Marco Rubio That victory was of course the 37 percent turnout in the 2014 midterms when both Democrats and moderate Republicans stayed home in droves and the GOP won its largest congressional majority since 1931So I dont think its quite right to describe the Republican leaderships vow to reject any possible Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Obama during his last year in office as unprecedented or particularly surprising Its useless to talk about precedent as if that word meant something these days for starters There is no relevant precedent for anything happening in American politics right now except perhaps for some limited parallels one could identify in the severely divided nation of the 1850s on the cusp of the Civil WarAs far as surprise goes give me a break Do I take a cynical view of all the expressions of amazement and righteous indignation from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and every other leading Democrat and the entire leftward half of the commentariat Sure I do They sense political opportunity and the chance to shoot a flattering selfie with the Constitution behind them Which is fair play and all but lets not mistake it for highminded principle It might be fair to give Sanders an asterisk on this one but the Democratic Party as a whole has been a junior partner or fellow traveler in the politics of paralysis and has done virtually nothing to resist itIts no secret that the current Republican leadership in Congress is essentially held hostage by the most extreme elements of its base We have all forgotten about John Boehner for understandable reasons but please remember that the duly elected speaker of the House was forced to quit for being not enough of a donothing obstructionist For any elected Republican to offer a fair hearing to any Obama nominee at any level of government is tantamount to treason half the Republican electorate apparently believes that Obama is not a United States citizen and not the lawful president in the first place What proportion of them believes that Obama had Scalia murdered in order to ban all guns open the borders and institute Sharia law remains unclear Im hearing its a big topic says Donald Trump fueling a new bump in the polls And here we are facing a Supreme Court vacancy after the death of the most conservative justice in recent history  or ever quite likely  under the aforementioned lameduck IslamoDemocratic socalled presidentWhether the Republicans can successfully run out the clock on the Obama administration without paying a devastating political price remains to be seen Its a massive gamble a game of Russian roulette played with four or five bullets in a sixshooter But their vow to do so is the logical fulfillment of their partys longterm commitment to paralysis as politics and it comes as a surprise to absolutely nobody in Washington If that tactic poses unknowable hazards for the GOP in general and its presidential nominee in particular thats not because it is qualitatively different from what theyve been doing for years Its only because it thrusts the nihilistic strategy of the rightwing conservatrolls who have eaten the Republican Partys soul into the publics face in blatant and unavoidable fashion Honestly it was more surprising to hear Sen Charles Grassley of Iowa chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee take half a step back from the GOP hivemind on Tuesday and suggest he might actually fulfill his constitutional role to hold hearings on an Obama nominee Once upon a time Grassley came off as a rightwing zealot among Senate Republicans Now hes a congenial bipartisan man of reason not to mention an 82yearold incumbent who faces a tough reelection fight in a purple state that Obama carried twice Lets not waste any compassion on Grassley because he deserves to ride the slippery slide of ignominy however that happens But I feel sorry for the folks who are fielding all the outraged phone calls in his Capitol Hill office right now I dont know whether its too late for some Tea Party firebrand to mount a Republican primary challenge in Iowa but I guarantee that question is being pondered right now Its tempting to express delight at the current GOP dilemma where Republicans would seem to face death by fire from the pitchforkbearing faithful if they move forward with an Obama Supreme Court nominee and death in the frigid ocean of a national election if they dont Its tempting if youre wearing ideological blinders that is and if you assume that the Democratic Party even in its divided and eviscerated state is guaranteed to reap a glorious victory after a lemminglike wave of Republican mass suicide I dont think thats a safe assumption Our entire bipartisan political system is in dire and potentially terminal condition and as I keep insisting there are ample reasons to believe that the virus that has destroyed one party has also infected the other albeit in less dramatic fashion Were already in a year when the Republicans seem likely to nominate a lunatic demagogue who is despised by the entire party leadership  and who whatever he is is not a conservative by anyones definition  and when a septuagenarian Jewish socialist is one or two victories away from being the Democratic frontrunner What will come of Obamas impending Supreme Court nomination and who will inherit the resulting mess next January I have no idea But if you still think political normalcy is about to reassert itself any minute now I have two words for you Hi Jeb
