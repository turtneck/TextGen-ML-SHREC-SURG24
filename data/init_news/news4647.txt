THE BIG IDEAShaking up his campaign once again Donald Trump has decided to let Trump be TrumpThe Republican nominee knows hes losing Congenitally unable to take personal responsibility he blames his slide in the polls on the people who have prodded him to act presidential and wage a more traditional campaignIn a 538 am press release Trump announced that Stephen Bannon who got rich on Wall Street but has never worked on a race before will take a leave of absence from running Breitbartcom to become the campaigns chief executive Pollster Kellyanne Conway who worked for Ted Cruzs super PAC during the primaries but has been friendly with Trump for years will become campaign managerPaul Manafort will retain his titles as campaign chairman and chief strategist but Trump advisers told Robert Costa overnight that his status has diminished internally due to the candidates unhappiness and restlessness in recent weeks The aides told Costa that Trump has grown to feel boxed in and controlled by people who barely know himTrump plans to redouble his focus on holding big rallies and doing lots of TV hits Hell also more aggressively attack Hillary Clinton to the extent thats possible and hell reembrace his role as an outsider making less of an effort to be nice to GOP graybeardsDuring the primaries when Trump was winning thencampaign manager Corey Lewandowski always said let Trump be Trump He now wants to get back to that type of campaign culture The moves send a signal perhaps more clearly than ever that the realestate magnateintends to finish this race on his own terms with friends who share his instincts at his side Costa writes This is another proof point that Trump is not trying to run the kind of serious campaign that can actually win the presidency Thats why it will frighten the GOP establishment scare off some mainstream donors who have been playing footsie with the billionaire and push congressional leaders like Mitch McConnell a little closer to cutting Trump loose maybe even before Labor Day Bannons site singlemindedly went after Paul Ryan in the runup to his primary Both of the newlyelevated advisers are conservative populists who will never discourage Trump from following his id Its hard for a 70yearold man to change his ways especially this one Donalds id demands instant gratification more than most peoples and hes long struggled to control his impulsiveness The shakeup also suggests that Trump realizes Manaforts Ukraine connections have become problematic and undercut the credibility of his attacks on the Clinton FoundationThe Associated Press reports this morning that Trumps campaign chairman helped a proRussian political party in Ukraine secretly route at least 22 million to two prominent Washington lobbying firmsThe project was structured in ways that obscured the foreign partys efforts to influence US policy Jeff Horwitz and Desmond Butler report The revelation was described to the AP by people directly knowledgeable about the effort  Under federal law US lobbyists must tell the Justice Department if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties A violation is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 250000 Read the whole story hereIn Wisconsin last night Trump announced that he would require senior officials in his administration to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government Another important storyline Breitbart News has long been Trumps Pravda and he just put the guy who runs the site in charge of his campaign staff Amusingly Trumps press release this morning cites a somewhat unflattering 2015 profile from Bloomberg BusinessWeek that calls Bannon the most dangerous political operative in America The release says he will oversee the campaign staff and operations in addition to strategic oversight of major campaign initiativesRecall that Breitbart took the side of the Trump campaign after Lewandowski grabbed the arm of one of its reporters he then lied about it until surveillance footage undercut his story That reporter Michelle Fields subsequently left and several employees resigned in protest Roger Ailes the pugilistic and recently ousted founder of Fox News is also reportedly moving closer to the inner circle The New York Times reports that Ailes still embroiled in a sexual harrassment scandalis acting as a presidential debate adviser to Trump as he prepares to face off against Clinton Two sources said Mr Ailess role could extend beyond the debates Maggie Haberman and Ashley Parker report For Mr Ailes being connected with Mr Trumps campaign could be a form of redemption after he was pushed out of the powerful network that he helped build The Trump campaign naturally publicly denies that Ailes has any role on the campaign per Jose DelReal Trump is cozying up to Ailes and Bannon after months of being unable to hire Alevel talent The smartest and most ambitious operatives know that having his name on their resume will probably become a scarlet letter that may doom their future prospects Politicos Katie Glueck writes that top Republicans in several critical battleground states say at best theyve never heard of Trumps state directors or have only limited familiarity with them  and at worst they know them and question their ability to do the job Three telling examples from Katies piece Trump offered a revealing window into his management style when he saidin 2007 that you should never hire people who are smarter than you You have to keep great people around you Trump told CNBC You always have to be on top of them And you have to be smarter than they are I hear so many times Oh I want my people to be smarter than I am Its a lot of crap You want to be smarter than your people if possible An important reminder of how little time Trump has to right the ship Voting actually

mysteriously appeared online Ellen Nakashima reports a development that could pose severe consequences for the agencys operations and government security The file contained 300 megabytes of information including several exploits or tools for taking control of firewalls in order to control a network  The disclosure of the file means that at least one other party  possibly another countrys

Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department outlining their rationale in a letter to House Oversight Committee lawmakers From Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian FBI Director James Comey announced in early July that he was recommending Clinton not be charged and the letter  largely repeated statements he had made previously in public But it also notably seemed to take aim at some ongoing conservative criticisms of Clinton  particularly that she was negligent in her handling of classified information and thus deserving of criminal chargesJason Herring who directs the FBIs Office of Congressional Affairs wrote that someone else who engaged in the type of conduct of which Clinton was accused might face severe administrative consequences and the FBI was in the process of providing relevant information to other government agencies But Herring also asserted that investigators found no evidence Clinton intended to mishandle classified information noting that even three emails marked as classified did not originate with her and that State had determined two of them did not contain classified informationRead the fourpage letter hereThe FBIs letter to the Judiciary Committee makes clear this is much ado about nothing Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein DCalif who released the letter said in a statement last nightHouse Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz said the documents provided by the FBI yesterday left him unpersuaded and while members of his committee would were not investigating the investigators they were trying to figure out what happened so that we can try to solve it We got to make sure this never ever happens again Chaffetz said Overplaying their handTrump adviser Al Baldasaro doubled down on hiscommentthat Clinton should be shot for treason for using aprivate email serverThe liberal media took what I said and went against the law and the Constitution and ran with it and they said that I wanted her assassinated which I never did Baldasaro said I said I spoke as a veteran and she should be shot in a firing squad for treason MassLivecom For the first time the Clinton campaign pushed back against conspiracy theories from the fever swamps of the right that her health is frail The evening press release included a statement from the former secretary of states doctor Lisa Bardack who maintained that she is in excellent health and that documents circulating online under her name are fake While it is dismaying to see the Republican nominee for president push deranged conspiracy theories in a foreign policy speech its no longer surprising said Jennifer Palmieri the campaigns communications director Trump is simply parroting lies based on fabricated documents promoted by Roger Stone and his right wing allies David Weigel Hillary won the endorsement of the Working Families Party a progressive group that worked to defeat her in the primaries The group said 68 percent of

food production issues But several of those listed seem to be opposed to Trumps calls for mass deportation and strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform package passed by the Senate in 2013  Immigrant labor is a bedrock of the agriculture industry in the United States many members of the newly formed committee have argued and a shortage in the already scant agriculture labor pool

time Chris Christie became governor of New Jersey the states auditors and lawyers had been battling for several years to collect longoverdue taxes owed by Trumps casinos  The total with interest had grown to almost 30 million The state had doggedly pursued the matter through two of the casinos bankruptcy cases and even accused the company led by Mr Trump of filing false reports with state casino regulators about the amount of taxes it had paid But the year after Christietook office the tone of the litigation shifted The state entertained settlement offers And in December 2011  the state agreed to accept just 5 million roughly 17 cents on the dollar of what auditors said the casinos owedA coincidence Mr Christie was close to the attorney general at the time Paula T Dow whom he had appointed and who previously worked for him  A week after the settlement was signed Mr Christie announced that he was appointing Ms Dow to the counsels office of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey until he could find her the judgeship that she desired The following month Page Six reported that the Christies and the Trumps were seen double datingAnother crazy scenario to think
