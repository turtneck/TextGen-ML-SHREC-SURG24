When Donald Trump descended from that escalator to announce his presidential run nearly six months ago you probably couldnt have found more than three people in the whole country who thought he had a chance It was even reported at the time thathe had paid actors at fifty bucks a headtoenthusiastically cheer and clap for his bizarre announcement speech in which he declared his intention to build a big beautiful wall to keep out all the immigrant rapists It seemed like a joke or some kind of political performance art Everyone settled in to enjoy the show never dreaming that anyone would take him seriouslyBut over the course of the last half year hes stayed at the top of polls and even more astonishingly gotten away with saying things that no other political figure could have ever gotten away with With each gaffe insult mistake faux pas slander and cheap shot his followers become even more loyalThe latest polling average by the Huffington Post pollsterhas Trump at 344 percent with Rubio at 146 percent Carson at 139 percent and Cruz at 134 percent Hes not going down Hes going up And now that the primary season is in full effect everyones starting to wonder whether he might actually winThere have been a flurry of recent articles reporting that big GOP donors starting to get nervous particularly since their designated candidate Jeb Bush sank in the polls a few months ago and hasnt been able to climb back up But they are stumpedabout what to do about him On the one hand theyre sure hes going to implode and on the other worried that any money they spend trying to take him down will be wastedThis articlein last weeks Washington Post by Matea Gold and Robert Costa is filled with colorful anecdotes and quotes from various consultants advisors and party poohbahs wringing their hands and clutching their pearls over the problem But the best are the big money donors who are convinced that the voters will see the light and all will be wellHe is going to implode himself said Frank VanderSloot the chief executive of an Idaho nutritionalsupplement company who is backing Sen Marco Rubio Fla He said he recently turned down a funding request from a group seeking to run antiTrump ads Its just going to take a little time for people to take a step back and look at his track record see who he is and how hes changed his positions and how unprepared he is to be president of the United States VanderSloot saidTheir faith is rather charmingly naive They dont seem to realize that the voters who are flocking to Trump hate people like them and have no respect for anything they believe Its not the money of course The fact that Trump is a billionaire is one of the things they love about him Hes a winner What they hate is the fact that these elites dont think Trump is qualified His lack of political experience is irrelevantHe says out loud what they are thinking and he does it without any selfawarenessor sense that theres anything wrong with it He validates their rage The large field has all the Super PACs tying themselves in knots trying to game out the ramifications of taking on Trump worried that it will end up benefiting one of their rivals John Kasichs Super PAC decided to take the plunge and was greeted with a threat of a lawsuit from Trumps lawyer Fred Davis the GOP admaker crafting the super PACs spots said the missive is an example of why more donors are not stepping forward to take on Trump I think the reason people are hesitant is that hes a bully he said Trump and his followers were undoubtedlythrilledwith that admission So the campaigns the big donors and the Super PACs have been pretty much paralyzed by the Trump phenomenon At this point they are just hoping hell implode and they can run the campaign they always planned to run But others in the party those with concerns beyond the presidential election are starting to do some serious analysis and strategizing around Trump Yesterday Robert Costa and Philip Ruckerreportedthat the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote a seven page confidential memo that urges candidates to adopt many of Trumps tactics issues and approaches  right down to adjusting the way they dress and how they use Twitter If you cant beat him join him The NRSC is obviously right to be concerned about Trump But most would assume this concern stems from the possibility that his brand of politics could lead to the party being decimated down ticket if he should get the nomination But this takes a different tack altogether NRSC Executive Director Ward Baker is telling his Senate candidates that Trump is on to something and they should try to emulate him Many people have pointed out that the Republicans created the angry constituency that is now enthralled by Trump with decades of talk radio and Fox TV propaganda And they were obviously startled by the results But now they seem to be in the process of accepting and adapting The problem is that they dont really understand Trumps appeal They think hes popular because of his antiWashington populist agenda and because he cant be bought And its true that people like that about him But what his followersloveabout him is his open almost cheerful disdain for people they hate and a willingness to win by any means necessary Without that hes just another guy railing againstWashington and saying hell lowertaxes Ward seems to think that candidates can cop Trumps attitude without going for the substance and people will go for it But thats pretty condescending Voters like Trump for what hes saying even more than the way hes saying it Theyre not going to be fooled by someone trying to do Trumplite Nonetheless the memo is important for the fact that it admits that the highest levels of the Republican party see a way in which Trump can put together a coalition that could win a general election Its hard to believe theyre right but they do seem to be serious But even more concerning is the fact that Trumpism is seeping beyond his candidacy and into the Party as whole They are no longer rejecting him they are coopting him They are becoming him
