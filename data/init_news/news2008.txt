Congressional Republicans face a major test this week as they seek to pass a budget that makes both fiscal and defense hawks happy and the big story right now is that Republicans may not resolve the impasse between the warring camps But they very well might  and at that point a bruising political battle with Democrats will unfold as Republicans move towards a Congressional vote on repealing Obamacare a key pillar of the GOP fiscal blueprint and a possible presidential veto loomsGearing up for the fight to come the Senate Democratic caucus will release a report this morning that previews how they will prosecute the political caseFirst though Republicans have to find a way to unify Politico and Roll Call report this morning that the House GOP leadership will try a new strategy to resolve their internal divisionsHeres how it will work The House will hold votes on both a budget that the fiscal hawks want which would balance the budget in 10 years with no new revenues and less defense spending and on a budget that the defense hawks want which would balance the budget in 10 years with no new revenues and more defense spending while not counting it as spending that busts the sequester caps conservatives want to keep in place Such are the parameters of responsible GOP budgeting in this CongressWhichever gets more votes will be the winner whereupon the effort will begin to reconcile that budget with the Senate GOP version presuming one passes If Republicans fail to unify there will be countless stories about their failure to govern and it will raise the possibility of a lot more chaos ahead But if they do agree on a budget a whole new chapter beginsThus the forthcoming report from the Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Center will argue that the spending cuts that are detailed in the GOP blueprints  such as the repeal of Obamacare while keeping its savings and the blockgranting of Medicaid to states  would take affordable health coverage away from millions of Americans And it will argue that to get to its goal of balance within 10 years with no new revenues the House and Senate GOP fiscal blueprints go to extraordinary lengths to conceal the real impact of the spending cuts that would be required to accomplish that goalSays Senator Chuck Schumer Fuzzy math sleight of hand and arithmetic acrobatics can disguise but not change the fact that the Republican budgets would devastate programs that the middle class relies upon Meanwhile the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that 69 percent of the cuts in the GOP budgets would have to fall on programs helping people with lower incomesBut will Republicans pay any political price for any of this One key thing to watch will be how GOP Senators up for reelection in states carried by Obama handle the politics of it Meanwhile most House Republicans are cossetted away in safe districts where GOP voters are presumably happy to be told that its perfectly possible to balance the budget in 10 years with no new taxes while hiking defense spending with the vast bulk of any cuts to the degree that theyre detailed at all falling on people with low incomes even as relatively few of the cuts hit programs that serve older Americans ISRAEL SPIED ON IRAN TALKS The Wall Street Journal reports that senior White House officials learned soon after negotiations began over Irans nuclear program began that Israel was spying on the talks as part of a broader effort to undermine the possibility of a dealThis could conceivably give some skittish Congressional Democrats the cover they need to side with Obama on any eventual nuclear deal with Iran On the other hand the Benjamin Netanyahu speech arranged by Congressional Republicans was supposed to accomplish that too but its still unclear whether it will ISRAELI AMBASSADOR LOBBIES HOUSE DEMS Meanwhile Politico reports that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer held a dinner last night with a number of House Democrats According to one of themThis is yet another reminder that if there is a deal with Iran many Democrats may find themselves forced to choose between the Israeli government and the Obamaled one VOTE ON LORETTA LYNCH DELAYED UNTIL MIDAPRIL Bloomberg News reports that Senate Republicans may not put up Loretta Lynchs nomination as attorney general for a vote until at least midApril because of a partisan dispute over a human trafficking bill Democrats are filibustering it due to an antiabortion provision Republicans are saying Lynch wont move until that dispute is resolvedThat would mean the vote on Lynch could come five months after she was first nominated While Lynch would be the first female African American attorney general the delay could also make history in another way one that doesnt reflect particularly well on Republicans CAMP HILLARY IS PSYCHED ABOUT CRUZ PRESIDENTIAL RUN Hillary advisers think Ted Cruzs presidential announcement is very much in her interestsWell okay Its not clear to me that the lack of any serious challenge to Clinton will end up benefiting her but well see THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE ATTACK ON JEB BUSH Byron York previews it Conservative activists are complaining that

presidential run on the premise that only he possesses the heroism and perseverance required to fully vanquish Obamas efforts to destroy America Watch for the where were you while there was still a chance to defeat Obamacare BEFORE it began enslaving millions line to emerge as a key attack AND OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER PART 973 The Associated Press reportsBetter get the Supreme Court to do
