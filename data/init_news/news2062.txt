The party apparatus exploits and exacerbates these fraidycrat jitters Whenever something major loomsan election a State of the Union address a major Senate vote a gravitational ripplemy email box turns into a Wailing Wall of Democratic fundraising messages bearing subject lines such as Worried Be Afraid Why Havent We Heard from You All Hope Is Lost and DOOMED which isnt how General Patton would have fired up the troops The heebiejeebieing is even worse on social media during the election cycle social media make everything worse if you open up the sluices turning even stoics into headless chickens A few years ago such Aunt Pittypat palpitations inspired a viral poster that showed President Obama making a bold gesture with the message EVERYONE CHILL THE FUCK OUT I GOT THIS And yet after nearly two terms of Obamas unruffled unrattled mastery of the long game his confidence doesnt seem to have energized Democrats en masse with a Forward march spirit When Democrats contemplate their navel they still see a panic buttonRepublicans are from Mars Democrats are from Venus goes an adage much beloved by pundits always looking for a convenient platitude to rest their elbows on Or chins Caricatured another way Republicans are cast as the Daddy Party jawjutting decisive disciplinarian financially prudent militarily assertive meat Democrats are the Mommy Party huggy permissive socially concerned globally cooperative veggies Such gender stereotypes may have outlived whatever hinky usefulness they ever had as stereotypes are wont to do but beneath the sexual cosplay of Republican executive blue suits versus Democratic mom jeans which President Obama was accused of fancying by no less a fashion arbiter than Sarah Palin is a forked dynamic deeper than any policy differences or identity politics Republicans are driven by anger Democrats riven by anxiety Anger stokes Republicans to lash out their grievances real and imaginary kept at a raging boil by Fox News Matt Drudge  radio talkshow hosts and similar mayhem artists Anxiety pincushions Democrats into a defensive crouch waiting for the ceiling to cave their blood pressure spiking with every alarming headline in The New York Times of which there is never a shortageNot all Democrats naturally otherwise the party would have gone the way of the Pony Express political architect Karl Roves vision of a permanent Republican majority having come to pass Yet there does seem to be an intestinal queasiness in the institutional identity thats chronic and unworthy of its ancestors When I was a stripling in the never dull 60s Democrats didnt quaver as if a wagontrain attack lurked around every bend Activated by adversity they appeared outgoing futurestriding and firmresolved dashing John F Kennedy happy warrior Hubert H Humphrey steerwrangling Lyndon Baines Johnson and radiating in the background the chromo image of Franklin Delano Rooseveltthe greatest president and perhaps the greatest figure of the 20th century The Republican adults in charge came across as somberly dour Richard Nixon or apocalyptically dire Barry Goldwater The bloody morass of Vietnam the urban riots and campus upheavals the assassinations of JFK his brother Robert and Martin Luther King Jr and the druggy saturnalia of the decade eroded the faith in liberal progress and took the bright shine off social engineering When Nixon swept the board in his reelection victory of 1972 over George McGovern winning 49 states it was as if a dark visor had been lowered over the future for liberal Democrats nothing ahead but charred landscape Undone by hubris and thirsty vengeance Nixon did the country a favor by befouling himself over Watergate opening a respite of hope for Democrats the improbable success of Jimmy Carter in time for the bicentennial only to have it smushed beneath the golden hammer of Ronald Reagan with whose twoterm presidency the Democrats are still reckoningIt wasnt only that Reagan was popular racking up a secondterm victory that equaled Nixons 49state total and scored the highest electoralcollege vote in history 525 out of a possible 538 leaving liberals thunderstruck It wasnt only that he was the first pontiff of the unfettered freemarket capitalism that has become the economic dogma of our time even if the actual record of his administration wouldnt pass Ayn Rands inspection
