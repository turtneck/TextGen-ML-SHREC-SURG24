CNN Republicans began their debate Thursday night with insults and ended with three candidates pledging to back Donald Trump should he win the nominationFlorida Sen Marco Rubio and Texas Sen Ted Cruz took more shots at Trump in Fox News debate  and through it all the billionaire businessman seemed to relish standing center stage defending himself against foes and moderators while showing his mettle to supportersAll three were happy to deflect efforts to drag them into sustained policy discussions and kept things personal Ohio Gov John Kasich was content to stand to the side and watch it allHere are seven takeaways from Thursdays Republican debateMinutes into the debate Trump was boasting about the size of his penisClearly annoyed that Rubio had joked days ago about the size of Trumps hands  suggesting as Trump put it that if theyre small something else might be small  the Republican frontrunner made a claim seldom heard during a presidential debateI guarantee you theres no problem I guarantee you he saidIt was a PG13 start to a twohour food fight that parents wouldnt have wanted their kids to watchEarly on as Rubio pressed Trump for more policy details the two gave each other nicknames Dont worry about it Little Marco Trump said to which Rubio responded Lets hear it Big DonaldTrump said Florida wouldnt elect Rubio dogcatcher after all of his missed Senate votes Cruz gave Trump instructions on letting go of his anger Donald learn not to interrupt its not complicated Count to 10 Donald Count to 10 Count to 10Later when Cruz told Trump to breathe Rubio jumped in and joked that the two were doing yogaI really hope that we dont see yoga on this stage Cruz answeredAnd then Rubio pointed to Trump whod just admitted his flexibility on policies and said Well hes very flexible so you never knowIt seemed as if Fox News had grown tired of Trumps opponents inability to knock him down  so the moderators decided to do it themselvesChris Wallace had a realtime fact check queued up when Trump asserted hed cut 500 billion in spending  pointing out that his strategies eliminating the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency which Trump called the Department of Environmental Protection would save just a fraction of that amountIt forced an awkward and unspecific claim about other things out of TrumpIm not only talking about drugs Im talking about other things he said Well save more than 300 billion a year if we negotiate We dont negotiateMegyn Kelly took her shot later on setting up three clips of Trump taking one policy position and then days later taking the opposite positionTrump was unmoored insisting he had logical explanations about his reversals on Syrian refugees the war in Afghanistan and more  and that by the way it doesnt matter much anywayYou have to have a certain degree of flexibility he saidTed Cruz needs Trumps momentum to ebb as much as anyone but he didnt spend much of the night on the attack For the most part Cruz stood aside and watched Rubio and Trump rip each other to shreds and then turned to the audience and threw up his handsMegyn let me just ask the voters at home Is this the debate you want playing out in the general election he saidCruz took his shots at Trump too but he let Rubio do the dirty work  betting that he rather than the Florida senator will reap the benefitsRubio for instance built on the attack line Mitt Romney started earlier in the day regarding Trump University pressing Trump over and over to admit he was ripping off the people who paid 36000 for his courses at a school thats now the subject of a classaction lawsuitCruz is trying to coopt the angry electorate that Trump has tapped into and his pitch is simple Trump is the villain youve been mad atFor 40 years Donald has been part of the corruption in Washington that youre angry about he saidIts entirely possible that the debate did nothing to change Cruzs fortunes But he does have a big opportunity on the horizonOf the four states to only allow Republicans to vote in GOP nominating contests Cruz has won three thanks to his strength among conservatives and the rules limiting Trumps ability to expand the electorate And all four states set to vote Saturday  Kansas Kentucky Louisiana and Maine  have closed contestsKasich will not under any circumstances engage directly with his foes on the debate stageAs the Democrats tell me all the time I can get the crossover votes he boasted early in the debate adding that hes often told at town halls that he seems to be the adult on stageIve talked about issues I have never tried to go and get into these kinda scrums that were seeing here he saidHe demonstrated his experience on economic and budgetary challenges and foreign policy and showed no signs of backing out of the race anytime soon  especially not before Ohios March 15 primaryFor Rubio thats all a big problemThe man who won the hearts of the Republican establishment by confronting Trump headon in the last debate was ready to hit the billionaire again and again  but a 1for11 Super Tuesday intervened and some of the shine wore offHe confronted Trump once again baiting the business mogul by calling him names attacking his business ventures and accusing him of knowing nothing about policy  even though he struggled with a raspy voiceOn the campaign trail Trump has proposed changing US libel laws so that politicians can more easily sue journalistsBut on Thursday night Trump said the bond between reporters and politicians who agree to go offtherecord is too strong to break That he said is why he wont ask The New York Times to release a transcript or recording of an offtherecord conversation he had with the newspapers editorial board about immigrationI think being off the record is very important I will honor it he saidThen Trump allowed  as his foes claimed  that he might have softened his hardline stance he has taken on the campaign trail that he will build a wall on the USMexico border and deport 11 million undocumented immigrantsI will say that in immigration as well as with anything else there has to be tug and pull You have to be able to have some flexibility he said I may have said something like that with The New York Times But I am not going to release something off the recordTrumps opponents pounced on his remark but they could be misreading his support Many Trump backers say they know he cant achieve everything he proposes but believe hell fight for it more effectively than anyone elseIn an interview with CNNs Dana Bash afterward he defended that flexibility saying Im flexible with everything You cant just say this is it and Im never going to talk he said With that being said you have to make great dealsComing less than 12 hours after Mitt Romney launched a scathing broadside against Trump the candidates answer to the last question of the debate was particularly strikingFox News moderators asked Rubio Cruz and Kasich whether theyd back Trump if he wins the nominationAll three said yesThe moment wont help Rubio  who had joined the NeverTrump movement of Republicans vowing not to support Trump on Twitter last week  with that crowdMore important though is what they didnt sayThe premise of the question was that Trump had already won the nomination But there are scenarios in which Republicans could have more chances to stop that from happening even after all 50 states voteA better question Would the Republican field support the candidate who wins the most delegatesSo what does this changeTrump struggled with policy details butted in when other candidates were speaking and sparred with the moderatorsSo what else is newHis sharp and sharply personal exchanges with his rivals might have been amped up Thursday night but still sounded much like Trumps first 10 debatesThe frontrunner doesnt get rattled or lose his wit even when he is under attack from everyone else on stage He often seems to relish it  as if his foes criticism gives him an excuse to stop holding backNone of the debates so far have changed the trajectory of the race  in part because Trump is the master of the debate postgame finding ways to deflect weak points and suck up media oxygen while branding his foes with nicknames like Little Marco and Lyin Ted and claiming victory  no matter what happened
