The Democratic National Committee over the weekendset its preliminary 2016 presidential primary calender with the four traditional carveout states  Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina and Nevada  holding contests in February and everybody else after thatThe calendar mimics what weve seen from Republicans who have basically agreed on the same order of successionHeres how that looksFrom there all other states would be permitted to hold contests between March 1 and June with party conventions being held in the early or midsummerSeems reasonable right Well the problem is that there isnt much hopethe calendar will stay this wayAnd all it takes is for one state to be the spoilsport and force a recasting of the entire calendar Translation New Years in Des MoinesIn recent years a handful of the other 46 states have bucked the committees and moved their primary dates to compete with or preempt the early states wanting the limelight and campaignspending that comes along with being one of the primaries that actually you know matters And its pretty easy for a state like Florida to just crash the party and set its date for late January as it has done the last two presidential electionsAbout the only thing stopping it or others from doing so are the penalties which generally entail decreasing the number of delegates they get to the national party conventions among other lesser thingsThose penalties have been ratcheted up in recent years with the Republican National Committee trying out evenharsher penalties this time around As I wrote in JanuaryPenalties for states moving in February or January will be more serious than in the past While the committee previously stripped them of half their delegates they will now lose more than that in most cases States with at least 30 delegates would be left with just 12 representatives at the convention while states with less than 30 delegates would have nineThe reason the rules have been tightened Because they didnt work Even faced with losing half their delegatesFlorida Arizona and Michigan all moved their contests ahead of March 1 pushing the earliest states to move from February to JanuaryBut while the RNC has tightened its rules for 2016 the DNC has not Rather than going further than the halving of delegates the DNC is sticking with the same rules as last time which allow for harsher penalties but dont mandate them So while the DNC is reserving the right to increase penalties after a state sets a date in violation of party rules its all hypotheticalIn reality though neither set of rules is likely to have the desired effect of actually stopping renegade states from jumping ahead Will Florida really balk at jumping the line againbecause it would have 12 delegates instead of 50 Maybe Will a smaller state that loses only a few more delegates under the new RNC rules feel that strongly Probably not And will the DNC actually increase penalties ona state that has already set its primary date by deducting more delegates just to send a messageI guess well seeAnd delegates remain overrated anyway Despite the delegate races weve seen in recent years its still clear that momentum is a bigger factor in determining presidential nominees The 2012 GOP primary and 2008 Democratic primary both included relevant delegate counts but in both cases the races continued in spite of their being a clear delegate frontrunner and likely nomineeIn addition all of the states that jumped ahead in 2008 and 2012 got the desired effect of holding an important presidential primary relevance And until those early states are actually boycotted by the candidates or somehow excluded from the horseracemomentum game that is the early primary process states will have motivation to move up  delegates be damnedWe arent yet seeing the socalled frontloading of the primary calendar but theres still lots of time And the offyear 2015 is when the game of leapfrog usually begins
