To just be grossly generalistic you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Hillary Clinton said at a New York fundraiser on Sept 9 The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamaphobic you name it And unfortunately there are people like that and he has lifted them up Video The Washington Post  Photo APHillary Clintons declaration Friday night at a New York fundraiser thathalf of Donald Trumps supporters fit into a basket of deplorables seems in its tersest formation like a stupid comment to make The New York Timess Michael Barbaro sums up that sentimentBut my summary above is not a fair condensation what Clinton said  and the fuller context makes it clear what she was aiming atTo just be grossly generalistic Clinton said according to a transcript from BuzzFeeds Ruby Cramer you could put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables Right The racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic  you name it And unfortunately there are people like that And he has lifted them upShe talked a bit about how Trump has interacted with that racist element and then continued But the other basket  and I know this because I see friends from all over America here  but that other basket are people who feel that the government has let them down the economy has let them down nobody cares about them nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures  theyre just desperate for change  Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as wellTrumps campaign  and Trump himself  quickly tried to make hay from the first partBut there are two ways in which this differs from something like President Obamas cling to guns and religion comments from another fundraiser in 2008The first is that the clingers remark disparaged something that was positive a persons religion or their cultural affinity for gun ownership and sportsmanship It was a dismissal of things of which people were proud Clinton however was saying that half of Trumps base was motivated by negative inclinations racism sexism No one is going to say Hey how dare you disparage my familys history of being racistTrumps tweet said she insulted his supporters but Clinton clearly delineated between two groups of supporters and she offered words of understanding to the latter So lets break the electorate out into four groups and consider how the comment will play1 Clinton supporters They support Clinton it seems unlikely theyll be put out2 RacistsexistxenophobicIslamophobicTrump supporters How big a group is this Its hard to say Clintons spokesman Nick Merrill tried to defend his bosss use of half by saying on Twitter that the racistxenophobic types appear to make up half of his crowd at events Update Clinton issued a statement on Saturday apologizing for implying it was half of Trump supporters We do know that 7 percent of Trump supporters think the candidate is racist suggesting that they themselves dont see racism as a dealbreaker Regardless of the actual fraction of the Trump base this group constitutes Clintons not likely to change their minds away from their preferred candidate either3 Nondeplorable Trump supporters This group will go one of two ways Theyll either a see Clintons remarks as insulting them as a whole or bbe reminded that there are elements of Trumps base of support that makes them uncomfortable That sense may spur them to be less enthusiastic to go vote for Trump in NovemberBut notice Either way theres no loss for Clinton If she spurs some Trump supporters to reconsider the loss is to TrumpRepublicans think Hillary Clinton just made her own 47 percent gaffe Did she4 Undecided voters Theyll go one of two ways too it seems Some may think Clinton was being rude and be less likely to support her Some may similarly be reminded about elements of Trumps base that they dont like and be less likely to back himThis is a much smaller group than the number of Trump backers mind you In the current RealClearPolitics average Trump backers are about 43 percent of the electorate and undecided voters are about 12 percent If Clinton sways 5 percent of the lets say 90 percent of Trump backers who arent deplorablesto rethink their support thats 2 percent of the overall electorate If she loses 10 percent of the undecideds thats 12 percent of the electorateThats assuming the shorthand here doesnt collapse into Clinton insulted all Trump supporters This is the point that Barbaro was making Clinton may have been trying once again to separate out nonracistsexistxenophobic Trump backers by pointing to those supporting Trump who do hold those objectively deplorable views Its a tricky line to walk  but compared withclingers for example shes in a slightly better positionAnd then theres that other thing about Obamas clingers comment He won anyway  twice
