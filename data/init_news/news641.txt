As Marco Rubio settles into his new role as a rising toptier candidate most of his opponents in the Republican presidential race are showing a reluctance and even an unwillingness to engage him directly on the national stageThe spotlight on Rubio is intensifying in the media as journalists investigate the senators political record and background But he otherwise is left facing relatively low hurdles for now bypassing the kind of heated personal clashes that have shaped the 2016 nomination raceFor Rubio it is a return to the lofty status he had after he burst onto the national scene five years ago Many Republican elites are once again celebrating him as the partys golden boy if not its strongest generalelection candidate and fear seeing him bruised too badly during the primary seasonHes articulate attractive and young His rivals dont want him to win but no one wants to lose him said Vin Weber a prominent Jeb Bush supporter Of course politics is a roughandtumble sport and hell need to take a few punches But at the end of the day this is a party that needs to find ways to appeal to Hispanic voters and having him on our side is an assetThe other candidates have not figured out how to deal with what some are calling the Marco moment hinting at critiques and possible antiRubio ads to come but hesitating to make Rubio their main targetDan Balz Ten months in the GOP race has no obvious frontrunnerDonald Trump has castigated Rubio on the stump and in Twitter messages as a total lightweight who is weak on immigration But under the primetime glare of Tuesday nights Republican presidential debate the outspoken mogul fell silent about the senator from FloridaWhen Sen Ted Cruz Tex tried to draw a contrast he did so only with a thickly veiled line about sugar subsidies something few voters could connect to RubioAnd although Bushs campaign previewed a litany of possible attacks on Rubio the former Florida governor didnt say a word in Milwaukee about his onetime protegeBush sees Rubio as a direct competitor for the support of wealthy donors and party leaders Bushs campaign and its allied super PAC Right to Rise have signaled possible lines of attack In a strategy presentation to donors a couple of weeks ago the Bush campaign branded Rubio disparagingly as a GOP ObamaIn the candidates Oct 28 debate Bush lunged at Rubio over his spotty Senate voting record even suggesting that he resign his seat But the offensive backfired and in the two weeks since Bush has steered away from Rubio The dilemma is further complicated by pressure from many of Bushs Floridabased financial backers who also like Rubio and want Bush to go easy on himAsked why Bush did not scrutinize Rubio during the Milwaukee exchange campaign manager Danny Diaz said the debate was a serious one where important issues were discussed and he urged reporters to stay tuned for the next debate on Dec15 We look forward to catching up with all our good friends in Las Vegas Diaz saidBushs surrogates indicated that more heat on Rubio would arrive in short orderIts a long campaign Al Cardenas a Floridabased Bush supporter who also is close to Rubio told reporters in Milwaukee Everybodys going to be scrutinized Those who do well will get scrutinized moreGOP strategist Ari Fleischer put it more bluntly The candidates will chop each other up if they thought it would help them Every one of those candidates think it should be them and they can give you every reason why it shouldnt be RubioFourth GOP debate is more about party fault lines than personal attacksThe mostly substantive nature of Tuesdays debate sponsored by Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal did not invite many personal skirmishes In one exception Rand Paul went after Rubio for wanting to increase military spending But in a tense exchange with the senator from Kentucky Rubio responded by articulating a hawkish worldview and portrayed Paul as championing an isolationist foreign policyTrump described the debates atmosphere as lacking fireworks It was amazing because the lights went on and you never know whats going to happen  are you going to be attacked and do you go for the kill right he said Wednesday on MSNBCs Morning Joe That was not really necessaryTrumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said the billionaire contender will continue to talk about his differences with Rubio especially on immigrationPeople are going to keep looking at Rubios record Lewandowski said Theyre going to ask themselves if they really want another firstterm senator as president someone who may not have the right experience Those concerns arent going awayRubios advisers presented the lack of engagement Tuesday night as a sign of Rubios strengthThe phrase where I come from is Theres no education in the second kick of the mule Terry Sullivan Rubios campaign manager told reporters I kind of feel like folks figured out that taking on Marco isnt such a great idea  I dont think anybodys really itching to take on Marco on the debate stagePerhaps the best encapsulation of Rubios good fortune came when moderator Maria Bartiromo asked him how his rsum stacks up against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clintons decades of service Rubio could not help but grin It was the softest of softballs  an opening for the 44yearold senator to cast himself as the candidate of the futureEric Fehrnstrom who was an adviser to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney said Rubio has a gift of the golden tongueBut he added I dont think any candidate on that stage thinks that theyre somehow immune from political attacks Rubios biggest vulnerability is immigration While he did not address that at length in Tuesdays debate I would expect when the attacks go up on TV that immigration will be in the mixSupporters of rival campaigns voiced surprise that Rubio was not drawn into the immigration discussion considering his leadership in 2013 on the Senates Gang of Eight pushing for comprehensive immigration reform Rubio has since disavowed the legislation and has hardened his immigration positions overallThere should be more scrutiny of Rubio no doubt about it said Bob Smith a former senator from New Hampshire who is backing Cruz Its almost as if the media is ignoring his immigration record or at least not giving it much coverage Conservatives up here however are well aware of it and my sense is that theyll continue to vet Rubio on their ownDan Pfeiffer a former senior adviser to President Obama said other Republican candidates may be afraid of tangling with Rubio in a debateRubio is skilled at delivering ascripted rehearsed counterpunch and they had to know he would be prepared Pfeiffer said He added that Cruz seems to be patiently waiting for his moment to make this attack Cruz wants to see the whites of Rubios eyes before he fires his biggest gunsIndeed Cruz has been laying the foundation for the contrast he hopes to make with Rubio if the nominating contest narrows to the two of them as some pundits predict In debate after debate Cruz has positioned himself as a hardline opponent of amnesty and more generally as a conservative puristIn his immigration comments Tuesday night Cruz did not single out Rubio But his advisers did with reporters afterwardThe freshman Texan will draw contrasts on issues Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said Senator Rubio was for the Gang of Eight Senator Cruz wasnt Right now were just beginning that and weve got three months till IowaJose A DelReal in Washington contributed to this report
