Desperate Obama RIPS Comey We Dont Operate On Innuendo By November 2 2016 Barack Obama must be pretty worried Earlier this week White House press secretary Josh Earnest told the media that FBI director James Comeys decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton didnt spring from bias or politics He explained  Director Comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the Bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed For example the president doesnt believe that Director Comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election And the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party Hes in a tough spot Hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties Now with the polls closing to within the margin of error President Obama has had second thoughts He told NowThisNews  I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks We operate based on concrete decisions that are made When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI the conclusion of the Justice Department the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable Its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  Obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo His Department of Justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism His IRS used innuendo to destroy conservative 501c3s His entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about Mitt Romneys supposed secret evils But more than anything the Obama flip here shows serious desperation What changed The polls On Monday it looked like the FBI scandal would detract from Hillarys polling numbers but wouldnt kill her Now it looks like she might go down in flames This shows how faithless Obama is  Comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened Hillarys chances at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo If Comey has any stones he should resign in protest at Obamas accusations Hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move Hillary into the White House Hes got no future in his position no matter what he does It would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell Obama and his cronies to stuff it now Tags
