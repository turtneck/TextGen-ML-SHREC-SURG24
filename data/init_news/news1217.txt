Conservatives are dismayed about the Supreme Courts complicity in rewriting the Affordable Care Act  its ratification of the IRSs disregard of the statutes plain and purposeful language But they have contributed to this outcome Their decades of populist praise of judicial deference to the political branches has borne this sour fruitThe court says the ACAs stipulation that subsidies are to be administered by the IRS using exchanges established by the State should not be construed to mean what it says Otherwise the law will not reach as far as it will if federal exchanges can administer subsidies in states that choose not to establish exchanges The ACAs legislative history however demonstrates that the subsidies were deliberately restricted to distribution through states exchanges in order to pressure the states into establishing their own exchangesThe most durable damage from Thursdays decision is not the perpetuation of the ACA which can be undone by what created it  legislative action The paramount injury is the courts embrace of a duty to ratify and even facilitate lawless discretion exercised by administrative agencies and the executive branch generallyThe courts decision flowed from many decisions by which the judiciary has written rules that favor the government in cases of statutory construction The decision also resulted from Chief Justice John G Roberts Jrs embrace of the doctrine that courts owing vast deference to the purposes of the political branches are obligated to do whatever is required to make a law efficient regardless of how the law is written What Roberts does by way of to be polite creative construing Justice Antonin Scalia dissenting calls it somersaults of statutory interpretation is legislating not judgingRoberts writes almost laconically that the ACA contains more than a few examples of inartful drafting That is his artful way of treating inartful as a synonym for inconvenient or even selfdefeatingRolling up the sleeves of his black robe and buckling down to the business of redrafting the ACA Roberts invents a corollary to Chevron deferenceNamed for a 1984 case Chevron deference has become central to the way todays regulatory state functions It says that agencies charged with administering statutes are entitled to deference when they interpret ambiguous statutory language While purporting to not apply Chevron Roberts expands it to empower all of the executive branch to ignore or rewrite congressional language that is not at all ambiguous but is inconvenient for the smooth operation of something Congress created Exercising judicial discretion in the name of deference Roberts enlarges executive discretion He does so by validating what the IRS did when it ignored the ACAs text in order to disburse billions of dollars of subsidies through federal exchanges not established by the statesChevron deference does for executive agencies what the rational basis test another judicial invention does for legislative discretionSince the New Deal courts have permitted almost any legislative infringement of economic liberty that can be said to have a rational basis Applying this extremely permissive test courts usually approve any purpose that a legislature asserts Courts even concoct purposes that legislatures neglect to articulate This fulfills the Roberts Doctrine that it is a judicial function to construe laws in ways that make them perform better meaning more efficiently than they would as written by CongressBernstein Why the Affordable Care Act is so messed upThursdays decision demonstrates how easily indeed inevitably judicial deference becomes judicial dereliction with anticonstitutional consequences We are says William R Maurer of the Institute for Justice becoming a country in which all the branches of government work in tandem to achieve policy outcomes instead of checking one another to protect individual rights Besides violating the separation of powers this approach raises serious issues about whether litigants before the courts are receiving the process that is due to them under the ConstitutionThe Roberts Doctrine facilitates what has been for a century progressivisms central objective the overthrow of the Constitutions architecture The separation of powers impedes progressivism by preventing government from wielding uninhibited power Such power would result if its branches behaved as partners in harness rather than as wary balancing rivals maintaining constitutional equipoiseRoberts says we must respect the role of the Legislature but A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan However he goes beyond understanding the plan he adopts a legislators role in order to rescue the legislatures plan from the consequences of the legislatures dubious decisions By blurring to the point of erasure constitutional boundaries he damages all institutions not least his courtRead more from George F Wills archive or follow him on Facebook
