Washington CNN President Barack Obama on Thursday effectively placed his diplomatic legacy largely in the hands of Iranian revolutionary clerics whove waged a proxy war against the US for three decadesWith a framework deal to halt Tehrans nuclear program Obama moved closer to the kind of staggering diplomatic breakthrough with the Islamic Republic that would have been unthinkable just a few years agoIf the political agreement reached in Switzerland turns into a genuine pact honored by both sides Obama will be entitled to a place in history as the leader who defused an intensely bitter estrangement with IranBut he also took personal ownership of a fraught negotiating process full of false starts and deep divisions one that hinges on the sides ability to hammer out a host of devilish details by a June 30 final deadline in the face of vocal opposition from domestic and international criticsIf the deal falls apart it will be hard to refute charges by critics that Obamas insistence on negotiating directly with US enemies  a tactic at the heart of his political philosophy  is deeply naive and futileThe risks of Obamas choice and the challenge of resolving tough issues to get to a final agreement by July were clear within minutes of news breaking that a deal was reached in LausanneObama quickly appeared in the White House Rose Garden not for the victory lap that presidents often take in this picturesque spot but to launch an impassioned defense of the contentious dealHis sales pitch was concise There is no other better way to prevent Iran from moving covertly to build a nuclear weaponWhen you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off ask them a simple question Do you really think that this verifiable deal if fully implemented backed by the worlds major powers is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East Obama saidIs it worse than doing what weve done for almost two decades with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspectionsThe question now is whether Obamas skills of persuasion  hardly his strong suit  will convince critics that his negotiators got a good deal First signs were not encouraging for the White HouseRepublican House Speaker John Boehner warned that Congress would continue to press for a vote on the deal which might derail its longterm prospects given the extent of Republican opposition Another pending bill that has the potential to scuttle the negotiations would impose additional sanctions on TehranRepublican Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina attacked the presidents posture on Thursday as he too emphasized that Congress must review a final dealWe simply cannot take President Obamas word that it is this or war he saidThe March 31 deadline  twice pushed back  was originally imposed on the process in order to help Obamas political prospects of selling the deal to Congress which has final say on lifting US sanctions on Iran Several Democrats had indicated that they planned to join with Republicans on the controversial bills but they pledged to hold up consideration of the measures until late March so Obama could show the talks were making progress and should be bolstered rather than tanked by legislatorsWhile the Republicans response Thursday demonstrated that the framework deal had not placated them skeptical Democrats were more noncommittal on how they would respondWe now need to take a close look at the details to determine if the compromises made are worth the dismantling of years of pressure built on Iran said Rep Eliot Engel of New York the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs CommitteeNew York Rep Steve Israel more clearly showed that Obama could well face an intraparty challengeThe details deserve and must get a vote by the US Congress he said in a statement Until the full details are provided to Congress on June 30th you can keep me in the highly skeptical columnObama also faces intense displeasure from many of Americas closest allies in the Middle East countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia that are directly in the Iranian line of fire They are concerned that the United States may be giving up leverage on Iran by lifting sanctions while leaving Tehrans nuclear infrastructure intactThe president nodded to this challenge in the Rose Garden when he said that he would invite the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council to Camp David this spring to discuss raging Middle East turmoil much of it aided by TehranHe also spoke to Saudi Arabias King Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with whom he has feuded over IranNetanyahu has powerful allies on Capitol Hill and will be sure to lobby for the bills seeking to constrain the administration in its dealmaking with Iran as the final deadline nearsAlready Thursday Israel called the celebrations in Switzerland disconnected from reality and said Iran would use a poor framework for a bad and dangerous deal to move towards nuclear warAnd the Obama administrations Iranian counterparts have their own treacherous path to getting approval of their part of the deal  making Obamas bold endorsement of the provisional agreement particularly perilousIrans top negotiator Foreign Minister Mohammad Javed Zarif must convince Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and hardliners in Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps to accept the deal and permit its implementationJavad Zarif will have to sell this deal like we will His task is not simple or a given a senior administration official saidLike Obama Zarif wasted no time boasting at a news conference in Switzerland that Tehran had retained its right to enrich uranium to 367 percent according to a White House fact sheet distributed at the deals announcement and would not lose its nuclear infrastructureAnd Iranian swagger like that  a political necessity for Zarif  emphasizes the very aspects of the deal that make its American critics most concernedAnother key point of contention is how comprehensive the inspections will be While the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency will have unprecedented access to Irans declared nuclear facilities under the deal many in the West wanted inspectors to have unfettered access to any site of their choosing since Tehran has hidden nuclear operations in the pastThe White House fact sheet said that the IAEA inspectors will have regular access to all of Irans facilities but did not specify how that would be achievedThe nuclear flaw in this agreement is the fact that we will not be able to go anywhere go anytime said Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for the Defense of DemocraciesThe IAEA is going to have to work with the Iranians What the Iranian government has shown over decades is the ability to defeat the IAEA with stonewalling delay and deviousnessBut the senior official said that the US negotiating team was confident that the talks on a final deal would produce an agreement on a mechanism that would resolve disputes over access to Iranian sitesSkeptics also questioned Obamas assurance that lifted sanctions could snap back in place if Iran transgressed once the agreement went into force Debates are already raging about the sequence in which sanctions will be lifted on Iran and on why the United States would bolster Irans coffers by lifting sanctions at a time when it is blaming Tehran for destabilizing the Middle EastThe White House however has other concessions to point toThe deal will cut Irans stocks of centrifuges require the conversion of an underground enrichment facility at Fordow to a research center and limit the output of another reactor at Arak among other requirementsIn return the United States and other world powers will lift sanctions that have throttled Irans economy offering it the tantalizing prospect of a return to full membership within the international communityKarim Sadjadpour an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said the deal was close to win win for both Iran and the United States He added however We dont want to get too ahead of ourselvesHe continued What was announced today is the engagement The wedding is scheduled to take place in July but there is going to be a vigorous debate about the prenuptial agreement and there is no guarantee this wedding will take place on timeThough the fourpage White House fact sheet left many technical questions unanswered the deal surprised some experts and political figures with its detail and specificityThats something that Jim Walsh from the Security Studies Program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested could help sway worried DemocratsI think they have put themselves in pretty good shape to go to that community and defend the deal They ended up with a lot more than most of us were expecting Walsh saidStill even Obama admitted that the success of the initiative was far from certain If the framework deal snags on the unresolved technical details before the final deadline on June 30 or if Tehran tries to cheat in years to come Obamas hopes of a foreign policy victory for the ages will founder as wellThe Presidents strategy has been absolutely incoherent in the Middle East in general He is pinning his legacy on this agreement Republican Rep Martha McSally of Arizona told CNNs Wolf BlitzerBut so far that legacy has received a boost from the weeks events even though Republicans tried to paint the twicedelayed announcement of the deal as a sign that Obama wouldnt be able to deliver That doesnt mean though that his fortunes couldnt change  and change quicklyYouve got quite a significant accomplishment Aaron David Miller a former US Middle East peace negotiator told CNN Is it perfect NoHe concluded He bet a lot on this Hes wrapped the last remaining 20 months of his presidency on what could be the most significant accomplishment on foreign policy  if in fact all of this holds
