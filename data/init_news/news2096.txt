Barring that what will actually happen is that Obama will veto the bill Darn so close guys And we were all so sure the 62nd time would be the charmNow this was only possible because the Senate passed a similar bill through the budget reconciliation process which is not subject to minority filibusters and allows bills to pass with a simple majority vote So Ryan didnt really do anything different than his predecessor John Boehner would have legislatively speaking But he did get to tweet out aspiffy new OnHisDesk Which in Washington is now preferable to the actual hard work of writing and passing legislation that might impact your constituents lives in tiny but positive waysHashtags and demagoguery aside whatthe GOP has actually done is start off the New Year  and the 10month push to Election Day  by voting to take away healthcare from millions of AmericansThe larger point here is that while it is still early in his tenure so far the best evidence suggeststhat Paul Ryans House of Representatives is going to be pretty much as worthless as Boehners at least this year Do the bare minimum to keep the lights on and the government performing its basic functions then placate the GOPsangry right wing by letting them pass messaging bills that President Obama will laugh right out of the Oval OfficeWeve already seen the House take on an omnibus spending bill just before Christmas that Ryan needed Democratic votes to pass while the GOPs Freedom Caucus was screaming for his head This was pretty much how Boehner used to operate The former speaker was an amiable party hack who didnt really want to shut the government down to placate the gremlins that run through rightwingers minds whenever they see a line item for Planned Parenthood in the governments budget Such shutdowns might get the base excited but they are bad for the business leaders and lobbyists who so recently held some semblance of control of the partySo Boehner would listen to the extremists pat them on their heads pay lip service to the idea that say repealing Obamacare was worth giving thousands of federal employees indefinite and unpaid vacations and then at the last minute go negotiate with Nancy Pelosi to keep the lights on This was a terrible way to run the nation and it eventually cost Boehner his jobThere was never any reason to believe any of this would change with Ryan at the helm But when the GOP was begging him to take the job party leaders sold him as the only man who could unite his fractious caucus Ryan himself promised the far right that he would return to them some of the power Boehner had yanked that he would listen to their concerns without condescension and that he would take action on the issues most important to them He was helped by Boehner secretly negotiating one final spending deal with Obama which allowed Ryan to pass the latest omnibus while telling conservatives that gosh darn it he hated to vote for such a monstrosity but his wily predecessor left him no choice None of this is to say that Ryan and Boehner are ideologically similar Ryan has long been a zealot on supplyside economics demonstrating a Randian belief in radically cutting the size of government mostly on the backs of the poor Boehner on the other hand while generally conservative never met an ideological principle he wouldnt trade away for a bottle of Scotch and someone else paying his greens fees But Ryan is pragmatic enough to understand his goals are unreachable by fullfrontal assault So you get him passing the omnibus and following it up with this latest attempt at repealing Obamacare You have him slamming President Obamas mild executive actions on guns over which at least one Republican is threatening to shut down part of the executive branch which keeps anyone from noticing the giant gift the business wing of the party is about to hand Volkswagen and its lobbyists after the automaker was caught earlier this year in a systemic violation of the Clean Air Act In terms of the results hes getting in the House Ryan is basically Boehner with cleaner lungs and minusthe rambling winedrunk press conferences It remains to be seen whether this twofaced act will carry out through the entire year The far right has been grumbling and Ryans approval ratings have dropped If the GOP thinks it has a real shot at winning the White House while retaining control of both houses of Congress Ryan might be able to keep the right wing in line by pointing out the bonanza that will result for them with President Ted Cruz in the Oval Office But if a Democrat takes the oath of office a year from now farright Republicans  and the GOP electorate in general  will be screaming very loudly for his scalp
