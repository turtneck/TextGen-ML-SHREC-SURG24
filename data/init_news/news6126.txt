 Cyber War  From Trifle to Catastrophe By Ernest PartridgeNovember 06 2016  Information Clearing House   Hillary Clinton tells us that all seventeen intelligence agencies agree that the Wikileaks hack comes from the Kremlin Those agencies proclaim this with a rocksolid conviction that I have not heard since Vice President DIck Cheney told us all that there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us Add to that the rocksolid evidence of Saddams treachery that Colin Powell presented to the UN Security Council The mainstream corporate media bought it wholeHowever as all know today these were lies Saddam had no WMDs and there were no Iraqi chemical weapons Winebagos of Death vividly described by Colin PowellNow we are told with high confidence that Vladimir Putins Kremlin has launched a cyber attack to disrupt our presidential election Never mind that as MIT expert Theodore Postol has written that there is no technical way that the US intelligence community could know who did the hacking if it was done by sophisticated nationstate actorsThe lies that launched the disastrous Iraq war have had lasting consequences to the credibility of the United States Government The last time that government cried wolf there was no wolf Why should we believe it nowSo no I am not convinced There is good reason not to believe the Kremlin hack storyA crucial distinction is in order First there is the actual content of the hacked emails Second there are the consequences of the general media assumption and public belief that the emails were a Kremlin plot to disrupt the presidential electionAs for the content  it was trivial and still worse not credible There is nothing remarkable in the disclosed content of the hacked emails They might if believed cause John Podesta some embarrassment In addition they might reveal that the Democratic National Committee is controlled by a political elite But we already know thatBut why should we believe any of that content If as claimed the leaks came from the Kremlin there is not and cannot be any authentication of the hacked emails unless the original sources eg John Podesta produce the originals And why would they Accordingly the leakers whoever they might be are free to concoct forgeries at will And of course it follows that we the intended audience are advised to ignore all of themFurthermore  why would Putin want to use these emails to rig our election To tilt the election toward Trump If that is his motive it has backfired spectacularly That alleged disclosure of the hacking has benefited Clinton far more than Trump It is one of her favorite talking points as we discovered in the final debateSo we are left with two alternate conclusions The Russian government likely had no part in the leaking Or if they did the leaks will have little or no effect on the election except to provide Hillary Clinton with a talking point and to embarrass John PodestaIn short the Wikileaks hacks whatever the source appear to be a just a prank A trifle blown hugely out of proportion by a scandalhungry mediaHowever even though the content of the hacked emails may be trivial and not credible the consequences of the accusation of Kremlin connivance could be catastrophicFirst of all as we are finding out the neocons and the media are using the hacks to intensify the demonization of Putin and to heat up the renewed Cold WarStill worse as Joe Biden stated recently on Meet the Press  the accusation that Putin is behind the hacks and their release might provoke a cyber retaliation from the United StatesA Kremlin spokesman has called Bidens threat a a virtual American declaration of war on RussiaIf as Biden warns the United States retaliates then the Russian response might unlike the present alleged leaks be devastating to the US economyBe assured that a cyberwar entails infinitely more than leaked emails It might include the shutdown of the internet and emails Also the disruption of business and financial communications and utility grids The world today runs on silicon and microprocessors Imagine returning home to no electric power phone service or access to the internet Add to that no restocking of the local supermarket or gas stations And no capability of the government to make prompt repairs The result Total economic shutdownWe can do this to Russia and be assured that Russia can do this to usThe reality of cyber attacks is no mere speculation we have seen them at work The Iranian nuclear weapons program was severely damaged and set back by a CIA implanted computer virus And this past month large regions of the United States temporarily lost internet service The cause remains unknownHas Joe Biden thought through the implications of his threat Is this the horror that Biden wants to unleash on us and the world in response to an essentially harmless prank To what purpose Some kind of capitulation by the Russians No chance of thatA far more likely result would be an escalation from cyber to military combat And then whatWhere are the coolheaded grownups now that we need themDr Ernest Partridge is a consultant writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy He has taught Philosophy at the University of
