a big and growing group an estimated 23 of the electoratefour years agoand expected to be a bit more this year and they have voted Republican in every presidential election since at least 1952Four years ago Mitt Romney won their support by a solid 14 percentage points according to surveys of voters as they left polling places But in the latest Pew Research Center poll taken last month Clinton

places like Chester County in PennsylvaniaDouglas County in ColoradoDelaware County in OhioWake County in North Carolinaand Fairfax County in Virginia those changing allegiances createformidable problemsfor Trump in states he needs to winthe White House While national polls give the businessman and reality TV star a 21 lead among white voters who dont have a college education Democrats

Bill ClintonOn a sunny Saturday near summers end the weekly farmersmarket tucked on an open lot in downtown West Chester is bustling with shoppers eyeing stacks of tomatoes and cornsix kinds of apples early pumpkins and gourds and homemadepies and cobblersMargot McKee who works in real estate sales and describes her age only as old enough to know betterbought a maple oat muffin to eat laterIn April shevoted for Trump in Pennsylvanias GOP primary He trounced his rivals winning 57 of the vote over Texas Sen Ted Cruz 22 and Ohio Gov John Kasich 19But now she anguishes overwhat to do in NovemberI think hes done a great job in getting peoples attention to some issues that have been neglected and Congress is dysfunctional and politicians are dysfunctional and they dont seem willing to do their jobs shebegins But she says Trump needs to grow up and learn to keep his mouth shut first describinghim as impossible and then calling him an unprintable epithetWhat about Clinton McKee sighs Imdrawn to her because of her experience and her even manner but Im not sure that shes honest adding unhappily thatthe Clintons seem to know how to duck and bobIm so disgusted Im thinking that maybe Im not going to vote she muses something shes never done beforeButthen thats a copoutThe four collar counties around Philadelphia Bucks Chester Delaware andMontgomery  in the past haveprovided Republican margins to help neutralize the Democratic advantage in the city itself In the past 12 presidential elections Chester has voted for the Democratic candidate only once in 2008 But Democrats have become increasingly competitive in the suburban counties which include about a third of the states votersIn 2012 Romney lost the other threeand carried Chester by just twotenths of a percentage point the closest margin in the stateThe county has a population of about 516000 and half have college degrees the highest proportion in the state Average household incomes are well above the state average unemployment is well below and voter turnout is high Four years ago seven in 10of the votingage citizens in Chester cast ballotsThe countys residents are overwhelmingly white Just 6 are African American 7 LatinoEven so it is Trumps provocative rhetoric about Mexicans Muslims and immigrants that seems to havecreated the biggest backlash among Chester County votersTypically here its having a fiscal conservative thats most important to Chester County voters but this race is transcending traditional issues Chester County Republican Chairman Val DiGiorgio a lawyer says Whats important here and determinative here is whether Donald Trump can show himself to be someone who reaches out to a broader segment of the population as opposed to what he did during the primaries Were still waiting to see whether thats the caseDiGiorgio who endorsed Florida Sen Marco Rubio in the Republican primary now supports Trump and is putting all our efforts to make sure hes elected president He says the New York billionaire has drawn more volunteers than usual to the local GOP organizationBut the Republican county committees home pagewhich among other things offers GOPbrandedwine made from grapes grown in Chester County on Monday didntmention Trumps name or the presidential race The websitestab listing 2016 candidates includedstatewide and local contenders but not the top of the ticketTo be fair the home page of the Chester County Democratic Committee didnt mention Clinton either though she was listed on the 2016 candidates tabBut a banner across the top of the page declaredIf you dont vote the whole ballot you are not doing your full part against TrumpismJust how much impact Trump could have down the ballot is a worry for Republicans and a hope for Democrats In a statewide Franklin  Marshall College Poll taken last month Clinton led Trump by 7 points 4740 and Democratic Senate challenger Katie McGinty led incumbent Republican Pat Toomey by 5 points 4338 The hardfought Keystone Staterace is one of a handful expected to determine control of the SenateThe fact is shes the beneficiary of Clinton emerging into the lead G Terry Madonna director of the poll and a professor of public affairs says of McGinty I think if its five points or less Toomey has a good chance of winning But if Clinton wins the state by more than 5 points Trump may leave Toomey with too much ground to make up among voters willing to split their ticketComitta who is challenging threeterm Republican incumbent Dan Truitt forthe state House of Representatives enthusiastically backs Clinton But she generally tries to talk about local and state issues not the national race as she campaignsShe stopsby the farmers market after a morning of walking doortodoor on this recent day distributing fliers that dont mention party affiliation instead describing her asMom Educator MayorI hear from some people who love hersome people who would never vote for her and some who will vote for her because they cant imagine Trump being president she says of Clinton Because the two candidates are so polarizing and I have to win my race Im not going there Thats a whole other conversationTrump does have enthusiastic supporters in Chester County and Linda Ives is one of themYou look at a human being as a body of work and I think that the gentleman has without a doubt provided opportunities job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of people and after watching his children at the convention I was most impressed says Ives 54 a retired US Army captain who now works as a consultantShe also is motivated by fierce opposition to Clinton She calls the former secretary of Statea criminal for her role in the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya and her carelessness with sending classified information on her private email serverIf I had sent one unclassified email like that I would be at Fort Leavenworth right now I would be in jail Ives says She is concerned about Trumps delivery but she also says unfair news coverage is contributing to his problemsI think people are embarrassed to say theyre supporting Trump she says I think whats happening is sorry guys the liberal media is just pushing the whole The man is a ridiculous clown I mean hes getting portrayed as a ridiculous clown and the only people who aregoing to vote for him is the young uneducated male So people are then Im an educated personwhy would I be stupid enough to vote for Trump Indeed the electoral shift among collegeeducated whites in just four years has been of historic proportions particularly for such a large group of votersIn Donald Trump you have a perfect storm of a candidate in terms of pressing buttons to sending white collegeeducated voters particularly women in the other direction says Ruy Teixeira codirector of States of Change anonpartisan project that studies the impact of demographic trends on elections These are not voters who are protectionist or antiimmigrant He represents a type of Republicanism or strand of the Republican Party that they probably like the leastWhats not clear yet is whether Republicanleaning voters like those in Chester County who plan to vote for Clinton this time will stick with Democrats down the roadSome of this is peculiar to Trump but I do think that Trumps success reflects the way the bases of the two parties have changedsays political scientist Alan Abramowitz of Emory University The 2016 race may accelerate longterm trendsthat are reshapingthe historic perceptionof Democrats as the party of bluecollar workers and Republicans as the party of whitecollar workersEspecially at the presidential level now Republicans are the party of the white working classAbramowitz saysMeanwhile Lisa Cromley 53 a middleschool English and history teacher shops at the farmers market andthen drops by a Democratic campaign storefront around the cornerI am so concerned about Trump that I dont know where to begin she says then ticks off a list Im concerned that he doesnt know any issues hes not a politician He doesnt have a legal background he really has a business background and the business background he has isnt even something that I think translatesIm concerned about his attitude toward most of the people who make up our pluralistic nation our multicultural nation Im concerned that he doesnt think before he speaksShe picksup a yard sign and a bumper sticker for Clinton hoping the public displays of support willencourage voters who may be reluctant to support herButI try not to talk to people about this campaign Cromley adds Its so divisiveTo report this series the USA TODAY Network identified eight counties around the country that represent key voting groups in the November election from bluecollar
