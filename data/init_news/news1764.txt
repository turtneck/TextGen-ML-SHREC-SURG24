Donald Trump keeps saying that voter fraud could cost him the election a charge that threatens confidence in US elections But theres no evidence the type of fraud he alleges is rampantSupporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wait for his arrival at a campaign rally at the University of North Carolina Wilmington on Aug 9 The GOP presidential nominee claimed Clinton supporters could vote 15 times without a voter ID lawDonald Trump has been claiming of late that if he loses in November it will be because the election was rigged After all he says look at the big enthusiastic crowds he attracts at his eventsOf course massive crowds do not necessarily foretell victory Often they are more a sign of passion and devotion or the entertainment value of a candidate and dont guarantee success  as Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders saw in his losing battle for the Democratic presidential nominationMr Trump it appears is preparing the groundwork to lose as his poll numbers in key electoral battlegrounds sink In the meantime hes calling on his supporters to register online as volunteer election observers and in the process is also gathering voter contact information and asking for contributions So in a way the rigged election cries are just another avenue for voter engagementBut more ominously Trump threatens to delegitimize the outcome in November if he loses and convinces his supporters that Hillary Clinton stole the election That could undermine the very fabric of American democracySomething like this is unprecedented as far as I know  where a major presidential contender openly raises doubts about the legitimacy of an election before the vote and without any evidence says Matthew Kerbel political science chairman at Villanova University in PennsylvaniaWhats more it would be extraordinarily difficult to rig a presidential election in the way Trump suggests Professor Kerbel says Youre talking about rigging an election in the Electoral College where you would have to rig a combination of statesPerhaps the biggest protection to US elections is their decentralized nature The US Constitution and federal law give states broad leeway in how they run elections resulting in a multitude of voting systems even within states So to rig the results of a national election at the ballot box or with absentee ballots a vast conspiracy would be requiredTrump has centered his allegations of planned cheating in a handful of key states In Pennsylvania he has bemoaned the fact that the commonwealth does not require a voter to present photo identification to cast a ballotWe dont want to see people voting five times folks Trump said last Friday in Altoona Pa I dont even know maybe you should go down and volunteer or do something But without voter ID theres no way youre going to be able to check it properlyEarlier in the week in Wilmington NC Trump suggested that Clinton supporters could now vote 15 times for her given the federal appeals court ruling last month rejecting the states voter ID law The law which also ended sameday registration and shortened the states earlyvoting period had a racially discriminatory intent the ruling saidTrump has also raised the prospect of voter fraud in Ohio another critical battleground stateBut the kind of cheating Trump envisions on a mass scale is virtually impossible to pull off  including in states that dont require the showing of a photo ID Even in such states to vote 10 or 15 times one would have to go to 10 or 15 different polling places and provide the names and addresses of people who live in those precincts and had not yet votedThe call for Trump Election Observers creates the appearance that inperson voter fraud is common But election experts call the rate of such fraud vanishingly small In 2014 an investigation by Justin Levitt a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles found only 31 credible incidents of voter impersonation out of 1 billion votes cast in the US between 2000 and 2014To put that number in perspective someone is more than three times more likely to win the jackpot in Pennsylvanias Cash 5 lottery as they are to have impersonated another voterWhats more Professor Levitt points out people in states with voter ID laws did not have greater confidence in the integrity of their elections than voters in states without such lawsThe factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair Whether their preferred candidates win Levitt writesAnother issue for the Trump campaign is the matter of a 1982 court order that limits the Republican National Committees ability to challenge the eligibility of voters at polling places The order bars the RNC and its agents from engaging in voter intimidation especially in areas with large minority populations The Trump campaign could plausibly be judged an agent of the RNC says election law expert Rick Hasen of the University of California at Irvine and thus the Trump observers activities could risk violating the order And that he says could extend the order beyond its Dec 1 2017 expirationTrumps warnings of a rigged election could have another offshoot suppressing his own voteOne recent poll shows a decline in the likelihood that Trump supporters will turn out a trend that election data guru Nate Silver suggests may belinked to Trumps message about fraudIn addition a recent experiment by two academics suggested that the message of a rigged election was less effective at mobilizing voters than a more positive message registering is quick easy and freeTrump voters already appear primed to believe that if he loses in November it will be because the election was rigged A Bloomberg poll released last week found that 34 percent of all voters and 56 percent of Trump voters believe the election results will be riggedIn a poll of North Carolina voters last week by the Democraticleaning Public Policy Polling fully 69 percent of Trump supporters said they believed that if Clinton wins the election it will be because the election was riggedOf course American history is replete with examples of election hankypanky over the years including ballots being cast by dead peopleThe contested presidential election of 2000 which boiled down to a 537vote margin in Florida and ultimately a ruling by the Supreme Court remains a hotly debated episode In 2004 some Democrats were convinced that their nominee John Kerry was the victim of voter fraud in Ohio  a state that had he won would have handed him the electionWhats different now is that Trumps charges are being leveled well before Election Day And hes not even focused on what could pose a real threat to the integrity of American elections hackersTheres vital interest in our election process Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at a Monitor breakfast Aug 3 Were actively thinking about the election and cybersecurity right nowIn a phone call Monday Secretary Johnson offered federal assistance to state officials in managing the risk to voting systemsFor Trump the claim that fraud could swing the election is losing its salience as his poll numbers head south Irregularities matter only in a close election and as of now its not looking close But no one is calling the election over and the rigged election argument isnt going away
