The four men  two of them brothers  who turned ordinary morning commutes in Brussels into bloodsoaked nightmares may have been spurred into action by fears that authorities were closing in on them according to a note left by one of the attackers that was described by a prosecutor WednesdayDays before the attacks on Tuesday counterterrorism police had raided their Brussels safe houses An ally who took part in Novembers Paris carnage was shot and captured by authorities And Ibrahim elBakraoui a 29yearold Belgian with a thick rap sheet wrote that he did not want to wind up in a prison cell Belgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said WednesdayThe men  at least two of whom had direct ties to the Islamic State attacks in Paris  knew they had to act decisively So they set out with explosives that ripped open a Brussels subway car and shattered the citys main airport terminal killing at least 31 people and injuring 300 in the bloodiest attack on Belgian soil since World War IIBakraoui detonated a suitcase full of nails screws and powerful explosives at the airport killing himself in the process Van Leeuw said So did Islamic State bombmaker Najim Laachraoui 24 who is also believed to have prepared explosives for the Paris attacks according to an Arab intelligence official and a European intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publiclyAn unidentified man who left an even larger suitcase of explosives at the airport is believed to still be at large he said That suitcase did not immediately detonate sparing Belgium even more casualtiesThe country held a national minute of silence Wednesday led by Prime Minister Charles Michel who laid a wreath at the Maelbeek metro station in honor of the victims Thousands of Belgians gathered in a somber ceremony in front of an ornate 19thcentury stock exchange building to light candles and lay flowersThe missive contained in a computer that had been chucked into a garbage can near Bakraouis Brussels apartment does not specifically cite recent raids across Belgium including one that netted a key suspect in the Paris attacks But its tone suggests a sense that the noose was tightening Van Leeuw saidThe computer message also gives apparent insight into the organization and motivation of militants who apparently turned their attention to Brussels after pulling off the Paris attacks that killed 130 peopleIn the note Bakraoui described feeling pressure bearing down He wrote that he was in a hurry no longer knowing what to do being searched for everywhere no longer secure according to Van Leeuws description of the message which was not made publicLaachraouis involvement draws the boldest line yet between the Paris attacks and those in Brussels His DNA was found on explosives in the Paris attacks and authorities believe that he was versed in the Islamic State art of assembling powerful explosives from ingredients that are readily available His participation in two attacks suggests that the Islamic State is increasingly able to strike on European soil  although his death may also mean that he feared imminent capture by European authoritiesTerrorism experts regard bombmakers especially those trained in handling sensitive explosives as among the most valuable and protected members of a terrorist organization It is highly unusual for them to participate in suicide attacks themselvesWhy is Brussels under attackLaachraouis DNA was found in a Brussels apartment raided last week The discovery of a militant cell there eventually led to the arrest of Salah Abdeslam on Friday Abdeslam was the final atlarge direct participant in the Paris attacks and is believed to have been the logistics mastermindThe computer file that prosecutors cited Wednesday does not mention Abdeslam by name but it says the attackers feared that if they did not strike quickly they risked winding up in prison alongside himIf they drag on they risk finishing next to him in a cell Van Leeuw said paraphrasing the contents of the fileVan Leeuw described the file as a will discovered on a computer He did not explain why authorities believed the computer belonged to BakraouiBakraouis younger brother Khalid elBakraoui 27 is believed to have been the suicide bomber on a Brussels subway car that blew up as it sped out of a station underneath the heart of the European Union quarter of Brussels an area packed with embassies and international organizations That attack came 73minutes after the one at the airport meaning that commuters were already reading the news of the first explosions when the carnage reached themKhalid elBakraoui appears to have been a kind of surreptitious real estate broker for the plotters according to a European security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case Using assumed names he rented an apartment in the Forest area of Brussels where Abdeslams fingerprints were found and an apartment near Charleroi Belgium where Paris attack mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud stayed as he plotted the violenceBoth Bakraoui brothers served prison time for violent crime the European security official said The announcement on Wednesday that two of the attackers were brothers highlighted another emerging tactic from the militant group They would be the third pair of brothers involved in an Islamic State attack in Europe in the past 15 monthsEuropean security leaders planned to gather Thursday in Brussels to discuss whether to pursue new policies that would better pool information to counter terrorismFrench Prime Minister Manuel Valls visiting Brussels on Wednesday to extend his condolences repeated past calls for sweeping new powers to be given to European intelligence agencies In the years to come the EU member states will have to invest massively in their security systems he saidBrussels terrorists probably used explosive nicknamed the Mother of SatanVan Leeuw the Belgian prosecutor said the brothers had not previously been suspected of ties to terrorismTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey had deported one of the attackers to Europe in July and warned European counterterrorism officials that it believed the man was a militant suggesting a serious lapse by Belgian authorities Interpol had also issued a red notice effectively an international arrest warrant for one of the suspects at the request of Belgian authorities It was not immediately clear when that notice had been issuedThere were signs that an even bigger attack had been forestalled Authorities found large stockpiles of bombbuilding materials at Ibrahim elBakraouis apartment in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels the prosecutor said 33 pounds of TATP explosives nearly 40 gallons of acetone 8 gallons of hydrogen peroxide detonators and a suitcase full of nails and screws Both acetone and hydrogen peroxide are easily obtainable together they can be used to make potent explosivesIt remained unclear Wednesday how many Americans had been killed in the blasts In Washington State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said that approximately a dozen Americans were injured but that a number of US citizens remained unaccounted for on Wednesday  without providing more specific figures He said that US diplomatic
