Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters speaking of its inaction on the Obama administrations request for nearly 2 billion to take extensive preventative measures such as developing vaccines and widespread mosquito controlI take no joy in suggesting that Republicans are going to look back on this time that theyve had to act on the Zika virus and deeply regret it Earnest addedThe White House slammed members of Congress over the administrations decision to shift more than half a billion dollars that was designated for fighting Ebola to instead be used against ZikaThe Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly  a condition in which a developing fetus brain fails to fully grow and babies are born with unusually small heads  as well as GuillainBarre syndrome which causes the body to attack its own nervesOfficials said Wednesday there have been 64 confirmed cases of Zika in pregnant women in the continental US One baby has been born with microcephaly in Hawaii and more cases are being investigated So far the US cases appear to have been contracted in other countries where the virus has been circulating The White House stressed that even with the shift in funds from the Ebola coffers the current amount of money available wont be enough to adequately prepare for what the World Health Organization has called a global health emergency At some point later this spring or maybe later this summer all of you and your news organizations are going to be sounding the alarm about the significant threat that is posed by the Zika virus Earnest said That is going to happen But as Earnest was briefing reporters the House Appropriations Committee put out a statement explaining its position More than a month ago we called on the administration to use existing funding and legal authorities to provide the most immediate and effective response to the Zika outbreak the statement said We are pleased to hear today that federal agencies are heeding our call And offering some reassurance in the face of the White Houses ominous predictions the statement said As we move forward the Appropriations Committee will continue to monitor the changing needs resulting from this unpredictable crisis to assure the resources necessary for the response are available In the White Houses view though until Congress approves more funding theres a risk The Office of Management and Budget devoted a blog post to the problem on Wednesday saying Without the full amount of requested emergency supplemental funding many activities that need to start now would have to be delayed or curtailed or stopped within months
