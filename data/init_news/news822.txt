Heres something interesting from The Unz Review Recipient Name Recipient Email  Donald Trumps red wave on Election Day was an unprecedented body blow against neoliberalism The stupid early1990s prediction about the end of history turned into a  possible  shock of the new The new global nativism Perhaps a new push towards democratic socialism Too early to tell Once again A body blow not a death blow Like the cast of The Walking Dead the zombie neoliberal elite simply wont quit For the Powers That BeDeep StateWall Street axis theres only one game in town and that is to win at all costs Failing that to knock over the whole chessboard as in hot war Hot war has been postponed at least for a few years Meanwhile its enlightening to observe the collective American and Eurocrat despair about a world they cant understand anymore Brexit Trumpquake the rise of the farright across the West For the insulated financialtechthinktank elites of liquid modernity criticism of neoliberalism  with is inbuilt deregulation privatization agogo austerity obsession  is anathema The angry white blue collar Western uprising is the ultimate backlash against neoliberalism  an instinctive reaction against the rigged economic casino capitalism game and its subservient political arms Thats at the core of Trump winning noncollege white voters in Wisconsin by 28 points Blaming whitelash  racism WikiLeaks or Russia is no more than childish diversionary tactics The key question is whether the backlash may engender a new Western drive towards democratic socialism  read David Harveys books for the road map  or just nostalgic nationalism raging against the neoliberal WashingtonEUNAFTA globalization machine Read my lips much lower taxes Trump is proposing to turn the tables on the neoliberal game Throughout his campaign he criminalized free trade  the essence of globalization  for decimating the American working class even as US businesses blamed free trade for forcing them to squeeze workers wages So lets see how Trump will be able to impose his priorities In parallel to addressing the appalling structural decline in US manufacturing he wants to pull a China a massive 1 trillion infrastructure project over 10 years via publicprivate partnerships and private investments encouraged by lower taxes Thats supposed to create a wealth of jobs Lower corporate taxes in this case translate into a whopping 3 trillion over 10 years something like 16 percent of GDP That would be the way to incite huge multinationals to repatriate the hundreds of billions of dollars in profits stashed abroad This fiscal shock would create 25 million jobs in the US over the next 10 years and propel a 4 percent growth rate And then theres the protectionist drive that will renegotiate NAFTA and kill TPP for good Not to mention raising import tariffs over manufactured products many by delocalized US multinationals imported from China and Mexico Its open to fierce debate how Trumponomics will manage to square the circle with more economic growth fueled by less taxes imports will rise to satisfy internal demand But if these products are subjected to stiffer tariffs they will become more expensive and inflation will inevitably rise Anyway the bottom line of protectionist Trumponomics would be a huge blow against global trade Deglobalization anyone Asia braces for impact Predictably the heart of deglobalization will be the TrumpChina relationship Throughout the campaign Trump blamed China for currency manipulation and proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports In Hong Kong banking circles no one believes in it Key argument the already strapped basket of deplorables simply wont have the means to pay more for these Chinese imports Another thing entirely would be for Trumponomics to find mechanisms to hurt US companies that delocalize in Asia That would translate into serious problems for outsourcing Meccas such as India and the Philippines Outsourcing in the Philippines for instance serves mostly US companies and attracts revenue as crucial to the nation as total Filipino worker remittances from abroad something like 9 percent of GDP Its quite enlightening in this context to consider what Narayana Murthy  founder of Indian IT major Infosys  told the CNBC TV18 network What is in the best interest of America is for its corporations to succeed for its corporations to create more jobs to export more so Im very positive Four months ago Nomura Holdings Inc issued a report titled Trumping Asia  No less than 77 percent of respondents expected Trump to brand China a currency manipulator and 75 percent predicted he will impose tariffs on exports from China South Korea and Japan So no wonder all across Asia the next months will be nervewracking Asia  and not only China  is the factory of the world Any Trump trade restriction over China will reverberate all across Asia Brace for impact deglobalized Trumponomics vs Neoliberalism will be a battle for the ages Pepe Escobar is the author of Globalistan How the Globalized World is Dissolving into Liquid War Nimble Books 2007 Red Zone Blues a snapshot of Baghdad during the surge
