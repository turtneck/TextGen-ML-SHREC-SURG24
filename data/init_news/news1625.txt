Theres evidence that when weighing Donald Trump versus rival Ted Cruz many Republican leaders have become more concerned about Senator CruzDonald Trump speaks to a crowd on Jan 4 2016 in Lowell Mass Thousands attended the rally in packed Paul E Tsongas Center Arena at the Lowell campus of the University of MassachusettsIs the Republican establishment  or at least some of it  coming to terms with the possibility that Donald Trump will be the GOP presidential nomineeA number of signs in recent days indicate thats the case Or to be more specific theres evidence that when weighing Mr Trump versus rival Ted Cruz many Republican leaders think Senator Cruz the greater danger Thats an implicit admission that theyre beginning to think Trump might not be you know so badLets go to the list Earlier this month rightleaning New York Times columnist David Brooks unloaded on Cruz saying the Texas senators speeches are full of a sort of pagan brutalism Since then two former Republican Senate majority leaders Trent Lott and Bob Dole have indicated they think a Cruz nomination would be cataclysmic for the GOP and lead to widespread losses down the ticketThen this week the Republican governor of Iowa Terry Branstad said flatly that he hopes anyone but Cruz wins his states firstinthenation caucuses True Governor Branstad cited Cruzs opposition to ethanol subsidies crucial to Iowas economy as the reason for his opposition But the open and vehement nature of the antiendorsement indicated a high level of political enmityIt is no surprise that the establishment is in full panic mode Cruz told reporters after hearing of this newsWhy does this imply anything about Trump Well the Iowa caucuses are now less than two weeks away The New Hampshire primary is within three The primary season moves quickly through South Carolina and other states after that If the Republican Party as an entity is to exert influence on the nominating process now is the timeMany have expected Republican leaders to band together against Trump given that some party figures see him as an existential threat to the GOP in its current form That doesnt seem to be occurringThe sort of GOP effort against Trump that many anticipated is happening instead vs Cruz tweeted Sunlight Foundation political analyst Richard Skinner on ThursdayYes this description of the state of play is a bit simplistic The Republican establishment is not a cohesive entity chaired by the ghost of Nelson Rockefeller Many GOP journalists and public intellectuals continue to worry that Trump with his belligerent populism will push the party so far from its smallgovernment roots that it will become unrecognizableWhat were seeing is the attempt at the normalization of Trump on the right and defining conservatism down Can be resisted and defeated tweeted rightleaning Weekly Standard editor William Kristol earlier this weekBut the fact remains that the legislative Washington wing of the party now seems inclined to cut Trump slack Mr Dole the partys nominee in 1996 said in a New York Times interview that Trump could probably work with Congress because hes got the right personality and hes kind of a dealmakerIt may be as simple as that Trump for all his insults is the kind of person members of Congress understand Hes a businessman who knows that deals arent all onesided and a political neophyte who would be willing to defer to their judgment Thats the theory anywayCruz Hes proved that the only legislative opinion he listens to is his own in the view of the establishment Many in the GOP believe he pushed them into the 2013 government shutdown and then blamed their lack of courage for the shutdowns inevitable collapseConsider this Back in the 2008 campaign questions arose about whether nominee John McCain was a natural born citizen and thus eligible for the presidency under the Constitution because he was born in the Canal Zone The Senate quickly moved to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming Senator McCains citizenship When Cruz became embroiled in the same question because of his Canadian birth that did not happenI just dont think the Senate ought to get into the middle of this said majority leader Mitch McConnell of the issue on ABC Newss This Week earlier this monthDoes the GOP establishment think it can block Cruz then turn to oppose Trump and boost someone else Maybe but its getting late to pull off that kind of maneuver Trump may rocket through the first primaries and then who could head him off Jeb Bush Hey hes at 10 percent in some New Hampshire pollsAre GOP figures counting on influencing someone whos not that easy to push around Sure Trump knows little about the daytoday operation of government That doesnt mean hell be Silly Putty in Senator McConnells hands Hes a billionaire with little vested interest in the party per seHe might well completely ignore Congresss wishes and just do whatever feels right to him on any given day Trumps primary goal over the past several decades has been to enhance the Trump name What policies that translates into is anyones guess writes Seth Masket at VoxOr does the party leadership still think that somehow or other without its involvement Trump is just going to lose
