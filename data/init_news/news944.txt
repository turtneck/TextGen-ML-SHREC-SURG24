Today President Obama will roll out the final version of the EPAsClean Power Plan an ambitious effort to reduce carbon emissions from power plants by nearly onethird from 2005 levels by 2030 This seems likely to set in motion an ideological death struggle that will rival the one over Obamacare  but with arguably even higher stakesThats because the longterm success of the new EPA rule  presuming it survives legal challenges  will depend to no small degreeon the actions of the next president The states dont have to tell the federal government how they will seek to meet the rules carbon emissions targets  many GOP states may not comply until around the time Obamas presidency is ending and beyond With implementation set to stretch out over many years a Republican president could seek to relax or undo the plan as Jason Plautz notesWhats more the stakes are extremely high here because the success of this plan could help determine the viability of longterminternational efforts to combat climate change With an international climate accord expected soon the fate of Obamas plan will help determine whether the US can keep its end of the carbonemissionreducing bargain As the New York Times puts itClimate scientists warn that rising greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly moving the planet toward a global atmospheric temperature increase of 36 degrees Fahrenheit the point past which the world will be locked into a future of rising sea levels more devastating storms and droughts and shortages of food and water Mr Obamas new rules alone will not be enough to stave off that future But experts say that if the rules are combined with similar action from the worlds other major economies as well as additional action by the next American president emissions could level off enough to prevent the worst effects of climate changeBen Adler adds that Obamas plan is the centerpiece of any realistic program to meetthe intended targets we have outlined ahead of the Paris climate talks that will take place later this year Indeed Congressional Republicans are encouraging GOP governors to resist the new rule with the explicit purpose of undermining the chances of getting an international climate deal by sowing doubts as to whether the US can meet its own pledgesThus the next president may well determine whetherthis plan helps lay the foundation for future international cooperation designed to avert an outcome that many scientists think could be irreversible That will thrust the issue into the presidential race making it perhaps more important than in previous cyclesHillary Clinton issued a strong statement pledging to defend Obamas plan against Republican doubters and defeatists a sign her campaign sees this issue as a good point of contrast with which to cast the GOP as the party of the pastAnd indeed the major Republican presidential candidates have already come out against the plan But this is only the beginning An international climate accord could be reached at the end of the year  just when the GOP presidential primaries are sorry I cant resist this heating up in a big wayGiven that this would combine Obummer Mandates with a neweffort atinternational engagement that many GOP primary voters will likely oppose it could perhaps make Obamas climate push even more ideologically toxic to Republicans requiring the GOP candidates to outdo one another in their zeal to oppose it KEY DEM CONGRESSMAN BACKS IRAN DEAL Dem Rep Adam Schiffa proIsrael moderate who is respected on foreign policy by many Democratscomes out in favor of the Iran deal in an interview with Jeffrey GoldbergAs Goldberg notes this could influenceundecided Jewish Dems Proponents are increasingly pushing back on the notion that opposing the deal is the only proIsrael position SCHUMER LEANING AGAINST IRAN DEAL Politico reports on the intense pressure from both sides on Senator Chuck Schumer as he makes up his mind on whether to support the Iran deal Politico suggests hes leaning against it ButKeep an eye on that if Schumer does oppose the deal he may not do so all that loudly and enough Dems could still support it to prevent Obamas veto of disapproval measure from being overridden The White House cant lose more than a dozen Dems WARREN COMES OUT FOR IRAN DEAL Senator Elizabeth Warren has just come out in favor of it That isnt surprising but its a reminder that if Schumer opposes it hell antagonize the left in a big way  and hes set to become next Senate Dem leader POLL FINDS BROAD OPPOSITION TO IRAN DEAL A new Quinnipiac poll finds that Americans oppose the nuclear deal with Iran by 5728 The poll doesnt define the deal anda recent Washington Post poll that did define it foundmajority support But this does suggest that proponents may have a great deal of work to do if Americans are broadly inclined against it out of distrust of IranMeanwhile a new YouGov poll that does define the deal found support for the deal has dropped from 51 percent to 36 percent though only 38 percent oppose it REPUBLICANS OPPOSE HIKING TAXES ON RICH Another interesting tidbit from the new Quinnipiac poll 61 percent of Americans think the federal government shouldtry to reduce the gap between well off and less well off Americans and 60 percent support increasing taxes on higher income earners to reduce middle class taxesBut Republicans oppose both those things by 5735 and 6531 HILLARY GOES UP ON THE AIR The Clinton campaign is airing two ads in Iowa and New Hampshire with strong biographical emphasis One discusses her mothers influence on her and the other talks about her work for children Were going to make sure everyone knows who Hillary Clinton really is the Clinton camp says Weve planned for a competitive primary with Hillary herself working to earn every voteThe Beltway pundit consensus appears to be that Clintons favorability ratings are in free fall so perhaps this is also part of an effort to get her positives up as the jargon has it WHAT REALLY MATTERS AT GOP DEBATE EJ Dionne has a nice column arguing that what really matters at this weeks GOP debate isnt Donald Trumps antics its the question of whether the GOP candidates will deviate even a tiny bit from stale GOP economic doctrineNope All signs are that the GOP candidates all believe the answer to stagnating wages and the failure of the recovery to achieve widespread distribution is to get government out of the way AND TRUMPMENTUM RAGES ACROSS THE LAND A new NBC News poll finds Donald Trump continues to surge among Republican voters nationally Hes first with 19 percent Scott Walker has 14 and Jeb Bush has 13 BreakdownSo Trump is winning lots of GOPleaning independents while also cutting into the conservative support of Walker and Cruz
