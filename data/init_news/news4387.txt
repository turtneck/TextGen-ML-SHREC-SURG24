Now youre right  the Inspector General just came out with a report it was not a good report for Secretary Clinton Sanders told host John Dickerson according to a transcript provided by the network That is something that the American people Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look atTrailing Clinton among pledged delegates collected through state primaries and caucuses Sanders said superdelegates  party leaders and elected officials not formally bound to any candidate  should at the very least cast their ballots at the Democratic National Convention in July with the candidate who carries a given state   That would give Sanders a boost from states like Vermont Washington and Alaska although Clinton prevailed in populous states such as New York Florida and Texas   Sanders continued to press a case for superdelegates to switch their allegiance to him from Clinton regardless of state affiliation and said the email controversy could become a drain on her in the general electionThey will be keeping it in mind I dont have to tell them that he said I mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind and the superdelegates sure are  Sanders trails Clinton by 1769 to 1499 in pledged delegates according to an Associated Press count When superdelegates are included Clintons lead swells to 2310 to 1542 leaving the former secretary of state 73 short of clinching the nomination Shes likely to cross that mark when votes are tallied in New Jersey one of six states to vote on June 7   Speaking on ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California said it was time for party unity He ought to be able to read the sign posts as well as anybody else and if he did that he would know that its all but over she said of Sanders   Still Sanders insisted on CBS that there is just a possibility that we may end up at the end of this nominating process with more pledged delegates than Hillary Clinton   I think we have a good chance to win here Sanders said of California the most populous US state Two opinion polls last week offered different outcomes for California One showed the race basically a tossup with Clinton ahead by 2 points The other put the former New York senator up by 18 points   Obviously if we dont do well in California it will make our path much much harder Sanders said in a separate interview on NBCs Meet the Press California is the big enchilada   The State Departments inspector general found in a report made public on Wednesday that the email setup violated department rules that Clinton never sought permission for it and that the proposal would have been rejected if she had The report handed Clintons Republican opponents a fresh line of attack  and Sanders too if he chose to take it   Sanders won praise at a candidates debate on October when he said Enough of the emails Lets talk about the real issues facing America At the time his campaign used the comments in a fundraising email   Fast forward seven months and for Sanders the delegates on offer on June 7 represent a lastditch effort to close the gap with Clinton   A strong performance in California may boost Sanderss case that superdelegates should switch their allegiance to him on the basis of perceived electability against Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee   That argument so far has been driven by opinion polls showing Sanders faring better than Clinton in a hypothetical matchup with Trump   In another sign Sanders has taken off the gloves his campaign late on Friday demanded the ouster of Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and former Massachusetts Representative Barney Frank from a key platform committee at the Democratic National Convention   Democratic officials rejected Sanderss request on Saturday the Associated Press reported   In a statement the Sanders campaign said Frank and Malloy were aggressive attack surrogates for Clinton Sanderss lawyer said the pair cant work impartially while laboring under such deeply held bias   In a fourpage letter handdelivered to Democratic National Committee late Friday Brad Deutsch Sanderss campaign counsel wrote of animosity by Frank toward Sanders dating to 1991Criticisms of Sanders by Frank and Malloy have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign Deutsch said   Frank on Saturday pondered the Sanders campaigns motive I hope it is not to lay the basis for an inaccurate claim that he was unfairly denied the nomination and I do see some elements of this he told PoliticoAlso this week Sanders keen for network airtime before the California vote appeared to get a boost when presumptive Republican nominee Trump agreed to debate him to raise money for a charity The billionaire businessman backed out on Friday saying it would be inappropriate to debate the secondplace Democrat  Sanders may not have given up hope though Maybe well get a call in five minutes and hell say yes again he said on CBS
