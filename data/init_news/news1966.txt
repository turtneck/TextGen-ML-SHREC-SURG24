Four former top economists in Democratic administrations signed a letter taking Bernie Sanderss campaign to task for touting a document by University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman that purports to show that Sanderss policies would boost the American growth rate to more than 5 percentAlan Krueger Austan Goolsbee Christina Romer and Laura DAndrea Tyson all served at one time or another as chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers under either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton their letter isnt signed by three other CEA chairs from Clintons tenure Janet Yellen whos busy running the Fed Joseph Stiglitz whos well to the left of this group and Martin Baily who tells me he didnt know anything about itThe letter cites Friedmans assumption that the economy would grow by 53 percent under Sanders and comments No credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes Further the economists argue that making this kind of claim undermines our partys best traditions of evidencebased policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmeticSomewhat ironically this group of empirically minded wonks doesnt actually offer an empirical critique of the study they are worried about  relying simply on their authority as Democratic Party luminaries to bat it downThis controversy is on one level almost totally meaningless No president in any era operating under any set of circumstances has managed to pass a complete legislative agenda and the combination of partisan polarization an entrenched House GOP majority and the extremely ambitious nature of Sanderss agenda makes it totally inconceivable that a Sanders administration would pass all of its policy proposalsAsking what would happen if the entire Sanders agenda is enacted is a little like asking what would happen if Sanders brought his midrange game to the Golden State Warriors To the extent that anyone is backing Sanders because they have read Friedmans paper the fact that none of this is going to happen is a bigger problem than any questions about Friedmans forecastsHowever on another level the Friedman paper and the attacks on it from Democratic Party wonks are an interesting window into how the primary is playing out behind the scenes Clinton has achieved such overwhelming party insider support that the Sanders campaign is largely cut off from access to the kind of paraparty policy wonk universe that would allow Sanders to release campaign proposals that pass muster by the traditional rules of the gameBut hes managed to make a virtue out of this weakness and harness it to the larger significance of the Sanders project  an effort to turn the Democratic Party into a more ideological party that operates more like a progressive mirror image of the conservative Republican Party and less of a broad coalition of interest groups mediated by technocratsThe headline conclusion of Friedmans paper is that under Bernienomics the growth rate of the real gross domestic product will rise from 21 per annum to 53 so that real GDP per capita will be over 20000 higher in 2026 than is projected under the current policyThat is a very high rate of growthWhen Jeb Bush promised 4 percent growth centristtoliberal economists were derisive and even the most Jebfriendly economists wouldnt quite endorse the claim Friedman is promising even more than that and the CEA letter reflects a similar level of skepticismI asked Dean Baker from the Center for Economic and Policy Research one of the more leftwing and Sandersfriendly economists in the Washington policy world what he thought of the 53 percent target He in the nicest possible way suggested it is unrealisticObviously opinions differ considerably about the merits of various aspects of Sanderss agenda But its on these questions of slack full employment and labor force growth where Friedman departs most clearly from the economic consensusConsider this chart laying out Friedmans view of how Bernienomics will impact the employment rate or the share of the adult population that has a jobReasonable people can and will disagree about how Sanderss plans would impact the labor market But virtually every expert Ive ever discussed this with believes that one reason the employment rate has declined since 1999 is that old people are a larger share of the population today than they were 17 years ago The main reason the CBO expects the employment rate to fall in the future is that this aging process is set to continue This means the full employment level of employment is simply lower than it was in the pastFriedman by contrast appears to believe that the full employment level is right where it was in the waning days of the Clinton administration and that with good policy we can get back thereFriedman does not however discuss the demographic change issue at all in his paper Instead in a footnote he argues that womens employment will be encouraged by the Paycheck Fairness Act which will raise the wages of women encouraging more to seek paid employment No empirical evidence is offered that such a modest piece of legislation will have an impact this large nor is much made of the fact that a large share of the growth benefit of the Sanders agenda is being attributed to this consensus Democratic policy rather than to his more unusual positionsConversely some of Sanderss more distinctive signature ideas would almost certainly depress labor force participation even in a sympathetic viewFor example if you made college free some young people who would otherwise work full time would instead go to school and work part time Some students who currently work part time would reduce their hours or cut back to zero A proponent of free college would likely describe these as benefits of the free college universe  and certainly foreign countries where college is much cheaper than the United States see fewer schoolage people in the labor forceBy the same token Sanderss Medicare for all and expanded Social Security plans would almost certainly increase the number of people who retire early Free health care would make it easier to be retired for a year or five before Social Security benefits kick in more generous Social Security would reduce the amount of intact savings people need once the benefits do kick in and the higher taxes to finance the Medicareforall plan would make working slightly less lucrativeNone of that is necessarily a bad thing  reducing old peoples need to toil is a very nice idea  but like free college it tends to cut against Friedmans view that Bernienomics will create a surge of employmentIts noteworthy that the former CEA chairs criticizing Friedman didnt bother to run through a detailed explanation of their problems with the paper To them the 53 percent figure was simply absurd on its face and it was good enough for them to say so relying on their authority to generate media coverageAnd to an extent mission accomplished The coverage has been generated But for better or for worse the entire premise of the Sanders campaign is that the existing Democratic Party establishment needs to be overthrown so imperious dismissals by establishment figures dont really hurt Sanders His policy director Warren Gunnels told Danielle Kurtzleben that the economists in question are the establishment of the establishment and claimed to be unbothered by the criticismsThat does not bother us at all he told her What bothers us is the fact that the US has more kids living in poverty than nearly any major country on earthBernie sympathizers like the Weeks Ryan Cooper and veteran leftwing political operative Jeff Hauser simply view the letter signers as noncredible referring to an old Goolsbee column and to Tysons service on corporate boardsTo Sanders skeptics this style of response is itself worrying Paul Krugman for example wrote about the letter and said If your response to these concerns is that theyre all corrupt all looking for jobs with Hillary you are very much part of the problemThe dismissals of the critiques of Friedmans praise for Sanderss plan are in a way more telling and informative than either the Friedman paper or the critiques of it Sanders and his core constituency simply dont careSanders is running a style of campaign thats very unusual for a prominent Democrat but extremely common for a Republican Marco Rubio for example has proposed a large tax cut a balanced budget amendment an increase in defense spending and to prevent any cuts in Social Security or Medicare for people currently at or near retirementThis is obviously not possible but it hasnt been a problem for Rubio in the GOP primary because the 2016 GOP primary  like the 2012 2008 2000 1996 and 1988 primaries  havent been about who has the best policy plans It is about how conservative ideology should be defined and  among those who share a similar definition  who is its most effective champion The 1980 and 1976 GOP primaries were about whether the Republican Party should be a vehicle of the conservative movement or whether it should continue in the EisenhowerNixonFord model of rightleaning interest group brokerage  with the conservatives winning in 1980 and never letting goDemocrats for almost all of this time have not defined themselves as a mirror image of the conservative GOP Instead they are a leftleaning coalition of interest groups looking for group wins that tends to downplay ideology This is why historically evaluating plans has been a very important part of Democratic politicsSanderss campaign against Hillary Clinton is more like Ronald Reagans battle with Gerald Ford than like the ObamaClinton primary of 2008 As part of his political revolution Sanders wants to change the Democratic Party which he historically was not even a member of into a much more ideological political party Consequently for Sanders the point of taking policy positions is much more about showing where he stands and who his friends and enemies are than it is about the details of policymaking What he would actually do as president after all is going to be constrained by political realities and his ability to mobilize the publicTo Sanderss critics of course this is just gross irresponsibility that neglects the best traditions of the Democratic Party and raises serious questions about Sanderss ability to do serious policy analysis when the time comes to make choices But to his fans fetishizing wonky details is just a way of circumscribing policy proposals to what can be uncontroversially modeled in a world where obtaining and deploying concrete political power  not drawing up more and better white papers  is the crucial task for progressive politics
