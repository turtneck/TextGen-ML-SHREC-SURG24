To reject the governments defense of the law Greenhouse writes the justices would have to suspend their own settled approach to statutory interpretation as well as their oftenstated view of how Congress should act toward the states She then addresses the conservative justices who would take Obamacares soul If you do and you proceed to destroy the Affordable Care Act nonetheless you will have a great deal of explaining to do  not to me but to historyWell the conservative justices who comprise a 54 majority on the Supreme Court probably do not care that much for the warnings of Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times As she well knows They have their own history to make after all and that is a political one gutting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while they have the chance I would like to believe that theyre thinking about this in anything but political terms but its doubtful because theyre wellestablished political hacksThe Democratic and Republican parties understand that theyre political hacks too and it makes sense to play to that side of themThe decision likely comes down to John Roberts again Roberts much to the enmity of his fellow conservative justices upheld the individual mandate in 2012 Even if he didnt go fullhack this was not a neutral ballsandstrikes reading of the law from our selfstyled umpire It was a careful weighing of political considerations He decided thenthat he wouldnt join Scalia Alito Thomas and Kennedy in going out of his way to wipe the entire law from the books That would be too abrupt So he upheld the individual mandate but only on the grounds of taxation and not the Commerce Clause as a way to needle the administration And he also gutted Medicaid as a sop to conservativesHe may regret letting the Affordable Care Act live and now he gets a second lick at the apple That gutting Obamacare over this would damage the courts honoris not very persuasive It implies that theres extant honor for it to lose That train left the station when the court picked up this stupid case to begin with if not much earlierA top concern for Roberts then might be the extent to which a ruling against the government in King v Burwell would send the countrys healthcare system into chaos This shouldnt be a concern for a justice whos deciding on the merits of a case but it is And its a political consideration his court would more easily get away with an inept ruling if he knew there was a safety net Convincing Roberts that there is no safety net then is a priority for the White House and convincing him that there is  that everything will be hunkydory if he just goes ahead and ruins Obamacare  is a top goal for the RepublicansHHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell appeared before the Senate Finance Committee in what turned out to be a testy hearing yesterday Republican senators repeatedly pressed her for details on what the administrations backup plan is should the court eliminate subsidies for insurance plans bought on federally facilitated exchanges Burwell repeatedly dodged saying that her focus now is meeting targets for the open enrollment period Sen John Cornyn went so far as to suggest she was acting in contempt of Congress Does the administration have a contingency plan Have they thought about what theyd do Well yeah And two former Bush HHS officials who spoke with the Hill seem to nail why Burwell and the administration are keeping their plans close to the chest now because they dont want to signal weakness to John Roberts Of course they have one they should all resign if they dont said Tom Scully an HHS official under former President George W Bush And they certainly should not discuss it either Former HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt who left office in 2009 agreed He added that he isnt surprised that senior officials would rather face a day of bad headlines than signal weakness to the Supreme Court If the court thought they had a plan they might think they felt like their case was weak Leavitt who also served as governor of Utah said in an interview The GOP of course would love for the administration to signal weakness  all while they the party that controls both chambers of Congress now signal strength comfort and reassurance Thats why theyre putting effort into developing an alternative to Obamacare after all these years Its all to show John Roberts go ahead guy well take care of everything else Theres no way that any of this should have any bearing on what John Roberts will decide but its a reasonable bet that it will and it makes perfect cynical sense to appeal to John Roberts this way
