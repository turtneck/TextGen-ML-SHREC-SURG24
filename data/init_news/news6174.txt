The presumptive Republican nominee is reintroducing Americans to a panoply of dormant scandals personal transgressions and partisan controversies that rocked Bill Clintons White House and first lady Hillary Clinton in two turbulent presidential terms leading up to the end of the 20th CenturyThe goal is to link them with a flurry of more recent dramas such as those over Clintons private email server and Benghazi to depict her potential presidency as a return to unsavory days of rumor innuendo and alleged malfeasance that would exhaust and disgust voters  in effect making the 2016 election a referendum on the Clintons and the baggage that has always haunted their successful and resilient political careersCase in point a new Instagram video that pictures Bill Clinton chomping on a cigar and revives claims of wrongdoing against him by several women which ends with the sound of Hillary Clinton laughing and a slogan Here we go againThe billionaire also appears to be taking aim at the already upsidedown approval ratings of Hillary Clinton to neutralize rockbottom perceptions of his own character revealed by polls that threaten his general election appeal especially with women voters the majority of whom prefer his likely Democratic rivalWhat he is doing is he is exposing not just Bill Clinton for what he was and what he had done but its the same as it relates to Hillary Michael Cohen Trumps legal counsel said on CNNs New DayShe attacked Mr Trump as being a sexist misogynist and he is not any of those things Cohen said portraying Hillary Clinton as an enabler of her husbands dalliancesBut Trumps personal broadsides against the Clintons are not riskfree The New York billionaire real estate investor has had a colorful personal life himself and has been accused by the former secretary of states allies and in news reports of sexist behavior and a string of unflattering comments about womenStill the strategy from Trumps point of view has the virtue of forcing Clinton into the painful personal position of recalling her husbands past wrongdoing when she would much prefer to focus on other issuesShe answered with a terse No when asked by CNNs Chris Cuomo last week whether she ever felt compelled to defend her or her husbands honor against TrumpI know that thats exactly what he is fishing for and you know Im not going to be respondingHer campaign has dusted off the classic Clinton scandal playbook  pivoting to focus on Trumps own vulnerabilities and stressing that the American people have more pressing concernsThe reason he is doing it is his own record his coming under scrutiny said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon on New Day Monday  as the Clinton camp lit into Trump over past comments that he hoped the real estate market would crash as it would benefit his businessesTrumps attacks aimed at fixing the picture of Crooked Hillary in the public mind as the general election gears up recall earlier political branding hit jobs that he pulled against low energy Jeb Bush and little Marco Rubio in the GOP raceHe also is showing he is ready to fight fire with a flamethrower It is significant for instance that his first veiled reference to 1990s sexual allegations against Bill Clinton came after he concluded that the Clinton campaign was playing the women card was against himTrumps attacks recall a tortured political era in which the Clinton White House seemed to stagger from scandal to scandal  but repeatedly defied predictions of its demise to survive and prosperAs soon as the new First Couple arrived in Washington from Arkansas they were beset by rumors of wrongdoing and mini ethics scandals There was Whitewater about the First Ladys real estate dealings in Arkansas Travelgate about firings of officials in the White House travel office and Filegate about the alleged misuse of FBI papersEarly on the Clinton White House was rocked by the suicide of legal counsel Vince Foster a close friend of Hillary Clinton which became the cue for another round of conspiracy theoriesIt all culminated in an independent counsel investigation by Ken Starr which in turn led to the moment when Clinton became only the second President to be impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 for lying under oath about an affair with Monica Lewinsky a White House intern He was subsequently acquitted in a trial before the US Senate in February 1999 None of the other scandals produced criminal charges against the Clintons and the Whitewater investigation was eventually wrapped up in 2002All of that seemed like ancient history Bill Clinton Clinton left office with a 66 approval rating according to CNNGallupUSA Today polling and threw himself into an energetic and philanthropic post presidency and built a personal fortune on the lucrative speech making circuit Hillary Clinton pursued her own political career in the Senate as secretary of state and her second presidential campaignEven Starr has praised Clintons redemptive post presidency and in remarks reported by the New York Times on Tuesday bemoaned the tragic dimensions of the Clinton scandals and investigations of which he was a partBut Trump is not interested in putting the past to rest Hes dredging it upIts the one thing with her whether its Whitewater or whether its Vince or whether its Benghazi Its always a mess with Hillary Trump said in the Post interviewThe most pressing question raised by Trumps personal assault using the ugliest moments of the Clinton presidency is whether it will workTana Goertz a senior Trump adviser told CNNs Pamela Brown on Tuesday that there were no fears in the billionaires camp that raising Bill Clintons conduct would boost his wifes approval ratings just as they did back in the 1990sBack then people felt sorry for Hillary because her husband was unfaithful They believed she was going to do the right thing for women and empower women strengthen women and support women and none of that happened Goertz said That might have been a sympathy vote back then but that will not happen againThroughout their turbulent political careers the Clintons have shown an ability to court public support by portraying attacks against them as vicious partisan witch hunts and displayed an almost supernatural capacity to weather political crisesThe period of personal anguish selfreflection and humiliation that Hillary Clinton endured as she questioned whether to save her marriage after the Lewinsky saga meanwhile confounded her enemies as it stirred public empathy for her plight But she also sparked a public debate over why she had chosen to stay with her husband amid claims by some critics that the marriage was simply a vehicle for her political ambitionBut Hillary Clinton supporter Maria Cardona dismissed the idea that the ghosts of the 1990s will stalk her campaign a two decades laterThe Bill Clinton issue is already baked in People know him Cardona said on CNNAn attack on her because of what her husband did is going to backfire in an incredibly big way  she is going to continue to be focused on issues
