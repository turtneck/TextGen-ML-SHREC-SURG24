President Obama told the UN General Assembly 18 months ago that he would seek real breakthroughs on these two issues  Irans nuclear program and IsraeliPalestinian peaceBut Benjamin Netanyahus triumph in Tuesdays parliamentary elections keeps in place an Israeli prime minister who has declared his intention to resist Obama on both of these fronts guaranteeing two more years of difficult diplomacy between leaders who barely conceal their personal distaste for each otherThe Israeli election results also suggest that most voters there support Netanyahus tough stance on USled negotiations to limit Irans nuclear program and his vow on Monday that there would be no independent Palestinian state as long as he is prime ministerOn the way to his election victory Netanyahu broke a lot of crockery in the relationship said Martin Indyk executive vice president of the Brookings Institution and a former US ambassador to Israel It cant be repaired unless both sides have an interest and desire to do soAside from Russian President Vladimir Putin few foreign leaders so brazenly stand up to Obama and even fewer among longtime alliesIn the past Israeli leaders who risked damaging the countrys most important relationship that with Washington tended to pay a price In 1991 when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opposed the Madrid peace talks President George HW Bush held back loan guarantees to help absorb immigrants from the former Soviet Union Shamir gave in but his government soon collapsedBut this time Netanyahu was not hurt by his personal and substantive conflicts with the US presidentWhile the United States is loved and beloved in Israel President Obama is not said Robert M Danin a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations So the perceived enmity didnt hurt the way it did with Shamir when he ran afoul of Bush in 91Where do USIsraeli relations go from hereIn the immediate aftermath of Tuesdays elections tensions between the two sides continued to run hot The Obama administrations first comments on the Israeli election came with a tough warning about some of the preelection rhetoric from Netanyahus Likud party which tried to rally rightwing support by saying that Arab Israeli voters were coming out in drovesThe United States and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize Arab Israeli citizens White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One It undermines the values and democratic ideals that have been important to our democracy and an important part of what binds the United States and Israel togetherEarnest added that Netanyahus electioneve disavowal of a twostate solution for Israelis and Palestinians would force the administration to reconsider its approach to peace in the regionOver the longer term a number of analysts say that Obama and Netanyahu will seek to play down the friction between them and point to areas of continuing cooperation on military and economic issuesBoth sides are going to want to turn down the rhetoric Danin said But it is also a structural problem They have six years of accumulated history Thats going to put limits on how far they can go togetherThe first substantive test could come as early as this month when the United States hopes that it can finish hammering out the framework of an agreement with IranNetanyahu strongly warned against making a bad deal during his March 3 address to a joint meeting of Congress an appearance arranged by Republican congressional leaders and criticized by the Obama administration for making USIsraeli relations partisan on both sides so close to the Israeli electionIf a deal is reached and does not pass muster with Netanyahu he is likely to work with congressional Republicans to try to scuttle the accordThe Republicans have said they will do what they can to block a deal and the prime minister has already made clear that he will work with the Republicans against the president Indyk said Thats where a clash could come and its coming very quicklyThe second test  talks with Palestinians  could be even more difficult In his September 2013 address to the United Nations Obama hailed signs of hopeAlready Israeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks Obama said in his speech Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has put aside efforts to shortcut the pursuit of peace and come to the negotiating table Prime Minister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian stateToday the signals could not differ more The Palestinian Authority has said that after it joins the International Criminal Court at The Hague on April 1 it will press war crimes charges against Israel for the bloody Gaza conflict during the summer Israel which controls tax receipts has pledged to punish the Palestinian Authority by freezing its tax revenueThe United States which gives hundreds of millions of dollars of economic aid to the Palestinian Authority would be caught in the middle It has been trying to persuade both sides to stand down but Netanyahus declaration that there would be no Palestinian state on his watch makes that more difficultNow its hard to see what could persuade the Palestinians to hold up on their ICC plans Indyk said That has nothing to do with negotiations but if both sides cant be persuaded to back down then they will be on a trajectory that could lead to the collapse of the Palestinian Authority because it cant pay wages anymoreThat could be an issue forced onto the agenda about the same time as a potential nuclear deal
