If youre following the news you know FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI found a bunch of emails on Anthony Weiners laptopAs Dilbert Creator Scott Adams notes there appears to be two main observations1 Comey seemed proClinton when he dropped the initial email case2 Comey seems antiClinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the electionSo how can both behaviors be explained First some background from Adams on The Persuasion Filter As my regular readers know the Persuasion Filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality  In order for us to be here today our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate They had no need to understand reality at any basic level And we have no such need either Thats why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and I might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine Many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival I like to describe reality as each person living their own movie which works well unless our scripts conflict When that happens one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent Thats how I see the worldLast year in this blog I suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what I call the Persuasion Filter Thats what I have been using to make spookygood predictions about the election so far And thats what Ill use today to give you an alternate movie about James Comey Compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the futureThe base assumption of the Persuasion Filter is that people are irrational 90 of the time and only rarely  when no emotions are involved  truly rational This is the reverse of the common filter for reality in which people are assumed to be rational 90 of the time and a bit crazy 10 of the time Thats some background for contextRead more here So back to Comey Adams asks  which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future Some say Comey is a political pawn in a rigged system By that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case But we cant explain why hes acting against Clintons interests now What changedWell some say Comey had to reopen the case against Clinton after discovering the Weiner laptop emails If he failed to act there might be a revolt at the FBI and maybe a whistleblower would come forward  But that leaves unexplained why Comey detailed to Congress how Clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the FBI was dropping the case If Comey had been protecting Clinton on the first round he would have softened his description of her misdeeds wouldnt he But he didnt seem to hold back anythingAnd none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know Comey have high regard for his integrity Comey also has the security of a 10year appointment as Director so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced Thats exactly why the job has a 10year term Given what we know of Comey before any of the Clinton emails any movie that casts Comey as an asscovering weasel is probably making a casting mistakeSo allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts Comey as more of a patriot and hero than an asscovering weasel Compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predictingMy movie says Comey had good evidence against Clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the American public  For reasons of conscience and acting as a patriot Comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the FBI found against Clinton The evidence looked damning because it was Under this interpretation Comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the Republic He didnt want the FBI to steal this important decision away from the people but at the same time he couldnt let the people decide blind So he divulged the evidence and stepped away like the action hero who doesnt look back at the explosion In the second act of this movie Comey learns that the Weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag And a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence That would violate Clintons rightsBut Comey couldnt easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against FBI policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day So Comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the Republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting In this movie Comey did the hero thing He alerted the public to the fact that the FBI found DISQUALIFYING information on the Weiner laptop And he took a second bullet to his reputation How do I know the new emails are that bad I start by assuming Comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions And even Comeys critics concede hes smart SoThe way you know the new emails are disqualifying for Clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed Congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections Comey is smart enough to know his options And unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age hes got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the RepublicAccording to this movie no matter who gets elected well eventually learn of something disqualifying in the Weiner emailsAnd we cant say we werent warned Comey took two bullets to do it So compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts And when we find out what is in the Weiner laptop emails compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifyingThe Persuasion Filter says there is no preferred reality We all see our own movies In my movie Comeys has a consistent personality from start to finish He starts out his career as a smart competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the Republic If your movie script has Comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season dont expect an Oscar Read more here Of course if youre a Democrat this is all irrelevant and Comey is A Putin puppet Howard Dean a federal lawbreaker who should never have been appointed Harry Reid and a partisan prejudiced individual Eric HolderNEW Former
