So far none of the presidential debates  Democratic or Republican  have asked about K12 education Thats a huge missed opportunityEducation really is a divisive issue within the Democratic Party and one on which Hillary Clintonhas indicated she might take a different tack than President ObamaLast week Obama signed a new federal education law the Every Student Succeeds Act For the first time in more than two decades it will scale back the federal governments role in education While teachers unions and congressional Republicans both like the new law its received criticism from the left from those who say that states cant be trusted to safeguard the wellbeing of poor and minority students Clinton said in a statement that she supports the law although its not perfectThis would have been the ideal jumpingoff point for a question about education policyPresident Obama just signed the Every Student Succeeds Act which keeps the standardized testing requirement from No Child Left Behind but gives states more freedom to decide which schools are succeeding and what to do about the ones that arent Do you trust states to make the right decisions without federal oversight And how would you work within the constraints of the law to improve education in the USK12 education has been almost entirely absent from the 2016 campaign trail so far But Clintons few public statements suggest that she might be friendlier to teachers unions than President Obama who often antagonized unions with his competitive grant programs support for charter schools and push to evaluate teachers based in part on their students test scoresClinton who has been endorsed by both major teachers unions has suggested charter schools cherrypick their students She opposes tying teacher pay to their students test scores saying theres no evidence that approach works And shes said that getting more funding for traditional federal education programs such as federal money to educate poor students and students with disabilities would be a top prioritySen Bernie Sanders meanwhile has hardly talked about K12 eduction at all And former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley was a strong supporter of charter schools while in office This is a big and important division within the Democratic Party one that debates repeatedly miss their chance to highlight
