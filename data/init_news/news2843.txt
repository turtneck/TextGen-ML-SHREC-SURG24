Impossible you say In this crazy year whats impossible Against Trump and Sanders Bloomberg could win Heres howBloomberg decided to run back in March of 2016 only when he saw that Trump and Sanders were on track to be nominated by the Republicans and Democrats He viewed both as dangerous men who would wreck the country And Bloomberg saw a path He thought voters would eventually see that he had been a highly successful mayor of a city larger than all but a handful of states and was far more fit for high office than either of them He would run as an unprecedented blend of insider and outsiderrepresenting elites but smashing the twoparty status quo that voters despisedThe journey began in midwinter After Trump plastered the field in New Hampshire on Feb 9 and won by double digits on Feb 20 in South Carolina Republicans proved powerless to resist his hostile takeover of their party With his opposition divided Trump edged Ted Cruz in home state Texas on March 1 and then on March 15 Marco Rubio in home state Florida and John Kasich in Ohio all but eliminating all three By then the die was cast on the Republican side though Americans and millions watching around the world still had to slap themselves to prove they werent dreamingDemocrats suddenly had to do the same in their party Sanders won 60 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary romping not just with young liberals but even older moderate women who were supposed to be Hillarys base Clinton prevailed in the Nevada caucuses by five points on Feb 20 but Sanders showed surprising strength outside his base with Latino voters When Hillary won by a much smaller margin than expected in South Carolina on Feb 27 it showed that Bernie would also avoid being overwhelmed by proHillary AfricanAmerican voters in the big industrial statesAfter Nevada and South Carolina party leaders breathed a sigh of relief thinking Hillary was home safe but thats always the moment with the Clintons when new voter doubts about them set in Hillary is best when shes in trouble and worst when sitting on a lead She underperformed badly on Super Tuesday losing Massachusetts by a big margin she had trailed there in the polls for weeks and shockingly Texas where the states longstanding populist tradition returned with a vengeance On March 8 Sanders carried Michigan which had gone for Jesse Jackson in 1988 That gave him momentum the following week to come close in Hillarys home state of Illinois and to carry Ohio where he reminded Democrats of their populist senator Sherrod Brown though Brown supported HillaryBloomberg easily won all three of the fall debates He was far more knowledgeable than Trump who continued his pattern of not preparing on issues When Trump predictably tried to belittle Bloomberg he failed badly Bloomberg was no loser in the only way Trump ever kept score And the fear arguments fell flat with a mayor who had rebuilt New York after the 911 attacks Meanwhile Bloomberg schooled Sanders on how to create jobs and make the economy grow eviscerating his plans as unaffordable and leading to tax increases on the middle class
