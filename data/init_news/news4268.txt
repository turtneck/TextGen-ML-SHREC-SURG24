Texas Senator Ted Cruz R isnt about to let the facts get in the way of his narrative so instead of admitting that his partys rhetorical tantrums about hoax videos may have contributed to Robert Louis Dears decision to shoot up a Planned Parenthood clinic on Friday he blamed it on what conservatives would consider a most loathsome manticore a transgendered leftist activistOn Sunday Cruz said that any attempt to link Dear to conservatives mission to curtail a womans right to choose is merely vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are prolife He claimed that the media promptly wants to blame Dear on the prolife movement when at this point theres very little evidence to indicate that Cruz you see is very very concerned about people who make commonsense accusations based on reports that Dear was mumbling about baby parts when he was arrested Repeating the Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood constitutes to his mind very little evidenceSolid evidence for Cruz comes from the person who has been deemed The Stupidest Man On The Internet who discovered that Dear was listed as Female on a voter registration form meaning he is obviously as Cruz identified him a transgendered leftist activistCruz made that statement while attempting to take the high road but hes unfamiliar with such heights and it showed Its also been reported that he was registered as an independent and a woman and transgendered leftist activist if thats what he is he said I dont think its fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left This is a murderer Apparently he believed people would walk away from his statement thinking Its big of Cruz not to blame leftist rhetoric for a man shooting up a Planned Parenthood clinic  which says quite a bit about how intelligent he considers his audienceMoreover given that the only evidence Cruz has that Dear was transgender is a single voter registration form in which he identifies both as Female and UAF which stands for unaffiliated it stands to reason that he believes it impossible for a transgender person to be affiliated with the conservative movement in general or the Republican Party in particular While that may be true its also telling about who he assumes can find a home in the conservative coalition As ThinkProgress Zack Ford reported no one who knew him believed he identified as a woman and his exwife claimed that he believed wholeheartedly in the Bible but that doesnt constitute the kind of evidence a professional prevaricator like Cruz would consider worthy of mention He should be commended though for his restraint in not arguing that Dear was simply a bank robber who took shelter in the Planned Parenthood clinic another conservative canard that made the rounds this weekend
