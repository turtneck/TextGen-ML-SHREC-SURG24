Actions by the Obama administration and several states have given the United States momentum in addressing climate changeSmoke rises from the Colstrip Steam Electric Station a coal burning power plant in Colstrip Mont in this 2013 file photoWhen it comes to the fight against climate change the United States is often cast as a laggard  if not an outright pariahBut that portrait is quietly changingOn one hand the fundamentals of Americas conflict over the human role in climate change remain unchanged A capandtrade bill to reduce carbon emissions remains a nonstarter in Congress and 41 percent of Americans say global warming has more to do with natural causes than human activity according to GallupBut executive actions by the Obama administration combined with a host of new laws in key states mean that the United States is actually already taking significant action against climate change Not only are these actions making an appreciable dent in the countrys greenhouse gas emissions they are beginning to change how other countries see Americas leadership on the issueThe fact that the US is taking these issues more seriously than we were doing five years ago that means other countries are going to take it seriously as well says Richard Reveszdirector of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University Law SchoolPresident Obama has made climate change a focus of his second term agenda and a cornerstone of his legacy as a whole But facing opposition in Congress he has turned to executive action and regulation principally through the Environmental Protection Agency EPAMr Obamas stated emissions pledge  made in partnership with China last winter  is to cut carbon emissions to 26 to 28 percent of 2005 levels within the next decade The pledge is tied to the Clean Power Plan CPP  a suite of new EPA regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from US power plants It is expected to go into effect later this summerBut what makes the CPP feasible experts say is what states have already been doingStates have been leading the way for a long time in terms of clean energy says Elizabeth Ouzts a spokeswoman for Environment America an environmental advocacy groupSeven states have adopted broad caps on emissions and 28 states have introduced renewable energy requirements according to a recent report from Environment America According to the report state and federal policies currently in action or about to go into action  including the CPP  can hit the targets laid out in the China dealThe path has been paved with statelevel success and ambition and the Clean Power Plan directly rose from the success weve seen at the state level says Anna Aurilio director of the Global Warming Solutions program at Environment AmericaShe says incidents of extreme weather such as hurricane Sandy and the ongoing drought in California have served as wakeup callsPeople are starting to connect the dots between extreme weather events and the need to act on climate change she saysThe first of several deadlines to comply with the CPP standards is 2020 and most states are already twothirds of the way toward compliance says Kenneth Kimmellpresident of the Union of Concerned Scientists Editors note The original version of this story misspelled Mr Kimmells nameMost states will exceed that 2020 timeline just based on what theyve already done he adds We do think states are poised to costeffectively and successfully comply with the Clean Power PlanThat means that American negotiators should be able to walk into the United Nations climate change conference in Paris this December with some momentumWe always believed that when the US took action domestically it could lead the rest of the world and thats in fact what were seeing says Ms Aurilio of Environment AmericaThe agreement between China and the US  the worlds No 1 and 2 polluters respectively  helped give America more credibility on the world stage And the CPP helped give America credibility with ChinaWe wouldnt have gotten the commitment from China if hadnt looked like we were about to implement Clean Power Plan says Mr Kimmell of the Union of Concerned Scientists I think our seriousness will result in positive action by other countriesHe adds that he was in Sweden and Denmark recently talking with people involved in international climate negotiationsTheres a recognition that its real he says referring to US action on reducing carbon emissionsMany challenges remain however On Monday the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA improperly streamlined the regulation process when it establishednew standards for emissions of mercury and other toxic substancesThe EPA says the ruling does not affect the Clean Power Plan But others say it throws the EPAs entire regulatory regime into question Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell R who comes from the coalproducing state of Kentucky said the ruling affirmed his advice to state governors to ignore the new power plant regulationsRegardless of the varying interpretations of Mondays ruling the CPP is likely to face both legal and legislative challenges And the US cant think that the CPP is enough says AurilloTo keep global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius  the consensus scientific target for preventing the worst consequences of global warming  the US must cut its carbon emissions at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by midcenturyWe shouldve got started with all these steps 20 years ago the fact were taking them on now means were going to have to work harder she saysBut she sees reason to hopeWeve seen countries like China that have never before constructively engaged come to the table she adds This is a very hopeful time in what has otherwise been a pretty long period of very little action and progress on the global front so this is huge
