Hillary Clintons running mate Tim Kaine defended her from accusations of dishonesty on Sunday after her inconsistent answers about emails her rival Donald Trump and new polls raised the question of trustworthiness in the minds of votersClintons use of a private email server while secretary of state has continued to haunt her even after an FBI investigation cleared her of criminal wrongdoing In an interview recorded on Friday her vicepresidential pick was asked to account for the false or inconsistent statements she has made on the subject over the last yearKaine did not directly address Clintons struggle to restore trust with voters arguing instead on NBCs Meet the Press that she did a great job telling her story in a speech at the Democratic national convention last week which meant folks are getting reintroduced to that story in a positive wayClinton has however also stumbled in the wake of the convention Last week she told the Fox News host Chris Wallace that the FBI director James Comey said my answers about email practices were truthful and what Ive said is consistent with what I have told the American peopleComey said there was no evidence Clinton lied to the FBI and declined to judge her various remarks to the public Last month he excoriated her for her extremely careless email practices and highlighted facts that contradicted her claims though he found no evidence of intentional or criminal wrongdoingOn Friday Clinton said she may have shortcircuited in her statements about Comey and the emails On NBC Kaine defended her saying her answer may have emerged from a misunderstandingI thought her answers in that setting were truthful Kaine said adding that Wallace might have been asking her a different questionThe bottom line is this Kaine continued She made a mistake and she said over and over again I made a mistake and Ive learned from it and Im going to fix it and I apologize for itKaine also promised greater access to Clinton who had gone more than 240 days without a press conference before an event on Friday at which she took a handful of questions from preselected journalists I know that this is something that shes learned from and were going to be real transparent absolutely Kaine saidAt a Saturday night rally in New Hampshire Trump gleefully seized on Clintons shortcircuited remark I think the people of this country dont want somebody thats going to shortcircuit up here Trump said pointing to his head Not as your president not as your presidentHe added Shes a totally unhinged person Shes unbalanced All you have to do is

Brexit referendum and angry outbursts toward women minorities and most recently the family of a Muslim American army captain killed in Iraq This week Barack Obama who has endorsed Clinton called Trump unfit and woefully unprepared to be presidentTrump tried to flip the argument on to Clinton on Saturday labelling her a dangerous liar the queen of corruption and Hillary Rotten Clinton a pun on her
