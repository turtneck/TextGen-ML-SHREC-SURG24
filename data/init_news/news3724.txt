There are two ways to analyze Donald Trumps decisive win in New Yorks presidential primaryFirst its the acknowledgment of a big run for Trump this week and next during which the GOP frontrunner will amass delegates at a faster clip than any of the other three Republicans in the race  in the process stretching his lead over Texas Sen Ted Cruz and pumping up the volume that the Republican nomination is deservedly The Donalds regardless of where the delegate tally stands going into Julys national convention in ClevelandTrumps argument will look good  on paper at leastAfter New York hes twothirds of the way to the 1237 delegates required by the GOP and a guaranteed firstballot win in ClevelandFor arguments sake lets give Trump roughly 100 of the 172 delegates up for grabs next Tuesday all the action occurring in his midAtlantic backyard of Connecticut Delaware Maryland Pennsylvania and Rhode IslandOnce the five states holding GOP contests in May apportion their combined 199 delegates Trumps total should enter fourdigit territory Per this Associated Press breakdown a firstballot scenario remains feasibleIf hes smart Trump will use the rest of April and May to keep driving home one word inevitability Backed up by this exit poll data showing that an overwhelming number of New York Republicans saying the candidate with the most primary votes should be the partys nomineeNow the other takeaway from New York the Sinatra questionTo paraphrase that other Chairman of the Board if Trump can make it there  winning big in the Empire State in a closed Republican primary  can he make it anywhere with threefifths of a primary electorate that hasnt bought into his candidacyThe answer no not in every primary at least    and stay tunedMay will not be the friendliest of months for Trump what with a firstTuesday primary in Indiana that could spell more Midwestern trouble perhaps a repeat of his meltdown in WisconsinAfter that a winnertakeall contest in Nebraska that likely will go to Cruz draw a line from Texas to North Dakota and it runs through states Cruz has won Finally Oregon and Washington awarding their delegates proportionallyNot much of a buzz thereHowever there is an opportunity for Trump to take a major step forward  in a way having nothing to do with beancounting and convention arcana And that would be courting those skeptical Republicans still waiting for a Trumpian pivot from angry rhetoric and juvenile socialmedia insults to a more dignified tone and statesmanlike personaThe news that broke on the same day as New Yorks results  that Trump is shaking up his senior campaign staff and empowering his team to spend aggressively to win in May and June  is a first step in that directionThe next step breaching divides within the GOPAccording to the latest NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll 63 percent of Republican primary voters say they could be satisfied with Trump as the GOP nomineeThe good news its better than the 49 percent Trump received back in the March exit pollsNot so good it cries of work to be done  specifically shoring up support among conservatives uneasy of Trumps past policy inconsistencies and his unwilling in this campaign to take on entitlement spending and the federal budget dragonFour years ago conservatives accounted for 35 percent of that years presidential turnout the highest share since pollsters first began recording that statistic back in 1976 82 percent of them voted for Mitt Romney Four years previously conservatives were 34 percent of the turnout only 78 percent voted for John McCainIn theory Cruz has a chance of repeating those percentages if not improving on them Can Trump Only if he starts speaking the languageSuch is the unusual nature of this Republican contest In late April of 2012 after 43 Republican primaries and caucuses had voted Romney had distanced himself from the field to the point where he could travel to New Hampshire and deliver this speech with an eye on the general election Romney promised a new campaign to unite every American who knows in their heart that we can do better    the beginning of the end of the disappointments of the Obama years and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write togetherTrumps not in that position at present  and he may not be until the final night of the Republican National ConventionThen again hes not the only candidate going through hard times these daysThe same NBCWSJ poll that gave Trump a historically awful 24 percent positive65 percent negative approval rating and had Hillary Clinton weighing in at 32 percent positive56 percent negative Cruz recorded a 26 percent positive49 percent negative Kasich came in at 31 percent positive 19 percent negativeVermont Sen Bernie Sanders the democratic socialist and Clintons chief tormentor these days received grades of 45 percent positive36 percent negative suggesting that the American electorate is not only sour on the political class but sorely in need of a week in Caracas for a reality check on how a socialist county fares under Bernie VisionWill Trump take advantage of Mays light pace to transition from temper tantrums to a style more tempered Its the practical thing to do Especially when confronted with national poll numbers that for now at least are practically awfulBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford
