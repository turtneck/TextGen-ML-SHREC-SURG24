Dublin IrelandThe West is feeling more and more like an irrational maze The banks are mad The austerity too But the antiRussia hysteria is the final straw Its not just antiRussia its antitruth antirational and antimodern Its the end result of postmodernism What began as irony is now systematic madnessEverything is upside down Or maybe at last its the right side up Maybe the West to begin with never was the Free World Wasnt that the whole point of modernism Modernism was self criticism Modernism was critical of the West And then along came postmodernism And the West suddenly was off the hook The West wearing the clothes of postmodernism went on the attack againThe end result is that anything goes as long as the West wins Forget the truth Forget the facts And forget history Everything apparently is fiction The West can say what it wants because everything is interpretation Thats the beauty of postmodernism You can contradict yourself a million times and laugh it all off As long as youve the power And thats the key word power Because postmodernism was from the word go a political project One that was made in the West for the WestThe end result is hatred for Russia And love for AlQaeda Why Because Russia attempted to rationalise the world It attempted to apply reason to the 21st century And so the irrational West had to punish it Listen to Putin in 2007 when he spoke in MunichHowever what is a unipolar world However one might embellish this term at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation namely one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decisionmakingIt is a world in which there is one master one sovereign And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from withinAnd this certainly has nothing in common with democracy Because as you know democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minorityIncidentally Russia  we  are constantly being taught about democracy But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselvesI consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in todays world And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in todays  and precisely in todays  world then the military political and economic resources would not suffice What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisationAnd listen to him in New York in 2015 when he spoke in the UN General Assembly and so the export of revolutions this time of socalled democratic ones continues It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa as has been mentioned by previous speakers Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time and people there wish for changes naturallyBut how did it actually turn out Rather than bringing about reforms an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress we got violence poverty and social disaster Nobody cares a bit about human rights including the right to lifeI cannot help asking those who have caused the situation do you realize now what youve doneDid you hear the plea for reason Did you hear the cry for modernity Did you hear the demand for moral foundations  for universal values  for international law Did you hear the defence of national sovereignty and the defence of the UN Charter The West didnt In these two key Russian speeches Munich 07 and New York 15 the West only heard a threat to its powerThe Wests reply to Russias rationalism was and continues to be irrationalism Media madness Presidential paranoia and Islamic insanity is the Wests response to the truth And the truth is no secret But the West just shrugs its shoulders and laughs it all off The truth is Western imperialism the unipolar world full spectrum dominance neocon mendacity hybrid warfare sanctions speculation special forces the CIA fundamentalism and American Exceptionalism In short Putin hit the nail on the headAnd the West hit back Why Because the West cant defend itself rationally There is no good reason for all the wealth found in the West So there can only be a bad reason imperial power And modernism proved beyond doubt that it was bad However as this power was rolled back in modern times  as the victims of Empire succeeded in liberating themselves  postmodern times came to the rescue of the West In Nietzsche the West found its champion The will to power was the Wests trump card And with Nietzsches blessing it played itFor Nietzsche all that mattered was power And whoever had it needed no justification or reason Truth was a lie And morality was only for the weak However if this intellectual climate only emerged and became hegemonic in the late 1970s think of Reagan and Thatcher it of course was ever present behind the scenes in the dark corners of Western imperialism For instance Americas leading strategist and Russian expert after World War Two George F Kennan famously put it into words in Memo PPS23 1948We have about 50 of the worlds wealth but only 63 of its populationOur real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentalityWe should cease to talk about vagueunreal objectives such as human rights the raising of living standards and democratisation The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans the betterNietzsche could not have said it better himself The question is though has this elite Western approach to the world changed since Kennan wrote Memo PPS23 No  it has only become more crass As a result this Nietzschean worldview is what Russia is up against today But havent we seen this before Hasnt Nietzsche in another guise attacked Russia already Have not the forces of irrationalism invaded Russia before And did Russia not for our benefit defeat those forces of irrationalism We still owe RussiaSo lets support it today it by burying Nietzsche And by resurrecting universal reason and all the ideals which are built upon it Give modern secular life another chance Not just in Syria but in the West too Aidan OBrien is a hospital worker in Dublin
