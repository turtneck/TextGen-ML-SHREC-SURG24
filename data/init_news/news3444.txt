Ben Carson has had a very strange couple of weeks Lets take a moment to review precisely what the arguable frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has undergone since the CNBC debate in late October At that debate he was challenged on his relationship with a shady nutritional supplement company that sells fart pills to very sick people Carson denied any relationship existed despite the many paid speeches and promotional videos he did for the group In the days that followed it was revealed that Carson thinks the Great Pyramids of Egypt were built by Joseph to store grain  a biblical literalist view that is supported by precisely zero historical or archaeological evidenceBut hey were not done yet The day after the pyramid thing Carson got into a fight with CNN when the network reported that childhood friends and acquaintances of the candidate dont remember Carson being the violent and troubled youth he claims to have been This led to the bizarre spectacle of Carson a candidate for the presidency forcefully insisting that he did in fact try to stab a person and any suggestion that he didnt try to murder someone with a knife is a smearThis string of scarcely believable events culminated on Friday with a Politico report that Carsons oftrepeated claim to have been offered a full scholarship to West Point was untrue West Point doesnt offer full scholarships Everyone accepted to West Point has their entire room board and tuition covered But saying you were enticed with a full scholarship is a great almosthonest way to make it look like the military academy was beating down your doorAll this follows months and months of other weird Carson behaviors  his repeated and inappropriate invocations of the Nazis and slavery to attack policies he doesnt like his Biblebased tax plan his book tour in the middle of the campaign his insistence that a Muslim should not be president his ignorance of basic economic matters his plan to have the government investigate propaganda on college campuses and the fact that his campaign increasingly resembles an elaborate directmarketing scam And thats only a few select tiles from the rich mosaic of Ben Carsons strangenessOne might think that a candidate with this many warning lights and trouble signs would have crashed fairly quickly or never even taken off in the first place But the Republican Party and its voters have declared war on the very concept of competent reliable governance which has provided space for outsider candidates who are manifestly unfit for the office of the presidency to seize the GOP electorate and retain a firm hold on it Now that hes at the top of the GOP 2016 polling hes facing a great deal more scrutiny and people are starting to wonder whether Carson will survive as a frontrunner for the presidential nominationThe obvious impulse for conservatives is to rally around Carson and protect him from the nasty liberal media and its pernicious biases The derpier corners of the conservative media are already doing exactly that arguing that media scrutiny of Carsons past is motivated by racial hatred and part of a broader scheme to attack black conservatives Others found themselves harshly criticizing Carson after the Politico story and predicting his demise only to reverse course and turn their fire back on Politico for overselling the story and toning down some of the more incendiary language in its initial report It would be very easy for Carson to escape from this in the minds of conservatives as just another victim of what they see as a biased and antagonistic pressBut when you look at the entire Ben Carson experience to date whats really needed is more scrutiny and more and better explanations for why exactly he thinks hes ready to serve as president Carson rose to prominence based on his inspiring life story and his willingness to be harshly critical of President Obama But as Paul Waldman notes the more we hear from Carson on policy matters and issue of national importance the more it becomes clear that he frequently has no idea what hes talking about is impervious to evidence and is unwilling to entertain the notion that his convictions may be wrong His policy platform is stuffed with grandiose and insane proposals that are completely untethered to the reality of how governments work and violate principles of basic mathematics but he argues that hell accomplish them anyway because he believes in himself It feels safe to assume given the mood of the Republican electorate that Carson wont have too difficult a time enduring these unwelcome probes into his background and bugnuts worldview Donald Trumps enduring popularity in the Republican primary already stands as a stinging indictment of the direction the GOP has taken The Ben Carson phenomenon has thus far endured in spite of his whacky ideas offensive remarks flirtations with authoritarianism and shady campaign practices I wouldnt be at all surprised if he continues his rise abetted by conservatives who want to shield him from the scrutiny he deserves Watch to find out what we know about Carsons alleged violent incidents
