Hillary Clinton made the case for her presidential bid in a rare interview with Fox News Sunday reaching out directly to the conservative shows primary audience older Republican voters many of them distrustful of her liberal politics and her conduct as secretary of state but even more terrified by Donald Trumps unpredictable temperament and seeming coziness with RussiaWe know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin to support Putin whether its saying that NATO wouldnt come to the rescue of our allies if they were invaded or his praise for Putinwhich is I think quite remarkable Clinton said when asked by Fox host Chris Wallace about the recent hacking attack against the Democratic National Committee which is widely believed to have been carried out by Russia in order to benefit Trump Clinton didnt go so far as to suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin would prefer to see Trump in the White House but she said it raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections in our democracy Trumps history of praising Putin also raises national security issues she arguedThe sitdown interview Clintons first since becoming the first female presidential nominee of a major party and her first with Fox News Sunday in five years was unusual for the veteran politician who is often criticized for her sporadic interaction with the press Unlike Trump who bombards the media constantly Clinton hasnt given a press conference in more than 200 days More unusual was what Clinton was trying to do win over conservatives like George Will who have been driven from the Republican Party by its decision to nominate as its standardbearer a former reality TV star with little history of conservative principlesClinton faces a steep uphill climb however in convincing Republicans that she is trustworthy and wont overstep her bounds as president on the issue of immigration both issues that Fox Newswhich reaired the 10 AM Fox interviewhas repeatedly hammered her on over the last year Confronted with the fact that twothird of voters say they dont trust her the former secretary of state acknowledged she had to do more I have work to do to make sure people know what I have done and what I will do but argued that Americans impression of her is a caricature not reality When I left office as Secretary of State 66 percent of Americans approved of what I do she told Wallace I think that its fair for Americans to have questions I hope youll ask Donald Trump why he is so untrusted by the American peopleThe Democratic nominee also sought to allay Republican voters fears that she would take away or limit access to guns as president a major obstacle to winning over uncertain conservatives who are worried about Trump Im not looking to repeal the Second Amendment Im not looking to take peoples guns away Clinton insisted repeating what she had said in her Democratic National Convention speech last week during which she had accepted her partys nomination for president But I am looking for more support for the reasonable efforts that need to be undertaken to keep guns out of the wrong hands she continued The vast majority of Americans including gun owners support the kind of common sense reforms that Im proposingClintons interview with Wallace was the latest in a series of moves by the presidential nominee to expand her voting base beyond liberal and centrist Democrats to include more conservative voters Days before rightleaning pundits had watched with some concern as the Democratic National Convention gleefully coopted an iconography and vocabulary traditionally belonging to Republicans giant American flags patriotic chants and a parade of highranking military officials police officers former Reagan officials and even Michael Bloomberg once a Republican himself The spectacle was they fretted more American than their own convention a weeklong celebration of TrumpClintons interview augurs potential difficulty on the horizon as she seeks to unite believers of oldfashioned Reaganera conservatism with the ideals of a socialist from Vermont and his legion of scrappy supporters But if anyone can scare more people into the Democratic Partys big tent its Donald Trumpand Clinton is holding open the doors Already there are suggestions that the Democratic nominee could soon receive the endorsement of highprofile dissenters within the Republican ranks even if it risks alienating some portion of her liberal base Fox News itself may soon be shifting toward the center as Rupert Murdochs sons James and Lachlan move to reinvent the network in the wake of Roger Ailes departure amid a sexual harassment scandal If theres anyone who can capitalize on the coming shakeup with a carefullytuned strategy of triangulation its another Clinton
