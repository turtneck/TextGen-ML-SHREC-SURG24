When Bernie Sanders launched his longshot bid for the presidency 10 months ago there were two words that rarely crossed his lips Hillary ClintonNow he cant seem to stop talking about her  and not much of what he has to say is very niceDuring a boisterous rally here the senator from Vermont dinged Clinton for supporting a series of disastrous trade deals He mocked her for refusing to release transcripts of paid speeches she gave to Wall Street firms He said she was wrong to vote for the Iraq War in 2002The transformation has been stark Whats less clear is whether Sanderss rhetoric helps explain his lasting power in a nominating contest that appears likely to drag on for weeks considering the mounting number of victories he has scored in key statesSo far the evidence is mixed In Michigan last week Sanders won a surprising though narrow victory after closing a gap of more than 20 percentage points in the polls He was relentless in the days before the election in criticizing Clinton on trade But Sanders also got trounced the same day in Mississippi  albeit a state where he didnt mount much of a campaignTuesday  a day when five states hold primaries  should give a better indication of whether Sanderss tough talk is paying offOne of those contests is in Illinois and Sanders isnt holding back as he campaigns here In Chicago on Friday Sanders even took aim at Clinton for her close association with Mayor Rahm Emanuel D whose approval ratings are in the tank particularly among black ChicagoansI want to thank Rahm Emanuel for not endorsing me I dont want his endorsement Sanders screamed to the delight of a crowd estimated at 9000 people I dont want the endorsement of a mayor who is shutting down school after school and firing teachersTo drive home his point Sanders held a news conference the next day devoted entirely to Emanuel He told reporters that if he were Clinton he would have refused the mayors supportCompared with the Republican presidential race and other elections in past years the Democratic contest remains relatively tame But the Bernie Sanders who is fighting to remain relevant in the delegate chase against Clinton sounds quite different from the Sanders whose chief antagonist was the billionaire class when he debuted on the campaign trail last springAnalysts say Sanderss decision to attack Clinton more aggressively is understandable Its what candidates who are behind tend to do But in Sanderss case he risks damaging his brand as anantiestablishment politician who has boasted about never running negative television ads and pledged to stay positive in his bid for the Democratic nominationWhen youre promising to run a different kind of campaign its never good to look like youre running the same kind of campaign that other politicians do said Mo Elleithee executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University Its a risk but its a calculated risk and one they seem willing to takeIn an interview Sanders acknowledged that hes adopted a tougher tone but said he has tried to stick to the issues and not engage in character attacks To the extent that the race has turned more negative Sanders said Clinton is to blameWere responding Sanders said I find it disappointing when the secretary mischaracterizes my recordSanders was particularly galled he said by Clintons assertion during their recent debate in Flint Mich that he had opposed releasing funds to bail out the automobile industry  an issue of keen interest to voters in Michigan given Detroits long history as the capital of the auto industryMost fact checkers who looked into Clintons statement concluded she wasnt telling the whole storyIn 2008 Sanders voted for an unsuccessful standalone bill to provide aid to the auto industry The bill Clinton referenced came later and its primary purpose was to bail out Wall Street something Sanders staunchly opposed Some money authorized in the bill wound up flowing to major US automakers thoughTo say that Bernie Sanders who has perhaps the strongest proworker voting record in the United States Congress does not support automobile workers in their time of need  is totally absurd Sanders said Its unfortunate that she made that statementSanders and his aides have tried to argue that none of his TV ads mention Clinton by name But some leave little to the imaginationOn Friday Sanders debuted a pair of ads in Illinois and North Carolina another state that votes Tuesday that say that while his opponent has flipflopped on trade deals Bernie has fought them and stood with American workersClintons positions on some trade deals including the pending TransPacific Partnership have in fact evolved As secretary of state she called the TPP the gold standard of trade deals Last fall she announced her opposition which she stated even more strongly over the weekend She has said she now has a fuller picture of whats being proposedIn the interview Sanders said voters have a right to know where he and his opponent divergeThe differences are becoming fairly clear to the American people and the more the differences between her views and my views get out there the better well be he saidClinton doesnt see it that way During an appearance Saturday in St Louis she said Sanders has decided to close this election by attacking me and misrepresenting my record and hisClinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said Clintons campaign thinks Sanders has broken his word about running a positive raceDuring a rally Saturday in Springfield Mo Sanders continued to hammer Clinton on trade saying their views diverged on the North American Free Trade Agreement which was approved when her husband was in the White House in the 1990sI understood at the end of about three seconds that what this trade deal was about was forcing American workers to compete against very very poor people in Mexico Sanders told his audienceI have voted against every one of these disastrous trade agreements he said Secretary Clintons position has been different She has supported virtually every one of these trade agreementsBoos filled the arena at the mention of Clintons positionSanders has also raised questions about Clintons judgment zeroing in on her decision to deliver a series of paid speeches to corporate interests in the runup to her presidential bid That included some addresses to the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs which paid her 225000 for one speechOn that subject Sanders hasnt hesitated to take a snide toneThe way I see it if youre going to give a speech and get 225000 it must be a really brilliant speech Sanders told a crowd at the University of Illinois on Saturday It must be opening new vistas of human thoughtHe also knocked Clinton for refusing to release transcripts of those speeches to the public She has said she would do so when other candidates are held to the same standardLet me make a dramatic announcement to all of you here today Sanders sarcastically told his crowd Saying he was ready to release transcripts of his Wall Street speeches he swung open his arms to reveal nothing Here they are he saidThe danger for Sanders Elleithee said is not that he will lose diehard supporters with his tougher tone but that it could be harder to attract new ones  including some who like Clinton and are still weighing whether to vote for herSome Sanders fans including Samuel Nebinger who turned out Saturday night to see the candidate in Springfield say theyre not bothered by the more pointed rhetoric Nebinger said he welcomes itNebinger 21 recently dropped out of Missouri State University he said because it was too expensive and he now works at a local call center He was wearing a shirt that said Help Us Bernie Youre Our Only HopeHe wanted to run it clean at first Nebinger said But he needed to go on the offensive because shes been doing so many corrupt things She did that to herself
