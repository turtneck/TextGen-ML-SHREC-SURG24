Well get to the GOP debate momentarily But first a word about the Republicans odyssey and oddity this past yearWelcome to the most volatile Republican presidential race in modern times The upper 66 percent of last years field is either out of the running or running on fumes The top 74 percent in the current field is five times larger than its 15 percednt share of a year agoAnd 2016 It may only add to the confusionOn to the main event and what transpired Tuesday night at The Venetian Las VegasThe good news It was smaller grouping than the last time CNNSalem Radio ran the show nine candidates down two from Septembers gathering at the Reagan Presidential Library And it was truncated  40 minutes less than Septembersthreehour debate from hellStill CNN was plagued by the same problems as before a candidates forum that was too long too lumbering and too laxly herdedHere are seven observations from this the final Republican debate of 20151 No One Trumped Trump It wasnt for a lack of effort Kentucky Sen Rand Paul ripped into Donald Trump less than 30 seconds into the debates start over Internet policy Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush tuttutted Youre not going to insult your way to the presidencyWhat they dont get Trump didnt earn the center spot on the stage courtesy of profound thinking or refined elegance Better to construct ones own case rather than try to deconstruct The DonaldBlame it on the candidates approach and Wolf Blitzers herkyjerky style of questioning like watching a 16yearold drive a stickshift for the first time how many of Trumps rivals made a lasting impression as to how theyd defeat ISIS and protect the homeland2 The Cage Match At various points Paul took swings at Trump Florida Sen Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie The libertarians in the crowd loved it but the candidate came across as desperate  for attention and a lifeline for a campaign struggling to stay afloatThe dustup that the media wanted but didnt get Trump and Texas Sen Ted Cruz Both were too smart to take the baitCruz didnt expound on his differences with Trump over the Muslim immigration ban or a previous comment suggesting he thought Trump lacked a presidential temperament Trump expressed great respect for the other candidates on the stage and ruled out an independent run the nights biggest newsTime will tell whether what Trump said in Vegas stayed in VegasCruz did have some momentary tussles  with Rubio over Senate votes always a good way to put an audience to sleep And Trump his testiest moments came in a personal backandforth with Bush over demeanor and poll numbers3 Executive Order It was a national security debate long on tough talk about leadership skills which would seem an opening for the two sitting governors looking for a legup in this race Christie and Ohio Gov John KasichDid either succeed Not quiteFor Christie the problem was numbers Yes he had some good moments connecting national security to his New Jersey heritage However nine candidates and a roundrobin style of QA too often reduced Christie to interjecting himself into the debate to remind viewers of just how vapid senators can be Carly Fiorina also went down this path at several points jumping into the crosstalk to bemoan the awfulness of the political classAs for Kasich its a matter of rhetorical substance abuse Three governors past and present have departed the race A fourth Bush is struggling to stay relevant Its a political climate in which the Republican base isnt impressed by resumes yet Kasich continues to recite a long Washington biography Ohio the humanity4 Auld Lang Syne And so ends the GOPs debate circuit for 2015 Next up a Jan 14 debate in North Charleston SC hosted by the Fox Business Network5 At a time when many a college student is taking semester finals this debate had the vibe of that last exam of the week before an extended break Tempers were short the candidates seemed tired of sharing the same oxygen6 Debate winners if we must Trump and Cruz for playing mostly errorfree ball7 Debate losers anyone who lost their place in line for theStar Warspremiere by staying home to watch a mostly uneventful debateBill Whalen is a research fellow at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution where he analyzes California and national politics He also blogs daily on the 2016 election at wwwadayattheracesblogcom Follow him on Twitter hooverwhalen
