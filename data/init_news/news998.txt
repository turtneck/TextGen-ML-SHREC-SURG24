President Obamas decision to expand the US war effort in Iraq and Syria is a reflection of the conflicting pressures on a commander in chief who doubts that military force alone can end the conflicts in those countries but who also feels compelled to act in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe and a growing threat to the United StatesThe president on Friday said that he was sending about 50 Special Operations troops to northern Syria to work with Kurdish and Arab fighters battling the Islamic State The deployment though small marks the first fulltime deployment of US forces to the dangerous and chaotic countryThe troops will be accompanied by more US attack planes based across the border in Turkey and plans for more joint raids  led by Iraqi counterterrorism forces  to capture and kill Islamic State leadersThe troops planes and plans for more raids represent an intensification of the presidents existing strategy said senior administration officials Few of those officials however suggested that the moves would be enough to break open the stalemated conflict or produce sudden battlefield gainsThis is a very complex battle space and were not directly involved in the way weve been in the past said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberationsWithout a clear overarching strategy to resolve the conflict were looking at things in a granular way the official said The goal for now is simply to incrementally reinforce those areas that are working and abandon initiatives that are notObama began his second term having brought one war in Iraq to an end and pledging to bring home Americas ground troops from a second in Afghanistan To that end he set hard limits on US deployments and firm time frames for the withdrawal of US forcesBefore deploying forces Obama would regularly demand that his commanders explain the theory of the case behind the moves The phrase is evocative of the presidents legal training and his deep skepticism that US military power can bring lasting change to broken societies He wanted assurances that the operations would work as intended as well as coherent explanations of how and when they would endAs he nears the end of his presidency Obama faces the prospect that he will leave office with ground forces deployed to three combat zonesLast month the president said he would keep 5500 ground troops in Afghanistan to advise struggling Afghan army and to pursue the remnants of alQaeda In Iraq and Syria the president has incrementally boosted the US force beginning an initial deployment of several hundred troops to Iraq in 2014 after Iraqi army forces in Mosul were overrun by Islamic State fighters The president sent 450 more American trainers and advisers after Iraqi forces were routed at Ramadi by a much smaller Islamic State force in the springThose forces were supposed to work with the Iraqi army and local tribal fighters to plan an offensive on Ramadi that has largely stalled We have four axes converging on Ramadi and on any given day none of them makes any movement at all said a senior US official involved in the war planningFrustrated with the lack of progress Obama in July made a rare visit to the Pentagon to push Defense Secretary Ashton B Carter and his top commanders for options to increase the intensity of US military operations without putting US troops in a direct combat roleMore ambitious and costly measures such as nofly zones or buffer zones that would require tens of thousands of ground troops to effectively protect civilians were rejected Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton has said that she favors a nofly zone in Syria Other riskier proposals such as the introduction of Apache helicopters or combat advisers who would move closer to the front lines and call in airstrikes or bolster the Iraqi attack on Ramadi werent explicitly rejected but were deemed unnecessary for nowThe presidents final decision balanced his desire for the United States do more with his determination to keep American forces from being pulled too deeply into conflicts in which US effectiveness was limited or where there were no clear military solutionsThe 50 Special Operations troops and the new attack planes heading to Syria and Turkey will bolster Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that were able to make surprising gains over the summer with the backing of US warplanesThe success in northern Syria wasnt the result of any strategic planning said a senior defense official who tracks operations in the region Really it was an opportunity that fell into our lapsSyrian Arab and Kurdish forces have fought to within 30 miles of Raqqa the Islamic States de facto capital With additional American help US officials said the fighters could isolate the city cutting its supply lines running up to the Syrian borderOver the longer term US officials said that a loose coalition of Syrian Arab Turkmen and Kurdish fighters might be able to dislodge the Islamic State from a 68mile stretch of the border creating a space where refugees can find haven The hope is that the coalition can also begin to provide some level of governance and take part in diplomatic negotiations to replace Syrian President Bashar alAssadBut even the most optimistic US officials said such an outcome could take yearsIn the near term administration officials expressed cautious optimism that the combination of more US air power a bigger Iraqi push against Islamic State forces in Ramadi along with Kurdish and Syrian Arab efforts in Raqqa and along the border could shift the momentum on the battlefieldIf you get all these things in motion you put a lot of pressure on the Islamic State to move and communicate a senior US official said As they do they become targetsSo far its a strategy that hasnt draw much support in Washington Republicans and some Democrats who have been pressing Obama to do more criticized the presidents cautionHis incremental stepbystep approach is an effort to manage risk and keep tight reins on the mission but ultimately it could mean that the whole is less than the sum of its parts said Michele Flournoy the chief executive officer of the Center for a New American Security who was among Obamas top choices to be defense secretary last year before Carter was selectedFlournoy said the addition of US air controllers to call in airstrikes a more robust bombing campaign and more support to moderate rebels combined with the measures the president is already taking could accelerate gains on the battlefieldIf he took these actions all at once it could have a greater impact she saidSome liberal Democrats described the presidents moves as a slippery slope to a deeper US commitment Rep Jim McGovern DMass called the presidents announcement last week the latest in a series of alarming signs that the US war against ISIS will continue to accelerate in the absence of congressional actionWhite House officials meanwhile described the presidents moves as the product of hard lessons learned on a complicated and chaotic battlefield We always envisioned this as a threeyear campaign the senior US official said In year one we learned some of our local partners did well and others didnt So we are doubling down on those who did well
