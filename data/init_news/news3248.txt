As the polls continue to take shape after the conventions were seeing Hillary Clinton further solidify her lead with African Americans Latinos voters under 30 and women Shes made considerable gains with independents and is miraculously chipping away at Donald Trumps lead with white AmericansBut what we dont know is which side of the aisle a critical voting bloc will land seniorsIn the latest CNNORC Poll Clinton received just 35 of the 65 and older vote as Trump earned 53 from the AARP wingThis could spell bad news for Clinton as seniors have only increased their voting powerIn the 2000 election voters 65 years and up made up 14 of the electorate and in the 2012 election the same group made up 16 of all voters and had become considerably more Republican Senior voters have become one of the biggest voting groups eclipsing both African Americans and Latinos who made up 13 and 10 of the 2012 vote respectivelyIn an election where Trump will not do as well as previous Republicans have with Latinos AfricanAmericans and women it is crucial that Trump over performs with senior voters if he wants any chance of winning this raceA February poll found that a majority of senior voters feel neglected by the candidates Indeed 70 said that Clinton and Trump werent paying enough attention to their issues  a big gamble as seniors are a bloc that actually show up to vote In the November 2010 midterm elections 61 of citizens 65 and older turned out to vote This was higher than any other voting contingentJust like all voters seniors want to know that the candidates understand their particular set of circumstances And after the last few years when low interest rates have dealt a serious blow to retirement plans hurting the wallets of seniors across the nation both Clinton and Trump need to spend more time talking dollars and cents with older AmericansSo what can the candidates doHit the two most important issues in this election the economy and national security hard with seniors circumstances in mind and do the same for healthcare an obvious high priority for the elderlyDonald Trumps bleak description of the state of the American economy may resonate with seniors A Bring the Vote Home poll found that 63 of senior citizens disapprove of Barack Obama as President In addition the same poll reported that 76 of seniors feel that the country is on a seriously wrong trackWhile Trump hopes to woo elder voters with his promise of a new direction he thus far lacks the specificity of policy to dramatically win this argument Clinton should emphasize her well detailed platform while also playing off President Obamas endorsement as the most qualified person to ever run for PresidentAnd she should play up her role as the candidate to protect Americans from national security threatsIn a July Pew Poll 80 of Americans stated that terrorism and national security are top issues in deciding who theyre voting for this November Hillary Clinton can win senior voters by continuing the patriotic shift of the Democratic Party they framed at the convention She must take in stride the label of being tough on ISIS and speak of her experience hunting down Osama bin Laden as proof that she will keep America safeFinally to keep seniors on their side both candidates need to reiterate their support to protect healthcare programs that are working especially when costs have been skyrocketing and approval for the Presidents signature plan continues to struggleTo accomplish this both candidates should show their support for Medicare Part D a program created in 2003 to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs mostly benefitting senior citizensHillary Clinton has suggested reforms to Part D by introducing Medicaidstyle rebates for Part D beneficiaries What she does not realize is that mandatory rebates leads to increased premiums and limited choice In an economy where many senior citizens are struggling to keep their heads above water this is not a policy position that will help her gain their critical votesOn the Republican side Donald Trump has broken with much of the GOP by calling for Medicare to negotiate its own prices This goes against Trumps openmarket capitalist spirit as allowing Medicare to negotiate its own prices would lead to a 36 billon loss in research and development for biopharma companiesClearly too much is at stake for the presidential candidates to be pushing these unsound policies for Medicare Part D Not only would the overwhelming majority of senior citizens who rely on Part D be adversely affected but those individuals families and their healthcare providers would be left to pay a considerable price Medicare Part D should be lauded for its success and efficiency especially in economic terms not used as a political pawn leaving our senior citizens at riskAfter all in an electionwhere the majority of seniors are already feeling like their votes arent being courted both Trump and Clinton cant afford to
