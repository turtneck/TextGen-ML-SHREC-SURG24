It was inevitable that liberals would end up beingcondemnedfor the horrific attacks on the Frenchsatirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in which 12 people were killed by what appear to have been Muslim extremists Yes I know it seems strange on the face of it that anyone would think liberals would be responsible for the actions of ultraconservative religious fanatics but this is nothing new It goes all the way back to the capture of John Walker Lind the American Taliban when conservative wags such as Ann Coulterdeclaredthat he naturally became a member of that violent conservative religious sect because he was raised in Marin County California and was thus a liberal role modelConservative writer Andrew Sullivan famously issuedthis indictment just five days after 911It never struck these people as odd that liberals  the coalition that includes feminists gays and promotes religious pluralism including atheism  would throw in with conservative fundamentalists but there it isSullivan later apologized for his remarks Im sure youll be shocked to learn that Coulter did notThis idea never really went away however Its as if some people cannot conceptualize the idea that their enemies might not be in cahoots with one another Even gayloving atheists and jihadis which has to be one of the oddest alliances of all time It took on a slightly different cast whenthe Danish cartoon controversy erupted back in 2006 At that time the right was very critical of the left for allegedly failing to throw the blasphemous and insulting cartoons in the jihadists faces and show proper regard for Western notions of free speech by telling Muslims everywhere in no uncertain terms what they could do with their prohibition on images of the Prophet Mohammed William Kristol of the Weekly Standardput it this wayHe was including that liberal squish George W Bush in his criticism by the way His state department had issued a statementcondemningthe cartoons as being unacceptableFast forward to the horrific events of this week in Paris and well see the same refrain Liberals are once again at least partially responsible for the terrible acts of what appear to be ultraconservative fanatics because they have failed to properly defend free speechYesterday Jonathan Chait in New York magazinequotedthe Time magazine Paris bureau chief Bruce Crumley in the wake of the earlier firebombing of Charlie Hebdo in 2010 angrily condemning what he called majority sections of Western nations to bait Muslim members with petulant futile demonstrations that they arent going to tell us what can and cant be done in free societies He was obviously talking about the attitudes and practices of Islamophobes throughout Europe but did take the magazine to task for its overall offensiveness as wellChait sarcastically says Crumley carefully noted terrorism is bad too But his primary villain was the satirical magazine that provoked the attacks Oddly later in the piece he quotes Crumley saying that societies cannot give in to the hysterical demands of extremists and that violence and intimidation cannot be condoned but his point seems to be that beyond thatanydiscussion or disagreement with the substance of the free speech in question is off limitsHes not speaking of liberalism in the parochial American sense obviously but the criticism hits the same people He goes on to quote Jay Carney Obamas former press secretary who very mildly pointed out at the time that insulting depictions of the Prophet Mohammed are entirely legal but that publishing them showed questionable judgment and concludesThe Muslim radical argues that the ban on blasphemy is morally right and should be followed the Western liberal insists it is morally wrong but should be followed Theoretical distinctions aside both positions yield an identical outcome The right to blaspheme religion is one of the most elemental exercises of political liberalism One cannot defend the right without defending the practice So much for that old American trope about freedom of speech I may not agree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it By defending the practice he apparently means we are also obligated to refrain from objecting towhatpeople say as well which is a very different proposition This essentially says that in defending freedom of speech you must give up your own right to free speech lest you help the terrorists  which is a bit strange And its a concept over whichthe great rightwing defenders of American valuesare going to find themselves in conflict After all the shoe was on their religious feet not that long ago NEW YORKSept 23Hes particularly outraged Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said by a collage of the Virgin Mary dotted with elephant dung He isnt impressed by the pickled pig carcasses either And hes taken dead aim at the Brooklyn Museum of Art It will lose 7 million in city funds he warns unless it cancels a sick exhibit of British works scheduled to open next week Romes Catholic Muslim and Jewish leaders have united to condemn pop star Madonnas decision to stage a mockcrucifixion when she performs in the Italian capitalon Sundaya stones throw away from Vatican City The lapsedCatholic divas latest irreverent performance sees her wearing a fake crown of thorns and descending on a suspended glittery cross as part of her worldwide Confessions Tour Having already been criticised in the United States Catholics priests from across the Eternal City have gone one further saying the act is blasphemy Cardinal Ersilio Tonino speaking with the approval of Pope Benedict XVI said This time the limits have really been pushed too far This concert is a blashphemous challenge to the faith and a profanation of the cross She should be excommunicated In an unusual show of religious solidarity Muslim and Jewish leaders added their condemnation of the selfstyled Queen of Pop famous for peppering her concerts and videos with controversial religious and sexual imagery I think her idea is in the worst taste and shed do better to go home Mario Scialoja head of Italys Muslim League said People get upset about things people say and often condemn them for saying it because its offensive to them or others Its certainly not an exclusively liberal thing unless you think that fundamentalist Islam is liberal or that conservative Catholics like Rudy Giuliani and Pope Benedict are leftwingers But it must be noted that in all the situations outlined here the only person to use the power of the state to try to shut anyone up was Rudy Giuliani Arthur Goldhammer wrotea very insightful pieceabout this latest horror in Al Jazeera He pointed out that Charlie Hedbo was more than just a satirical magazine It followed a certain unique French tradition that was an equal opportunity offender and it reveled in its freedom to vex irritate and derange Its doubtful many people would feel it necessary to defend the substance of everything in its pages  how could they without having their heads explode No what we must defend is the principle under which they were allowed to say what they said period That is inviolable And that principle also allows people to condemn Islam or Charlie Hedbo  or both in the very same breath Once you start policing what people say in the name of free speech youve already lost the argument And yes under that principle we must also defendWilliam Donohues right to say the cretinous idiotic things he saysAnd we can certainly also feel free to condemn him for saying it In doing so we are not advocating that he be silenced We are usingourright of free speech to say we think hes a cretinous idiot and we wish he would stop being one
