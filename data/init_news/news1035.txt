Fitzgerald Griffin Foundation October 29 2016 Classic January 22 1998  Suddenly nobody is questioning Paula Joness veracity anymore Mrs Jones told a simple story and has stuck with it while the president has shifted ground equivocated with his patented carefully worded denials and let his thuggish blundering and very expensive lawyer handle public relations The Clinton teams line echoed by the major media until recently has been that Mrs Jones is trailerpark trash whose allegations are credible only to dirtyminded rightwing Clintonhaters Never mind that her allegations are consistent with a great many other allegations from a great many sources The Clinton strategy was to scare her off and then when that didnt work to make her character the issue leaking their own allegations to the press But her tenacity created enormous pressure forcing the president to make a humiliating appearance in her presence a few days ago to give his deposition  and possibly to try to tamper with other witnesses Only he knows how many other potential witnesses there are The new charges of creepy lechery and criminality have finally cost Clinton his protective press Though Newsweek spiked its own scoop the story exploded anyway All those journalists who have covered for Clinton now feel hes yanked the rug out from under them once too often And it happened because a story they didnt want to dignify with coverage refused to go away The story Newsweek spiked was written by Michael Isikoff who had left the Washington Post in fury two years ago when the paper spiked a similar story hed written on the Jones suit But now the respectable press has finally caught up with the crazy press leaving Hillary Clinton to repeat her usual gripe  Bills just the victim of someones political agenda  to an empty gallery Clinton is standing on a precipice staring down into the abyss of impeachment and prison One nudge  another story witness allegation or tape recording  could push him over And the market value of any damaging evidence has skyrocketed with the media fighting fiercely for the kind of information they used to spurn Hes at the mercy of any bimbo who wants to step forward After being driven from office Richard Nixon was able to make a comeback by claiming however speciously that his motive had always been to defend the dignity of the presidency Thats a claim Clinton wont be able to make If he seduced a twentyoneyearold White House intern and urged her to perjure herself for his sake the dignity of the presidency was the last thing on his mind Nor will he have the diehard itdidntstartwithWatergate defenders Nixon had In Clintons case it started long ago in Arkansas He arrived in Washington with a trail of sleazy rumors some of them substantiated The respectable press ignored all that including the fact that Gennifer Flowers had enjoyed rapid promotion as a state employee and had tapes of Clinton urging her to lie about their liaison It ignored rightwing reports that hed used state troopers to procure women Such stories illustrated his readiness to abuse power for sleazy purposes but they were treated as cheap sex gossip When Paula Jones told her story it fit the pattern  but was rejected as unworthy of serious attention Now that the pattern is undeniable Clinton is still Clintonizing  issuing new carefullywordeddenials as if he might yet exculpate himself with verbal cleverness It hasnt sunk in that he no longer has many supporters who will seize on any excuse for believing his version His guilt isnt an epistemological puzzle Supporting Clinton has become extremely costly He has destroyed the Democrats congressional majorities in both houses and though he managed to win reelection by methods that will now get redoubled scrutiny he has destroyed his own presidency And his disgrace will be contagious The major media should not be allowed to ask How were we supposed to know Its their business to know  and to inform the public But their job had to be done by Paula Jones and the rightwing press  This is one of 82 essays in Joe Sobrans collection of his writing on the President Clinton years titled Hustler The Clinton Legacy  which has just been republished by FGF Books
