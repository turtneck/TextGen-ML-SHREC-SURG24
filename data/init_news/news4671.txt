subject matter may be difficult because were going to be talking about sexual assault Its a confronting and inarguably painful issue for all people especially those who have been victims or those who know someone whos been sexually assaultedAccording to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network or RAIN one of out of every six American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime About 3 of American men or one in thirtythree have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime And from 20092015 Child Protective Services substantiated or found strong evidence to indicate that 63000 children a year were victims of sexual abuseAccording to the National Crime Victims Survey since 1998 there have been 177 million American women who have been raped and 278 million American Men and thats according to the survey There may be more because as we all know a lot of people do not come forward because of the stigmatization and other issues they may face from both the police or familySo before we delve into anything I wanted to say thank you for letting me talk to you about your story because I know its a really painful issue to talk about especially since youre a survivor yourself Feel free to divulge as much or as little as youre comfortable withThe reaction to you talking about your sexual assault because you have talked in brevity on Twitter and I believe on Facebook to some extentWhat was it like What was the reaction like to you talking about itSARAH Part of the reason why I posted it on social media was because I dontand I still really dont I felt like I didnt really have anyone to talk to What kind of in as vague terms as possible there was someone I was seeing outofstate and I went to go see him His best friend ended up assaulting me On top of this my boyfriend whatever you want to call him obviously exboyfriend now blamed me for the entire thing and said it never happened when he was there And called me all these disgusting names and said I deserved it Plus I was just thinking about it the other day because I hate to call it an anniversary but its been a year and like a week basicallyI was just thinking about it and how weird it was that it never happened but then it was my fault for it happening I was just thinking about that and how ridiculous it was But anyways I didnt have anyone that I felt really comfortable talking to and also when it first happened I was outofstate so I had absolutely nobody So it was very scary to me and I felt like TwitterI dont want to call Twitter a safe spacebut I feel like its a place that I can express myself Obviously I get trolled like almost everybody does But I was able to say what was happening almost like an open journal in some kind of playbyplay of what was happeningThankfully a lot of my friends that follow me were very receptive obviously and asked me if I was okay this and that I just felt like it was kind of important to talk about but at the same time I didnt want to tell any of my family members I had like one friend I told I just felt very scared and I felt like I was going to be judged or nobody was going to believe me So its like what is the point of even telling a family member if theyre just going to blame me or say it didnt happen or say Im making it up or being dramatic I project a lot in my head and so I feel like I was like I dont even want to go there because Im going to be more stressed out More anxiety Everything so Twitter was just kind of the place I went toROQAYAH On that note what have you gone through mentally emotionally and maybe even physically in light of the Trump tapes where he gleefully talks about freely assaulting women Because I know that many women have had stay away from social media because of this issue They go through reliving their experiences So what have you gone throughSARAH I actually went on a minivacation that weekend when everything happened with the tapes with my family and none of them know So it was kind of this really bizarre kind of like me listening to all their opinions about it and thankfully for the most part my family members were just like this guy is trash He assaults women Hes disgusting Hes a piece of shit Blah blah blah But you had the few comments of well why are they coming out now And that obviously hurts even more knowing that I never reported my assault If I had said to them oh by the way I was raped too It would be well why did it take you so long to come out type of thingSo that weekend was not really the best weekendJust a lot of the same things that his defenders or his supporters or fans kind of say that are enabling him are the same exact reasons why I didnt report my assault and why I didnt tell so many people because of that same reaction So it just brought back a lot of really bad memories and feelingsROQAYAH People dont understand what it takes to actually report sexual abuse Its more than going to the police and saying hey this happened to me and then its over with Its extremely intense You have to not only tell a complete stranger what happened to you You have to undergo oftentimes medical services that require you to undress yourself do different kind of examinations and then at the end of the day your rape kit may not even be tested for years on end Theres a lot more to itAnd then finding out recently I believe based on reports in the Washington Post and elsewhere cops will routinely laugh and mock sexual assault victims and try to manipulate them into recanting or telling them things like the kid is really young Why you gonna ruin his life So this isnt just something oh you didnt tell Why didnt you tell Its a lot more than filing a report and then going home and youre fine But I think a lot of people assume its that easyDo you think the language that Trump uses in those tapes and uses otherwise to describe women do you think thats pervasive amongst men in the USSARAH Oh totally Even before these tapes happened like if you go back I posted about this on Facebook What he did to Miss Universe even back to Rosie ODonnell He has always been so just disgusting You can just tell hes somebody who thinks theyre more powerful and so much more above women and just thinks theyre there to serve him and he can do whatever he wants to them and hes rich and this and that Like the same thing from the tapesIt was more the reaction to the tapes that was surprising Clearly this is a huge issue in the US You have not just with Donald Trump but you see this a lot of time on the news anyways I remember with Steubenville and a lot of other cases like that swimmer Brock Turner Like oh youre ruining his wife and this and that and no one ever once thinks oh this poor womans life is completely ruined I remember in Steubenville the women had to move out of the town because she was getting harassedIts just so ridiculous to me and so hurtful that this is continuously happening and obviously with Trump too And I think its beyond people who support him I think there are people too who were like oh its just words My mom and I saw some type of report where they went to some random town in Pennsylvania and a lot of them were saying oh thats Trumps personal life Im still going to vote for him And its like how is that personal life Hes assaulting women That shows how disgusting he is and just his character is so rottenROQAYAH A lot of these people defending him either know someone who talks like that or talk like that I was not as angry about it and thankfully I began to say this is really bad You need to stop talking about women like animals basically Whenever I hear any guy defending what he is sayingI mean its very simple All you got to do is say I dont support what he says Its really bad Theres really not more to it but men specifically are going out of their way to say eh this is normal And I dont talk like that but it happens and get over it and youre being politically correct Its a bunch of bullshit they use to defend in reality what they are in real lifeSo being a sexual assault survivor have you had trouble talking about this to other Muslims Because I know that sex and the subject of sexual assault is still unfortunately really taboo in our communitySARAH Thankfully for most Muslim women my friends theyve either  well I shouldnt say thankfully because unfortunately some of them are like this happened to me too Ive had several people friends either from real life or social media contact me and be like this happened to me too which is a whole other issue But I havent reallyEven when I was posting about it on Twitter not that many men really replied I did have a friend that was not that judgmental but he did ask me was I drinking what was I wearing and stuff like that Its like thats not really relevant to the story because youre not asking if he was drinking or what he was wearing Why is that even a question So that really bothered meROQAYAH I dont know why I dont know why this is still an issue with men Theres no reason why that will matter in the story No one has a right to put their hands on another person without consent So if you are butt naked and you are out of your mind drunk it shouldnt matter You dont have the right to touch anyone especially in a situation where they might not be there mentally That kind of thing really makes me sickSARAH It just makes me very angry In my head its almost like are you doubting my story orThe only answer is what if I was wearing a revealing outfit and I was doing shots at the bar or something which I wasnt Does that mean that I deserved it I dont get why youre asking the questionROQAYAH It serves no purpose whatsoever and it works as a way for them to manipulate you and sort of doubt your story without coming out and having a spine to say I dont believe youSARAH Right and especially I feel like from Muslims its like that whole extra well were you drinking because youre not supposed to be Well were you wearing a revealing outfit You shouldnt have beenROQAYAH Thats another issue with Muslims Its a bit offtopic but since we brought up the subject a lot of Muslims look down on other Muslims who drink or who dont wear the hijab or dont follow the religion as they think they should And so we see when a lot of Muslims are in the news and they do something terrible they go oh well he wasnt really a Muslim He was drinking Or he wasnt really a Muslim He was having premarital sex They dont understand that sin doesnt remove you from the fold of your religion in the way that they think So people will make mistakes or do whatever and it doesnt make them any less of a Muslim than you because youre so uber piousThe post Interview Sarah Anastasia Muslim Makeup Artist And Skin Care
