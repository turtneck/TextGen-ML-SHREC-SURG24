Print This is a breaking story and there will be time to update it later But its important for people to get the word out not only that Ammon Bundy and his codefendants have been found not guilty on all charges but that federal marshals who were present used a Taser on Bundys attorney Marcus Mumford when Mumford asked the judge to order Bundy freed unless the feds had a detainer that would give the federal district a reason to keep him in custody First the news about the acquittals and one hung jury outcome A federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy his brother Ryan Bundy and five codefendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation threat or force during the 41day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge The Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundys charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras The jury didnt have to deliberate for long The jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the highprofile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon The defendants and their legal teams were naturally thrilled and relieved But the real drama started when Ammon Bundy lawyer Marcus Mumford asked for documentation on a pending case against Bundy in Nevada for which a detainer would give the feds a reason to keep him in custody The coda to the stunning verdict undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors was when Ammon Bundys lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt should be allowed to walk out of the court a free man US District Judge Anna J Brown told him that there was a US Marshals hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada If theres a detainer show me Mumford stood arguing before the judge Suddenly a group of about six US Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table The judge directed them to move back but moments later the marshals grabbed on to him What are you doing Mumford yelled as he struggled and was taken down to the floor As deputy marshals yelled Stop resisting the judge demanded Everybody out of the courtroom now Mumford was taken into custody a member of his legal team confirmed Ammon Bundys lawyer J Morgan Philpot said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun or Taser on his back Another member of Ammon Bundys legal team Rick Koerber echoed Philpot saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him Philpot decried the marshals treatment of Mumford in the courtroom What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government he said By 630 pm Mumford was released from custody He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom I would say this is unreal except that things like this are happening far too often now Mumford was merely doing what a good lawyer would do arguing zealously for his client There is no reason why he should have remained silent Demanding a detainer document if Bundy was not to be released is exactly what any defense attorney should have done in the situation The Oregonstandoff situation has been full of such unjustified highhandedness by the federal government from the beginning and this latest event just raises the red flags again Americans should be very alarmed at what our federal government feels entitled to do now including federal officers disobeying a judge in her courtroom in order to manufacture an incident out of nothing Dont assume that word of what actually happened will get out through the MSM Here is how the New York Times reported the marshals rugby scrum against Mumford In a sign of the tension that ran through the trial Ammon Bundys lawyer Marcus R Mumford frustrated that the Bundys were not being released was restrained by four United States marshals after an outburst This makes it sound as if the marshals were acting under the judges order when in fact  according to the Oregonian account  she told them to back off after they converged on Mumford One of these accounts is essentially a lie I know which one my money is on We no longer live in a world in which MSM outlets can be assumed to be acting in good faith But its up to us whether we have such a world again
