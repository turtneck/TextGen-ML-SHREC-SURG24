You must file back to the Democrats convention in Chicago in 1968 to find a similar political forum which unfolded under such a pall and the potential for epic violenceAnd frankly as the GOP convenes its Cleveland conclave things could be even more volatile after the three police murders in Baton RougeSecurity concerns are off the chart in Cleveland The country reels from Baton Rouge  just days after the assassinations of five Dallasarea police officers We havent even mentioned talked about controversial police shootings of black motorists in Baton Rouge and Minnesota Turkey boils People are still trying to piece together a murderbyRenaulttruck scheme in Nice FranceWhen was Orlando againAnd then there are the politics at the GOP conventionThis convention features the mostunconventional candidate to head the ticket of a major political party in decadesWelcome to the Cleveland ShowIt wasnt long ago that Ryans predecessor former House Speaker John Boehner ROhio suggested the GOP should try to draft the Wisconsin Republican as the 2016 standardbearer should Donald Trump fail to secure the nomination on the first ballot Then Ryan called a press conference this spring to quash once and for all suggestions that there was some way Republicans would draft himSo Ryan is sticking with his day jobA better place to beIn the days after Orlando Ryan tried to cobble together a terrorismguns package before Congress bolted Washington for a protracted sevenweek recess But those efforts collapsed after Republicans rejected virtually any gun legislation There didnt appear to be the votes for a plan authored by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn RTexas It would grant the attorney general a threeday window to halt potential gun sales for prospective terroristsI think what we should be focused on is listening to people in communities who have done a good job of merging law enforcement with the communities so that these kinds of problems dont occur Ryan said after the questionable traffic stop killings and police violenceDallas was known in law enforcement circles as one of those agencies which had done just that in recent years Still look what happenedDemocrats struggled to keep their focus on firearm laws On Thursday night House Democrats staged a speakout about guns at sunset on the West Front of the US Capitol But even that scored scant coverage Just an hour before the protest the nowinfamous white lorry tore through the streets of Nice bludgeoning everyone in its pathOne violent news story usurped by another violent news story Before long it too was usurped by another violent news story the coup attempt in Turkey And then that fell by the wayside too as soon as gunfire cut down officers in Baton RougeBaton Rouge frayed nerves even further in ClevelandImmediately the union representing the Cleveland Police Department fired off a request to Ohio Gov John Kasich Law enforcement wanted Kasich to suspend a state law allowing for the opencarry of firearms around the convention zoneOhio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state Constitutional rights or state laws as suggested said KalmbachDuring an appearance on Fox News Steve Loomis president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmans Association took issue with KasichThats a wellwritten political statement Theres no basis in reality The governor could easily declare a state of emergency and act with executive powers said LoomisOf course this is precisely why some Democrats assert its important to change the law If the law poses danger then change itWell find out soon if the law is right on this scoreKeep in mind that Cleveland banned everything from water pistols to tennis balls in an area near the convention But firearms are fine under the Buckeye States opencarry statuteOne can only imagine how the Baton Rouge shootings could reignite the gun debate in WashingtonInterestingly most of the gun reform efforts propounded by Democrats  and even some Republicans  would do little to end the spate of violence which now grips the country Moreover another utterly incomprehensible slaughter of law enforcement on the eve of the most combustible political convention in nearly a halfcentury unglues those already fretting about security in Cleveland If the police arent safe then no one is safe That means all Constitutional freedoms are in jeopardy tooNo wonder everyone is flipped out about security at the Republican convention And we havent even gotten to the Democratic convention next weekEveryone is expecting the Republican convention to erupt into a conflagration  be it a political melee in the hall or violent protests in the streets The bar is pretty low But if things actually go well a successful relatively calm convention helps establish calm elsewhere But if things erupt into mayhem all bets are offIts possible a debate over guns and unrest could dominate the conversation If so the trend of police shootings coupled with violence in Cleveland could very well drive Democrats closer to their goal of votes on gun billsAnd that could be the ultimate irony of the Cleveland convention
