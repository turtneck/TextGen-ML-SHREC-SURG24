New emails show Huma scheming for Hillary Assange promises that WikiLeaks will release proof that Hillary has rigged the elections Yesterday WikiLeaks sent out an alarming tweet that Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel called for WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange to be assassinated The tweet contains a video snippet of Beckel on FoxNews saying The way to deal with this is pretty simple  you get Special Ops Operations forces I mean a dead man cant leak stuff This guys Assange a traitor treasonous and and hes broken every law of the United States The guy ought to be  and Im not for the death penalty so if Im not for the death penalty the only way to do it is illegally shoot the son of a bitch  Blog and news sites including big names like ZeroHedge and Pamela Geller  are reporting Beckels vile remarks as contemporaneous in the context of WikiLeaks current exposs of Hillary and the DNC Not so Beckel actually made those remarks 5 years ago in December 2011 Heres a longer FoxNews video wherein Beckel was part of a panel discussing how the US should deal with Assange and WikiLeaks for their release of the State Departments diplomatic cables Beckels shoot the son of a bitch remarks begin at the 057 mark That it was 5 years ago that Beckel had called for assassinating Julian Assange doesnt make it less reprehensible Its also ridiculous for Beckel to call Assange a traitor and treasonous because Assange is Australian not a US citizen So who is Bob Beckel According to Wikipedia  67yearold Bob Beckel is a political analystpundit who began his professional life as a Democratic administration official and Democratic Party operative He was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 1977 and Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs 1978 in the Carter administration the campaign manager for Walter Mondales 1984 presidential campaign founder of the consulting  lobbying firm Bob Beckel  Associates 1984 campaign manager of a Democratic US Senate candidate in Idaho 2002 USA Today columnist 20052015 FoxNews  token angry liberal  cohost 20112015 and since October 2015 CNN commentator on the 2016 election Wikipedia makes no mention of Beckel being a Hillary Clinton strategist nor have I found confirmation that he is a Hillary strategist other than what the WikiLeaks tweet claims But all that doesnt mean he isnt a Hillary Clinton strategist given Beckels history as a Democratic Party operative There must be a reason why WikiLeaks sent out its tweet of Beckels 5yearold call to assassinate Assange Perhaps Assange has received death threats and does not want the same fate that befell DNC staffer and WikiLeaks informant Seth Rich See  WikiLeaks  Julian Assange murdered DNC staffer was source of leaked DNC emails  Ht maziel
