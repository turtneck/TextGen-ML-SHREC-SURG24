The number of middle and high school students using electronic cigarettes tripled between 2013 and 2014 according to government figures released Thursday a startling increase that public health officials fear could reverse decades of efforts combating the scourge of smokingThe use of ecigarettes among teenagers has eclipsed the use of traditional cigarettes and all other tobacco products a development that Tom Frieden director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called alarming and shockingWhats most surprising is how incredibly rapid the use of products other than cigarettes has increased Frieden said in an interview addingthat some ecigarette smokers would undoubtedly go on to use traditional cigarettes It is subjecting another generation of our children to an addictive substanceTheresults based on an annual survey of 22000 students around the country and published Thursday by the CDC detail a quickly evolving landscape of tobacco products that appeal to teenagersAntismoking advocates argue that the rise in the popularityof ecigarettes stems in part from aggressive largely unregulated marketing campaigns that Frieden said are straight out of the playbook of cigarette ads that targeted young people in earlier generationsThese are the same images the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago said Matt Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids Its the Marlboro Man reborn Its the Virginia Slims woman recreated with the exact same effect  This is not an accidentBut advocates of ecigarettes  small devices that heat up flavored nicotinelaced liquid into a vapor that is inhaled  say the worries expressed by public health officials are premature and not backed up by dataCynthia Cabrera executive director of the SmokeFree Alternatives Trade Association an industry group said her organization has long supported age restrictions and other measures to keep ecigarettes out of the hands of minors But at the same time she said theres no definitive evidence ecigarettes are a gateway to using traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products On the contrary she said manyteens have triedecigarettes in the past already were smokersWe need to not lose perspective about the potential these products have to eliminate harm from combusted tobacco she said I suspect teens experiment with a lot of things And I suspect anytime someone is not smoking a cigarette thats a good thingThe CDC should really be jumping for joy at the fact that smoking rates are declining This is a huge success added Michael Siegel a professor and tobacco control specialist at Boston Universitys School of Public Health Instead they are using this as another opportunity to demonize ecigarettesSiegel said he agrees that minors shouldnt have access to any tobacco product But he said the CDC numbers suggest that rather than serving as a gateway to cigarette smoking ecigarette use might be diverting teens from traditional cigarettes which still kill hundreds of thousands of Americans each year Thats a good thing he saidWhile tobacco giants such as Lorillard and Altria have indeed purchased ecigarette companies in recent years Cabrera disputed that those marketing campaigns target underage smokers And she said the bulk of ecigarette marketing is still done by hundreds of small companies whose ads on the internet and other platforms target only adultsIf youre thinking this is Big Tobacco redux thats the wrong thinking she saidThis much seems certain Teens are experimenting as much as ever Roughly a quarter of high school students and near 8 percent of middle school students still report using a tobacco product at least once during the past 30 daysBut between 2013 and 2014 the findings show ecigarette use among high school students had increased from 45 percent to 134 percent Usage also more than tripled among middle school students according to the findings Only among black students was another tobacco product cigars more popular than ecigarettes the CDC saidDuring that same period the use of hookahs  water pipes that are used to smoke specially made tobacco  roughly doubled for middle and high school students also eclipsing the use of regular cigarettesSeven things to know about ecigarettesMeanwhile use of conventional cigarettes sank to the lowest levels in years According to the CDC 92 percent of high school students and 25 percent of middle school students reported smoking a cigarette over the past monthOn the surface that might seems like good news given the hundreds of thousands of Americans that still die from smoking each year And it might be The drop in cigarette use is historic with enormous public health significance Myers said But he was quick to add the explosion of ecigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown longterm consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress weve madeLast April the Food and Drug Administrationannounced that for the first time it would begin to regulate ecigarettes which has grown into a multibilliondollar industry in the United States The agencysaid its plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients in ecigarettes The initial proposals stopped short of halting online sales of ecigarettes restricting television advertising or banning the use of candy and fruit flavorings that critics say are intended to appeal to young smokersA year later the FDA has not finalized any new regulations involving ecigarettes though its top tobacco officials said in a statement Thursday the agency still plans to oversee the burgeoning marketIn todays rapidly evolving tobacco marketplace the surge in youth use of novel products like ecigarettes forces us to confront the reality that the progress we have made in reducing youth cigarette smoking rates is being threatened said Mitch Zeller JD director of FDAs Center for Tobacco Products These staggering increases in such a short time underscore why FDA intends to regulate these additional products to protect public healthMyers said such action cant come soon enoughThe failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed he said In the absence of strong governmental action these numbers will only keep going up
