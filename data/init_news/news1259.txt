Bernie Sanders Has Strength Among White Men Pinched By The EconomyWhen Bernie Sanders won the primary in Michigan last week it shook up the narrative of the Democratic raceSanders did so with the help of white men If hes able to pull off a victory in Ohio the same demographic will likely be keyTake Jim who describes himself only half jokingly as an angry white manWere pissed off Jim said Jims asked that his last name be withheld because his union AFSCME has endorsed Hillary Clinton and he supports Sanders He cant be quoted publicly going against his union We havent gotten raises Our pensions have been cut Our healthcares increasedAnd Jim added Sanders speaks to that Bernie he speaks from the trenches Jim said We feel that hes fighting for usIn Michigan Sanders won with the support of 62 percent of white men who were oneinthree voters according to exit polls In 2008 in the Democratic primary in Ohio white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions to this years Michigan contestAt the same time black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and likely wont be enough to put Clinton over the top In Michigan Clinton won more than twothirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate In 2008 Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio they were just 18 percent of the electorate and Clinton won the state ironically with the support of white voters including white menRyan a member of a building trades union in Cleveland who also asked NPR not to use his last name because his union has endorsed Clinton feels the same way as JimShes Clinton seen as the centrist candidate Ryan said And shes a bigmoney candidate And big money and centrism hasnt been working for middleclass America for the past 30 years Since ReaganWhen Ryan first saw Sanders speak a few months ago something clicked He said it was as if a politician was finally saying what Ryan had been thinking about the state of the country Ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to Sanders campaign and later bought a TshirtLike NASCAR everyone wear their patchAt a union hall in Cleveland both Jim and Ryan talked about rising healthcare costs and trade deals that they believe have hurt much more than they helpedSanders overwhelmingly won voters in Michigan who thought trade deals cost American jobs  58 percent of voters said so there and Sanders won them 2to1 Oneinthree Michigan voters said they lived in a household with a union member Clinton and Sanders split them Likely accounting for that were black union members who went for Clinton Those numbers are not split out in exit pollsJim said hes only gotten one raise really more like a costofliving adjustment in eight yearsYou look at the stock market he said its gone up I dont know how many a couple of hundred percent You know my wages have gone up 2andahalf percent And whos speaking to that Bernie is And yeah I think maybe hes kind of like Don Quixote But I mean thats part of the attraction It really is At least for meAnd Jim insists this isnt about gender He loves his congresswoman who incidentally endorsed Sanders on FridayThere are elements of Clintons stump speech designed to speak to workingclass men including the parts where she talks about punishing companies that ship jobs overseas But its clear from these interviews that Sanders attacks on Clintons trade record her superPAC her big money speeches to Wall Street banks  they are breaking throughThe money issue nags at Dave Passalacqua He likes that Sanders gets his campaign cash from regular peopleTheres that old saying is politicians should be like NASCAR everyone wear their patch Passalacqua said You know lets see what the patches are and Sanders doesnt need to wear a patch because its his own thingPassalacqua is executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland His union has endorsed Sanders but hes still undecidedPassalacqua agreed to meet at a Cleveland diner along with Jim Goggin a fixture in the citys labor community Hes an organizer for the Delaware Valley Health Care CoalitionIts pie in the sky said Goggin with an unmistakable Irish lilt I mean everything Bernie says I think would be fantastic But the fact of the matter is that I am also a realist and I know that you cant do thatFor Goggin it is all about beating the Republicans in NovemberAnd I wish to God that I thought he could win Goggin said But I dont unfortunately think he can win Consequently Im with Hillary because at least shes not going to throw us under the bus the working peoplePassalacqua chimes in And one good thing that Bernies been doing though even with Hillary is Bernie has moved Hillarys positions on thingsFrom the outside it seems Passalacqua is having a classic voters struggle between his head and his heart He isnt convinced Sanders will be able to do what hes promising Who will he vote forWhoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line Whoever is going to make  not to steal Donalds line but  America great again said Pasalaqua quoting Donald Trumps catch phrase Because in order to make America great again weve got to make the middle class great again So whoevers going to do that I thinks going to be the best person And thats who Ill end up having to vote forNo matter how Tuesdays vote turns out and no matter who wins the nomination all four men said they would support the Democratic nominee in November
