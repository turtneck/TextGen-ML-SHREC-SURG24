CNN Tori Sisson and Shant Wolfe of Tuskegee Alabama camped outside the Montgomery County Courthouse overnight hoping that when the sun rose Monday theyd be the first samesex couple to be legally married in the countyThey arrived at 2 pm Sunday and set up their tent Expecting a crowd  of mostly media and friends or their chosen family as many of their kin dont approve of their relationship  they awoke at 5 am Monday to get dressed so that when we got out of the tent wed look like a million bucks Sisson saidSisson 24 and Wolfe 21 have known each other for seven years Theyve been dating for two Last year the pair got spiritually married in Tuskegee but it wasnt a staterecognized union  where all the rights and benefits of matrimony are conferred on both partnersThey previously considered going to a state that allowed samesex marriage but Wolfe balked at the ideaWe work here and we pay taxes here and we didnt feel it was right that wed have to do that because nobody else does she saidThough there were some minor computer problems in issuing their license their wish soon came trueWith one of their godmothers performing the ceremony they exchanged vows outside the courthouse and kissed as a phalanx of media cameras captured the moment One of those cameras belonged to the Human Rights Campaign a watchdog group involved in marriage equality advocacy Sisson works for the organizationSisson wept while Wolfe did notOne of us has to hold it together Wolfe quippedSissons tears werent borne solely of the bliss that comes with being joined in union with your beloved Sure those sentiments were there Sisson said but she cried also because she had been thinking all night about the myriad couples who were denied the opportunity she and Wolfe were able to seize MondayWe have the honor to be the first couple in Montgomery County to do this Its amazing Sisson said explaining the overwhelming and overflowing love I have for Shant but also for people and the hope I have in my heart that this really means progress hereHow we got hereThough the US Supreme Court and the US District Court for the Southern District of Alabama cleared the way for samesex marriages to begin Monday in Alabama the famously conservative chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Sunday mounted a lastditch effort to stop the weddings instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to samesex couplesThat didnt stop several couples from converging on county courthouses across the state Probate Judge Alan King in Jefferson County the states most populous said there appeared to be a largerthanusual crowd outside the courthouse when he arrived at work MondayEffective immediately no Probate Judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama Probate Judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with the state code or constitution Moore wrote in the orderThe American Civil Liberties Union called Moores order spurious and reminded Alabamas probate judges they are sworn to uphold the US Constitution which outweighs state law on this issueJudge Roy Moore has no authority to trump a federal courts decision said Susan Watson executive director of the ACLU of Alabama By issuing his order he has done nothing but create confusion among the different probate offices across the state Whereas some counties are issuing licenses to samesex couples there are many who arent Unfortunately we have received a number of complaints to that effectThe Human Rights Campaign has already denounced the order as a clear violation of all codes of legal ethics and several counties  including Jefferson Montgomery and Madison  have told CNN they intend to issue samesex marriage licenses MondayBut in Tuscaloosa County where five samesex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened Monday chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the court would follow Moores guidanceWe will be issuing traditional marriage licenses she told CNNShelby Marshall and Houston counties also are declining to issue the licenses and in Lee County where two samesex couples attempted to tie the knot Monday Judge Bill English said he too was complying with an order from the chief justice late last nightOther probate judges werent sure Moore had the law behind himI was shocked King said of his reaction to Moores order Im old enough to remember the George Wallace stand in the schoolhouse door I was a kid at the timeKing was referencing the 1963 attempt by thenGov Wallace to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the University of Alabamas Foster AuditoriumContacted before his court opened for the day King said he doesnt want to be on that side of history After consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze Moores order Im convinced its my duty to follow the US Constitution and the federal court order At 8 am we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in Jefferson County  I dont think Moores order is grounded in legal theory just like Gov Wallace in the 1960s was not grounded in law he saidGov Robert Bentley said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licensesHe added that he had great respect for the legal process and said We will follow the rule of law in Alabama and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channelsThe federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until Monday to allow probate courts to prepare Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the US Supreme Court to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of samesex marriages in four statesIn this case the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court resolves this important Constitutional questionStrange responded in a statement In the absence of a stay there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Courts anticipated ruling on the legality of samesex marriage Strange further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys about how to respond to the ruling
