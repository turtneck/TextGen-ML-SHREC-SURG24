The roots of gridlock will never be addressed until we stop restating the problem and start focusing on the solutions The good news is that we not only can bridge this political divide we already areIts not just young revolutionary Bernie Sanders supporters or angryashell Donald Trump fans who want to change the system Its also the president of the United States of AmericaThe future we want will only happen if we fix our politics said President Obama in his 2016 State of the Union address If we want a better politics its not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a president We have to change the system to reflect our better selvesBut exactly how do we do that The president did not say And when William Jefferson Clinton in 1992 and George W Bush in 2000 expressed the same noble sentiment they didnt tell us how eitherOur last three presidents did not tell us because they dont know They are products of the system and clearly are not going to reform much less revolutionize it They have risen to the top of the leadership pyramid by playing the partisan game Them telling us how to work together would be like an alcoholic telling us how to get sober He knows everything about the topic except doing itOn both sides of the aisle Democrats and Republicans are recognizing that they are in a longterm political marriage that needs help But even if both donkeys and elephants want to repair their broken relationship they still need to learn how The primary causes of dysfunction that Obama identified  the gerrymandering of congressional districts and the tyranny of money in campaigns  are certainly real But these and other causes will never be effectively addressed unless we stop restating the problem and start focusing on the solutionsThe good news is that we not only can bridge this political divide in fact we already areI have recently interviewed and profiled dozens of Americans who know how to solve problems across the divide They are doing so in state legislatures and on Capitol Hill in living rooms and town halls between corporations and anticorporate activists with police departments and minority communities and in almost every sector of our society When diverse groups connect in constructive dialogue they make progress on issues ranging from criminal justice reform to internet privacy to education reformLiterally dozens of major initiatives have had concrete successes bringing Left and Right together to break down the partisan wall and find common ground They have succeeded where Capitol Hill has failed This movement to reunite America is gaining momentum because it starts with four fundamental shifts that are a vital part of fixing our politicsFrom Confirming to Learning Anyone who thinks that political leadership means thinking that whatever we believe is automatically right  and anyone who disagrees with us is wrong  is not part of the solution Simply confirming what one already knows is not leadership it is an addiction to being right The movement to reunite America is redefining leadership to be about learning rather than about being knowitalls Check out  or as examples of this shiftFrom Control to Relationship Particularly during elections winning seems to be everything Controlling the Congress and the White House appears to be the goal But on the day after the election whoever won or lost must forge a relationship with the opposition Making relationships across the divide strong and healthy is today the key to accomplishing anything that endures Learn more from or the 2000member From PositionTaking to ProblemSolving America has a surplus of leaders with rigid positions and a deficit of leaders who solve problems Its time to reverse that imbalance Across the country a host of problemsolving organizations are gaining ground Examples include No Labels in Washington DC to in San Francisco from in Tallahassee to the in Kansas CityFrom Endless Campaigning to Effective Governance The line between campaigning and governing used to be clear Campaigns were brief preludes before Election Day not neverending titfortat attacks that became a permanent part of civic life But today campaigning is benefiting from unprecedented levels of investment and governing is being paralyzed Fortunately from the offices of city mayors to statelevel initiatives and even on the edges of Capitol Hill redblue coalitions are finding common ground on a wide range of policy issues ranging from criminal justice reform to education to defense spending  s Next Generation project for example has convened acrosstheaisle collaboration in scores of state legislaturesSo we Americans do know how to work together But we have to get past the soaring rhetoric from the right and the left about how they alone can save America We have to get down to the real business of learning and applying boundarycrossing skills If we actually want a system that reflects our better selves lets start with what works Lets take to scale the scores of projects where that is already happeningMark Gerzon president of Mediators Foundation is the author of  The Reunited States of America How We Can Cross the Partisan Divide
