Implausible schemes to put Mike Pence rather than Donald Trump on the top of the ballot have been flying since a oncesecret recording of Trumps lurid boasting about sexual assault leaked to the public on Friday eveningPence has issued a public statement on Trumps remarks saying he does not condone his remarks and cannot defend them  but accepted Trumps apology and suggested hed stick by him through the second presidential debate on Sunday night Anonymous sources say privately Pence is beside himself over the details in the leaked audioMeanwhile multiple prominent Republicans  from former rival for the nomination Carly Fiorina to former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a number of members of Congress  have called for Trump to step aside and allow Pence to be the nomineeOn some level the Republican longing for Pence in the face of these new details about Trumps past makes sense Hes an experienced politician with a long track record He has impeccable social conservative credentials Hes the governor of a state He can pay attention in a debate long enough to land punches on Tim Kaine And he has almost certainly never been secretly recorded talking about a womans tits or pussy or bragging about kissing women against their willBut if Republican politicians are really horrified by Trumps remarks  and not just by the possible electoral implications  Pence made one decision that should disqualify him in their eyes too Mike Pence agreed to be Donald Trumps vice presidentPence lent Trump the legitimacy he needed to unite the Republican Party He spent months apologizing for Trump explaining what Trump really meant and doing everything he could to put Trump in the Oval OfficeTrump himself pointed to party unity as one of the key reasons for choosing Pence as his running mate in the first place making no secret of the role he viewed the Indiana governor as playing in the campaignIts not as if Pence didnt know what he was doing By the time Trump picked him as his running mate on July 14 Trump had alreadyNor was Trumps rampant sexism a secret His public feuds with celebrities aside the New York Times had already published a long article on times Trump was accused of crossing boundaries with women in his private lifeAnd of course Trump had spent years publicly doubting that President Obama was born in the United StatesThis is not a complete list But by the time Trump was picking a running mate it was clear that he was a man with a history of bigoted racist sexist behavior and remarks This is what Pence agreed to make palatable to the Republican establishment to social conservatives and to swing votersPence was going against his own principles as these tweets from before he joined the ticket showAnd Pence has stood by Trump throughout the ensuing controversies  Trumps fights with a Gold Star family and the 1997 Miss Universe among them Hes watched Trump tell black voters that they should vote for him because What do you have to lose and say that the Central Park Five proved innocent by DNA evidence should have been executed anywayTo characterize Pence as a paragon of respect and decency who happened to wake up one morning and through no fault of his own be Trumps running mate ignores the role Pence played in trying to make Trump palatable to voters and the establishment in the first placeIf the case against Trumps presidency is his poor judgment and his lack of respect for women what does Pences tacit approval of all of this say about him
