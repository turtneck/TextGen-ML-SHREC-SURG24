Rand Paul may very well already beon his way out of the Republican presidential campaign but hes going out with a bang not a whimper forcefully rebuking his Senate colleague and Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz for being the root of Senate dysfunctionPaul told Fox News Brian Kilmeadethat he believed Cruzs petty politics and disregard for Senate decorum have made him an ineffective legislator writing off the Texas freshmans future in the senate He is pretty much done forTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate and as a consequence he cant get anything done legislatively He is pretty much done for and stifled and its really because of personal relationships or lack of personal relationships and it is a problem I approach things a little different I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing  I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and its just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end resultIn July Cruz called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell the effective leader of the Republican Party a liar on the Senate floor Days later his Republican colleagues refused to grant him the 16 votes needed to pass a simple procedural vote as a public rebuke of his outburst This week McConnell got his revenge denying for now Cruz the government shutdown over Planned Parenthood he so desperately wanted to prop up his presidential campaign Of course that didnt stop the stunts from Cruz  he tried to offer up a referendum on McConnells leadership this week before being summarily shutdown by his fellow Republican senatorsOf course Paul is mostly just backing up the senior senator from his home state of Kentucky as he actually opposes the continuing resolution set to pass this week to keep the government operating for the time being Paul like Cruz is in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood even if that means shutting down the government over it He just disagrees with Cruzs tact I would defund not only Planned Parenthood but hundreds and hundreds of regulations hundreds and hundreds of wasteful programs I would take them all out put them on the table and say You know what Democrats it doesnt take 60 votes to defund something its actually going to take 60 votes to fund any of these programs vote on them one at a time and we will see how many of these crazy programs get 60 votes My guess would be very few but that would take the courage to let the spending expire and start anew and let new programs all require 60 votes to pass Paul and Cruz would appear to be natural allies with their Tea Party base of support and their libertarian bents but since entering the Senate the two have had markedly different styles Cruz has been on a seemingly nonstop rant against the DC establishment while Paul has forged friendships and close political alliances with the partys top leaders as he works doubletime to keep his Senate seat while running for president
