by Yves Smith Be sure to vote today if you havent already Even if you dislike the Presidential choices downticket races are important And an overdue note Thanks SO much to those of you who came out to meet me in Dallas last week We had a group of 3035 attend including someone from Iowa and a libertarian who declared that NC was one of only three nonlibertarian sites that he reads We have a lively discussion and I think everyone had a good time The organizer of the evening Steve in Dallas circulated a list for people who wanted to be on a Dallas Meetup listserv Some participants had already left by then so if you missed the opportunity to sign up and would like to be included or missed this meetup but want to be kept in the loop please ping me at yvesatnakedcapitalismcom and Ill send your coordinates to Steve Please put Dallas Meetup in the subject line At the end of the evening Steve raised an important issue hes tried getting friends and family members to read NC and other independent media with much less success than hed like I volunteered that most people dont want to question authority and that going outside the mainstream media was tantamount to admitting that the traditional press was wrong or doing a superficial job This chart might help get traditional media loyalists to consider that reporting isnt what it used to be If readers have other approaches that have worked please share them in comments Thanks
