Are Republicans going to use their control of Congress to pass immigration reform in 2015 The short answer is noHeres the best reason to think that they wont if Republicans were serious about passing immigration reform next year youd at least see Republican officials and pundits saying so on Spanishlanguage media to reach out to Latino voters But theyre notOn the election night edition of Univisions nightly news broadcast which only lasted an hour from 1130pm to 1230am Eastern rather than the allnight orgy of English language news networks immigration was the first issue that came up in any segment And while everyone on the broadcast agreed that immigration reform needed to happen no one was willing to say that the Republican Congress would take it onWhen Univision interviewed an actual Republican member of Congress  newly elected Florida congressman Carlos Curbelo who beat oneterm Democrat Joe Garcia a big supporter of immigration reform  he was openly supportive of immigration reform saying in Spanish Im ready to go to Washington to work with Republicans and Democrats to achieve it But he didnt make any promises that Republicans are about to take up the issue In fact Curbelo wasnt terribly eager to defend his colleaguestobe We have to be honest Yes there are Republicans in the House whove blocked immigration reform Ive criticized them  just like Ive criticized the president for using the issue for politics and failing to keep his promisesDuring an analysis segment also in Spanish host Jorge Ramos pressed Republican analyst Mercedes Schlapp on whether Republicans would really do immigration reform Her response began withBueno yo espero que hagan algo  Well I hope they do something Instead of making any predictions about whether the Republican Congress would she made a point that Univision viewers are very familiar with that Republicanstienen que en alguna manera buscar solucin  they have to find some sort of solution  if they want to compete for the Latino vote in the 2016 presidential electionSchlapp did say that the Republican leaders of both chambers of Congress  incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House John Boehner  understood the need for Republicans to take up immigration But Republican leaders in Congress themselves havent been so clearHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy whos laid out the most detailed agenda so far for a Republican Congress in 2015 and 2016 didnt do anything more than leave open the possibility of some unspecified immigration billWhat Republicans on Congress appear to agree on however is that any executive action by Obama on the issue of immigration is going to poison the well in Speaker Boehners words for Congress to do anything about it On Wednesday incoming Majority Leader McConnell compared executive action on immigration to waving a red flag in front of a bull If congressional Republicans plan to make an exception to their recalcitrance so that they can get a bordersecurity bill passed theyre certainly not mentioning it Bulls arent known for only busting through particular aisles of china shopsSchlapp mentioned executive action on immigration as a possible obstacle to a Republican immigration bill Curbelo didnt But neither of them left Spanish speakers on Tuesday night with any impression that the incoming Republican Congress is committed to immigration reform
