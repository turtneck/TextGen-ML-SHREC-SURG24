The Supreme Court made a number of important decisions this term but none more transformative than legalizing gay marriage The decision however does not settle the issue of gay rights and religious libertyWhy climate scientists are taking factchecking into their own handsA man holds a US and a rainbow flag outside the Supreme Court in Washington after the court legalized gay marriage nationwide on June 26 After the decision religious conservatives are focusing on preserving their right to object Their concerns are for the thousands of faithbased charities colleges and hospitals that want to hire fire serve and set policy according to their religious beliefsTwo blockbuster cases dominated the docket at the United States Supreme Court in its recentlyconcluded term  one stands as a civil rights landmark the other is slipping into quiet obscurityIn its 201415 term the high court decided 74 cases including rulings upholding the presidents power to determine US policy over the contested status of Jerusalem permitting Texas to exclude the confederate flag from specialty license plates and barring prosecutors from treating an undersized grouper as the legal equivalent of a shredded documentBut by far the terms biggest decisions came in the courts historic ruling for samesex marriage and in a 6to3 vote upholding distribution of tax credits in President Obamas health care reform lawWhile the samesex marriage decision will reverberate for years the high courts ruling in the Obamacare case has quickly fallen off the national radar now that the oncedire threat to millions of health insurance policies has subsidedIn contrast Justice Anthony Kennedys decision in the samesex marriage case is a transformative event It marks the most significant civil rights decision by the high court in at least a generation  a kind of gay rights version of Brown v Board of EducationIn his decision Justice Kennedy established that the fundamental right to marry embraces all Americans  regardless of sexual orientationIn the 5to4 ruling the high court said that state bans on samesex marriage violate due process and equal protection rights of the Fourteenth AmendmentThe decision effectively ends a rancorous statebystate debate over marriage and extends a welcoming hand to a segment of American society that has faced open hostility and discriminationAs such the marriage decision represents a huge victory for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT community their friends families and other supportersThis decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free President Obama said in comments shortly after the rulingBut the case that sharply divided the court itself has also left the country sharply divided Religious conservatives feel they are under siege and are looking for ways to fight back or protect themselvesRecognizing this Kennedys decision hints at matters beyond gay marriage and anticipates the next big high court showdown  a bitter national struggle pitting gay rights against religious libertyAnalysts say Kennedy went out of his way in his decision to avoid labeling religious conservatives as bigots or motivated by animosity toward homosexuals That posture is critical they say because it leaves open a way for the court in future cases to balance the competing interests of religious conservatives with the growing rights and clout of gay AmericansKennedy I think wants to keep the courts options open to respect religious and traditional marriage libertarian rights to exclude or to discriminate Yale Law Professor William Eskridge told a recent gathering of the American Constitution SocietyJustice Kennedy is loath to close off those options he saidProfessor Eskridge noted that Kennedy provided the decisive fifth vote in a 2000 high court case that upheld the Boy Scouts right to bar gay men from serving as scoutmasters To the Boy Scouts the decision affirmed their right to associate with likeminded individuals To the rejected scoutmaster the decision endorsed blatant antigay discriminationWashington Appellate Lawyer Gene Schaerr said in a Heritage Foundation briefing that Justice Kennedy went out of his way in numerous places in his opinion to try to suggest respect for the religious viewpoint on this issueThose of us who care about religious liberty can be grateful that Justice Kennedys opinion dodged some big bullets Mr Schaerr said But the opinion unintentionally I think launched a number of grenades that are still in the airHe noted that some religious organizations may soon face loss of their tax exempt status unless they jettison their opposition to samesex marriage and religious colleges may discover their accreditation is in jeopardy if they are found to discriminate against samesex married couples in violation of constitutional rightsIn contrast to the historic samesex marriage landmark with its ongoing repercussions the high court challenge to President Obamas health care reform law is fast on its way to being forgottenHad a majority of justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act barred the distribution of tax credits thorough federal health care exchanges set up in 34 states that decision would have gutted the ACA and left millions of Americans unable to afford any health insuranceBut thats not what happenedInstead the court essentially gave the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt over what the majority justices said were a few examples of inartful draftingWriting for the majority in the 6to3 decision Chief Justice John Roberts said it would make no sense for Congress to create a law meant to advance universal health care by allowing tax subsidies only in health care exchanges established by a state  rather than also in exchanges set up by the federal governmentCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets not to destroy them Chief Justice Roberts wroteIt marked the second time the chief justice had joined the high courts liberal wing to save the ACA from its potential demise at the nations highest court In June 2012 Roberts joined with the courts liberal wing to uphold the controversial measure after concluding that the laws mandated insurance requirement amounted to a tax rather than a penaltyThe chief justices twin rescue operations prompted Justice Antonin Scalia to quip in a dissenting opinion that rather than calling the law Obamacare it should be renamed SCOTUScare SCOTUS is an acronym for Supreme Court of the United StatesBeyond the two blockbusters the courts term produced several other notable decisionsIn an 8to1 decision the court put employers on notice that they must recognize the need to accommodate religious practices of their workers or job applicants even when a job applicant fails to request an accommodationIn that case the court ruled for a Muslim teen who was rejected for a job at an Abercrombie Kids store because she wore a headscarfIn its 10th year under Chief Justice Roberts the court remains essentially a conservative body But you wouldnt know it from this years highest profile cases Of the top 10 decisions of the term analysts classify eight as liberal victories Only two of the top 10 decisions are said to embrace a conservative approachThis pendulumlike movement at the court between liberal and conservative rulings is due in large part to Justice Kennedys position at or near the center of the ninemember courtHe is thus frequently positioned to cast the fifth and deciding vote in controversial casesThe chief justice has also occasionally swung over to join the liberal wing in high profile cases as both he and Kennedy did in the Obamacare decisionDespite that exception Kennedys power to singlehandedly decide major cases was on full display this termHe provided the deciding vote in a ruling that an independent commission formed in Arizona by ballot initiative did not violate the Constitutions elections clauseThe decision is a major victory for election reform advocates It upholds similar commissions in six other states and gives a green light to others looking for ways to reduce the involvement of partisan politics in drawing election districtsKennedy also swung over to join his liberal colleagues in a redistricting case in Alabama In that case the court agreed to keep alive a challenge to a voting map drawn by the Republicancontrolled state legislature Minority groups charged the map illegally undercut black voting clout in the stateKennedy also played a key role in holding off an effort by the courts conservatives to bar the use of socalled disparate impact discrimination claims under the Fair Housing ActThe case marked the third time in recent years that the courts conservatives had sought to take up a case to strike down the disparate impact approach under the FHAThe disparate impact theory of discrimination permits lawsuits when a statistical analysis shows that minorities suffer disproportionate harm from a particular policy  even when that policy is racially neutralInstead of joining the conservatives Kennedy sided with the liberal wing and wrote the majority opinion upholding disparate impact lawsuits under the FHA but also seeking to impose limits on such suits when they might lead to racial quotasApart from the string of liberal wins the high court produced two conservative victories among the terms top cases Both were made possible by the swing vote of KennedyIn one the court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must take the cost of compliance into account when considering whether to regulate toxic air pollutants emitted from coal and oilfired power plantsIn the second conservative victory the court upheld Oklahomas use of the drug midazolam as part of its threedrug lethal injection protocol despite the involvement of that same drug in three botched executions last yearAgain with Kennedys support the court said three Oklahoma death row inmates had failed to prove that the states use of midazolam presented an intolerable risk that the condemned prisoners would suffer severe pain during the execution processThe case was important because capital punishment abolitionists have been working to dry up the availability of certain drugs used in lethal injections The ruling will make it easier for states like Oklahoma to continue to use midazolam and to continue carry out executionsThe case is also notable because two liberal justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced that they believe the time has come to declare the death penalty unconstitutionalThat announcement is expected to trigger a new round of litigation in death penalty cases with an eye toward bringing a dispute to the high court that might facilitate a decision striking down capital punishment throughout the US As in most other high profile cases the outcome in that one would likely once again come down to the vote of Justice Kennedy
