Manchester New Hampshire CNN It was the revenge of the governors as Republicans met for their final debate before the Granite States primary on TuesdayNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie knocked the rising Florida Sen Marco Rubio down several pegs while former Florida Gov Jeb Bush went toetotoe with billionaire businessman Donald Trump and equaled or got the better of his nemesis Ohio Gov John Kasich meanwhile stayed with his positive game and seized opportunities to tout his own recordHere are five takeaways from Saturday nights debate on ABC as the primary clock counts downAfter a strongerthanexpected thirdplace finish in Iowa  and taking a clear lead over other establishment candidates  Rubio knew hed be wearing a big target Saturday nightBut whether he was overrehearsed or underprepared Rubio was offkey as he responded to the attacksThe opponent responsible for most of them ChristieFrom the debates outset he pestered Rubio You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable he saidBut he then opened up a brutal line of attack in suggesting that the Florida senator only knew how to turn a phrase rather than accomplish somethingMarco the thing is this Christie said When youre president of the United States when youre a governor of a state the memorized 30second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one personIn answering Christie Rubio consistently turned to the same talking point casting President Barack Obama as calculating rather than incompetent and intent on changing America for the worseThe fourth time he invoked Obama though the audience turned on him booing the answer And then moderator David Muir drove in the knife saying The governor wasnt talking about the PresidentRubio rebounded a bit near the debates end when he hammered Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for supporting abortion rights  and won applause from the audience for itOf Democrats Rubio said They are the extremists on the issue of abortion and I cant wait to expose them in a general electionChristie Kasich and Bush know that since theyre all competing for the same pool of more moderate voters there probably arent enough tickets out of New Hampshires primary for all threeBut the trio were still happy to unite in attacking the senators in the race and in Bushs case TrumpThe only mild governorongovernor criticism came from Christie who noted that Kasich had increased the number of Ohios government employees But that followed praise of Kasichs job performance with Christie saying hed done a great job in OhioAnd Bush in arguing that money and authority should shift from the federal government to the states said I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads in their statesAll three turned in strong performances Saturday night  and their timing couldnt have been better given Rubios onstage struggles and New Hampshires reputation for voters who make their decisions at the last minuteKasich played up his time as the Houses lead budgetwriter during the surpluses of the 1990s and his record in turning a deficit into a surplus in OhioBush effectively traded blows with Trump lighting into him on eminent domain with a brutal response to the real estate moguls accusations that Bush wanted to sound tough How tough is it to take property from an elderly womanAnd Christie who risked coming across as a bully in order to knock Rubio down early in the debate was moving when he talked about drug addiction linking his position on helping addicts to his stance opposing abortion saying he wants to support kids after theyre born as well as beforeIm prolife when they get out and its a lot more complicated he saidStill there are two big questions Is it too little too late And on a Saturday night how many New Hampshire voters were watching3 Trump vs Cruz The fight that didnt happenTheyve bashed each other on the campaign trail in recent days but Texas Sen Ted Cruz and Trump  the two topfinishing candidates in Iowas caucuses  seemed to want nothing to do with each other on the debate stageIt was one fight that was conspicuously absent Saturday night and it contributed to Rubios awful night The Florida senator might have been hoping that those two would bash each other  but it didnt happen and he clearly was Enemy No 1Cruz had a revealing answer when asked who he expects will win the Super Bowl With an eye toward February 20 Carolina he said alluding to the South Carolina primaryWhy it matters New Hampshires more moderate electorate means its not a state where Cruz is likely to shine He could though win in South Carolina  and his campaigns strategy largely relies on racking up delegates in Southern states with March primariesTrumps answers were revealing in their own way demonstrating that his support isnt about an ideological opposition to big government as much as a desire for strength and a sense that the government is incompetentAt one point he defended eminent domain a practice hes used as a real estate developer Later Trump backed the role of governmentsponsored health care saying Youre not gonna let people die sitting in the middle of the street in any city in this countryTrump was restrained for most of the night  with the exception of a bit of audiencetaunting when during an exchange with Bush he dismissed those booing as his donors and with a single shot at Cruz during his closing statement more on that laterCruz made false claims about CNNs caucusnight reporting  and the network immediately called him on itAs caucusgoers were still voting in Iowa Cruzs staffers had wrongly cited CNN in playing up the idea that former neurosurgeon Ben Carson was dropping out of the raceMy political team saw CNNs report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers It was being covered on live television Cruz said Saturday He said CNN reported that Carson was suspending his campaign from 630 pm to 915 and didnt correct that story until 915 that nightWhat Senator Cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false CNN responded in a statement put out while the debate was in progress CNN never corrected its reporting because CNN never had anything to correct The Cruz campaigns actions the night of the Iowa caucuses had nothing to do with CNNs reporting The fact that Senator Cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishingCNN had reported that Carson would continue campaigning after taking a break at home in Florida His next stop reporter Chris Moody said would be Washington DC for the National Prayer BreakfastCarson passed on the opening to go after Cruz directly Saturday night Im not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen CruzBut he did say he was very disappointed that members of Cruzs team thought so little of me that they would believe he was dropping out after all the effort his campaign put into the race He pointed to his dedicated volunteers and noted that one even died  a reference to an auto accident in which one of his supporters was killedTrump whod avoided Cruz all night did take one shot at him at the debates end After Cruz cited his victory in Iowa during his closing statement Trump said Thats because you got Ben Carsons votes by the wayThought the 2016 debate season couldnt get any weirder Think againAt the start of ABCs broadcast Saturday night Carson  the second man due to appear on stage  seemed not to hear his name So he lingered behind the curtain as other candidates confused walked past himSoon Trump  who apparently had the same problem  joined Carson in waitingAnd Kasich wasnt introduced at all until the moderators were told theyd missed the Ohio governorModerator Martha Raddatz defused the situation by pointing to a loud and rowdy audience that made it difficult to hearBut on television it was baffling The names of the candidates came through loud and clearCarson  late to the stage  quickly disappeared on it And while he got supportive chuckles from the audience for his cracks about not getting enough air time  I thought maybe you thought already I had dropped out he said  thats not the way to climb above his fourthplace finish in Iowa
