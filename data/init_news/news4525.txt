Washington CNN He cut billions in taxes intervened in controversial abortion cases railed against affirmative action and gun control and dreamed of a state capital in which government buildings would forever be drained of unneeded workersYet the biggest barrier between former Florida Gov Jeb Bush and the White House may be a perception that  despite his record  hes not conservative enough for todays RepublicansMany things hes said have rubbed conservatives raw said Morton Blackwell a Republican National Committee member from Virginia who said a lot of base voters were particularly suspicious of Bushs departures from party orthodoxy on education and immigrationBushs presidential hopes are complicated by multiple factors As the son and brother of former presidents hes undeniably part of an establishment that is loathed in many corners of the GOP base The party has also shifted rightward in the years since he left office under the influence of the tea party and activists have embraced populist conservatives like Sarah Palin and Ted CruzBut Bush 61 is also facing an uphill battle because his time running Florida seems fuzzy to many people  particularly GOP primary voters Thats in part because he has yet to highlight the most conservative aspects of his 1999 to 2007 governorship And the issues that hes most vocal about  the Common Core education standards and immigration reform  are the positions that most infuriate conservativesGlenn McCall a South Carolina RNC member says activists in his state arent interested in Bushs recordWhether he talks about it or not Bushs legacy in Florida will come under sharper scrutiny as he makes moves to launch a presidential campaign Thats especially true if Mitt Romney mounts a third White House bid and campaigns to Bushs rightBush will mark a rite of passage for Republican presidential candidates next Wednesday by addressing the Detroit Economic Club Ahead of that speech hes beginning to make the kind of arguments for small government that closely echo his rhetoric from his days in FloridaOur government gets in the way each and every day he said in a speech in San Francisco last week It is time to challenge every aspect of how government works how it taxes how it regulates how it spendsThose who know Bush believe his record in Florida could be a tool to blunt attacks from conservatives and lay to rest  once and for all  the idea that he isnt one of themHe was in no way a moderate said Florida political strategist Mike Hanna who advised Bush during his gubernatorial runs After Governor Bush gets out there and starts to introduce himself to the voters of Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina and other states I think they will realize  he is a cardcarrying unabashed capitalist conservativeJohn Dowless who headed the Christian Coalition in the Sunshine State while Bush was governor said there is no question that Jeb Bush was and is a conservative There never was a question in FloridaBut talking about that conservatism hasnt always come easy to BushDuring his first gubernatorial campaign in 1994 his attempts to demonstrate his politics were brash and sometimes clumsyNot only did he advocate for abolishing the Department of Education for voter approval of all new taxes and privatization in every area where privatization is possible he also suggested welfare reforms that would have cut recipients access to benefits after two yearsHis 1994 pronouncements on gay rights haunt his image to this dayDuring that failed first campaign he argued in the Miami Herald that there was no need for special categories to protect members of the gay and lesbian community Should sodomy be elevated to the same constitutional status as race and religion he asked in one controversial line My answer is noBushs narrow loss that year to popular Democratic Gov Lawton Chiles prompted deep selfreflection before his next try in 1998 He later admitted he had run with unvarnished conservative views and needed to become a better storyteller By the time he left office after two terms he was more comfortable laying out his conservative vision  and he had approval ratings of over 60Bushs politics also evolved after his conversion to Catholicism his wifes religion in the mid1990s which strengthened his resolve on issues like abortionIn 2009 after leaving office he explained that he admired the fact that the Catholic Church believes in and acts on absolute truth as its foundational principles and doesnt move with modern times as my former religion didHe also spoke disapprovingly of politicians who put their religion in a safety deposit box while in office In San Francisco he said his faith gave him serenity and was hugely important during tough times as governorPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Bushs record in Florida is his use of muscular executive power on social issues that are important to conservativesBacked by a pliant Republican legislature he vigorously sought restrictions on abortion while governor  from a ban on lateterm procedures to a constitutional amendment that would circumvent the courts which had struck down a law requiring girls notify their parents before getting an abortionBushs abortion activism shocked some state officials who believed he was reaching beyond the powers of his officeIn 2003 Bush unsuccessfully tried to get the courts to appoint a guardian for the fetus of a 22yearold disabled woman with cerebral palsy and autism who became pregnant after being raped by an operator of a statesupervised group homeIn 2005 he intervened in the case of 13yearold girl known as LG who was a ward of the state and was 13 weeks pregnant when she tried to get an abortion Bush fought hard to prevent the procedure but was overruled by a judgeShortly after those episodes Bush told Republicans at the 2005 Georgia GOP convention that there is such a thing as right and wrongRepublicans cannot continue to win unless we talk with compassion and passion about absolute truth he saidThat principle clearly guided Bushs extraordinary intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo a mentally impaired woman deemed in a chronic vegetative state Schiavos parents Bob and Mary Schindler  with aid from thenGovernor Bush  repeatedly tried to prevent Schiavos husband from removing her feeding tube to end her lifeAfter five years of litigation in 2003 Bush tried to get a different courtappointed guardian for Schiavo and filed a friend of the court brief to block removal of the feeding tube He lost that round but then persuaded the legislature to pass a law giving him the power to prevent a feeding tube or hydration device from being removed from a patient who had not laid out their endoflife directivesIn the midst of the debate Bush proclaimed that he was probably the most prolife governor in modern times according to Associated Press reportsAfter the feeding tube was reinserted Michael Schiavos attorney railed against the gross and illegal intrusion into the private liberty of citizens and the Florida Supreme Court ruled that hastily drafted state law was unconstitutional The Florida governor kept pushing the case through all possible avenues including action by Congress and thenPresident George W Bush Ultimately he lostIn polls many Florida voters said they felt Bush had gone too far but his actions were based on personal and religious tenets from which he could not retreat said Mac Stipanovich a Republican political strategist who advised Bush during the 1994 campaignThose battles suggest that he is unlikely to back away from his positions on controversial issues like immigration and Common Core even during a heated presidential campaignBush will change his mind about stuff but it is grudgingly factbased and he really thinks about it Stipanovich said He seldom looks for the path of least resistanceWhile Bushs Catholicism looms large in his social policy his economic approach is molded by his lifetime immersion in toplevel Republican politicsJeb Bush closely observed President Ronald Reagan a conservative icon who he later termed spectacular when his father was vice president In office in Florida Bush took as his model Reagans mantra that government was not the solution to Americas problems but the problem itselfDuring his second inaugural address in 2003 he gazed out at government offices and said there would be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we make these buildings around us empty of workers silent monuments to a time when government played a larger role than it deserved or could adequately fillOver the course of eight years Bush signed into law 19 billion in tax cuts He sought to privatize key government providers including foster care state parks and even legal aid to death row prisoners His businessfriendly states bonds were topratedHe reshaped Florida by wiping out 13000 government jobs and vetoing 2 billion in new spending an economic approach influenced by the conservative gospels of Milton Friedman He enforced conservative solutions on taxes gun control dismantling affirmative action in universities taking on teachers unions over testing and performanceBut despite all this Bush faces an important question as he embarks on a presidential run Will he get a hearing among grassroots activists who view his support for immigration reform as akin to amnesty for illegal immigrants and his backing of Common Core as an unacceptable embrace of state powerIs there enough space in our media environment in the Republican primaries for people to listen to his entire record asked Matthew Corrigan author of a new book on Bushs tenure in Florida Conservative Hurricane Or will his opponents be able to yell amnesty and federal government control of education and not pay attention to anything elseBlackwell said he believed that it would simply not be possible for Bush to convince the base he truly has the conscience of a conservativeWeve been down this road repeatedly before with members of his family who ran like they were going to be movement conservatives he said But his father broke the no new taxes pledge and his brother expanded federal programs in various directions which conservatives didnt likeTea party supporters who could be important in some early voting states like Iowa and South Carolina are also worried that the former Florida governor not only does not reflect their views  but is not listening to them They warn a ticket topped by Bush could face lukewarm Republican turnout in a general electionLaurie Newsom president of the Gainesville Florida Tea Party noted that many in the grass roots were disappointed by the performance of Republicans who had professed their conservative fiscal bona fides  like President George W Bush  and had unhappily accepted previous GOP nominees John McCain and Mitt RomneyWe have held our noses and voted in 08 and 12 Newsom said Jeb Bush  he hasnt got a prayer Poor Jeb has clouds hanging over his head right nowBut Bush is warning that the Republican Party simply will not win in 2016 if it does not offer a positive vision for the future despite boiling conservative resentment at WashingtonWe are not going to win votes as Republicans unless you lay out a hopeful optimistic message he said in San Francisco A positive agenda wins out against anger and reaction every day of the week
