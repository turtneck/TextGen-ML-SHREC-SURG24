Email Im trying to make this campus more aware said Jessica Adams coordinator of LGBT services at the Cross Cultural and Gender Center at Fresno State University in California Im asking most people to unlearn this concept of gender that they have been taught for years And its not an easy task No doubt Most people are stuck believing boys are boys and girls are girls Adams argues that those who hold to such beliefs are the ones with the problem She recently helped Mr Love  a female who is transitioning to a male  become one of the first of these transgender students at Fresno State to change her name on her student ID card This is considered a huge victory by Adams because she claimed You feel fraudulent as a person yet no one is allowing you to be who you are If you can imagine being called the wrong name for the rest of your life or even for a day If you kept telling them and they refused to acknowledge that thats painful Mr Love is transitioning by taking natural supplements rather than testosterone injections But this is not her first transition In the past she was at one time bisexual and has suffered from anxiety and depression In fact Mr Love shown reacted to the tragic news that 49 people were murdered by an Islamic terrorist in Orlando by considering suicide It was all just too much Mr Love recalled I wanted to die One survey has found that more than 40 percent of transgender people have attempted suicide In a study conducted by The New Atlantis  sex reassigned individuals were about 5 times more likely to attempt suicide and about 19 times more likely to die by suicide Whatever the exact figures it is obvious that these are deeply mentally disturbed individuals After writing a suicide note to some friends Mr Love was forced into an ambulance and transported to a mental health center in Fresno But what really upset her was when she looked down and saw the name on the plastic medical bracelet They had use Mr Loves birth name instead of Mr Love It was an Aztec female name meaning goddess of music and dance Mr Love explained You have to realize every time you say it its going to be like knives to the heart To those in the transgender community birth names that identify the person as male when he wants to be known as a female or identify the person as female as in the case of Mr Love when a transgender individual wishes to be known as a male are referred to as dead names Sometimes Mr Love uses the name of Alex because it is more gender neutral When Mr Love was a highschool student at Clovis United the school board refused to adopt a genderneutral dress code Boys and girls who supported the transgender students swapped clothes as a protest against school policy Although no federal statute exists that requires local school districts to allow transgender males into girls locker rooms and viceversa the Obama administration has told schools across the country they will either do so or face the loss of federal funds The Charlotte Observer recently editorialized in favor of allowing transgenders to use the bathroom they identify with and not their biologically appropriate one The paper dismissed concerns that sexual predators could use trangenderoriented bathroom laws Besides the paper lectured The thought of male genitalia in girlss locker rooms  and vice versa  might be distressing to some But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort So according to the Charlotte Observer  anyone who opposes a naked boy strolling into a shower full of naked girls is no better than a segregationist After all it was discomforting to a white bigot to be around black people and opposition to transgenders using the bathroom of the opposite sex well that is a bigoted stance too Of course a similar opposing argument would have just as much or more logical validity Maybe transgenders should get used to the discomfort of being naked around their own biological sex and that to do otherwise and force their nakedness on the unwilling opposite sex is akin to sexual assault Although Mr Love wants to be recognized as a man she wants to keep her mezzosoprano voice considered one of the highest female singing voices Ive come to terms with my voice My voice is everything its all I have Mr Love said Mr Love insists that she is a man trapped in a biological womans body and that she cannot help it I didnt ask for this life I didnt choose it I really didnt But a recent study in The New Atlantis journal concluded that trangenderism is not supported by the science The report was coauthored by Dr Paul McHugh who is the former Chief of Pyschiatry at Johns Hopkins University Examining research from the biological psychological and social sciences this report shows that some of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence The hypothesis that gender identiy is an innate fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex  that a person might be a man trapped in a womans body or a woman trapped in a mans body  is not supported by scientific evidence insisted the researchers But it is not just that the acceptance of transgenderism one will note that the mainstream media dutifully calls a transgender person by the pronoun that person prefers is unscientific The report argues that such enabling is harmful An area of particular concern involves medical interventions for gendernonconforming youth They are increasingly receiving therapies that affirm their felt genders and even hormone treatments or surgical modifications at young ages In a statement released in March by the American College of Pediatricians a similar conclusion was reached The report was entitled Gender Ideology Harms Children and in it they assert that taking gender dysphoria as anything other than a psychological problem is harmful One woman Cari Stella took to YouTube to describe how this ideologically driven movement harmed her I am a real live 22yearold woman with a scarred chest and a broken voice and five oclock shadow because I couldnt face the idea of growing up to be a woman Thats my reality When I was transitioning I felt a strong desire  what I could have called a need at the time  to transition But the transition only worsened her mental health Testosterone made me even more disassociated than I already was Stellas situation is an example of an observation made in The New Atlantis study The potential that patients undergoing medical and surgical sex reassignment may want to return to a gender identity consistent with their biological sex suggests that reassignment carries considerable psychological and physical risk The report concluded that the promotion of transgenderism is influenced more by politics and the culture than by science On the Carol Burnett Show  Vikki Lawrence once performed a skit where she portrayed a mother with an infant child When someone asked the common question Is the baby a boy or a girl Lawrence effected offense answering This is 1970 The baby can make that decision at age 21 Of course the audience predictably guffawed at the absurdity of it all But that was 1970 Now in 2016 such a skit on television would probably lead to boycotts and condemnations from our modern progressive society
