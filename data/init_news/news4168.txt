CNN One day after reporter Alison Parker 24 and her cameraman Adam Ward 27 were gunned down on live television near Roanoke Virginia Parkers boyfriend said merely remembering their lives is not enoughThere needs to be some action that is taken out of an event like this  out of an event like Sandy Hook like Charleston like Aurora Colorado where these things just dont occur anymore Chris Hurst told CNN on Thursday citing a litany of American gun violenceWe need to have a substantive conversation on what is going on in America that is allowing evil to continue to crop up over love Is it because we are in the media And the attacker knew this was going to get a lot of play and here we are again another mushroom cloud of coverage over gun violenceOn Wednesday Vester Lee Flanagan II produced a realtime murder show that he choreographed in detailIn a ranting note sent to ABC News before his death Flanagan blamed his misery on black men and white women and said he was somewhat racist against whites blacks and LatinosFlanagan shot dead Parker and Ward while she was live on air on WDBJ via Wards camera a video of the incident showedHurst works at the station as an anchor and had been dating Parker for nine months They were already talking about marriage He was saving for an engagement ring he saidI think the media can have an even stronger effect to be positive if we can use this as a conversation in figuring out why we are allowing hate to creep into peoples hearts instead of fostering love he said at memorial for the victimsWe need to ask why this is happening and we need to keep the conversation going We dont want to keep it going because its tiresome and then we just wait for another one to happen and we say This is a huge issue and then forget about it until another one happens If we dont forget I think the incidents will lessen I believe thatParkers father Andy Parker told CNNs Anderson Cooper on Thursday night that he will honor his daughters memory by lobbying for laws that will make it harder for the mentally ill to purchase firearms It was not clear whether Flanagan had been diagnosed with a mental illnessAfter Sandy Hook and the theater shootings everybody thought gosh this is terrible he said We have got to do something to keep people that are mentally disturbed we got to keep them away from guns and having the ability to get gunsIts up to the media he said to prevent the story from fadingThats what the National Rifle Association is thinking right now Parker said The NRA is saying it will go away And you know they are the most powerful lobby in the country And someone has got  to take them on By God I am going to do itParker was reluctant at first to speak to reporters about his daughters killing but her career as a journalist changed his mindThe first 24 hours after her death were filled with numbness uncontrollable grief and anger he saidShe was kind and she was sweet and she touched everybody he saidHe didnt go nicely back then and Ward recorded his emotional outburst on camera Court documents from a discrimination suit that he filed show that Flanagan scoffed at Ward and flipped off the camera Before police walked him out of the building Flanagan handed his manager a small wooden cross and said Youll need thisFlanagan had not worked with Parker the reporter he shot dead but there were signs he resented her having been hiredWDBJs general manager said Flanagan had runins with many coworkers and was a poor performerFlanagans performance and behavior problems led to his bosses referring him to the companys employee assistance program Marks saidThe managers did not request he reach out to the program because of his mental state  they didnt know about that  but because of his difficulty working with others Marks saidThe final warning for the reporter came in December 2012 and he was fired in February 2013Flanagan caused a stir and police were called to escort him out Marks said Flanagan gave the news director at the time a cross and said youll need this Marks saidAll of the claims that Flanagan made against the company and were investigated Marks said Those investigations concluded that no reasonable person would have taken the alleged instances as discrimination or harassment he saidVester Flanagan owned several websites associated with gay porn records showFlanagan registered at least seven domain names in 2007 and 2008 and solicited attractive  muscular men to model for live web camsRecords obtained by CNN show Flanagans name and Vallejo California address were included in the domain registrationsThe shooter planned meticulously to act out a lot of resentment violently and get back into the limelight before turning his gun on himselfFlanagan aka Williams recorded video of his killing which he spread on social media as he fled authorities He appeared to have prepped his Twitter account days before the killing with a review of images from stations of his lifeDuring his flight posts to Twitter appeared in the name of Bryce Williams showing video recorded from the perspective of his gun barrel as his shots struck his victims Many social media users were horrified by the scenes playing out before them on autoplayBoth Facebook and Twitter quickly shut down the accountsFlanagan had rented a car weeks before and used it in his getaway instead of his

Wednesday afternoonFlanagan was known for a series of anger and behavioral problems in his workplacesAs news broke about whom police sought in the killing Don Shafer heard a familiar name on the radio Vester Flanagan He worked for me he said to himselfThe hair on the back of my neck went up said Shafer who is now news director at XETV in San DiegoWhen he hired Flanagan Shafer was news director at WTWC in Tallahassee Florida The reporter who went by Bryce Williams made a nice impression on Shafer at first but in 2000 he fired him over runins with colleaguesThere were some issues with him and his personality that kind of spiraled down and thats why we had to get rid of him Shafer saidFlanagan sued alleging racial discrimination but the suit was dismissedLater he joined WDBJ but was later fired over performance issues He sued again once more alleging discriminationCourt documents from that suit revealed the station had taken disciplinary action against Flanagan for months met with him many times about angry behavior and told him to seek counselingDan Dennison former news director at WDBJ said it was the toughest termination decision hed ever handled He had to call police to escort the reporter outWilliamsFlanagan had a level of a long series of complaints against coworkers nearly from the beginning of employment at the TV station Dennison said He said they were never substantiatedThe firings and lawsuits were part of a mishmash of resentments that Flanagan faxed to ABC News while police searched for himIn a ranting note in his farewell fax Flanagan tried to justify his killingsOK so the big question is Why  he wrote Well after I compiled well over 100 pages chronicling the hurt in my life I asked myself Why NOT And he talked about having a disturbed mind Ive been a human powder keg for a while  just waiting to go BOOM at any moment he wroteHe spent some time making allegations of racism including against reporter Parker whom he said made racist comments but got hired anyhow There was no elaboration and WDBJ General Manager Marks said the claim was unfoundedWere outraged that any of the comments in that manifesto are taken the least bit seriously he said adding that he doesnt believe that Flanagan and Parker crossed paths at WDBJBut Flanagan also blamed much of his misery on black men and white women and said he was somewhat racist against whites blacks and LatinosFlanagan said he put a deposit down for a gun two days after the Charleston South Carolina church shooting in June and ranted against the accused shooterAs for Dylann Roof You deleted You want a race war deleted BRING IT THEN YOU WHITE deleted the fax saidPolice recovered two guns from Flanagan Glock 9 mm pistols he purchased legally
