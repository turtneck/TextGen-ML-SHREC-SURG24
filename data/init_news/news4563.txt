Immigration reform used to be an issue that split both parties Probusiness Republicans faced off against cultural conservatives while within the Democratic Party Latino advocates faced off against laborBut over the past 10 years immigration has become a partisan issueThis change isnt just a shift in where politicians take certain policy questions Its also a change in whether Americans think that immigrants in general are a good thing for AmericaTo a certain extent polarization on immigration in Washington and polarization among voters reinforce each otherIn 2005 when comprehensive immigration reform was a key priority of President George W Bush Republicans and Democrats were about equally likely to think that immigrants strengthened America Once Bushs successor Barack Obama started stressing the need for comprehensive immigration reform though Republicans were much less likely to look favorably on immigrants  according to Pews findings Republican attitudes changed precipitously between late 2009 and summer 2010But this isnt the whole story because the debate in Washington over comprehensive immigration reform has always had a tenuous relationship to how Americans actually feel about immigrantsHistorically even the antiamnesty politicians who opposed comprehensive immigration reform stressed that immigrants were welcome in America as long as they came and stayed legally For most Americans though the difference that matters isnt between legal and unauthorized immigrants  its between immigrants they find likely to assimilate into American culture and those who they believe cannotAmericans are much more ambivalent about immigrants in general than you might expect from listening to politicians talk about immigration  or than you might guess by looking at polling for various immigration reform proposalsFor many white Americans over the past couple of decades that ambivalence has hardened into a constellation of stereotypes associating immigrant with illegal immigrant illegal immigrant with Latino immigrant and Latino immigrant with criminalThis is the genius of Donald Trumps presidential campaign His rhetoric homes in directly on the things that actually worry many Americans about immigrants rather than using economic or legal arguments as a way to gesture toward cultural fearsBut as the chart shows Trump wasnt just exploiting a sentiment among American voters  hes exploiting a sentiment among specifically Republican votersThe changes shown in the Pew chart dont just reflect Democrats or Republicans changing their minds about whether immigrants are good for America In fact most of the people changing their minds are embracing immigrants overall the most recent Pew poll found 59 percent of Americans agree that immigration strengthens the country which is the highest level of support in 20 yearsThey reflect changes in who identifies as a Republican or a DemocratOver the past 20 years the Democratic Party has gotten markedly more ethnically diverseas white voters have increasingly identified with RepublicansNot all of the white voters who have switched parties are motivated by antiLatino sentiment But the voters who are motivated by antiLatino sentiment are particularly likely to have switched partiesBefore 2000 there was a correlation between negative feelings toward Latinos and identifying as strongly Republican But that was just a side effect how people felt toward black Americans was a much better predictor of how strongly they identified with the GOPIn the 21st century the two have diverged All else being equal  even sentiment toward African Americans  a white American in 2008 who felt negatively toward Latinos was likely to be more strongly Republican onethird of a point on a sevenpoint scale from strong Republican to strong Democrat than someone who felt positively toward themTheres no indication that the trend has abated since 2008 Indeed the Pew polling shows that sentiment toward immigrants among Republicans hit new lows in May 2015 with only 27 percent of Republicans saying immigrants strengthened America That was just before Donald Trump launched his presidential campaignWhile Donald Trump didnt make Republicans wary of immigrants effect on America though he does appear to have made the remaining skeptics in the Democratic Party embrace themIn May 2015 on the eve of Trumps campaign launch 62 percent of Democrats said that immigrants strengthened America In March 2016 78 percent said they did  a 16percentagepoint jumpThats the biggest reason proimmigrant sentiment is at a 20year high The Democrats who hadnt already embraced immigrants are doing so nowIf that holds it will complete the last phase of the partisanization of immigration Republican voters are already fairly united in their distrust of immigrants and many Republican politicians are following their lead Democratic politicians meanwhile are fairly united in their support of immigrants And now Democratic voters appear to be embracing their identity as the proimmigrant party
