Part of the fun in watching two politicians debate is seeing their foreheads sweat their spit fly and their fists pound the podium Emotion is a hallmark of politics at a certain point logic and reason are tossed out the window and passion takes over whether the setting is a televised debate or a dinnertimeargumentA new study published in the journal PLOS One lends some support to the idea that the more emotional people get when politics comes up the less likely they are to think things through clearly A team led by Michael Bang Petersen a professor of political science at Aarhus University in Denmark asked58 subjects ages 19 to 32 to report their political ties Then the researchers attached electrodes to the index and middle fingers of the participants nondominant hands these measured their physiological responses by recording small amounts of sweat present on thefingertipsThe subjects were then shown 16 policy proposals each with the logo from one of two rival Danish political parties affixed to it  We should lower the tax on income for example or The police should be far more visible Subjects were asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with the proposal The catch was that the party names were assigned randomly to the proposals  sometimes a proposal was paired with a party that didnt actually support it In other words this was a test for kneejerk support for anything with a given partys brand affixed toitPerhaps unsurprisingly it was the emotionally engaged participants who were the most kneejerk All things being equal those participants who experienced a strong physiological response when their partys logo appeared tended to report that they agreed with that partys proposals no matter their content  that is they blindly nodded along at least in this experiment to anything proposed even fictitiously by theirpartyWe build up emotional attachments to objects if we experience them in emotional activating contexts explained Petersen and this can apply as much to politics as to any other area So if positive feelings are elicited when I watch Barack Obama when I go to a Democratic convention and when Im around other Democrats then my emotional systems will automatically begin to associate things that are linked to the Democratic party with positiveaffectOnce those emotional ties are in place theyre almost impossible to change You can try to put yourself in a situation where your opinions are tested said Petersen which is a good way to increase the cognitive effort involved in decisionmaking If you have to justify your choice you usually rely on reason over emotion to make it But that can easily backfire You might simply put more effort into justifying the alreadyheld opinion rather than changing the underlying one PetersonsaidIn short once youre a biased partisan its difficult to see the other side As Petersen puts it its like choosing football teams You dont make a rational assessment about which team is better or which team deserves to win You support your team no matterwhat
