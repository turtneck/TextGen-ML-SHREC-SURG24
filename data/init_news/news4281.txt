Gun rights supporters in Texas counted down the hours minutes and seconds to New Years Day because when the clock strikes midnight licensed firearms owners in the Lone Star State can openly carry their handguns in publicThe nonprofit group Open Carry Texas which supports the law posted a countdown on its websiteTexas already allows openly carrying rifles and shotguns but has banned having handguns visible since just after the Civil War On New Years Day itll be the 45th and largest state to sanction some form of open carry with California Florida Illinois New York and South Carolina still banning itActivists with Open Carry Texas say they support the law but that it should go farther Our ultimate goal will always be constitutional carry  if you can legally own and purchase a gun you should be able to legally carry that gun without begging for government permission in the form of a license and 2nd Amendment tax they say on their websiteTexas had nearly 826000 concealed license holders in 2014 which ranks among the nations highest Openly carrying a gun will require obtaining the same license concealed weapons holders have  be at least 21 have clean criminal and psychology records complete a training course and pass a shooting test Concealed handguns are even allowed inside the Texas Capitol where license holders can bypass metal detectorsUnder the new law businesses can bar guns from their premises if they post approved signs outsideTexas also has the countrys most federal firearms license holders from manufacturers to dealers and the state cites its relaxed gun ownership rules in lobbying gun makers to move here The National Rifle Association has traditionally pumped tens of thousands of dollars into Texas state political races more than it spent many other places though contribution totals look to be waning recentlyThe original open carry bill included a nostop provision barring police from demanding to see the license of someone simply for openly carrying their gun Tea party legislators didnt want 2nd Amendment rights infringed while Democrats worried about racial profiling concerned that blacks and Hispanics might be asked for their licenses more than their white counterpartsIf I get a gun I guess Id better put my hands up state Sen Rodney Ellis a Houston Democrat who is black said when the measure was debated on the Senate floorAustin Police Chief Art Acevedo was an outspoken critic of the nostop provision saying it would effectively bar police from doing their jobs while endangering the public Under pressure from Acevedo and other police chiefs as well as state law enforcement organizations that language was stripped from the final open carry billBut Michael who is readying Acevedos force for the new law said he doesnt expect many officers to ask for licenses The department is even training its dispatchers to educate the public on the law change anticipating a barrage of 911 calls about someone openly carrying a gunThe calltaker will say its now legal to do that said Michael who said his department has been discussing preparations for open carry for months with police departments across Central TexasPolice dont want to not act and then have something devolve into a mass shooting incident but harassing every person with a holster gun isnt going to solve that said Shannon Edmonds director of governmental relations for the Texas District and County Attorneys AssociationThe irony is that you saw many law enforcement agencies lobby strongly against that provision that would have restricted them outright from ever asking if someone had a license absent other evidence of a crime Edmonds said noting thats changed after a number of those same agencies talked with their legal counselsNot demanding to see licenses though could also make it easier for unlicensed Texas residents to take advantage of the dontask environmentWeve changed things here a lot and weve not thought this through said Charley Wilkison executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas the states largest law enforcement officers union People will drive without a license and we can sure count on them to carry a weapon without training or licenseThe Associated Press contributed to this report
