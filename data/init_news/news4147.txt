httpssoundcloudcom44daysputinandxiinwesternpropagandawhydoesxjpgetoffsolightly161029 Better watch out Vlad When Western propaganda throws an ism at you the gloves have come off Think Marxism Leninism Maoism communism socialism extremism and Islamic terrorism for starters After all behind the Great Western Firewall they are all the same thing right A recent cover and main article in the Economist pictured above reminded me of just how hyperbolic and ideological is the Wests propaganda against Russian President Vladimir Putin While maybe good polemical fodder as a cartoon on the editorial page the fact that this demonic caricature merits front cover status indicates just how programmed and institutionalized Western mainstream media is Westerners love to insult the AntiWest press for being party organs and government mouthpieces But why travel so far They only need to stay home with their national New York Times  Radio France and BBC  to really appreciate Bernaysian psyops being passed off as serious journalism as in Edward Bernays I dont call it living behind the Great Western Firewall for nothing I have a friend whose email signature is Blame it on Putin For a while he changed it to Blame it on China But that didnt last long and he recently changed it back As we have seen with the most depressing predictability President Putin specifically and Russia in general are the voodoo pin dolls of Western racism and demonization of another people Slavs and other religions Orthodox Christianity as well as widespread Islam and Buddhism in Siberia httpchinarisingpuntopresscom20151001slavsandtheyellowperilareniggersbrutesandbeastsintheeyesofwesternempirethesaker44daysradiosinoland2015101 What is so remarkable is how unhinged and psychopathic the Wests racist propaganda is against Putin  Co compared to the attacks on Chinas President Xi Jinping XJP and the Chinese people It transgresses irrational fear to the point of being sick black humor Yet about the most polemical front cover against XJP was Time magazine in April 2016 seen below But making Chinas leader look like a Mao Zedong Blade Runner replicant is tame and almost quaint compared to the Orwellian Emmanuel Goldstein tsunami being launched nonstop against Putin Pretty tame stuff this compared to the racist feeding frenzy that Western propaganda is ginning up against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Slavic countrymen True Russia has the longest border with the European Union and there is tremendous historical Western precedence to keep Germany from forming any kind of economic or geopolitical alliance with Russia As well the Wests Ukrainian color revolution turned out to be a total genocidal failure with Russia reintegrating Crimea and Donbass biding its time for a hopeful remarriage in the years to come Needless to say the revenge factor and if there is anything that Western tyranny loves more its to avenge its long list of failed chaos and extermination around the world But Russia is officially a capitalist country Its current constitution was largely written by American fifth columnists The Russian Central Bank is widely presumed to be under the thumb of the Wests oil banking families In spite of widespread ignorance around the world on these two counts China can definitely list itself in the opposing column httpchinarisingpuntopresscom20161018socalledcommunistchinaanexclusivearticlefortheallchinareview161017  Given Americas post1917 deranged hysterical fear of and untold billions spent to crush any communist expression around the world you would think that red China and Xi would be Public Enemy Number One But no its Putin and the Russians One factor might be Western perceptions of Russias and Chinas military strength Russians have shown off their powerful wellrun army navy and air force in Syria and the Black Sea The West is probably in a bit of an historic rut when looking at Chinas rapidly modernizing Peoples Liberation Army PLA like back to the Korean War when the just liberated New China had no air force no navy and no nuclear missiles yet still kicked the pants off Uncle Sam using mostly World War I vintage arms But then again nobody in the West will ever admit that they lost the Korean War in the first place httpchinarisingpuntopresscom20160904frommay9thinmoscowtoseptember3rdinbeijingtheantiwestordercomesfullcirclereprint  I can tell you that here in China just like 19501953 XJP and the PLA do not fear American military power not one iota Respect it yes Fear it never President Xi has put the PLA on combat ready war footing and he means it httpwwwglobaltimescncontent966932shtml But there is a new gadfly in Americas imperial ointment one who may push President Xi and the Chinese people up the racist hateometer to Slavic levels and that menace is the Philippines new president Rodrigo Duterte httpchinarisingpuntopresscom20160917puppetjapansavesunclesamsfaceinsouthchinaseaafterphilippinesprincipledstandvsimperialismjeffjbrownonpresstv  This plainspoken no bullshit world leader is Uncle Sams worst nightmare He is calling American empire what it is genocidal dictatorial and rapacious Not once but day after day meeting after meeting press conference after press conference At September 89 2016s ASEAN summit in Laos Duterte showed a colonial era photo and talked about the genocide that the US committed as it brutally conquered the Philippines 18991913 killing an estimated 125 million people about 25 of the nations population Western media censored it like the plague and even semifriendly outlets like the South China Morning Post were aghast that he actually associated the West with genocide Heaven forbid This in spite of the fact the easily 8090 of the historys genocides and exterminations were and are being perpetrated by Eurangloland including of course Israel Behind the Great Western Firewall genocide is exclusively reserved for powerless dark skinned people and unrepentant socialists like Serbias framed and destroyed Slobodan Milosevic Speaking truth to imperial power Duterte gives a blunt lesson on Western genocide during the recent ASEAN summit in Laos How dare you tell it like it is Image by Baiducom Duterte is a semiofficial socialistpopulist His cabinet is inclusive and consultative with former imprisoned and exiled political opposition leaders including communists and Muslims He clearly cant stand Americas grotesque imperial arrogance and tyranny in a country that has been a pliant doormat for US mayhem and exploitation in Asia going back to the turn of the 19 th 20 th century When Dutertes hometown of Davao was hit with a very suspicious false flag smelling public market bombing on September 2 2016 he suggested that the automatictoblame Abu Sayyef Group a Muslim independence outfit on his island of Mindanao is controlled by US Special Forces based there which is of course true But world leaders arent supposed to speak truth to power especially little brown brothers as Filipino Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay has described Americas attitude to his long suffering and abused nation httpwwwphilstarcomheadlines201609171624575dfachiefphilippinesnolittlebrownbrotherus After signing with XJP more than three times as many development deals 15 billion as the US has totally invested to date in the Philippines 47 billion Duterte declared to the world that the US has lost and that his country was realigning with Baba Beijing His official governmenttrade delegation had an unprecedented 300 members and another 150 business people paid their own way to join the Asian lovefest The two sides set up bilateral committees to discuss and negotiate their South China Sea claims which is anathema to Uncle Sam who always insists on being the rabid Rottweiler in the middle Next stop was US prostitute Japan where he further declared that the Philippines would be free of all foreign military meaning US marines and special forces something that has not happened since 1521 when Spain began colonizing and raping the archipelago This is all very powerful history changing geopolitics Almost every other world leader who has talked and acted like this has either been overthrown andor murdered by the West sooner than later Clearly from the perspective of the West Dutertes visionary regional reset is closely tied to President Xi and China It is for this reason that XJP may be getting the SlavicPutin treatment on an accelerated schedule in a desperate attempt to trash Chinas deep historical leadership and trust role in Asia The old story about people being able to see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes is very apropos to Duterte He is shouting out to the world that Western empire is a colossal failure and humiliation for his impoverished exploited citizens and by extension equally so for every other member of humanity outside Eurangloland httpchinarisingpuntopresscom20160716communistchinavscapitalistphilippinesvsimperialfrancechinarisingradiosinoland160716  Once one person pierces the veil it emboldens others to finally have the courage to pile on For Uncle Sam its already happening Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak is visiting XJP and Co in Beijing October 31November 6 2016 an unusually long state visit by a world leader Najib has declared that Malaysia is committed to strengthening friendship with China and pushing ties to new highs httpwwwreuterscomarticleusmalaysiachinaidUSKCN12R0ZU  As more and more countries embrace Chinas history founding One Belt One Road plan in which the whole world is and will benefit into the 22 nd century including Eurangloland expect ever more desperate racist demonization and dehumanization of Xi Jinping and the Chinese people along the lines of Putin and the Russians Maybe the CIAMI6 can dig up that old 19 th century chestnut The Yellow Peril and give it a modern day makeover Stay tuned to the New York Times Radio France and the BBC  as the propaganda psyops campaign takes shape As more and more world leaders are emboldened to speak out against Western tyranny thanks to Filipino President Rodrigo Dutertes courage to make a public stand President Xi Jinping can expect his face to morph into Putins who is demonically pictured above on
