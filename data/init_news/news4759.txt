Marco Rubio Donald Trump US Sen Ted Cruz Ben Carson and Jeb Bush It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016On the trail Cruz promises to repeal Obamacare and his entire stump speech is essentially a takedown of a Washington power structure that is too timid to fight  by any means necessary  for what conservatives back at home actually wantBut on his sixday Iowa tour last week Cruz didnt mention the shutdown once It hasnt come up in the debates Undecided voters dont ask about it in town hallsAnd some supporters of his at events who only paid attention to Cruz when he launched his campaign for president in March couldnt exactly put their finger on why they had heard of him beforeI follow Ted Cruz pretty closely Jeanette Dietzenbach a church musician said as she waited to hear him speak here in a pizza shops basement but not as far back as 2013Clifford Bullerman 71 didnt remember it either when asked by a reporter but went on at length about the 2011 shutdown in Minnesota which he said was avoidableTo be sure there are Republican diehards who recall it with fondness recollecting Cruzs decision to read Green Eggs  Ham from the Senate floor as he lambasted the Affordable Care Act as a millstone on the American economyJoel Hefti 47 first heard of Cruz during the Obamacare debate He strongly opposed it and he was one of the few that actually stood up  and didnt waffle Hefti told CNNAnd other admirers even if they dont recollect the shutdown specifically flock to him because he has shown the spine to stand up to Washington including on ObamacarePeople want a candidate who has a backbone and whos not afraid to make a decision  whether it was the right one or the wrong one hes all in said Brian Logie 35The shutdown endeared Cruz to much of the professional right from the rabblerousing Senate Conservatives Fund whose leaders are organizing on his behalf to the Club for Growth some of whose donors have been his biggest backers And several of the House Republicans who also sought a shutdown have endorsed his presidential campaignBut it is also likely to have political consequences The shutdown  and effort to defund Obamacare  is sure to be rich fodder for any Democratic nominee in NovemberAnd the shutdown has alienated him from contributors with ties to Wall Street or Washington lobbyists who serve as some of the nations most prominent bundlers None of his fellow senators have endorsed him some still reeling from the fracas two years laterHas everyone just moved onCruzs closest allies maintain that he isnt running away from it but that he and his voters have moved onWhy stick it into the dialogue when youve got so much future policy to discuss asked Rep Steve King his top backer in Iowa and a brotherinarms during the 2013 fight which he said was wrongly laid at Cruzs feet Theres no upside to talking about things that will be mischaracterizedThe Obamacare fights of which Cruz writes in his most recent book that no battle has consumed more energy are only gently and occasionally flicked at When asked to draw a contrast with Trump here at Mabes Pizza Cruz argued that he was campaigning in the true Iowa way and also rattled off a series of fights that showed his mettle while others ran away fromWho actually has stood up on Washington Cruz said beginning his usual riff on the highlights of his Senate career In 2013 when millions of Americans rose up against the disaster that was Obamacare and is Obamacare I was proud to stand and lead that fight You look at the other men and women standing on that debate stage the natural question is Where were theyIt may be that Cruz does not see the shutdown today as a political winner Twice as many people had unfavorable opinions of Cruz during the throes of the shutdown than had favorable ones and polls taken after the impasse majorly damaged voters impressions of the Republican Party  even among Republicans and tea party supportersScott Reed the top political strategist for the Chamber of Commerce which strongly opposed the Cruz gambit said it had likely receded from the countrys political conscience because of the GOPs success in the subsequent midterm electionsIm not surprised its not a fever on the campaign trail said Reed It was a long time ago and we had a great election in the meantime  so it kind of overshadowed that critical buffoonery
