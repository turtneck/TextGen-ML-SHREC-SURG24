On March 23 2010 President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the 906page health care reform law known as Obamacare It was as a live microphone caught Vice President Joe Biden exclaiming to his boss a big deal with Biden memorably inserting an extra word for emphasisand for historybetween big and dealObamacare would cover millions of the uninsured a giant step toward the Democratic dream of health care for all It also included dozens of less prominent provisions to rein in the soaring cost and transform the dysfunctional delivery of American medicine It was the kind of BFD that the most consequential presidencies are made of even though it had squeaked through Congress without any Republican votes and few Americans truly understood what was in itEven fewer Americans understood what was in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act the 55page addendum that officially finalized Obamacare This was the strange legislative vehicle that Democrats had jerryrigged to drag reform around a Republican filibuster Its substance was mostly an afterthoughtthe New York Times ran a dutiful story on page A16 after it passedbut as Obama noted when he signed it the next week at Northern Virginia Community College it included another BFDWhats gotten overlooked amid all the hoopla all the drama of last week is whats happened in education he saidYes education Tucked into the parliamentary maneuver that rescued his health care law was a similarly radical reform of the trilliondollar student loan program When Bidens wife Jill a professor at Northern Virginia introduced Obama that day she called it another historic piece of legislation The House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio complained that today the president will sign not one but two jobkilling government takeoversObamacare wasnt really a government takeover but the student loan overhaul actually was it yanked the program away from Sallie Mae and other private lenders that had raked in enormous fees without taking much risk The bill then diverted the budget savings into a 36 billion expansion of Pell Grants for lowincome undergraduates plus an unheralded but extraordinary studentdebt relief effort that is now quietly transferring the burden of college loans from struggling borrowers to taxpayers It all added up to a revolution in how America finances higher education completely overshadowed by the health care hoopla and dramaOver the past seven years Americans have heard an awful lot about Barack Obama and his presidency but the actual substance of his domestic policies and their impact on the country remain poorly understood He has engineered quite a few quiet revolutionsand some of his louder revolutions are shaking up the status quo in quiet ways Obama is often dinged for failing to deliver on the hopeandchange rhetoric that inspired so many voters during his ascent to the presidency But a review of his record shows that the Obama era has produced much more sweeping change than most of his supporters or detractors realizeIts true that Obama failed to create the postpartisan political change he originally promised during his yeswecan pursuit of the White House Washington remains as hyperpartisan and broken as ever But he also promised dramatic policy change vowing to reinvent Americas approach to issues like health care education energy climate and finance and that promise he has kept When you add up all the legislation from his frenetic first two years when Democrats controlled Congress and all the methodical executive actions from the past five years after Republicans blocked his legislative path this has been a BFD of a presidency a profound course correction engineered by relentless government activism As a candidate Obama was often dismissed as a talker a silvertongued political savant with no real record of achievement But ever since he took office during a raging economic crisis hes turned out to be much more of a doer an actionoriented policy grind who has often failed to communicate what hes doneWhat hes done is changing the way we produce and consume energy the way doctors and hospitals treat us the academic standards in our schools and the longterm fiscal trajectory of the nation Gays can now serve openly in the military insurers can no longer deny coverage because of preexisting conditions credit card companies can no longer impose hidden fees and markets no longer believe the biggest banks are too big to fail Solar energy installations are up nearly 2000 percent and carbon emissions have dropped even though the economy is growing Even Republicans like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who hope to succeed Obama and undo his achievements have been complaining on the campaign trail that hes accomplished most of his agendaThe change is real says Ron Klain who served as Bidens White House chief of staff and later as Obamas Ebola czar It would be nice if more people understood the changeIn a conflictobsessed media environment that is not exactly geared toward substantive policy analysis Obamas technocratic brand of change has tended to be more opaque than say Donald Trumps plan for a wall along the Mexican border or Bernie Sanders promise of free college for all At times its complexity has camouflaged its ambition At other times its ambition hasnt lived up to Obamas rhetoric not everything has changed in the Obama era For example he talked a big game about eliminating wasteful programs but other than killing the F22 fighter jet an absurdly expensive presidential helicopter and a hopelessly captured bank regulatory agency called the Office of Thrift Supervision he hasnt done much of thatThe most obvious thing Obama hasnt done is usher in a new era of public enthusiasm for government action and the Democratic Party He was reelected by a comfortable margin but conservative Republicans have taken back both houses of Congress and made impressive gains in statehouses on his watch riding a powerful wave of hostility to federal overreach That political legacy could imperil some of Obamas leftofcenter policy legacy if a Republican is elected to succeed him It has already stymied gun control and immigration reform while forcing Obama to accept deep spending cuts he didnt wantBut its remarkable how often Obama has gotten what he wanted in many cases policies that Democrats and sometimes moderate Republicans have wanted for decades and how often those policies have slipped under the radar
