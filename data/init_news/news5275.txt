The once and perhaps future presidential candidate Rick Santorum has lots of policy ideas for fellow Republicans seeking public officeHes just not sure hell be one of those hopefuls ever againYeah I dont know if I can do this Its just tough Santorum said about another White House runThe former Pennsylvania senator tells The Associated Press in an interview that he isnt ruling out a 2016 candidacyBut he says there are plenty of reasons why he wouldnt do itHe is enjoying a second career as a movie studio executive His daughters health remains a concernAnd Santorum writes in a new book he can help shape his partys future from offstageIn the interview Santorum said the GOP will struggle to win races unless candidates came up with policies that help working AmericansVictories will be tough he said unless elected officials stop being obstructionistsSantorum said the libertarian streak running through his party distorts the definition of freedom and that politicians wrongly look to President Ronald Reagans policies to address todays challengesThen theres Santorums slap at Republicans who demonize social welfare programsDo Republicans really care less about the person at the bottom of the ladder than Democrats do To be painfully honest I would have to say in some ways yes Santorum writes in his book Blue Collar Conservatives Recommitting to an America That WorksThe tough talk raises questions about Santorums viability in what could be a crowded 2016 primary fieldAlso hes not rushing to camp out in early nominating Iowa or New Hampshire againA while A year at least probably he said of his timeline to decide on a 2016 bidSantorum ran an upstart campaign in 2012 surviving long enough to be Mitt Romneys last remaining rival He struggled to raise money or support among establishmentminded Republicans but his socially conservative profile drew enough backing for Santorum to pick up victories in 11 statesEven in victory his disorganized campaign cost him including failing to qualify for the ballot in VirginiaWe cannot run the campaign we ran last time if we run this time Santorum saidHow Republicans win is the focus of Santorums latest book to be released MondaySantorum offers ideas on energy education the economy and health care It comes across as part think tank policy paper part campaign playbook and part communications advice on how to connect with workingclass votersFor instance Republicans should not focus exclusively on business leaders and job creators and should speak to employees Santorum saidAnxiety among those voters remains high and Republicans have for too long talked to the top earners and not the workersA rising tide lifts all boats  unless your boat has a hole in it A lot of Americans weve got holes in our boats Santorum said Millions and millions of Americans are out there who want good lives but have holes in their boats  They just see the water level going up and their boat sinkingThats why he argues candidates need to put forward policies to help those votersIm looking at 2014 and Im thinking the Republican Party is heading toward Noville which is were against this were against that were against this Were not painting a positive vision for America Santorum said in the interviewAfter the 2012 campaign he signed on as CEO of EchoLight Studies which produces movies rooted in faith and familyI saw an opportunity to do something in the space where we need to have movies that have a faith message in them that are better than the movies that have been done Santorum saidAt home 5yearold daughter Bella keeps Santorum busy She has a genetic disorder Trisomy 18 which causes brain heart and internal organ developmental abnormalities Almost all children die within the first year of lifeBella turns 6 in May and the senator is at work on a book about his daughter Her difficult nights have sometimes kept Santorum at her bedsideSantorum said family issues would drive his decision to run or not and Bella would be a key factorHis other six other children Santorum said are all very open to dad doing this againBut Santorum isnt rushing into anything A primary might feature the libertarian wing of the party led in part by two prominent tea partyers Sens Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of TexasTheres a strain within the Republican Party now that smacks of the nogovernment conservatism Santorum said That wasnt Ronald Regan It wasnt Teddy Roosevelt It wasnt Abraham Lincoln It wasnt any Republican that Im aware of It wasnt Calvin Coolidge And yet there seems to be this creation of this strain of conservatism that has no basis in conservatismSantorum said Republicans should respect Reagan but he doubted the former president would offer the same policies today that he did during the 1970s and 1980sSantorum also includes plenty of incendiary rhetoric in his book that he acknowledges could haunt him should he run againIn addition to the sentence about Republicans and social safety nets Santorum writes that poor voters took their lie about sex without consequences as gospel and calls climate change a hypedup crisis
