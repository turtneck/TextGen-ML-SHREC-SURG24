MarcFaberBlogcom November 1 2016 Its nonsense to claim that inflation is only going up 1 percent per year in the United States The cost of living of a typical family is going up much more than thatinsurance transportation schooling are all going up For example health care premiums for insurance policies are rising so the typical household is being squeezed The central banks dont care about that they dont look at it I suppose the system will collapse before we become like Venezuela In the West if they start to print money the end game will be brief Within five years I expect the system to implode You better ask the bureaucrats what their plans are They had zero rates since December 2008 soon eight years passed and that hasnt boosted economic activity for the average household not in Japan nor the United States nor the EU Now they talk about fiscal spending You better ask the bureaucrats what their plans are They had zero rates since December 2008 soon eight years passed and that hasnt boosted economic activity for the average household not in Japan nor the United States nor the EU Now they talk about fiscal spending Then they will find some academics who will blame wealth inequality on the evil capitalists who made so much money out of asset bubbles They will blame the economic woes on these people To some extent this is true But the rich people did not create the inflated asset values it was the central banks by slashing interest rates to zero and negative interest rates in many countries First you create mispricings through artificially low rates and negative interest rates and you boost the income and wealth of the superrich Its at best the 01 percent that really benefit from asset inflation at the cost of all the people that have no assets and so you have this rising wealth inequality So we have to tax the rich people and tax them more Taking money from the rich is appealing if you go to voters and you say to them Look the reason the economy is doing so badly its because of the rich people the billionaires We have to take 20 percent away from them and give it to you You can be sure that everybody will vote for that because the wealthy are a minority This is what happens after monetary policies completely fail Some wellconnected people will hide their wealth but a lot of people wont Even if they take 50 percent from the richest its not going to help The next step will be to take money from less wealthy people the interventionists will go all the way  Source The Epoch Times
