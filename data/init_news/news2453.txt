To understand how dangerously extreme the Republican Party has become on climate change compare its stance to that of ExxonMobilNo one would confuse the oil and gas giant with the Sierra Club But if you visit Exxons website you will find that the company believes climate change is real that governments should take action to combat it and that the most sensible action would be a revenueneutral tax on carbon  in other words a tax on oil gas and coal with the proceeds returned to taxpayers for them to spend as they chooseWith no government action Exxon experts told us during a visit to The Post last week average temperatures are likely to rise by a catastrophic my word not theirs 5degrees Celsius with rises of 6 7 or even more quite possibleA properly designed carbon tax can be predictable transparent and comparatively simple to understand and implementExxon says in a position paper titled Engaging on climate changeNone of this is radical Officials negotiating a climate agreement right now in Paris would take it as selfevident Republican leaders in the 1980s and 1990s would have raised no objectionBut to todays Republicans ExxonMobils moderate selfevident views are akin to heresy Donald Trump the leading GOP presidential candidate says I dont believe in climate changeSenTed Cruz Texsays Climate change is not science its religionSenMarco Rubio Fla at the moment seems to acknowledge that climate change might be real but opposes any action to deal with itWell you may say Trump revels in his stupidities and most of the presidential candidates are appealing to the rightmost wing of their primary electorate at the moment What about the grownups in the party such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell KyIn an oped for The Post published as President Obama traveled to Paris for the opening of the climate talks McConnell slammed Obamas policy for harming the middle class without measurably affecting climate changeDoes that mean I asked the majority leaders press secretary that he believes climate change is real and are there policies he would favor to mitigate the riskThe spokesman answered While the Leader has spoken often on energy and the Presidents policies I dont believe hell have anything new today And as to the Presidents policies the President says hes for all of the above He got that line from us But as to his climate proposal and the Paris proposals I think hes spoken clearly on that in his oped I hope that helpsI tried once more So as to whether he believes climate change is real or would favor any policies to mitigate it I should just say declined to answerA genuine conservative as Ronald Reagans secretary of state George P Shultz has written would acknowledge uncertainties in climate science but look for rational marketbased policies to lessen the risk without slowing economic growth A revenueneutral carbon tax as in a bill RepChris Van Hollen DMd has introduced fits the description preciselyWhat then explains the knownothingism of todays Republicans Some of them see scientists as part of a leftwing cabal many of them doubt governments ability to do anything let alone something as big as redirecting the economys energy use Almost all of them along with quite a few Democrats would rather not tell voters that energy prices need to rise for the sake of the environmentTheir donors in the oil and gas industry encourage their prejudices Three years ago Grover Norquist the Republicans antitax enforcer said that a carbon tax wouldnt violate his notaxincrease pledge if the proceeds were returned by lowering the income tax though he made clear he didnt like the ideaThe next morning the lobbying arm of the oil and gas industry swung into action Grover just butch it up and oppose this lousy idea directlythe American Energy Alliance said This wordsmithing is giving us all headachesFor most of us the reaction to this would have been Butch it up But Norquist got the message and within hours issued a clarification Only a constitutional amendment banning the income tax could justify a carbon taxSo the industry deserves its share of blame and that includes ExxonMobil which hardly trumpets its views on the advantages of a carbon tax Its most alarming slide on the 5degree temperature rise cant be found on its public siteBut blaming it all on Big Oil lets the politicians off too easily Yes McConnell represents a coal state and yes he wants to preserve his Senate majority If those considerations are more important to him than saving the planet let him say so to our children and grandchildren Lets not blame the oil companies for the pusillanimity of people who are supposed to leadRead more from Fred Hiatts archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
