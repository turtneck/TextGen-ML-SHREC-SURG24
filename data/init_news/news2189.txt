On a late July day this past summer a roar filled the sky over Cairo It was the sound of Barack Obamas capitulation to a dictatorEight new American fighter jets freshly delivered from Washington swooped low over the city F16s flying in formation As they banked hard over the citys center they trailed plumes of red white and black smokethe colors of the Egyptian flagFor Egypts brutally repressive president General Abdel Fattah elSisi the spectacle was a triumph symbolizing not only his militaristic power at home but also his victory over an American president who had tried to punish him before surrendering to the cold realities of geopoliticsJust two years earlier Sisi had seized power in a military coup toppling Mohamed Morsi the democratically elected successor to Hosni Mubarak himself a strongman of 30 years pushed out in early 2011 by mass protests in Cairos Tahrir Square In the summer of 2013 Sisi followed his coup with a brutal crackdown that would have done Saddam Hussein proud His security forces arrested thousands of people including much of his political opposition and in one bloody day that summer they gunned down some 1000 proMorsi protesters or more who were staging peaceful sitins The massacre was shocking even by the standards of Egypts longdismal human rights recordObama was appalled We cant return to business as usual he declared after the slaughter We have to be very careful about being seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think run contrary to our values and idealsSeveral weeks later Obama halted the planned delivery of US military hardware to Cairo including attack helicopters Harpoon missiles and several F16 fighter jets as well as 260 million in cash transfers He also cast doubt on the future of Americas 13 billion in annual military aid to Egypta subsidy on which Cairo depends heavily and much more than the United States sends to any country in the world aside from IsraelBut a fierce internal debate soon broke out over whether and how to sanction Egypt further a fight that many officials told me was one of the most agonizing of the Obama administrations seven years as the presidents most powerful advisers spent months engaged in what one called trench warfare against each other It was an excruciating test of how to balance American values with its coldblooded security interests in an age of terrorism Some of Obamas top White House aides including his deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes and the celebrated human rights champion Samantha Power now US ambassador to the United Nations urged the president to link further military aid to clear progress by Sisi on human rights and democracy But Secretary of State John Kerry thenDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Hagels successor Ash Carter argued for restoring the aid Trying to punish Sisi would have little effect on his behavior they said while alienating a bulwark against Islamic radicalism in an imploding Middle East Egypt was one of the most significant policy divides between the White House and the State Department and the Department of Defense says Matthew Spence a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Middle East policyFor months Obama tried to split the difference In meetings and phone calls with the Egyptian ruler by now paranoid and resentful about Americas intentions Obama and Kerry urged Sisi to respect human rights while also seeking his help in countering the the metastisizing Islamic State in nearby Syria and Iraq Sisi did little of eitherIn the end Obama folded This past March he called Sisi once again this time to explain that he would release the cash transfers and delayed hardwareincluding the F16sand end the administrations threats to block the larger 13 billion annual aid packageWe caved says a former senior administration official who participated in the debatesIn a long conversation recently Rhodes the speechwriter turned national security aide who has been with Obama from the beginning of his presidency didnt mince words when it came to the yearslong internal battle over Egypt Were in that sweet spot where everyone is pissed off at us Rhodes told meAnd not just about Egypt The persistent problem of how to deal with Americanallied strongmen has long tripped up a president who prefers pragmatic solutions to moral purity but has been unable to find much of either in the Middle East While every US president struggles to balance values like democracy and human rights with national security Obama has struggled more than most because of the vast gap between his inspirational rhetoric and the compromises he has made with thuggish world leaders especiallybut by no means exclusivelyin a Middle East where authoritarian heads of state from Riyadh to Cairo have cracked down with renewed vigor after the unsettling protests of the Arab SpringThe rhetoric got way ahead of the policymaking says Michael Posner who served as Obamas top State Department official for human rights and democracy in his first term It  raised expectations that everything was going to changeHes never quite melded his rhetoric with his policies says Dennis Ross who served as Obamas top Middle East aide in his first term Adds Robert Ford who was Obamas ambassador to Syria before resigning in frustration over the presidents policy there It seems like we are swinging back to the idea that we must make a choice between supporting dictators or being safeTheir views were echoed in many of more than two dozen recent interviews with current and former administration officials members of Congress experts and activistsinterviews that revealed a striking degree of frustration and disillusionment Many Obama supporters started out believing that the president had grand ambitions for replacing George W Bushs militaristic posture with a more enlightened and progressive approach to the world before coming to believe they had misread a president who was not the idealistic internationalist they had thought he wasIn hindsight it seems clear that Obama came to office far more focused on showing the world that the Bush era was over than on any coherent strategy of his own for advancing human rights or democracyBut it didnt seem that way at the time Obamas aides entered the White House full of plans for dignity promotiona favorite phrase of Powers meant to signal a contrast with Bushs post911 talk of democracy promotion and his secondterm Freedom Agenda that many came to equate not with Bushs lofty goal of ending tyranny in our world but with imposing Western values on countries like Iraq and Afghanistan at gunpoint
