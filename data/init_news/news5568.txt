Washington CNN Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that negotiators had reached a bipartisan deal on the antihuman trafficking bill clearing the way for a vote to confirm attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch in the coming daysAn agreement would end the latest Washington standoff which has tied the Senate in knots for weeks A skirmish over a provision in the antihuman trafficking bill quickly grew into a larger debate over abortion and race that resulted in the longest delay of an attorney general nominee in decadesOn Tuesday McConnell seemed ready to move onIm glad we can say there is a bipartisan proposal that will allow us to complete action on this important legislation so we can provide help to the victims who desperately need it he said on the Senate floorMinority Leader Harry Reid said Republicans had agreed not to expand the scope of the Hyde language the abortion provision that had been the sticking point for Senate Democrats who had been filibustering the billMcConnell said Tuesday that as soon as we finish the trafficking bill theyll take up Lynchs confirmation vote  hopefully in the next day or so Reid and McConnell thanked Senators Patty Murray a Democrat from Washington and John Cornyn a Texas Republican as the lead negotiators on hammering out a compromiseLynchs nomination has taken on historic significance  and not just because she would be the first AfricanAmerican woman to lead the Justice Department No other nominee for attorney general has had to wait this long for Senate confirmation  165 days and counting  since Ronald Reagan was in the White House Lynch supporters have accused Republicans of delaying in part because shes an AfricanAmerican woman a charge they dismissAt issue was the addition of the socalled Hyde Amendment to the antihuman trafficking bill by Republicans without the knowledge of most Democrats The amendment is a common provision attached to most government funds for health programs that bars such funds from being used to pay for abortions but Democrats said it was an unprecedented expansion to nontaxpayer dollarsThe deal is essentially a cosmetic fix that lets both parties claim a win It allows Republicans to say theyve won their battle against funding abortions with government money and Democrats to say theyve avoided expanding the Hyde AmendmentAccording to sources in both parties the MurrayCornyn deal pools two sources of funding to support victims of human trafficking and each is subject to distinct restrictionsOne funding stream from fines levied against sex traffickers could be used for survivor services that do not include health care or medical serviceslike legal aid and law enforcement That effectively bars the money from being used to fund abortions but does not technically include the Hyde AmendmentThe latter funding stream which comes from community health center funds included in the docfix bill President Barack Obama signed into law this week is already subject to the Hyde AmendmentWhile the agreement paves the way for the Senate to move past the controversies there are still a number of procedural hurdles in the way of a final vote on both the antihuman trafficking bill and Lynchs confirmationRepublican and Democratic leaders are still hammering out which amendments to the antitrafficking bill to bring up but votes on those amendments could begin as early as Tuesday night with a final vote on the bill expected WednesdayLynch is still facing a filibuster from GOP opponents in the Senate but McConnell is expected to take procedural steps Tuesday to set up a Thursdaymorning vote to break the filibuster That would pave the way for a vote on full confirmation later that day Both face just a 51vote threshold are expected to easily win approvalThe movement on the paired issues is the latest signal that the years of gridlock that ground legislative business in the Senate to a halt may be lifting and further evidence McConnell wasnt merely bluffing when he promised to prove the GOP could govern when they took control of the Senate this yearThe deal was a rare legislative compromise on abortion that drew praise from both sides of the debateCecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund used the announcement of the deal to praise Reid and Murray for preventing expansion of the Hyde AmendmentThankfully Sens Reid and Murray and other womens health champions held the line and todays agreement prevents Hyde from being extended even further into other funding streams and provides survivors of human trafficking with immediate access to needed health care services Richards said in a statementAnd Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the antiabortion Susan B Anthony List said the group is pleased with the proposalThis deal ensures no money in the fund is used for abortion and that any funding for health services is subject to the longstanding Hyde amendment It ensures taxpayers will not be in a position of facilitating human trafficking by keeping victims on the street she saidLynchs nomination faces a few GOP critics but has enough votes to get confirmedRepublican Sen John McCain of Arizona who plans to vote against Lynchs confirmation told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on the Situation Room Monday he expects a vote fairly soonMcCain pushed back against the notion that Republicans fivemonth refusal to bring Lynchs nomination up for a vote was a form of retribution against DemocratsEarlier on Monday Democratic Sen Debbie Stabenow called the delay politics at its worst
