Sanders she now insists would do so from the left by instituting a program  singlepayer healthcare  that would be more progressive than the Affordable Care Act Yet this possibilityis portrayed in the starkest of terms Its as if the Clinton campaign saw a house burning down and told the fire department to put it out by setting the house next door on fire to suck up all the oxygen feeding the flamesThe attack is predicated on a bill that Sanders introduced in the Senate in 2013 that would have set up national singlepayer The bill would have required each state to set up its own singlepayer program A federal board would oversee these state programs and take charge of any that dont meet whatever requirements it lays out All federal programs  Medicare Medicaid SCHIP  would have been folded into these staterun onesIn a way Sanders bill was structured a little like Obamacare with each state having the option of setting up a marketplace exchange to sell insurance plans and the federal government operating one large exchange for consumers in states that dont want to run their own Since it would have moved even further to the left than the ACA obviously it was dead on arrival in CongressWhats particularly weird is Clintons specific accusation that Sanders singlepayer plan would allow states to opt out altogether As if Bernie Sanders the selfdescribed national democratic socialist would design a health insurance plan with a giant sop to conservativesIt is simply put divorced from realityThe Clinton campaign has pressed this attack hard all week even going so far as to have Chelsea Clinton who has never been much of an attack dog go on the trail to slam Sanders for a proposal that would strip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance Thats a lot of millions It also makes Bernie Sanders sound like Mitch McConnell only with a more gratingaccentIts a typical Clinton campaign move Have a bad week at the polls Overreact with a terrible transparent attack that anyone with an IQ north of negative can see through The fact that this move might alienate the Sanders supporters shell need later on if she wins the nomination does not seem to enter the calculationIve been watching liberals grumble about this whole blowup in my Twitter feed for a couple of days calling Clinton dishonest and dirty while also acknowledging that there is some value to having this fight now in the primaries so as to sharpen the general Democratic healthcare platform before the general election There have also been suggestions that Sanders and Clinton could unite to push some sort of public option the fabled unicorn the Obama administration took off the table while writing the ACA back in 2009 thus dooming its progressive credibility for all time in some circlesSettling on a healthcare goal for the party platform is a worthy goal of this debate if thats in fact whats going on here But Democrats could all save themselves a fair amount of grief by remembering this truth No healthcare proposal from Sanders or Clinton be it a public option or a singlepayer system has any chance in hell of passing through the Congress that the next president will be saddled with I know its fashionable in some quarters to talk about bringing a political revolution to Washington but the reality is that the major barrier to enacting singlepayer or adding a public option to the ACA remains Congress and the army of industry lobbyists who will descend on itthe minute the insurance companies think their bottom lines are in jeopardy Plus the House of Representatives is likely to stay under Republican control after November and those Republicans are going to be the same stubborn jellybrained nihilists who have turned President Obamas hair gray over the last seven years An even if by some miracle the House flips to the Democrats a president would still have to contend with the Senate There is a chance the Democrats could become the majority party there but it wont be a 60member supermajority that marches in ideological lockstep Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson may be gone but the chamber has not yet been fumigated of their spirits In fact assuming the next president is a Democrat his or her main job with regard to healthcare will be keeping Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act Adding to it or fixing some of its flaws will likely have to wait until either we have a more liberal Congress or the Republican Party decides to start governing again Everything else were hearing is just noise Of course maybe President Clinton or President Sanders will surprise us all and pull off a couple of miracles But considering how insane the election of either is likely to drive the GOP some pessimism is definitely warranted
