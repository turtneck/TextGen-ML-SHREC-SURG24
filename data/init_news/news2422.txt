inflammatory comments he made to coworkersDuring a threehour hostage standoff with police after the shooting spree Sunday Mateen referenced the Islamic State and the militant group  also known as ISIS or ISIL claimed Monday that Mateen was a soldier for its selfproclaimed caliphage However officials say that so far no signs have emerged that he was guided by groups outside the countryWe see no clear evidence that he was directed externally Obama said during remarks in the Oval Office It does appear that at the last minute he announced allegiance to ISIL But there is no evidence so far that he was in fact directed by ISIL and at this stage theres no direct evidence that he was part of a larger plotObama said the shooting appeared so far to be a case of homegrown extremismThe comments by Obama and other law enforcement officials Monday offered the sharpestlook yet at what authorities believe may have motivated the gunman who attacked Pulse a popular gay club in OrlandoWere working hard to understand the killer and his motives and his sources of inspiration FBI Director James B Comey said Monday Were highly confident that this killer was radicalized and at least in some part through the InternetEven as this information emerged police were still revealing detailsabout the shooting and the hostage situation that followed while relatives of victims were still awaiting word about whethertheir loved ones were among the woundedor deadClassmates say Orlando gunman was cheering on 911Comey said that during the threehour standoff the gunman had with Orlando police officers therewere three different 911related calls The gunman called 911 about half an hour after opening fire and then hung up the phone Comey said Mateen thencalled a second time and spoke briefly to a dispatcher before hanging up again and then the dispatcher called him back and theyspoke brieflyDuring the calls he said he was doing this for the leader of ISIL who he named and pledgedloyalty to Comey saidHoweverComey said there were no signs that Mateen was tied to any kind of network and he added that it remained unclear exactly what extremist group this attacker supportedIn addition to referencing the Islamic State Mateenalso mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers as well as a Florida man who had joined an alQaeda affiliate and carried out asuicide attack in Syria leaving his specific sympathies unknown Comey saidLaw enforcement officials in Florida meanwhile offered a new accounting of the shootoutOrlando Police Chief John Mina said that police first encountered Mateen shortlyafter the initial gunfire at about 2 am when an offduty officer working at the club  Adam Gruler a 15year veteran of the force  exchanged shots with MateenAdditional officers called to the scene soon joined in another gun battle at which point Mateen retreated further into the building and eventually into a bathroom The police then held back because there were no more gunshots Mina said and they tried to negotiate with Mateen to avoid any more bloodshedMateen was in a bathroom with four or five people while another 15 or 20 were in another bathroom Mina said During these negotiations Mateen was cool and calm and did not make many demands Mina saidAfter about three hourspolice said they decided to storm Pulse after the shooter referenced bomb belts or explosives Mina said the police used explosives and then an armored Bearcat to break a hole in the clubs wall Hostages poured out and Mateen  armed with a pair of guns  came out as wellDuring the gun battle Mateen was killed and one Orlando police officer  Michael Napolitano a 14year veteran of the force  was injured when a bullet struck his Kevlar helmet In a statement Monday police identified Napolitano and the other officers who fired shots at the nightclub Following state protocol all 11 of theseofficershave been relieved of duty while the state investigates their shootingsHowever much still remains unclear

identified relatives or nextofkin for nearly all of the victims making notifications for 48 of the 49 people killed On Sunday police had included Mateen when saying 50 people were killed For many the

years In 2013 agents opened an investigation that lasted 10 months after Mateen made comments to coworkers about terrorist groups and expressed a desire to martyr himselfInvestigators interviewed him

came to the attention of federal agents looking into the Florida man who blew himself up in Syria Comey said Mateen and this man attended the same mosque according to Comey Again the FBI interviewedMateen looked into his possible ties to the suicide bomber determined that there were no strong ties and moved onEven givenMateens mentions of the Islamic State the level of possible connections between the gunman and the militant group were unclearThe Islamic States alBayan Radio described him Monday as one of the soldiers of its selfdescribed caliphate but it offered no further details on possible contact before the attack said the SITE Intelligence Group which monitors statements by extremist factionsIf it does appear that the Orlando gunman was radicalized from material
