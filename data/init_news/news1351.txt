October 30 2016 at 118 PM Right now we are at a pivot point in this nations history as important as any time in the past We have the choice over the next 9 days to elect a woman who has proven time and time again that she and her husband former president Bill Clinton operate outside and above the law Or we can elect a person who appears to represent values quite the opposite of Killer Clinton This Moonpie Mafias last venture into the Oval Office was filled with scandals from the very minute they entered the White House through their exit carrying every bit of furniture and silverware they could load in their UHaul trailer Their body count runs to the millions when you take into account the destruction of other countries during their despotic reign And Bush was even worse Have we forgotten the nearly 80 men women and children 22of the Branch Dividians murdered by armed goons on the direct order of Janet Reno Killer Clintons hired assassin and attorney General Did we forget that Madeline Albright Killers Secretary of State when she bragged about a 500000 body count as an acceptable death toll in Central Europe as Killers husband sent in his mercenaries to slaughter innocent civilians in Croatia Slovakia and Slovenia while supporting puppet regimes and war lords who murdered millions of their peoples through planned genocide How about Rwanda with the death toll that was well in excess of 500000 I recall Bill Clinton basically saying Ooops Sorry I guess I kind of missed that onehey Monicahow about another blow job I really get off getting head while I shoot some cruise missiles at the people in Iraq and Afghanistan It sure defines Getting off I guess the memory hole is just that deep Idiots and morons will elect Killer because they either know nothing of history dont care about the Clintons death toll or actually like the idea that this psychopathic murdering mutant bitch might actually be elected to the highest office in the land Anyone who voted for Killer votes for death by the number and democide by the millions When it comes to Trump Im not a fan of his either But when given the choice of Killer or Trump I am forced to chose between the lesser of two evils BIG EVIL lives in the skin of Killer Clinton Whatever lives in the skin of Trump is I am convinced is far less a danger to the Republic in name only than Killer Klinton and her Blood thirsty Killer Klown Klan
