Its been a big week for abortion newsCarly Fiorinas passionate if inaccurate depiction of a Planned Parenthood sting video was one of the most memorable moments of last weeks GOP debate And the House of Representatives on Friday passed two abortionrelated bills  one aimed at cutting federal funds to Planned Parenthood the other at punishing doctors who fail to provide medical care to infants that survive abortion attemptsGiven all this you could be forgiven for thinking theres been a publicopinion shift against abortion rights in the USAbortion is one of those rare issues in which public opinion never seems to budge all that much Americans are still more or less where they were on whether they think it should be legal as in 1975 just after the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision That is with the largest share of Americans somewhere in the murky middleAccording to Gallup data by 29 percent to 19 percent Americans think it should be legal in all circumstances But a majority  51 percent  say it should be legal in only certain circumstances  in cases of rape incest or where the mothers life is threatened for example That number has barely changed in 40 yearsThose kinds of data stand in stark contrast to whats available about other social issues Consider samesex marriage for example where public opinion has swung dramatically toward legalization in the past decadeOr take the death penalty  upticks in crime and opposition to government spending are two factors that have driven Americans opinions on this topic back and forth over the yearsAbortion isnt like that Strong majorities have consistently opposed overturning Roe since 1989 today by nearly 2 to 1Thats perhaps even more surprising when considering whats happened over the past 40 years a patchwork of state laws passed to define very specific restrictions on abortion a decline in teen pregnancy and increasing political polarization All of that has apparently neither caused nor been the result of big shifts in national public opinion on abortionSo whats going onIt might have to do with another fact about public opinion on abortion  its a topic for which the realities are anything but black and white which is exactly how the arguments are all too often framed in the political arenaA majority of Americans support legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy But a majority also oppose it in the second and third trimesters Most support it in cases of rape or incest but most oppose it if the mother simply cant afford another childThose opinions get much messier when you dive deeper into the researchNot only is opinion remarkably stable  it is deeply contradictory said Karlyn Bowman who studies public opinion at the rightleaning American Enterprise Institute When people are asked  Is it murder people say yes Bowman said But if asked  Should it be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor a large majority say yesIn one poll from the Public Religion Research Institute 43 percent of Americans identified as both prolife and prochoice Those labels are their own source of uncertaintySince the mid1990s the share of people who consider themselves prochoice by Gallups count has fallen moderately  even while opinions on abortion circumstances have held steady Still a majority  50 percent  consider themselves prochoice while 44 percent say they are prolifeThese contradictions may be why public opinion holds so steadyWhen that contradiction happens on a public policy issue when there are deep contradictions most people pull away from an issue Bowman said They dont see any reason to resolve the tensions in their opinions So that leaves the topic up to the prolife and the prochoice activists And those groups dont really represent most peopleWhy Planned Parenthood is the focusSo if most Americans dont firmly oppose abortion one might say its foolhardy for Republicans like this weeks GOP debate participants to stake such firm antiabortion stancesBut abortion is an issue that fires up the bases of both parties Its one of the top issues used by Republicans and Democrats to motivate fundraise and organizeWhats more though the latest abortion fight isnt focused on the larger issue of abortion itself Its been about Planned Parenthood And recent surveys suggest that public opinion on the organization is more malleable than opinion on the topic of abortionToday a plurality of Americans  37 percent  view Planned Parenthood favorably according to a recent Monmouth poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 28 percentage points But just three years ago the same poll found that far more people  55 percent  viewed the organization favorablyIts just one survey but it suggests that making the abortion debate about Planned Parenthood and taxpayer money may be a more successful tactic for the GOP than trying to pass laws restricting abortion itselfOf course that doesnt mean a shutdown over the issue would be a good idea for the GOP The Republican Partys favorability rating fell sharply during the October 2013 partial government shutdown  making it one area where public opinion does tell a clear story
