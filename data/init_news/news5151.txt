For most people a salaried job paying 25000 ayear is far from exceptional It corresponds to an hourly wage of roughly 14 which isnt enough to live on in many pricey metro areasBut according to existing federallabor rules a 25000 job can be classified as managerialor given another designation that exempts it from overtime pay Thats why the Obama administrationmoved this week to change those rules As of Dec 1 the minimum annual salary that can be excluded from overtime will be raised from 23660 to 47476 unless opponents manage to block the change in Congress or the courtsThe move is long overdue The percentage of people eligible for overtime has been in a free fall since its high in 1975 Then 62 of salaried workers were paid overtime for work over 40 hours Today the number is 7 And it was even lower before2004 when the Bush administration made some needed changesSetting a new minimum salary is to be sure an inexact science An annual salary of 23660might once have been called middle income even managerial Today thatdoes not pass the laugh test as a threshold for a managementor professional jobThe new level of 47476 is slightly less than it would have been had it been adjustedfor inflation each year since 1975 It wouldincrease the percentage of workerswho qualify for overtime to 35That seems like a reasonable place to startIt also seems reasonable that the new level should be indexed for inflation as well But this and future administrations need to recognizethat any action can produce unintended consequences and should be willing to adjust the number if circumstances warrantThese new rules are the latest effort by the Obama administration to push up worker pay in the face of a decidedly hostile Congress With Republicans refusing to budge on the federalminimum wage Obama settled on overtime rules in part because he could alter them without legislationIn truth the overtime rules are probably a better way to assist workers than by tweaking the minimum wage now at 725 an hour The minimum wage affects a small segment of the working population about15 million peoplecompared with42 million people whodqualify for overtime under the new rulesAnd if the minimumis raised too far too fast employers could respond by eliminating jobsThe response to changing overtime rules is likely to be less severe If employers dont want to pay overtime they are more likely to cut people back to 40 hours a week or to bump their salariesup to the new annual minimum of 47476 than they are to eliminate jobsCritics of the new rules argue that they will turn millions of professionals into clockpunchers while adding rigidity to what have been flexible and collegial work environmentsThere might besome truth to this But clearly the current system has not served the interest of workers wellMost people in the lower to middleincome bracketswould rather have fair pay for their long hours than a fancierjob titleUSA TODAYs editorial opinions are decided by itsEditorial Board separate from the news staff Most editorials are coupled with an opposing view  a unique USA TODAY featureTo read more editorials go to theOpinion front pageor sign up for thedaily Opinion email newsletter
