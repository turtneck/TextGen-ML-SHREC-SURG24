Just one month ago Hillary Clinton had amassed a 9point lead over Donald Trump in national polls and had an even bigger advantage in several swing states Her eventual victory seemed to many to be all but assured and Democrats were so confident of winning that a landslide victory even seemed like a possibilityBut its all been downhill for Clinton from there Starting in midAugust her leads in both national and swing state polls began to gradually shrink And the events of this past weekend seem to have made her margin narrow even further as Trump has been getting some of his best state polls of the entire general election campaignImportantly Clinton still appears to be narrowly ahead both nationally and in enough states to win But the recent trends have not been good for her and make a remarkably dramatic contrast with where the race appeared to be last monthSo whats happened Why has this race gotten so close all of a suddenMatt Yglesias offers the bigpicture point that Clinton is simply quite unpopular But that still leaves open the question of why things have changed so quickly Inconveniently a month of a campaign is a complex thing with many different events unfolding either concurrently or one after another which makes it difficult to test a clean theory about whats made the differenceSome combination of all this is most likely responsible for the shift weve seen due to voters changing their minds and perhaps differences in poll response rates  though its unclear which of these factors is most important What is clear is that a race Democrats hoped would be a landslide is now looking more like a nailbiterIn the weeks following the Democratic convention in late July Trumps poll standing plummeted This was probably partly because Clinton got a convention bounce but another factor was likely Trumps highprofile attacks on the family of the late Capt Humayun Khan The Kahn controversy was heavily covered in the press and earned Trump a new round of condemnations from highprofile RepublicansBut around August 17 Trump decided to make a change He installed a new campaign team He stopped doing constant TV interviews where hed end up putting his foot in his mouth He started doing more traditional and messagedriven campaign events as the Wall Street Journals Monica Langley writesAnd perhaps most importantly Trump has managed to avoid embroiling himself in any major new campaignconsuming controversies well until Thursdays birther flap which hasnt yet played out in the polls Of course he is being graded on a curve here  as Matt Yglesias writes even uneventful Trump interviews usually contain several untrue or offensive statements that would shock us if any other politician were involvedTrump still isnt doing as well as we would expect a generic Republican nominee to be doing Voxs fundamentalsbased elections forecast suggests that he should be winning 509 percent of the twoparty vote and hes currently 3 points behind that Still Trump has generally spent the past month hammering home his critique of Clinton rather than being dogged with questions about one offensive statement or another And that could be helping bring some reluctant Republicans back into his campTheres also one other big thing thats changed for Trump in this time period He finally started spending money on swing state campaign ads Until midAugust Hillary Clinton had been spending millions on the airwaves essentially unopposed in every key state but now the Trump campaign has been investing millions in ads as wellNow these ads are only seen by swing state voters so we wouldnt expect them to make a dent in national polls And Trump has improved nationally so theyre not at the heart of whats going on Still they could be making a difference at the margins in his performance in the swing states that will decide the electionAs Trump has been improving his operation Clinton has been dogged by a series of negative news stories that could be hurting her to some extentOn September 2 the FBI released a report of its findings in its investigation into Clintons emails There wasnt really much news here but it quite understandably led to a new spate of news stories with Clinton and FBI in the headlines And considering that the last time Clinton sank this badly in the polls was in the weeks after FBI Director James Comey first announced his findings in early July it seems that when the topic is in the news Clintons poll standing suffersOver this same late Augustearly September time period a series of negativesounding stories about the Clinton Foundation also were published Most of these stories didnt seem to amount to very much if you read their details closely But the very fact that a bunch of negativesounding stories about Clinton appeared in the news helps create an aura of corruption around her particularly when Trump dubs her crooked regardless of the fine details Most voters arent retaining the fine details hereMeanwhile Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule in August so she could focus on fundraising instead The side effect though was that she didnt have the opportunity to counterprogram those negative news stories with positive events putting her message out thereClintons decision to lay low in August  will be debated for years Politicos Glenn Thrush writes If she wins her summertime fundraising blitz meant to unleash a torrent of antiTrump advertising at campaigns end will be regarded as strategic genius lose and her decision is up there with Michael Dukakis in the tankI find that to be a bit overheated and doubt this made that much of a difference but hey when voters did see a lot of Clinton and her message during the week of the Democratic convention they did seem to like them well enoughSo the race had already gotten a good deal closer since midAugust But then the events of this past weekend seem to hurt Clinton even more  though its not clear which mattered mostFirst was deplorablesgate At a fundraiser last Friday Clinton disparaged half of Trumps supporters at a fundraiser as belonging in the basket of deplorables  racist sexist homophobic xenophobic Islamophobic you name it Clinton soon gave a semiapology saying that half was too much but reiterating that Trump does indeed have many racist supporters Meanwhile the Trump campaign and much of the media quickly portrayed her remarks as a devastating gaffe akin to Mitt Romneys 47 percent comments from 2012Afterward things got worse for Clinton as she felt faint and had to leave a 911 commemoration event on Sunday was recorded nearly collapsing while being led into her car and belatedly admitted that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier All this seemed to some to vindicate rumors Trump and his allies had been trying to spread about Clintons health for some time and made Clinton appear less than fully forthrightThis is speculative but like Brendan Nyhan of the Upshot I suspect the health news is hurting Clinton more than deplorablesgate Yes the Trump campaign has seized on her remark but the Clinton team probably has better data and they now seem eager to discuss the topic after the candidates initial semiapologyFurthermore the deplorables comment seems like the type of insidebaseball campaign story that ordinary voters wont really care about whereas Clintons health is far more striking Search data also suggests that people are far far more interested in Clintons health than in the deplorables controversyNow its possible that this sudden swing in the polls is affected somewhat by differential nonresponse rates a phenomenon Voxs Jeff Stein wrote about earlier this year That is to say the news of Clintons illness may have made her supporters less enthusiastic about even answering polls so theyd naturally show up less often in the results even after demographic weightingSimilarly Trump supporters may have been disproportionately less likely to respond to polls back in early August when Trump was under fire for his attacks on the Khan family That could have made Clintons poll leads look artificially large then and a change in Clinton supporter response rates could be making the race look unusually tight now As Stein wrote Andrew Gelman and Alan Abramowitz have compiled evidence showing that what looks like big poll swings can often be explained partly by this effectYet if Clinton voters truly are feeling so unenthusiastic about the race that they wont answer phone polls that in itself indicates a major underlying enthusiasm problem her campaign needs to solve Furthermore finding creative reasons to dismiss poll results that may not fit with your preconceptions has generally been a bad idea this year as Trumps primary rise and Brexit have both shownAs for whether this is the harbinger of a new normal in the race well we dont really know of course There are still 53 more days until Election Day and much can happen in that time Everything mentioned above happened in just the past month Clintons health could get better or worse Trump could avoid more gaffes or start backsliding like he did with birtherism on Thursday The media could cover Trump more harshly now that it seems more likely he could win The debates could go well or disastrously for either candidateWhat is clear is that a race Democrats briefly thought they had in the bag no longer looks like such a sure thing
