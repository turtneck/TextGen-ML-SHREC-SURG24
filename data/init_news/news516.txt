Hacking Accusations Against Russia Are Sign of Washingtons Desperation With Putin winning across the board Washington is struggling to contain its humilitation Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation The Obama administration is now accusing Russia of cybercrime and trying to disrupt the US presidential election The claim is so farfetched it is hardly credible More credible is that the US is reeling from Putins stunning humiliation earlier this week Since June US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian statesponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic partys database It is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election by releasing damaging information on Clinton which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump Russia has vehemently denied any connection to the cybercrime charges or trying to disrupt the November poll Now the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections reported the Washington Post This takes the row to a whole new level No longer are the insinuations a matter of private partisan opinion The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cybercrime and political subversion Predictably following the latest allegations there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyberattacks on Russian government facilities Vladimir Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as rubbish He noted that the Kremlins computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day many of which can be traced to American origin but Moscow doesnt turn around and blame the US government for such cyberattacks There are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion As with previous Russianhacker claims by the Democrats and US media there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof When reports emerged in June  again through the Washington Post  that the Democrat National Committee DNC was hacked by Russian agents the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike The firm is linked by personnel to the NATOaffiliated antiRussian think tank Atlantic Council Again no verifiable evidence was presented then just the word of a dubious partisan source Back then the Russian scare story for thats what it was served as a useful diversion from far more important issues Such as the 19000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clintons presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders Muchvaunted US democracy was exposed as a fraud and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damagelimitation mode by smearing Russia It was the whistleblower site Wikileaks run by Australian journalist Julian Assange that released the embarrassing emails It had nothing to do with Russia Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself This is where it gets really explosive Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 20112012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change Furthermore Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists Assange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clintons alleged gunrunning to terrorists this month If the evidence stands up Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US The exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion Hence the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cybercrime and of trying to subvert American democracy This is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become Day by day it seems leads to more damning revelations of Washingtons complicity in illegal wars covert subversion of foreign states and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world In addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks much of revelation about US criminality and statesponsored banditry has emerged from Russias principled military intervention in Syria Russias intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change Russias intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria Washingtons mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath Such is Washingtons ignominious fall from pretendgrace to its grim odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground In announcing Russias unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclearweapongrade plutonium Putin went much much further He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumpedup sanctions against Russia with financial compensation as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russias border In other words the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington with all its ridiculous delusions of exceptionalism has never ever heard before American pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand Washingtons criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed And now with due contempt Russia is putting manners on Washington It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue Moreover the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too When a giant banner declaring Putin a peacemaker was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend the popular enthusiasm went viral Washington is reeling from Putins righteous courage to call it out for what it is The truthtelling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn Its deluded mythmaking about its own virtues are being stripped bare Whats going on here is a worldclass historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity The reaction is understandable foamingatthemouth desperate hysterical and panicked Accusing Russia of hacking into the American democratic process is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues Washingtons exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making the emperor is a criminal the people know it and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this hasbeen
