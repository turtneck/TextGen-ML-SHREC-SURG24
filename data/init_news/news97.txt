CNN On Veterans Day we recognize and honor the sacrifices our service members and their families make for our country We owe our service members the very best but unless Congress acts on January 1 more than 9 million veterans who rely on Social Security benefits or pension and compensation benefits will not get their annual cost of living increaseThis freeze in funds which has happened only two other times since 1975 will be really tough on veterans among the 71 million Americans who depend on Social Security and other benefits to help make ends meet Twothirds of seniors depend on Social Security for the majority of their income and for 15 million Americans Social Security is all that stands between them and povertyWhile vets and seniors get no raise CEOs at the top 350 American companies received on average a 39 pay increase last year Thats a lot of money The average CEO at one of the top 350 American companies made 163 million and got more than half a million in pay raises So CEOs get huge raises while seniors veterans and others whove worked hard dont get an extra dime Why Its not an accident Its not inevitable Its the result of deliberate policies set by CongressSocial Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when prices go up benefits go up too But Congress formula samples the spending patterns of about a quarter of the country and the formula isnt geared to what older Americans actually spendProjections for the costs of core goods and services show inflation is up about 2 but seniors wont get a cost of living increase  mostly because of falling gasoline prices which dont mean as much to millions of seniors who dont commute to work So seniors who are already struggling to scrape by to cover rent and exploding prescription drug prices  will be left scramblingSure companies should make their own decisions about how much to compensate executives but because of the laws Congress has passed American taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimilliondollar pay packagesIts time for Congress to make different choices Thats why last week I introduced the Seniors And Veterans Emergency SAVE Benefits Act The SAVE Benefits Act will give seniors on Social Security veterans those with disabilities and others a onetime payment in 2016 equivalent to an average increase of 39  the same as the taxpayersubsidized raise that CEOs received last yearWe can afford to give seniors and vets a raise In fact we can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single penny to the deficit simply by closing the bonus loophole for corporate executives According to the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration closing this loophole will create enough revenue to help millions of Americans and still have enough left over to help extend the life of the Social Security trust fundSeniors and vets would get an increase of about 581 next year  a little less than 50 a month That 581 increase would cover almost three months of groceries for seniors or a years worth of outofpocket costs on critical prescription drugs for the average Medicare beneficiary That 50 a month is worth a lot to those 71 million Americans According to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute that little boost could lift more than 1 million Americans out of povertyGiving vets and seniors a little help and stitching up these corporate tax writeoffs isnt just about economics its about our values For too long weve listened to a handful of people with money and power who say Cut taxes for those at the top cut rules and regulations that keep everyone honest and let everyone else fight over the scraps We tried trickledown economics and it failedBut we can make different choices  choices that reflect our values We dont have to ignore this problem We can give a small boost to 71 million Americans who have earned it and who need itWe can lift over 1 million people out of poverty We can extend the life of Social Security And we can do it by shutting down taxpayer giveaways to a handful of wealthy corporations that will do fine without them For me this is simple Our spending should reflect our values and that means passing the SAVE Benefits Act
