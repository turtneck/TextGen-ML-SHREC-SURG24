In 2008 it wasformer Gov Tommy Thompson of Wisconsinwhom beltway political mavens had built up for years as an exciting Republican reformer with big new ideas like welfare reform and school vouchers In the wake of the Bush debacle he was especially attractive as an outsider who could make the American people forget what theyd just endured Unfortunately like Walker on the stump Thompson was frighteningly unprepared even making embarrassing gaffes about Jews and Israel and he dropped out in August of 2007Undeterred by this embarrassment the establishment once again anointed a Midwestern Governor as the GOPs salvation for exactly the same reasons in 2014former Minnesota Gov Tim Pawlenty who also flamed out before any votes were castThis year it was Scott Walker who suspended his campaign yesterday after having been in precipitous free fall from frontrunner to last place and facing the prospect of beingbooted from the main debate stage and forced to spar with Lindsey Graham at the kids table next time outIf you dont count Gerald Ford who backed into the presidency by being appointed vice president and succeeding Nixon when he resigned the GOP has never nominated a governor and only one politician from the Midwestsince Alf Landon back in 1936 Senator Bob Dole in 1996 And neither of them wereexactly resounding victories  Landononly got twoelectoral votes and Dole was soundly defeated by the incumbent Bill Clinton Eisenhower more accurately belonged to the nation not the region where he was born and his executive experience was in saving the world from fascism so such parochial electoral concerns were not particularly relevantBut while its true that the modern electoral map is very daunting for the GOP they seem peculiarly fixated on this region Walker took the early lead in the Midwestern savior race but for months people were also talking up Michigan Gov Rick Snyder and Indiana Gov Mike Pence as similarly excellent choices to lead the GOP out of the wilderness Back in 2014 as they all made pilgrimages to the Republican Governors AssociationPolitico described them this wayThe fact that they seemed to be able to transcend the partys shall we saycruderside was also a big selling point AsWalker put itduring his apparently impressive appearanceBy strong leadership he meant that one should be as crackpot rightwing as one can get away with and not be Michele Bachmann And Walker was that guy in every wayThe New Republic described him this wayHe took his marching orders fromThe Club For Growth Americans for Prosperityandanti immigration guru Jeff SessionsHe had evangelical credentialsequal to those of Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum His record of union bashing was second to noneAnd he certainly seemed nice so nice in fact that he appeared to be something of a grinning simpleton at timesparticularly on social media where his tweeting of his dinner menus and constant pictures of himself riding on a Harley were ruthlessly mocked While all the constituencies in the party who were presumed to be his greatest fans gave him plenty of chances his gaffes and flipflops made them doubt his sincerity and abilities He had been widely assumed to be the Koch brothers choice due to their involvement in the union busting and recall campaign in Wisconsin And they were admittedly very impressed with him until he started making embarrassing mistakes like saying thatRonald Reagans greatest foreign policy achievement was taking on the air traffic controllers unionand flipflopping on immigration several times finally landing on the opinion thatevenlegalimmigration should be ended Not ready for prime time doesnt begin to describe it andthe Kochs have known that for a while now Additionallyfor reasons that remain somewhat elusive the Christian right just didnttrust him To someone who isnt a member of that club his tiny deviations from the dogma seemed understandable but they saw it differently With other candidates in the race with strong conservative evangelical credentials as well as Trump who rightly notes thatmany evangelicals love him too that constituency never materialized for him either And even aside from the now predictable consecration as this years Midwestern savior the rationale for Walkers campaign was built on the fallacy of his alleged prowess in bending the Legislature to his will and dominating at the ballot box Apparently managing to win in years that were national Democratic electoral bloodbaths and only being recalled once makes you a giant slayer in the Republican Party these days And having a legislative majority thathad been building an agenda and a game plan for many years before you were elected counts as a demonstration of heroic power Juggling numerous scandals and managing to avoid indictment is likewise considered a useful skill  which come to think of it it actually is in the GOP The sad fact is that Walker has been the most overrated politician in the country based largely upon the Republicans quixotic desire to find a leader who can put a respectable face on its increasingly disreputable base  and the medias odd willingness to not believe what their eyes were telling them that Walker was a terrible candidate Like Pawlenty and Thompson before him he may have looked good on a PowerPoint presentation but in reality he showed few signs of life on the debate stage or on the stump The good news for Washingtons pundits and establishment Republicans is that theres still some hope for their Midwestern hero scenario to come true in 2016 There is another one in the race Ohio GovJohn KasichWhether or not he can make the cut is still unknown but if theres one thing you can say about him its thathes anything but dull Unfortunately the Republican electorate seems mesmerized by outsider amateurs this year so far and Kasich is the embodiment of a lifelong politician who took some time out to cash in hes the fourth richest Republican runningand then jump back in to become governor and then president He also has a habit of diluting his hardcore conservatism with some pragmatic dealmaking from time to time which is unlikely to be acceptable unless he adopts some Trumpish attitudes about Mexicans and Muslims to cover it But whatever happens this time out for those who believe in the Great Whitebread Hope as the only salvation for a fractured party that needs someone who can convince the country it hasnt gone completely stark raving mad theres every reason to believe that the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
