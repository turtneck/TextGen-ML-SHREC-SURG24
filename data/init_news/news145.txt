Are the wheels coming off the Iran deal Less than a year after Iran America and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord a debate over its terms has erupted anewIn Washington the braggadocio of a prominent White House aide is fueling Republican accusations that President Obama deliberately deceived the Congress and the country about Iran and the deal And in Tehran frustration over the residual impact of American sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from Iranian leaders that the United States has failed to live up to its end of the bargain As a result some are fretting that the deal is at risk and are laying blame on the White House doorstepBoth claims are spurious and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the Obama administration In the end however the ruckus over recent comments by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is largely an insidetheBeltway dramaone that provides endless entertainment for Washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or American diplomacyBy contrast Irans dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for Washington But it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is unraveling Rather the chorus of complaints from Tehran demonstrates the accord signed in July 2015 is working exactly as it was intendedforestalling Iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economyObamas handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility For the sake of the deal and for any prospect of a durable Thermidor for the revolutionary state Washington should resist the temptation to assuage Irans postdeal growing pains If Iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield thatin other words meaningful political economic and foreign policy reformNot surprisingly Iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from Washington Their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed On an April visit to Washington Valiollah Seif the head of Irans Central Bank questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement insisting that Tehran has received almost nothing of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA Mohammad Javad Zarif the countrys smoothspoken foreign minister has contended that the United States needs to do way more warning that if one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falterAnd Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei charged recently that the Americans are engaged in obstruction and deception adding on paper the Americans say banks can trade with Iran but in practice they act in such an Iranophobic way that no trade can take place with IranAdding fuel to the fire are changes to US visa policies that are perceived at constraining Irans economic rebound deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the US Congress and a recent Supreme Court verdict that paves the way for a 2 billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to Tehran or its proxies Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has described the decision as flagrant theft and evidence of enduring American hostility toward TehranTehrans narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies the revolutions power brokers steeped in official narratives of American treachery an Iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend and a European business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative marketAnd it wouldnt be the first time Tehran got cold feet about its nuclear obligations out of an unfortunate sense of that the payoff was insufficient In 2005 two years after a deal with Britain France and Germany to suspend core aspects of its nuclear program Irans leadership soured on that deal and reneged Anxiety about a repeat performance is prompting new US efforts to facilitate business in Iran and a mounting debate in the press and on Capitol Hill around additional American sanctions reliefBut Irans campaign is grounded in a fundamental falsehood that Washington has failed to live up to its end of the bargain In fact Washington has delivered fully on the sanctions relief pledged under the JCPOA and officials in the White House State Department and even the enforcement office of the Treasury Department have engaged in extraordinary outreach to clarify remaining restrictions and underscore American commitment to the terms of the dealMoreover the rewards of Irans nuclear concessions are actually widely evidentin the volume of new trade and investment that is already underway in the scope and velocity of diplomatic and commercial reengagement with Iran in the swifterthananticipated revival of oil exports Heads of state from Italy and India from South Korea to South Africa are beating a path to Tehran accompanied by contingents of eager investors Meanwhile Iranian officials including Seifchief of the same Central Bank that was formerly barred by sanctionsheadline swanky conferences aimed at wooing European business players The great Iranian gold rush is onThe catch is that the money is moving more slowly than Iranian officials seem to have anticipatedand the trickledown effect has been almost nonexistent for the average Iranian The explanation for this lag is complex and multidimensionalFirst and foremost Iran is hard hit by the decline in oil prices which have fallen by roughly 60 percent since the interim nuclear deal was signed in November 2013 Even in the best of times the Islamic Republic was never a particularly easy place to do business and many of its structural economic problems have been exacerbated by a decade of sanctions and the particularly egregious mismanagement of the 2005 to 2013 tenure of Iranian President Mahmoud AhmadinejadIrans designation since 2008 as a highrisk and noncooperative jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force a multilateral body established to combat money laundering and terrorist finance poses additional hurdles for banks In addition a host of other market distortions induce investor caution corruption a bloated and opaque banking system an inflexible labor market unattractive contract terms for energy investments the traditional dominance of the public sectorTehrans challenges in luring capital is further complicated by its reputation for provocative domestic and regional behavior Torching embassies arresting tourists and dualnational businessmen testing ballistic missilesnone of this provides a conducive context for Irans reintegration into the global economy As the old adage goes capital is a coward and the Islamic Republic is a haunted houseIran has seen this all before Similar factors undercut Tehrans previous efforts to open up to the global economy In the early 1990s after the long war with Iraq thenPresident Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani sought foreign trade and investment as part of his massive reconstruction program Initial outcomes were encouraging but falling oil prices excessive shortterm debt and the perpetuation of an ideological foreign policy drove away investors and undermined his economic reformsThis time around American sanctions have cast a long shadow The nuclear deal left intact an array of restrictions the primary US embargo on Iran as well as financial measures that preclude access to the US dollar and penalize third countries for doing business with Iranian individuals and entities that are involved with terrorism or other malfeasance The vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor And the hangover effect of a decade of stringent and costly enforcement has generated a culture of overcompliance in the international financial sector since institutional due diligence is an integral dimension of the industrys viabilityNone of this should come as a surprise to Tehran American officials were crystal clear throughout the negotiations and in advocating on behalf of the deal that the deal only removed the nuclearrelated sanctions and that US measures imposed as a result of Irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or other issues would remain intact And every sensible analyst looked past the inflated rhetoric of the deals opponents who brayed against the deal as a massive cash bonanza to recognize that the residual sanctions regime would remain a significant factor in Irans postdeal economic picture As I wrote at the timeSo if this was entirely predictable why is Tehran crying foul now Unlike in the United Stateswhere the agreements shortcomings were oversold if anything rather than downplayedin Iran there was a triumphalism with which the deal was sold domestically This was mostly because of the peculiarities of Irans political system To avoid the appearance of contravening the red lines articulated by Khamenei the countrys ultimate authority Iranian negotiators depicted the JCPOA as delivering wholesale sanctions relief Rouhani described the outcome as a legal technical and political victory for the country emphasizing that Tehran achieved more than what was imaginedIrans politically motivated embellishments were exacerbated by the hype surrounding the deal cultivated by entrepreneurs and aspiring middlemen who presented Iran in hyperbolic terms as the best emerging market for years to come and one of the hottest opportunities of the decade But while it may offend the Iranian ego the relative scale of the opportunity in Iran is more modest than other muchheralded economic openings such as China It is hardly inconceivable that many banks and other firms have simply chosen to sit this first round outNeither Irans economic challenges nor the grievances of its leadership are fraying the nuclear accord in fact they only highlight its underlying logic While the deals scope was finiteit was not a wholesale rapprochement or rehabilitationmany of its supporters argued that its logic would prove selfreinforcing Irans gradual reintegration into the global economy would bolster the case among its leadership for a broader moderation of its domestic and foreign policies precisely in order to boost their benefitsTehrans dissatisfaction with the payout to date suggests this formula is working A little bit of sanctions relief has whetted the entrepreneurial appetites of the clerical state Despite official invocations proclaiming a resistance economy the trickle of new trade and investment from Europe and Asia into Iran since the deal was signed has only intensified pressure for moreand for more tangible dissemination of its benefits among the Iranian population In other words it is the success of the nuclear dealrather than its shortcomingsthat is driving the complaints that have emanated from IranThe United States is not responsible for the hesitancy of international capital and other economic hiccups that Tehran has experienced in the aftermath of the nuclear agreement The culpability resides as it always has with Iran and the risks that its governments policies pose for international business If Iranians want to see their nascent opening to the international community expandedif they want the peace dividend they have been promised they need to look to their own leadership and its policies If Irans Central Bank governor wants normal conditions and access to the US financial system as he demanded during his Washington visit let him return to Tehran and help instill the kind of reforms that would make those goals possibleThere are sensible steps that Washington can take to ensure that the provisions of the nuclear deal are fully feasible including limited mechanisms for enabling transactions such as the repatriation of previously frozen assets that are specifically permitted under the deal Such exceptional measures are reasonablenot because they help Tehran but because they help sustain consensus between Washington and its European partners and help preserve the Wests negotiating leverage with any future targets of American or multilateral financial sanctionsHowever it would be profoundly detrimental for Washington to provide significant unilateral relief to Tehran without reciprocal additional Iranian concessions And the PR blitz by senior US officials to reassure Irans prospective foreign investors has taken on an unseemly tone especially since existing sanctions prohibit US persons from facilitating transactions with Iran by foreign entitiesThese measures may be aimed at building confidence but they ultimately have the opposite effecteroding Irans incentives to abide by the deal undermining any rationale for broader changes Iran remains a risky place to do business and it is in Washingtons interestsas well as those of Iranians and the broader international communitythat Tehran focuses on mitigating those risks rather than seeking to subvert their penaltiesThe nuclear deal is working Irans nascent reintegration into the global economy is intensifying internal debates and popular expectations This is all to the good But to get more Tehran will have to give more
