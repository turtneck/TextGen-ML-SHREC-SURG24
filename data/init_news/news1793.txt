the day Indiana was the unlikely center of the political world  all thanks to a flat tireTrumps plane hit something when it landed Tuesday night resulting in a popped tire according to a source familiar with the process That kept Trump in the state longer than he expected after campaigning with Gov Mike Pence setting off a lastminute scramble of highprofile travelers to the Hoosier State as the clock ticked down on his VP decisionConcerned Trump was unsure and torn about his choice and maybe leaning in a direction they didnt like his children  Eric Don Jr and Ivanka  hopped on a plane early in the morning to reach him Trump and his children wound up having breakfast with Pence at the governors mansionThe plane malfunction set off a domino effect with others Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich flew to Indianapolis to meet with Trump on a private jet provided by Fox News host Sean Hannity two sources with knowledge of the situation told CNN He was later seen leaving a hotel in the same motorcade as Trumps childrenTrump spoke to New Jersey Gov Chris Christie over the phone for a conversation that included talk about the vice presidencyAnd Alabama Sen Jeff Sessions arrived in Indianapolis to meet with Trump to serve as another adviser as the presumptive GOP nominee makes his final decision on a running mateEarlier in the day a Trump spokesperson said the meetings were held in Indiana to allow Trump more time with PenceThe process of choosing a vice presidential partner is a crucial one that often provides early insight into how a nominee might approach the presidency Most presumptive nominees operate their vice presidential search under intense secrecy with potential candidates sneaking to cloakanddagger meetings to avoid the press and maintain the element of surprise ahead of the final announcement But not Trump whose search has been remarkably public over the past weekTrumps search is entering its final phase Paul Manafort his campaign chairman told CNN Wednesday evening that Trump will make his announcement Friday in New YorkTrump later tweeted I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan Details to followThe presumptive nominee has not yet made a final decision But he said in an interview with Fox News Bret Baier that he was trimming his shortlistIm narrowing it down I mean Im at three potentially four But in my own mind I probably am thinking about two he saidTrump has spend the past several days publicly giving potential running mates a trial run on the campaign trail And the feverish endgame of his search suggests a penchant for intrigue an unpredictable streak and  above all  a desire to make a splash as the comings and goings Wednesday triggered a media circusThe lobby of the Conrad Hotel in Indianapolis suddenly became the epicenter of the 2016 campaign  with reporters and passersby straining for a sighting of Trump or any of his possible running mates speculation running rife about the former reality stars intentionsNext door at The Capital Grille local politicians and lobbyists buzzed about what the future held in store for homeboy Pence who rocketed up the list of possible vice presidential nominees after spending significant face time with Trump in the last few daysDonald Trump Jr summed up the whirlwind developments with a tweet Amazing trip to Indiana today Fast but very productiveWith Trumps mind not yet made up the intrigue focused attention on exactly what kind of qualities the GOP presumptive nominee is looking for in a running mateOne of the biggest questions is whether he will opt for someone with a reputation as a partisan scrapper who could defend him in the media and lambast Democrat Hillary Clinton or if he will choose someone viewed as a safer political partner who could bring more sobriety to his volatile campaignOne source said Trump wants a fighter and Christie  the tough talking former prosecutor  fits the billIm getting attacked from all sides Trump told The Wall Street Journal Tuesday Though he was not in Indianapolis on Wednesday Christie one of the first major politicians to back Trump before he captured the nomination is still very much under consideration multiple sources told CNNTrumps gut is Christie one source said The New Jersey governor spent the day in backtoback meetings in Washington as he leads Trumps transition teamTrump spoke of his kinship with Christie with whom several sources said he talks every dayI tell you Chris Christie is somebody Ive liked a long time hes a total professional Hes a good guy by the way a lot of people dont understand that he said on Fox NewsBut on Wednesday Trump told Fox I just want to pick up somebody thats solid whos smart Im not looking for an attack dog Frankly Im looking for somebody that really understands what were talking aboutAnd if Trump wants someone more conventional he could turn to Pence The Indiana governor has credibility with social conservatives who are among the most suspicious of Republican Party constituencies towards TrumpTrump and Pence met privately before a fundraiser in Indianapolis on Tuesday evening and then Pence got a tryout at a rally in nearby Westfield The Trumps and Pences dined together at the Capital Grille in Indianapolis staying past midnightA source close to Pence told CNNs MJ Lee that

aboutWhen CNN asked how the breakfast with Pence went on Wednesday Trump gave a thumbsup An adviser said the encounter was cordial but added that the billionaire had yet to finalize his decision on a

Pence said he was humbled to be a part of the processTrumps giving it very careful consideration he told reporters in Fort Wayne Indiana Im just honored to be on that listEven potential rival Gingrich offered extensive praise for the Indiana governor on Wednesday nightA lot of people who are a little jittery about Donald Trump would feel reassured talking with Pence Gingrich told Fox News My strength is totally different Im an outsiderA Trump adviser however disputed conventional wisdom that Pence could steady or moderate the voluble Republican presumptive nominee on the stump In fact this person said having him as a more temperate running mate could prompt Trump to become even more unconventionalMike is not going to go and defend Trump the way he needs it  the way a Newt or a Christie would or even the way a Sessions has the adviser saidSome donors are pressuring Trump to pick Gingrich as his vice presidentA source close to Sheldon Adelson told CNN that the casino magnate spoke to Trump and said that he liked NewtMarking the unpredictability of the state of affairs Trump was still making calls to people in recent daysTrump even reached out again to Condoleezza Rice the
