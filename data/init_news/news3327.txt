Why Sprott Believes Gold Bullion Is A Mandatory Portfolio Asset Posted on Tweet Home  Gold  Gold News  Why Sprott Believes Gold Bullion Is A Mandatory Portfolio Asset We have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation deflation or economic collapse We view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output stocks and bonds have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself GDP While the Fed may ultimately attempt in December its second rate increase in tenandahalf years it is important for investors to see the forest through the trees and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen From Sprotts Thoughts In our September report we suggested shortterm developments in gold markets often distract investors from more relevant longterm fundamentals providing attractive entry points for the nimblefooted On October 4 we believe just such an investment opportunity materialized in the gold complex The spot gold price declined 4428 on the day 34 and 5 for the week largest weekly decline since September 2013 As is always the case when gold corrects financial media were instantly replete with naysayers forecasting the end of golds 2016 advance In recent days various investment banks have rushed to reduce their price forecasts toward the 1050to1100 range With all due respect to these market participants we would suggest absolutely nothing of substance has changed in golds medium and longterm investment fundamentals What caused the earlyOctober backup in the gold price First hawkish comments on 10316 by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester 2016 FOMC voter were echoed by Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker 2018 FOMC voter on the morning of 10416 Then before noon on 10416 media reports surfaced that the ECB Governing Council was considering tapering its assetpurchase plan later denied and then that the BOJ was contemplating market intervention to weaken the yen A fair number of human traders and algorithmic computers perceived these developments as a potential turning point for globalcentralbank easing policies and sell orders were reflexively generated throughout the gold complex Once bullion penetrated its yeartodate uptrend as well as the psychologically significant 1300 support level technically oriented CTAs and highfrequency traders joined the fray We would suggest these kneejerk trading decisions have presented an especially fortuitous entrypoint for investors contemplating a portfolio allocation to gold and gold equities In short we view the above quartet of earlyOctober news items as little more than jawboning from central bankers stuck in an increasingly awkward policy pickle Desperate to normalize policy after seven years of extended largesse central banks are recognizing that aggregate debt levels remain too ominous and economic growth too fragile to exit from ultraaccommodative monetarypolicy conditions While the Fed may ultimately attempt in December its second rate increase in tenandahalf years it is important for investors to see the forest through the trees and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen At Sprott we have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation deflation or economic collapse We view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output stocks and bonds have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself GDP In essence the decoupling of financialasset valuations from any rational underpinning of productive output portends two future developments which are both supportive to the gold investment thesis First as the financial system rebalances inflated paper claims back toward supporting output gold should provide prodigious purchasing power protection as it has in the past MacroMavens highlights in Figure 1 on the following page that even at todays roughly 2140 level the SP 500 Index still remains 70 lower in gold terms than at its March 2000 peak During the past two corrections in the SP 500 during which the Index declined 5050 32400101002 and 5770 1011073609 gold provided unparalleled portfolio protection We expect the next correction in US financial assets to prove no different The second implication of the contemporary mismatch between paper claims and productive output is inevitable official policy response whenever elevated debt levels weak economic growth or both conspire to destabilize the enormous global debt pyramid Even in the bizarro world of floating exchange rates central bank debasement of fiat currencies is perhaps the most fundamental investment thesis for gold Bloomberg highlighted in an October 16 report that the balance sheets of the 10 largest global central banks now total 214 trillion in assets an increase of more than 10 just from the end of 2015 This aggregate increase accrues largely from the efforts of the ECB and BOJ which together have grown their balance sheets some 21 trillion since 123115 While the Feds balance sheet has leveled off in the vicinity of 45 trillion in recent years we remind readers that the Fed has felt compelled to purchase an average of 48 billion worth of Treasuries and MBS every month during 2016 to replace maturing paper With globalcentralbank printing remaining at such a frenzied pace does the investment case for gold really diminish whenever a central banker floats hawkish commentary or the Fed attempts an annual 25 basis point rate increase We think not Our investment case for gold rests squarely on global monetary and economic imbalances Among the many valuable measures in monitoring the gold investment thesis we have always favored for its clarity the Feds own ratio of Total US Credit Market Debt to GDP Z1 Report As shown in Figure 2 above the ratio of outstanding claims 65066 trillion total debt to output 18437 trillion GDP in the US today stands at 353 barely below its June 2009 peak Contrary to popular belief there has been no aggregate deleveraging of the US financial system in recent years Indeed quite the opposite has been the case Since December 2007 total US debt has actually grown by 16259 trillion an increase of 3332 from 48808 trillion to 65066 trillion Even more eyepopping has been a 4834 explosion in nonfinancial credit from 31213 trillion to 46301 trillion during the same span By way of comparison US GDP has expanded only 4362 trillion during this entire period Demonstrating the levitating effects of QE policies on equities and real estate the Feds measure of total US household net worth has expanded by a mindboggling 31345 trillion or 5431  since yearend 2007 from 57718 trillion to 89063 trillion While we recognize the power of cognitive dissonance in all euphoric investment cycles how can any investor rationalize that a 4362 trillion increase in GDP could support a 31345 trillion increase in household net worth What magic can create wealth seven times faster than output Our answer remains that central banks have fostered unprecedented and unsustainable inflation in financial asset prices To those who view golds portfolio relevance as muted due to the lack of visible CPItype inflation we would suggest they are looking in the wrong place Central banks have enabled absurd decoupling of paper claims from underlying output There is already rampant inflation throughout the financial system Importantly we believe central bank policies of ZIRP NIRP and QE have distorted economic decision making for so long that global economic growth has become remarkably unproductive Every student of economics knows that marginal returns eventually approach marginal costs At zero percent interest rates earnings for all economic agents on average will eventually approach zero Years of malinvestment plummeting capex declining productivity and now an extending trend of declining corporate profits all suggest that the global economy is misfiring on many cylinders Even worse we believe the global financial system has become so dependent on zero percent interest rates that any move toward normalization will have devastating impact on a wide range of financial asset prices We are preparing an expanded strategy report which focuses on themes ranging from the broken nature of Fed models to the persistent decline in productivity trends to the rise of global populism to signs of incipient inflation To those with a high tolerance for dense topics we look forward to sharing this piece in coming weeks As a precursor to this tome we offer one vignette from MacroMavens in Figure 3 below to summarize our views on US economic trends One of the most reliable precursors of employment gains has always been the direction of corporate profits The recently stubborn falloff in corporate profits suggests payroll statistics are about to endure significant stress Hardly an environment for significant Fed tightening This
