Donald Trump voters praise him for telling it like it is But the appeal of his plainspeaking runs much deeperHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueRon Herndon needs more than 10 fingers to count the ways Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rubs him the wrong way not least the billionaires quest for personal aggrandizement via the White HouseSo why is the smalltown barbecue shack owner a registered Democrat likely voting for Mr Trump if he wins the GOP nominationAmerica is at the point where she needs someone who speaks the truth to say what we all think but wont say around strangers says Mr Herndon Sometimes the truth makes you smile  and sometimes it hurtsHerndons view is that America needs a straighttalking president to tackle reallife problems long ignored by Washington It has become a common refrainThe views of this AfricanAmerican pit master suggest that many Americans are curious about Trump not just because he brazenly breaks the rules of political rhetoric but also because the key to tackling Americas problems they say requires people to stop taking offense at the drop of a hatIn that way Trump is the symbol of a broader cultural tension As many Millennials in particular become more militant in their desire to make public discourse inclusive they are coming up against those tired of wars against Christmas or tentative talk about Islamic extremismFor Millennials who have grown up in the language of political correctness speech is a weapon and curtailing words that can be seen as offensive or hateful is a new civilrights frontier But Trumps unfiltered speech encapsulates a potent backlash with many conservative Americans trying to draw the line on how cautious and careful public conversation becomesThe big difference with Trump is his language is not coded says Henry Giroux a political scientist at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario and author of the upcoming book America At War With Itself which largely focuses on the rise of TrumpTrumps words tap into is a nation that really has been suffering particularly since 911 from a kind of national insecurity state mobilized by a massive sense of fear he adds But Millennials see in such language a darkness lurking beneath the surfaceOn Super Tuesday Trump continued his trend of underperforming among voters age 18 to 29 But he did well among New England suburbanites Southern Evangelicals small businessmen and bluecollar workers among othersAt least partly behind Trumps success is the perception that political correctness has morphed into soft totalitarianism wrote James Kalb wrote in Chronicles Magazine late last yearThe domination of public life by PC elites has  made it impossible for ordinary people to assert their complaints publicly in an acceptable way so their objections can easily be shrugged off as the outbursts of ignorant bigots who will in any event soon become demographically irrelevantAntipathy toward political correctness spans a wide spectrum of Americans many whom use the phrase as a pejorativeSeventyone percent of Americans say political correctness is a problem in the United States up 10 percentage points from 2014 according to an August 2015 report by Rasmussen ReportsAt the Pawn Depot situated on a lonely stretch of US 278 in Lithonia Ga that concern is frontofmindElizabeth Langbecker the owner is a Trump fan because he refuses to tiptoe around immigration the economy and terrorismWe need someone who is not afraid to step up to the plate and say what a lot of us want to say she addsShe weighs the Obama administrations efforts to downplay the phrase Islamic extremism against the San Bernardino Calif shootings last year where a Muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 22 others How can we deal with all these problems if we cant even have an honest conversation about the root cause she saysIn the 2016 race political correctness has played out in a number of ways On one hand Hillary Clinton apologized for using the term illegal immigrant as opposed to undocumented migrant But there have been examples on the right too Republican orthodoxy has long held that candidates should not criticize past Republican presidentsTrump has torn that to shredsYes its true that on college campuses theres a lot of silliness about not wanting to offend someone says Alan Abramowitz a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta But its also on the conservative side  which Trump has also been violating  where you couldnt say the Iraq War was a mistake or  that Romney was going to lose the 2012 electionNow those things are being said loudly One difference is a sense of desperation in many rural redstate areasPopulism needs to be a loud message and political incorrectness is high volume says Dave Mudcat Saunders of Roanoke Va The backdrop is not just anger but survival  were in survival mode out here where 93 percent of counties are still in recession A hungry dog will bite your rear I can tell you thatThat desperation has matched the militancy of Millennials looking to reshape the national conversation with the militancy of conservatives pushing back against it The answer says The Atlantics Conor Friedersdorf is to prune political correctness back to its original essenceCitizens who oppose Trumpism are going to have to take a careful look at everything that falls under the rubric of political correctness study the real harm done by its excesses identify the many parts that are worth defending and persuade more Americans to adopt those norms voluntarily for substantive reasons not under duress of social shaming or other coercion he writesWorking on the set of the vampire series The Originals in downtown Conyers Ga last week 20something Michael Sanders says to him political correctness is a force from on high  the media government and academia  that has pervaded his lifeMe and everyone I grew up with have always used the language of political correctness he says When we talk about phrases like illegal immigrant my dad says Thats just the way people used to talk On one hand it enforces common courtesy But there is an appeal he adds to someone who comes out and baldly talks from the standpoint of the worldview that used to be dominantI think many Americans like to hear the language of someone not only willing to complain about the end of white dominant culture but someone who says he can do something about it Thats when political correctness goes out the window
