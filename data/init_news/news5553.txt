 MMR Vaccines Cause 340 Increased Risk of Autism in African American Infants Vaccines do cause autism and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lyi Print Email httphumansarefreecom201611mmrvaccinescause340increasedriskhtml Vaccines do cause autism and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lying about this fact for years according to newly uncovered information As it turns out the CDC fudged some numbers in a 2003 study it conducted on the MMR vaccine that if honestly reported would have revealed   of autism among male African American infantsBut the CDC instead shrunk down the sample size of this study to conceal any possible correlation between MMR and autism in the end publishing what amounts to fraudulent data that has repeatedly be used as evidence that vaccines do not cause autism To the contrary there are major effects of the MMR vaccine that at least three CDC officials who supported the bogus study are now culpable for withholding from the public possibly resulting in untold thousands of cases of autism The Focus Autism Foundation FAF a nonprofit group committed to raising awareness about autism broke the news after speaking with a CDC whistleblower who at first came forward in anonymity but has now been revealed as epidemiologist Dr William Thompson Dr Thompson helped lead several studies including the one in question that were used by the CDC to conceal   autismIn an interview with the FAFs Dr Brian Hooker the father of a child with vaccineinduced autism Dr Thompson broke down the history of deception within the CDC dating back to the days of the Tuskegee experiment which involved government officials withholding treatments from African American men with syphilis as part of a medical experimentAccording to Dr Thompson a 2003 CDC paper on autism which was published in the peerreviewed journal Pediatrics the following year intentionally obscured data showing that MMR significantly increases a childs risk of autism particularly when administered before the age of three And African American boys he says have the highest overall risk Its the lowest point in my career that I went along with that paper confessed Dr Thompson I went along with this we didnt report significant findings CDC has known since at least 2001 that age when MMR is given affects autism risk Dr Thompsons bold confession is rocking the health world a significant portion of which bought into the CDC lie that vaccines do not cause autism case closed In truth the CDC has engaged in a massive fraud against the American people and really the entire world by falsely claiming that scientific data debunks the vaccineautism connection when it actually shows the exact oppositeIt is what famed gastroenterologist Dr Andrew Wakefield tried to tell the CDC and other government officials more than a decade ago only to be slandered and falsely accused of fraud himself But as he explains in a new film top CDC officials had actually vindicated his original findings only to eventually succumb to political pressures seeking to bury all evidence of a connection   Over a decade ago Dr Scott Montgomery and I put forward a hypothesis for MMR vaccine and autism explains Dr Wakefield in the film The age that you receive the vaccine influences the risk This makes sense For some infections like measles the age of infection changes the outcome We shared this hypothesis with vaccine officials A group of senior vaccine safety people at the CDC studied it It panned out We were right By November 9 2001 nearly 13 years ago senior CDC scientists knew that younger age of exposure to MMR was associated with an increased risk of autism In 2004 they published but they hid the results Be sure to watch Dr Wakefields film here  By Jonathan Benson
