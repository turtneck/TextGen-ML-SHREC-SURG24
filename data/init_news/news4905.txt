shorty BY PETER LEE I ve written a couple pieces of the smoking hot issue in Pivotland Philippine president Dutertes swerve toward a proPRC foreign policy and what the US and proAmerican sector of the Manila elite are going to do about it The first piece Reports of death of USPhilippine alliance may be exaggerated addresses the fact that Dutertes freedom of movement is constrained by the need to keep the Philippine military happy and notes that exprez and retired general Fidel Ramos who facilitated Dutertes entrance on the national political stage is signaling dissatisfaction with Duterte The second piece Duterte Plays the Mamasapano Card covers a Duterte counterattack a threat to relitigate the death of 44 Philippine National Police commandos at Mamasapano in Mindanao a 2014 special ops fiasco conducted under the aegis of the United States which a exposes expresident Aquino to serious legal jeopardy b posits that the US alliance is doing a better job of killing Filipinos than the PRC can ever hope to do The US seems to be embedded in a colonial mindset when it comes to the Philippines something along the lines of weve been selflessly looking after the Philippines for a century and that thug Duterte wont be allowed to screw that up during his brief maybe curtailed presidency It takes a pretty superficial view of Philippine history one that accepts the US selfdefinition as the Philippines security savior while ignoring the distortions and shortcomings of the colonial and neocolonial relationship For me this tunnel vision was typified by the US media crowing over the formal delivery of a refurbished C130 transport to the Philippine government by outgoing ambo Philip Goldberg Message heres the US making provisions for Philippine defense at the same time Dutertes selling out the country to China To me the inadvertent message was 1 heres the US blindly stroking the pivot fetish while Duterte tries to solve the Mindanao insurgency that has cost at least 400000 lives over the last century win his drug war and find a place for the Philippines in Asia that doesnt give primacy to the US preoccupation confronting the PRC and 2 the US in my opinion pretty much has a policy of keeping the Philippines flat on its behind as an independent military force by trickling out secondhand gear to the Philippine military while the sweet stuff is dangled in front of it during US joint military maneuvers and port calls But the United States is trying to find political leverage wherever it can and the Western media will Im sure put its shoulder to the wheel to help out Feelings of nationalism are pervasive in the US but Americans have difficulty understanding why people in other nations may harbor animosity toward them on account of their colonialist and imperialist experiences P hilip Goldberg sat down for a 45minute exit interview with Rappler As befitting Rapplers origins in the SorosOmidyar network of proUS globalization advocacy the interview was a stream of softballs about what to do about Dutertes disregard of the awesomeness of the American relationship an awesomeness that is acknowledged by virtually all Filipinos who inexplicably and if the US has anything to do about it temporarily at the same time give Duterte approval ratings of over 80 Its worth watching if you have the patience Goldberg is a smooth cat and the Rappler tonguebath gives you no inkling of the fact that he intimately familiar with the wet work of endarounding national governments to cultivate secessionist movements you know like what he did in Bolivia declared persona non grata as a result and Kosovo and like that thing in Dutertes home province of Mindanao which in my opinion probably the main reason why Duterte wanted him out of the Philippines Goldberg also discretely plays the economic threat card concerntrolling that antiUS attitudes will dismay foreign investors It will be interesting to see how this plays out in subsequent weeks As far as I can tell the biggest US factor in the domestic Philippine economy is the callcenter industry I doubt US corporations are interested in actually pulling their operations out and subjecting them to the Englishlanguage mercies of India but certainly a call from the State Department or White House would convince them of the wisdom of at least making the threat And I also wonder if expected President Hillary Clinton will find it necessary to drop the hammer on Duterte in order to demonstrate to a rather dubious Asia that there is no alternative to loyalty to the pivot I expect the next few months in other words to be very interesting NOTE ALL IMAGE CAPTIONS PULL QUOTES AND COMMENTARY BY THE EDITORS NOT THE AUTHORS
