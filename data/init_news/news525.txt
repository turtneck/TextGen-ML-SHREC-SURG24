Washington CNN The Democratic candidates for president gathered in Las Vegas for their first debate Tuesday and CNNs Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the testThe team of reporters researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate selecting key statements and then rating them True Mostly True True but Misleading False or Its ComplicatedReality check Martin OMalley says US has failed to invest in overseas human intelligenceOMalley said We have failed as a country to invest in the human intelligence that would allow us to not only make better decisions in Libya but better decisions in Syria today Its a huge national security failingGiven the opacity of the available data it is difficult to issue a verdict on OMalleys statement but it is possible to provide some context to what he claimsThe National Intelligence Program requests congressional funding for the intelligencegathering activities of six federal departments the Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National IntelligenceAs a matter of policy the government does not disclose information about the budget of the NIP beyond the aggregate or topline amount requested and the amount approved by CongressThe most recent year for which data on the approved congressional appropriation for the NIP is available is FY 2014 The aggregate amount approved for the year ending March 2015 was 505 billion This amount represents a 3 increase over the previous year which saw an annual NIP appropriation of 490 billion partially due to reductions associated with the sequesterThe amount appropriated in FY 2012 the year during which the attack took place on the US consulate in Benghazi was 539 billion the secondhighest appropriation during the decade 20052014In August 2013 The Washington Post obtained documents from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden regarding the previously undisclosed 526 billion FY 2013 budget and providing a level of detail that had never been released on a previous US intelligence budget The documents indicated that the United States has 107035 employees in the intelligence community Of these the largest employer of civilian intelligence officials is the CIA which had the equivalent of 21459 fulltime civilian employeesAccording to the leaked documents in FY 2013 human intelligence operations consisting of clandestine acquisition of documents and other material collection by personnel in diplomatic and consular posts and official contacts with foreign governments comprised an annual budget of 36 billionWhile specific data on human intelligence operations is not available for other years CNN military analyst Lt Gen Mark Hertling notes that the government has cut human intelligence operations relative to other forms of intelligence collection fueling a major debate in the intelligence community since the 1990sAn additional obstacle to effective human intelligence gathering is the lack of racial diversity within the CIAs own ranks according to CIA Director John Brennan Minorities make up less than 24 of the CIA workforce and only 108 of its top senior intelligence service Brennan noted that in many of the countries that are the focus of the CIAs current work it is harder for white employees and easier for many minorities to operate covertlyChafee said We just spent half a billion dollars arming and training soldiers the rebel soldiers in Syria they quickly joined the other sideThe Obama administration recently announced it was going to suspend the train and equip program in Syria and not take on new recruits while they assessed how to better to improve on the program To be sure the program faced many challenges despite the near 500 million price tag In testimony last month US Central Command Commander Gen Lloyd Austin said only four or five graduates of the program were on the battlefield at that time nine months after the program beganAn initial group of 54 rebels that had been put into northern Syria this summer came under attack by al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat alNusra and ceased to function as a fighting force the Pentagon said last month At least five of those forces were captured by al Nusra but their fate is not clear Pentagon officials told CNN in August that some of those rebels got stuck in Turkey and never actually crossed the border into Syria while others just simply ran away after coming under attack and never came back to regroup with their unitAnd then US officials confirmed last month that coalitionissued pickup trucks and ammunition had fallen into the hands of al Qaedalinked forces in Syria But rather than evidence of rebels joining the other side that equipment was given up in order to gain safe passage according to Central Command spokesman Col Patrick RyderTo suggest that all graduates of the program defected from their ranks to groups opposing the USled coalition is not trueReality check Did Hillary Clinton not have a position on KeystoneClinton said she never had a position on the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline before she said last month that she would oppose itI never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone she saidBut as a member of the Obama administration the thensecretary of state indicated she was likely to support it  though she never said so explicitlyWe havent finish all of the analysis Clinton told the Commonwealth Club in October 2010 So as I say weve not yet signed off on it But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasonsOver the next five years Clinton would repeatedly decline to say what her opinion was while the Obama administration studied the project Last month she finally said I oppose itOMalley made the pitch Tuesday night that he could do better than all the promises made by Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders and others because he had already pushed those priorities into law when he was governorWe raised the minimum wage passed the living wage invested more in infrastructure went four years in a row without a pennys increase for college tuition OMalley saidHe also increased spending on roads and capital projects and succeeded after many years of failed attempts in increasing the states gas tax to pay for those improvementsClinton said I did say when I was secretary of state three years ago that I hoped it would be the gold standard It was just finally negotiated last week and in looking at it it did not meet my standardsNegotiations on the TPP trade agreement began while Clinton was secretary of state but the significant details were worked out after she left that officeIn fact Clinton did not say she hoped the TPP would be the gold standard at the time she said the deal set the gold standardThis TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field Clinton said at an event in Australia in 2012 And when negotiated this agreement will cover 40 percent of the worlds total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environmentNearly three years have passed and Clinton has been out of office for most of that time as talks have proceeded on the important details of the deal As such it is reasonable for Clinton to claim that the deal has changed since she supported it and was involved in its negotiationHowever in some ways the deal has strengthened over the years in areas that Clinton has cited as key concernsClinton now says the deal doesnt do enough to address currency manipulation But the deal didnt include clear language on that topic in 2013 either when critics in Congress were calling for it to be addedShe also says she is concerned about the benefits the deal gives to pharmaceutical companies  which are strengthened under TPP but less than they would have been under the deal in its 2013 stateVERDICT Clintons claim she said she hoped TPP would be the gold standard is false She said it was the gold standard and fully supported the negotiations Her broader point about the deal changing since she left office is True but Misleading The deal has changed in the past three years but in some instances those changes have improved the very deficiencies she citesCNNs Anderson Cooper grilled Sanders repeatedly on whether he was protecting gun manufacturers from lawsuits After some explaining Sanders landed on a simple answer Of course notSanders has been nailed by liberals and his Democratic opponents for his positions on gun control including his decision to vote against the Brady bill and for allowing Amtrak riders to bring guns in checked bags And his comment during the debate sounded like a sharp stance in favor of clamping down on gun manufacturers defending his vote to shield them from litigation as part of a large and complicated billWhere you have manufacturers and where you have gun shops knowingly giving guns to criminals or aiding and abetting that of course we should take action he said Tuesday nightBut in a July interview with CNN Sanders sounded starkly different saying that gun manufacturers could not be held responsible The sole difference was that in that interview Sanders did not say the manufacturer was aware of the crime that would later be committedIf somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the gun do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible he asked Not any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer That is not what a lawsuit should be aboutReality check Bernie Sanders said AfricanAmerican youth unemployment is 51 Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 It seems to me instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration maybe just maybe we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kidsThere is certainly an employment crisis among minority youth But as he has done in the past Sanders may have misspoken when he cited those statisticsThe leftleaning Economic Policy Institute has found that 513 of black and 361 Hispanic high school graduates age 17 to 20 are underemployed That means they either dont have a job arent working as many hours as they would like or arent currently looking for work but would like a jobThe comparable number for whites is 338The official unemployment rate for black youth age 16 to 24 was 207 For Hispanic youth its 127 while for white youth its 103 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics The government data is not limited to high school graduates and has a wider age rangeReality check Hillary Clinton said We have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence This has gone on too long and its time the entire country stood up against the NRAAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there were 33636 people killed by firearms in 2013 the last full year for which data is available That averages to about 92 people a day However the number includes suicides unintentional deaths and incidents with undetermined intent as well as violencerelated firearm deaths homicide and legal intervention In 2013 11675 people were killed in violencerelated deaths by homicide or legal intervention which equates to almost 32 deaths a day The CDC reports 505 unintentional deaths by firearms in 2013 or just more than one death per day They also report 281 deaths where the intent was undetermined in 2013Ninetytwo people did die each day in 2013 from a firearm injury However the number of people killed from violencerelated homicides and legal interventions in 2013 was much lower  about 32 deaths a dayReality check Bernie Sanders said It is wrong today in a rigged economy that 57 of all new income is going to the top 1The top 1 saw their incomes soar 271 during that time period while the bottom 99 got an only 43 bump in income Healthy stock market returns helped fuel income gains among the wealthyBut the good news for the bottom 99 was that 2014 was the first year of real recovery from Great Recession losses Thats thanks to a drop in the unemployment rate from 66 at the start of 2014 to 56 by years end
