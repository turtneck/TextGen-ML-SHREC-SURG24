True Believer Why Donald Trump Is The Choice Of The Religious RightWhen Donald Trump stepped to the podium in a football stadium in Mobile Alabama filled with 30000 people there to hear him spread the gospel of Trump he was overcomeNow I know how the great Billy Graham felt Trump said last monthTrump and Graham the famed Baptist revival preacher and counselor to presidents are not exactly cut from the same cloth And yet Trump is winning over Christian conservatives in the current Republican presidential primaryThats right  the candidate currently leading among the most faithfilled voters is a twicedivorced casino mogul who isnt an active member of any church once supported abortion rights has a history of crass language  and who says hes never asked Gods forgiveness for any of itIf that sounds like an Onion story its not His blunt talk against a broken political system in a country rankandfile evangelicals believe is veering away from its traditional cultural roots is connecting He pledges to Make America Great Again a positive spin on the similar Tea Party refrain of Take Our Country BackThat redeeming message  and his tough talk on immigration foreign policy and the Republican establishment  is quite literally trumping traditional evangelical concerns about a candidates morality or religious beliefsIve come to see somebody thats not scared to say what he thinks and he thinks like I think gushed Joe Smart a security guard who was at a Trump event in Greenville SC last month Hes religious and from what I hear hes going to change the White House back to Christianity I pray every night that our nation will come back to GodIts all left prominent evangelical leaders in disbeliefTrump has made his living as a casino mogul in an industry that preys on the poor and incentivizes immoral and often criminal behavior said Dr Russell Moore head of the influential Southern Baptist Conventions Ethics and Religious Liberty CommissionMoore offered a searingly blunt assessment of the current GOP frontrunner in an interview with NPR Hes someone who is an unrepentant serial adulterer who has abandoned two wives for other women he added Hes someone who has spoken in vulgar and harsh terms about women as well as in ugly and hateful ways about immigrants and other minorities I dont think this is someone who represents the values that evangelicals in this country aspire toWhether evangelical voters  who have been so key to national Republican presidential success  will heed that message or stick with a candidate who seems so anathema to many of their core beliefs will be tested as the campaign wears onFinding Trump Appeal In The Buckle Of The Bible BeltIn the heart of the Bible Belt at a Greenville SC convention center last month  just down the road from the iconic evangelical school Bob Jones University  the line was long to get in to hear Trumps latest sermon against political demonsWhen pressed many in the crowd in the key early primary state said they didnt know about some of Trumps more controversial statements regarding his faithOn whether hed ever asked for forgiveness from God for his sins he told pollster Frank Luntz this in Iowa in JulyHe went on to describe the sacrament of communion this wayAudrey Lindsey of Spartanburg SC said she hadnt heard those comments but believed his later exhortations of his faith He says his favorite book is the Bible Lindsey said and I believe thats what its going to take  good honest Christian people praying for this countryBut Trump who says he ranks the Bible just ahead of his own Art of the Deal has been unable in this campaign to name his favorite Bible verse or even testamentWell I wouldnt want to get into it because to me thats very personal Trump told Bloomberg When pressed he demurred saying I dont want to get into specificsHe said the Old and New Testaments were probably equalSo is Trump one of those good honest Christian peopleThats a question mark Lindsey said Thats between him and God I know people make mistakes and you can change your life Im hoping through this situation that if hes not a Christian hell come to know ChristLarry Linsin of Seneca SC is also willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubtPeople do change if its an honest legitimate turnaround said Linsin who is also considering voting for Texas Sen Ted Cruz someone with long evangelical credentials None of us has a perfect pastI Love Them They Love MeLike with most things Trump is confident about his appeal to evangelical votersI love them They love me he said in a press conference following his Greenville speech I am protestant  I am Presbyterian I love the evangelicals Why do they love me Youll have to ask them  but they doThe polls so far bear that out A national CNN poll out last week showed Trump 32 percent and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson 28 percent as the top choices among selfidentified evangelicalsIn South Carolina a state where nearly twothirds of the GOP electorate identifies as evangelical or bornagain Christians Trump led Carson 33 to 13 percent according to an August Monmouth University poll In Iowa Monmouth had Trump narrowly behind Carson with religious votersIts an astonishing development particularly considering the rest of the Republican presidential field He leads a Southern Baptist minister in former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee two sons of preachers in Cruz and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker plus former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum who won over Iowa evangelicals four years ago to take the first presidential nominating contestBob Vander Plaats an influential evangelical leader in Iowa and president of The Family Leader said many religious voters see a kinship with Trump in his targetsIts not surprising is that the enemy of our enemy is our friend Vander Plaats said Thats the art of political warfare Hes calling out the establishment the media elite and hes calling out a lot of peopleJames Guth a professor of political science at Furman University in Greenville who studies the intersection of religion and politics said he like many have been baffled by the rise of Trump But he echoed Vander Plaats in noting that evangelicals like that hes attacking a common enemy  the GOP establishmentHes quite clearly putting it to the Republican Party Guth said and a lot of evangelical Christians feel like theyve been neglected by the Republican PartyThe Christian Broadcasting Networks David Brody explained it this way in JulyRobert Jeffress pastor of the megachurch First Baptist Dallas wrote that evangelical voters arent under any delusion that Trump believes the same as them Instead theyre just glad hes closer to their beliefs than President ObamaWhen the Christian World Magazine surveyed 94 top evangelical leaders in July about who they support for 2016 Trump was near the bottom of the pack Florida Sen Marco Rubio was their choiceMoore contends that polls showing Trump ahead may be inaccurately identifying evangelicals and not differentiating among people who are committed regular churchgoersThere ought to be a criterion of character for candidates for public office Moore said Someone who has a life and a tenor of life that is so obviously at odds with what evangelicals claim to be their values ought to cause some alarmTrumps lack of support among leaders may be because they are skeptical that hes a true believer In addition to his past support for abortion rights his divorces and inability to identify Bible verses questions remain about his moral conviction on abortion and samesex marriage And there are holes in his story about something as basic as where he goes to churchTrump recently agreed with an interviewers suggestion that a good Supreme Court nominee would be his sister Maryanne Trump Barry a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals But she supports abortion rights Many of Trumps rivals and conservative groups like Concerned Women for America pouncedTrump talks fondly of growing up going to Sunday School at First Presbyterian Church in the Jamaica section of Queens NY When asked by NPR where he currently attends he said he goes to Marble Collegiate Church in ManhattanYet the church says hes not an active memberWhats more Marble Collegiate is part of the Reformed Church in America  typically considered more of a mainline rather than evangelical denomination The church is supportive of gay rights according to its websiteVander Plaats  who backed the Iowa winners in both 2008 Huckabee and 2012 Santorum and will reveal his pick for president around Thanksgiving this year  said he thinks Trump is very genuine He trusts that his conversion on issues like abortion and samesex marriage is realBut Vander Plaats noted that Trumps lack of support for Kim Davis the Rowan County Kentucky clerk who was jailed for not issuing marriage licenses to samesex couples could be a problem for him Huckabee and Cruz on the other hand rallied to her side and stood with her as she was released from jail TuesdayVoters will hold his feet to the fire on a very real issue Vander Plaats said and thats a danger issue for himTrump will hold a gathering of evangelical leaders at the end of the month But its led by Paula White a Florida televangelist who preaches the prosperity gospel  a belief that its Gods will to financially bless devout Christians something controversial in many evangelical circlesCan The Support Of The RankAndFile LastThroughout the summer Trump defied political gravity After each gaffe that would have been fatal for a conventional candidate Trump has instead only soaredThe large field of candidates is helping Trump with evangelicals There isnt one candidate the religious right has rallied around so their support is splitGuth for one is skeptical Trumps appeal can last I think as time goes on many people in the evangelical community will begin to have reservations he predicted Some of that fascination with Trump will eventually wear off once they become more aware of his downsideIt very well could be that as religious conservatives learn more about Trumps positions or another candidate connects as the primaries get closer their support fades But Moore conceded that evangelicals have not always supported the candidate who lines up exactly with what they believe But even of those candidates they were always men who espoused a legitimate moral turnaroundReligious conservatives are credited with fueling George W Bushs 2000 election and 2004 reelection despite his past with drugs and alcohol And one of their heroes is Ronald Reagan who himself was divorcedBush of course is the quintessential redemption story While he never expressed publicly that he was born again he did point to a 1985 conversation with the aforementioned Billy Graham Bush wrote in his 1999 autobiography A Charge to Keep that Graham planted a mustard seed in my soul a seed that grew over the next yearTrump has pointed to no such conversionAs of right now Donald Trump is the incarnation of a bumper sticker Moore said The support for Donald Trump is a way of sending message of anger with the status quo and there are many people angered with the status quo But I dont think that that necessarily translates into people wanting to hand the nuclear codes to that living bumper sticker
