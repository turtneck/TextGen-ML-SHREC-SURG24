President Obama said Wednesday that the administration will be as aggressive as we can on a Texas judges ruling thattemporarily blocked the administrations deferreddeportation program and he will veto any potential congressional vote on whether or not his executive actions on immigration are legalUnfortunately a group of Republican governors sued They found a District Court judge who enjoined but thats just the first part of the process Obama said at a town hall event hosted by MSNBC and Telemundo in Miami This is just one federal judge We have appealed it very aggressively Were going to be as aggressive as we can In the meantime what we said to Republicans is Instead of trying to hold hostage funding for the Department of Homeland Security which is so important for our national security fund that and lets get on with passing comprehensive immigration reformObama continued In the short term if Mr McConnell the leader of the Senate and the speaker of the House John Boehner want to have vote over whether what Im doing is legal or not they can have that vote I will veto that vote because Im absolutely confident its the right thing we doObama said that the administration was not surprised by the ruling byUS District Judge Andrew S Hanen ofTexas Obamacompared his immigration actions to those of George HW Bush which Obama said were not challenged by Democrats for political reasons Obama said that the executive action program is on hold due to the court fight but immigrants should be gathering their paperwork for their deportation relief applications so that they are ready to go after the legal fight is resolvedThe president said that no matter what happens a bill on comprehensive immigration reform must pass Congress because the changes from his executive order will only be temporary until the law is changedWeve got to pass a bill The pressures got to continue to stay on Congress The pressures got to continue to stay on the Republican Party that is blocking comprehensive immigration reform For the next set of presidential candidates  because Im termlimited Michelles happy about that  when they start asking for votes the first question should be Are you really going to deport 11 million people If not whats your plan  Were going to have to keep on the political process on a separate trackObama met with 17 advocates at the White House hours before the town hall inMiamiMarielena Hincapie executive director of the National Immigration Law Center said Obama hopes that the funding issue will be resolved soonso he cantalk about possible immigration legislationwith Boehner ROhio and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy Despite that the president is concerned that this congress will never pass a bill that he could sign into law one that addresses the nations 11 million undocumented immigrants she saidHowever Obama said in Miami that hehasnt given up passing it when Im president  Dont suddenly give up and say Oh we have to wait the next two years  Im not just going to stand still over the next two yearsObama highlighted parts of his executive action plan that were not part of the court orderincluding refocusing border patrol agents on highpriority people including felons not families or people who have been in the country for years or decades Felons not families Obama said when announcing the actions in NovemberHe really wants to lift up the parts of the executive action that havent got as much attention that were not enjoined by the judge said Frank Sharry founder and director of Americas Voice Advocacy groups will also start highlighting that only one portion of the executive actions is part of the rulingThose include refocusing border patrol agents on highpriority people including felons serious criminals and people who recently crossed the border not families or people who have been in the country for years or decadesWhen asked by moderator Jose DiazBalart about the continued number of deportations despite the new policy Obama said it takes time for a huge government to fully changeEvery time you have a big bureaucracy and you change policy there is going to be one or two or three instances where people apparently havent gotten the message But if you talk to the head of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson he is absolutely committed to this new prioritization More important I the president of the United States am committed  Were going to be focusing on criminals were going to be focusing on potential felonsIf for example someone working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesnt follow the policy changes theres going to be consequences to it Obama saidObama said that he has used all the legal power he has to try to change the nations immigration policiesNot only are we going to have to win this legal fight but ultimately were still going to pass a law through Congress The bottom line is Im using all the legal power invested in me in order to solve this problem he saidAttendees said advocacy groups will also stress that young people who receivedtemporary relief under Obamas 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or DACA are not subject to the order and can still sign up and renew their statusWe went into the meeting and left the meeting with the same sense that the president acted within his full legal authority when he announced these initiativesback on Nov 20 and theres an agreement between us Hincapie saidThe administration on Mondayfiled a notice of appeal and motion to stay the decision It argued that the states do not have standing to challenge federal immigration policyThe motion for stay cited the use of prosecutorial discretion where the government uses its discretion to decide how to best allocate resources and apply the lawWhile Hanens order would halt the program nationwide the administrationargued that Texas is theonly State whose claims of harmthe Court credited and if a full stay is not granted the ruling should only apply to TexasJohnson the Department of Homeland Security secretary won support Wednesday from two of his Republican predecessors  Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff  who joined him in warning that a shutdown would hurt the departments ability to protect the homelandRidge the departments first secretary under President George W Bush acknowledged that he strongly opposed Obamas executive orders on immigration which triggered the funding battle I personally believe that the president has greatly overstepped his constitutional authority Ridge said at a news conference with Johnson and ChertoffBut Ridge called it wrong and folly to express that opposition by refusing to fully fund DHS We would not think of not funding our soldiers he said These are soldiers at DHS They wear a different uniform but the goal and objective and mission is the same  keeping America as safe as possibleDiazBalart pressed Obama as to why he didnt push harder for immigration in his first termIt wasnt like I was sitting back not doing anything We were moving aggressively on a whole host of issues We wanted immigration done we pushed for immigration to be done but ultimately we didnt have the votes to get immigration done  I dont regret having done the ACA Obama said referring to the healthcare lawObama said that the changing demographics of the United States will ultimately resolve the issueOver the long term this is going to get solve because at some point theres going to be a President Rodriguez or a President Shin because were a nation of immigrants So what I would say to the next president is think aheadthink longterm Obama saidAfter past contentious meetings with immigration activists the mood was relaxed and advocates felt that they were on the same page as the administrationTheres been a lot of difficult meetings with the president over the years and this was not one of them Sharry said Lots of mutual gratitude and a clear alignment on strategy and tactics and lots of optimismthat were going to win in the courts
