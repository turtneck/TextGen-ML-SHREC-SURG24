Which bulletin was worse though The news in April that he was beingdroppedby WIBC in Indianapolis a booming talk powerhouse that played home to Limbaughs radio show for more than two decades orthe newsthis week that the talkers new address on the Indianapolis dial is going to be WNDE a ratings doormat AM sports station that hasso few listenersit trails the commercialfree classical music outlet in townThe humbling redstate tumble is just the latest setback for the conservative talker who has seen his oncegolden career suffer a steady series oflossesrecentlyDivorced from successful longtime affiliates in places likeNew York Los AngelesBoston and Indianapolis Limbaughs professional trajectory is heading downward Thats confirmed by the second and thirdtier stations he now calls home in those important media markets and the fact that when his show became available general managers up and down the dial passed on it Apparently turned off by the shows hefty price tagsaggingratings anddisappearing advertisers Limbaugh continues to be a very hard sellIts a precipitousfall from the glory days when the host posted huge ratings numbers had affiliates clamoring to join his networkanddictated Republican politics All of that seems increasingly distant now With his comically inflated50 millionayearsyndication deal set to expire next year Limbaughs future seemsuncertain Who would even want someone whose audience is aging and is considered toxic to many advertisersaskedRadioInsight last monthFor Limbaugh the troubles were marked by key events from 2012 and 2013 The first came in the form of Limbaughs Sandra Fluke implosion where hecastigated and insultedfor days the graduate student who testified before Congress about health care and access to contraception calling her a slut and suggesting she post videos of herself having sex on the Internet The astonishing monologues sparked anunprecedented advertiser exodusThe following year as the host struggled to hang on to fleeing sponsors radio industry giant Cumulus Media decided to negotiate its Limbaugh contractin public making it clear through the press that the company was willing to cut ties with the pricey host in major cities where Cumulus owned talk radio stations In the end Limbaugh stayed with Cumulus stations but the company sent a clear signal to the industry Limbaugh was no longer an untouchable and general managers werent clamoring to hire him Since then the talkers fortunes have only fadedAnother looming problem Conservative talk radio is a format fewer advertisers are interested in buying because of its aging audiencenotedradio consultant and selfidentified Republican Darryl Parks Limbaugh himself recentlyconcededa generational disconnect Now that Ive outgrown the 2554 demographic Im no longer confident that the way I see the world is the way everybody else doesThat disconnect may be fueling Limbaughs waning political influence Once a mighty player whose ring wasconstantly kissedby Republicans this campaign season seems to be unfolding with Limbaugh on the sidelines his clout and his ability to drive the conversation seeminglysurpassedby other conservative mediaplayersHeres a perfect example In April Bloombergs Mark Halperin conducted an awkward interview with Republican presidential hopeful Sen Ted Cruz asking the Hispanic candidate about Cuban food and if hed answer at least one question in Spanish Limbaugh immediatelycastigatedHalperins QA on his show but nobody seemed to pay much attention to his complaintsFastforward one week and syndicated conservative columnist Ruben Navarrettelodgedsimilar complaints about the interview ie This was bad journalism bad form and bad manners Except this time the complaint went viral and Helperin was quicklyforced to apologize At BuzzFeed a writermarveledat how Halperins controversial interview had gone unnoticed for nine days But it hadnt gone unnoticed Limbaugh highlighted the interview right away Its just that nobody cared about the talkers critique at the time Limbaughs unfolding majormarket woes will do little to boost his faltering influenceLast yearhe was bounced off a highprofile station in Los Angeles shipped down the dial and deposited on a hasbeen outlet KEIB that today has trouble securing a 10 ratingaccordingto Nielsen ratings Note that his forced farewell from WIBC in Indianapolis was likely painful The station hosted the talker for 22 years before announcing in April it was time for him to go Especially embarrassing for Limbaugh was the fact that WIBC is sticking with its conservative talk radio lineup it just no longer wanted Limbaugh to be a part of it Then after WIBC announced it was dropping Rush no stations in the market stepped forward to pick him up which meant Limbaugh then had to be bailed out by iHeartMedia Formerly known as Clear Channel iHeartMedia owns the syndication company that produces and sells Limbaughs radio show Premiere Radio Networks and iHeartMedia owns hundreds of radio stations So with no Indianapolis takers in sight iHeartMedia was forced to shoehorn Limbaugh onto its own lowly rated allsports channel in the market The station will soon besimulcastvia a new iHeartMedia FM translator signal in the Indianapolis market Theres no way iHeartMedia wouldve placed Limbaugh on an owned Sports station if the company had any other affiliation options in the marketnotedRadioInsight when the news broke on Tuesday But when everyone one else says no and you need to save face options become limited That same desperate scenario is playing out in Boston where Premier hasnt been able to find a new home for Limbaugh This after WRKO announced it was dropping the show One station owner recentlytoldtheBoston Globethat Premiere had offered the Limbaugh show four times and four times the station turned it down Fact Years ago station owners lined up for the chance to pick up Limbaughs powerhouse program Now rumors are still swirling in Chicago that talk radio powerhouse WLS is poised to drop Limbaugh The move was firstreportedin March and quickly denied by WLSs owner Cumulus Media But Limbaughs ratings are clearly down in the Windy Cindy According to a March report in theChicago Tribune Limbaughs WLS show ranks 24thin the market drawing 121000 listeners in a metropolitan area of roughly 10 million people The Chicago rumors come as no surprise to mewroteconsultant Parks as three different Cumulus executives have told me on different occasions they wish they could get rid of Limbaughs show and they cant sell it Ratings and revenue Thats what the radio business has always revolved around These days Limbaughs having trouble delivering either
