Led by conservative Justice and Reagan appointee Anthony Kennedy the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 54 decision in favor of samesex marriage Despite the often binary depiction in the media this decision is in fact a landmark victory for conservative principles In fact Fridays decision is a momentous win for the founding principle of the Republican Party individual libertyConsistent conservatives should frame their views in accordance with the fundamental belief that individuals not governments have the right to determine the course of their own livesFellow conservatives particularly within the Republican Party typically do a good job arguing against totalitarian onesizefitsall approaches to policy What works for a family in New York City might not work in Jenison Michigan or Tulsa OklahomaIt is for this reason that Republicans and conservatives have embraced issues such as school choice which gives parents the right to choose the method of schooling that best fits their childs needs Parents not governments should decide what is best for their familyRepublicans and American conservatives have also been remarkably consistent on taxation Consistent conservatives believe people should keep more of the money they work so hard to earnnot because the vulnerable dont deserve assistance but because individuals can and will make better and more effective financial and charitable choices with their money than government bureaucratsThe list of important conservative positions all relating back to the fundamental principle of individual choice goes on and on property rights freedom of association and freedom of speech etcBut when the topic of gay marriage arises some conservatives have not been consistent The debate on marriage within the Republican Party has been hijacked by those who wish to dictate their beliefs onto others Rather than professing consistent conservative beliefs some within the party have taken to advocating for a remarkably liberal totalitarian approachThis hypocrisy has not been lost on the electorate Millennials possibly the most naturally conservativeleaning constituency laugh at the inconsistencies they hear coming from conservative voices on issues like gay marriageRepublican presidential candidate and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is one of those inconsistent conservatives Walker immediately lashed out at the Supreme Courts decision proposing an astonishingly biggovernment response Walker called for a Constitutional Amendment ensuring that politicians will forever be able to dictate whom one should or should not be able to marry In other words Walker wants to cement the will of politicians into our daily livesWalker has taken a stunningly liberal position As conservative Justice Kennedy wrote in his opinion marriage is a keystone of the Nations social order States have contributed to the fundamental character of marriage by placing it at the center of many facets of the legal and social order Indeed marriage today is as much as it has ever been an important legal contractone which carries with it profound financial and emotional ramificationsWalker and others like him seem to ignore the reallife implications of contemporary marriage instead focusing solely on a religious definition of marriage with which they happen to agreeWalker like many religious conservatives confuse civil marriage with the religious blessing of the church or synagogue In todays society the word marriage means both a government document and a churchs blessing To pretend like there is only one definition is to deny reality Confusing the issue even further politicians have written the word marriage into the tax code where religious conservatives erroneously assume tax benefits refer to their definition of marriageAs Justice Kennedy wrote in his decision samesex couples are denied the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage and are consigned to an instability many oppositesex couples would find intolerable If this constellation of benefits was intended only for those wed under the auspices of the church what right would oppositesex couples married on the courthouse steps have to it The answer is clearly that politicians didnt mean that one must have a blessed union to jointly file their taxesRepublicans who profess their admiration for individual libertyfor the power and freedom of choice and laissez fairemust stay consistentThe only true conservative position the individual right of marriage for all has been affirmed by the Supreme Court Its time for consistent conservatives to come out in favor of the Courts rulingRichard Grenell is a Fox News Contributor He served as the spokesman for four US Ambassadors to the UN including John Negroponte John Danforth John Bolton and Zalmay Khalilzad Follow him onTwitterRichardGrenell
