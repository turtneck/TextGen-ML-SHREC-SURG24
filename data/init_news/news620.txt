Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The root cause of stress is fear as all fear is the threat of losing our attachments If were attached to a desired outcome anything that threatens it will be something we fear The fear of losing control underpins stress for example and creates frustration over what cant be controlled As desirable as it is to be in a position of control our attachment to it ultimately creates a fear that can manifest as stress worry anxiety and panic advertisement  learn more Fear brings disorder into our experience when it is within us and its an energy that suppresses consciousness Activation energy is the force required to get you from doing something when youre on autopilot such as habits routines procedural awareness or relaxing to doing something new It is a manifestation of willpower When we are in a state of fear stress our activation energy is diverted toward doing things to ourselves that are primarily against our will Running late for work and caught in a traffic jam You can either become frustrated and upset because you fear arriving to work late which brings you no closer to your goal of getting there on time or you can accept the present moment and use it as a learning lesson to leave earlier next time You can also choose to enjoy the unexpected free time in the morning and listen to a podcast or some music There are many choices you can make in that space of time that can affect or degrade even the most minute increments of your personal development Stress causes you to divert attention and willpower away from your initial goal bringing you no closer to it than when you began In a state of stress and fear your willpower gets diverted toward the threat not the goal and this is against your own best interest Time is currency so pay attention to what you spend your time on advertisement  learn more Now of course there are valid situations where your willpower MUST be diverted toward dealing with the threat or there might not be any willpower left for you to use in the future There are two types of fear survival based fear and ego based fear Ego fear includes fear of rejection failure humiliation loss uncertainty lack of control etc These fears are not real but may feel so to you Ask yourself whats the worst that could happen Is it death the loss of freedom a loved one suffering If its none of those then youre too attached to an outcome that is not essential to your wholeness When were mindful of our awareness extraordinary things await us on the opposite side of fear Believe Believe in what Yourself A higher power Both Believe in the truth of your situation by first accepting everything that is happening You cant move forward in a state of denial because denial is resistance Then think about what youre afraid of an outcome for example and why it is making you feel afraid What will you lose that is causing your anxiety What is this thing that youre holding onto that is vital to your security and wholeness Fear should be an alarm not a program An alarm alerts you of danger while a program controls and runs the show When ALERTED by fear we can use the logic of our conscious mind to analyze if we are in any real danger rather than allowing the subconscious mind and its primal instincts to impulsively control us Even if we dont lash out during times of stress and frustration we may remain divided and chaotic internally throwing emotional temper tantrums no one else sees Do your job to parent yourself and take control of the inner child embedded in your subconscious mind we all have one Fear is an insecurity and insecurity is the source of many malfunctions in the human condition However if it wasnt for fear we would never know who and what we really are Fear is illusion Life is designed to strip illusion from you by bringing you face to face with your fears again and again until you have no choice but to face them release resistance to them and become fearless Once you become fearless youre free from illusion because you have discovered the truth of whats on the other side of your fear We design our lives to run away from fear so we dont have to feel it but whatever we resist persists chasing us into the corner Its understandable why we do this but its not helpful because this daunting tool that keeps offering itself to us is the tool of our expansion the tool of truth if we are ready to accept it You would be oblivious to yourself without fear which makes it one of the greatest tools of awareness You shouldnt feel ashamed of it regardless of how tough you are every human being feels fear People who suppress fear are glorified Rather than suppress it feel it and come to terms with it This way you wont feel the need to suppress it because you have already gotten to its source truth And the truth will always wipe out fear By suppressing fear youre ignoring your personal lesson We often ignore what our emotional guidance system is trying to tell us because we dont think fear is valid Fear is a red flag within us that we should pay closer attention to so we can dig deep and find the source of that fear Suppressing it is only ignoring the shadow masking it as courage We dont examine the fear that we have instead we try to focus on anything that decreases the level of fear that we experience Sometimes fear is legitimate and sometimes it is not but we must always pay attention to it so we can get to the Truth of why its there Fear of the unknown is also common Since we know nothing about the unkown what we actually fear is whatever we ourselves project into it We think we know what potential negative thing the unknown might hold for us and we are running from the projection of that potential pain We fear what we project into the unknown based on our previous experiences mostly from childhood of uncertainty and discomfort The reptile brain seeks comfort so anything that is uncomfortable alerts our primal survival drives These red flags create anxious moments to our pleasureseeking and painavoiding ego When faced with the unknown the mind goes to work projecting its already acquired fears into the unknown so that it can predict what lies there Its those projections that we fear Its not the unknown of that experience that it fears its what it thinks it knows that experience will create We need to be brave enough to face and admit to what we actually fear This may sound counterintuitive but everything we do regardless of how stupid or damaging it is for ourselves has a positive intention at its core Anxiety responses aim to help us  usually to get us out of a situation to protect us Every behaviour that we generate even if its detrimental to our longterm growth and happiness has a positive intention behind it and recognizing this will allow you to change the behaviour Your subconscious mind wants to protect you but it doesnt think longterm with respect to your growth and happiness it reacts in the present moment and wants to deal with the perceived danger NOW The subconscious is always thinking about whats happening now and how to fix it now It thinks How do I get out of it How do I survive it While your subconscious mind is intuitive smart and integral to the mindbody system it is also deeply irrational and has the cognitive capacity of a 10yearold child Ask yourself would you let a 10yearold run your life We need to educate and guide the subconscious mind using its own language and worldview The subconscious minds job is to keep you happy healthy and safe so when you give it a way to understand that what its doing is hurting you it will stop the behaviour If the subconscious mind has to choose between safety and happiness it will always chose safety Selfpreservation is its primary objective to protect you and keep you alive so you can move your genes forward Do not justify your fear While something could have happened to you that created the fear such as a traumatic event you must still move beyond it It may be difficult but when you justify your fear in whatever terms you remain a prisoner to it You give yourself a reason to hold onto the fear because youre telling yourself that this fear is coming from the outside instead of its true source the inside Once you become aware of something you have the choice and power to change it Your belief systems determine your ability to overcome your fears If you tell yourself I cant overcome this fear you ensure this remains true As long as you believe it it will be True in your reality The perception we have of ourselves is greater than the perception other people have of us Your perceptions will determine how you will react which in turn determines how long the fear will last in your life Facing your greatest fears will be your greatest liberation Your fears are your unresolved issues once you get to the Truth of why they exist you can resolve those issues and stop feeding the fears We must let go of and reexamine what we think is good and bad because our perspective shapes our fears The Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world with varying physical and psychological
