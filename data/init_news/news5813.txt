If Donald Trump were a car he would be a Porsche If he were an animal hed be a lion And people like Porsches and lionsOr at least Walmart moms do according to a focus group of Republican primaryvoting Walmart moms conducted this past week in Pittsburgh by Democratic pollster Margie Omero and Republican pollster Neil Newhouse Walmart moms are defined as women who have children younger than 18 at home and have gone to the store at least once in the past month The focus groups  the two pollsters did another one with swing moms in suburban Philadelphia  were funded by WalmartCharacterizing Donald Trump as a type of car or animal resulted in some fascinating descriptions  from the GOP group women depicted him as a Porsche a Ferrari a muscle car a boxer who stands his ground a bulldog an Escalade a lion fierce and king of the jungle and as an unpredictable cat Newhouse and Omero wrote in a memo summarizing the results These Moms praised him as someone who speaks his mind stands his ground and is refreshingly politically incorrectThe most baffling moments from Donald Trumps Washington Post ed board interviewThe focus group which was split evenly between Trump supporters and those backing another Republican candidate provides a fascinating window into not only how Pennsylvanians view Trump on the eve of the states primary on Tuesday but also into how the real estate mogul is viewed more broadlyThe findings should be comforting for Trump and deeply concerning not only for Sen Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov John Kasich his rivals for the Republican nomination but also for the Never Trump movement within the GOP establishmentThese GOP Walmart moms seem to want no part of the NeverTrump movement Newhouse told me Sunday In fact they respect his strength and his straight talk and believe he is the partys best shot to beat HillaryMost importantly the GOP primary race as seen through the lens of these Walmart moms is effectively Trump vs everyone else Neither Cruz nor Kasich make much of an impression with these women  even this late in the primary processVoters were generally unable to tell us much about either Cruz or Kasich Republican primary voters seemed to dislike Cruz perhaps more than the swing Moms he was generally described in both groups as religious gorilla  almost human or like a neighbors dog  you dont know if theyre going to bite Omero and Newhouse wrote Kasichs image was even thinner I think they like him in Ohio said one too sane or Mild like a kitten said othersThen theres the fact that for all the attention paid to Trumps comments about women during his long life in the public eye the vast majority of these GOP Walmart moms seems strikingly unbothered by his views on womenWhen these GOP Moms were pushed about Trumps gender issues there was some acknowledgment that he may be a sexist but general agreement among these women was that I dont really care Ive seen worse Newhouse and Omero wroteThats an absolutely stunning finding  at least to meThe new Donald Trump should scare the hell out of the GOP establishmentWhen it comes to the broader delegate fight the women in the focus group think Trump is also in very good shape and think it would be deeply unfair for the person who enters the convention with the most votes and delegates not to be chosen as the Republican nomineeId feel terribly misled one woman said when asked about the prospect Cheated another said Not surprisingly this group was equally dismissive about the prospect of House Speaker Paul D Ryan or some other white knight candidate riding to the rescue at the convention If convention turned to someone like Paul Ryan  shows that GOP leaders dont really care about them Newhouse tweeted while conducting the focus groupFinally theres a very strong sense that Trump represents the GOPs best chance of beating Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the fall  despite lots and lots of polling that suggests he would be a decidedly weak nominee against the former secretary of stateThe Walmart moms said they would feel relieved concerned good and optimistic with Trump as the nominee  a remarkable set of emotions toward the business mogul There was no hesitation among the GOP women that Trump could beat Clinton and that they would support the GOP nominee  even if he hadnt been their first choice Newhouse and Omero wroteWith Trump coming off a huge win in New York last Tuesday and almost certainly headed to a fivestate sweep this Tuesday these findings suggest that among the GOP rank and file he is considered far more likely to be the Republican nominee than is commonly understood in Washington  a frightening prospect for party leaders who believe that nominating Trump could be a massive electoral disaster for their sidePittsburghs not that far from Washington DC but these GOP Walmart moms are a world apart from DC in their views on this race Newhouse said Weve long passed Valentines Day but among these women its coming up all roses for Donald Trump
