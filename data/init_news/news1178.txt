52 Views October 31 2016 GOLD  KWN King World News With most markets on lockdown on Halloween trading day here is a big picture view of where the world is headed Stephen Leeb This past week a New York Times headline that caught my eye was At Heart of US Strategy Weapons That Can Think The gist was that over the next few years the US will be spending billions of dollars to make smart weapons while also boosting our cyber budget by billions of dollars It struck me as another example of how anytime we in the US pound our chest about our mighty military we always point to how much money have spent and plan to spend IMPORTANT To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about 8000 gold and the coming mania in the gold silver and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs Michael OHarlan and David Petraeus men with exceptional military pedigrees declare US forces have few if any weaknesses and in many areasthey play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countriesNor is this likely to change anytime soon as US defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States closest competitor China Reassuring words Maybe for a moment But as soon as you think about it they become anything but reassuring showing that even when it comes to our most vital security issues we make the fundamentally flawed assumption that money equates to wealth Ive long been convinced that if the US continues on what appears an ever more inevitable slide historians will point to the day Nixon dropped the gold standard as launching that skid Gold is wealth paper is merely money Money can facilitate the exchange of wealth but by itself it is just paper or entries on a computer ledger and a very poor substitute for wealth Commodities are wealth and many vital commodities as we pointed in a recent interview cant even be purchased any more  period Information is also wealth And no amount of money can guarantee an edge in information A few weeks ago a 15 or 16yearold who had recently become interested in chess wrote a letter to a chess blog asking how much hed need to spend to become a Grand Master  how much for training how much for practice time coaches etc The only possible answer not all the money in the world could turn a novice whos already a teenager into a worldclass player Grand masters have a wealth of knowledge and savvy that cant be acquired once youre much past 7 or 8 years old Youve missed the boat Similarly no amount of money enabled US experts to crack the cell phone of the San Bernardino terrorists But cyber experts from Israel which spends a lot less on cyber issues cracked it with relative ease Israel along with China and Russia are among a number of countries mostly located in Asia that develop the skills of their gifted children at early ages This has left the US a poor second in critical areas ranging from cyber security to super computers which will be the most essential tools in the next generation of a goldcentered monetary system Even nonbelievers should be starting to perceive the inevitability of gold replacing paper A few metrics tell the story First is the relationship between the dollar and economic growth Despite the recent report of betterthanexpected thirdquarter GDP the economys growth has been declining as the dollar has risen In the wake of the Great Recession the dollar traded in a fairly tight range while GDP growth in fits and starts peaked at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014 The higher dollar has held GDP growth to less than 2 percent for the past two years But commodities have begun to rise Most major commodity indexes have climbed 10 percent or more this year Even the temporary setback in obtaining an OPEC agreement wont hold back real goods Recently for the first time since China announced its Silk Road initiative in 2013 a major article on the undertaking appeared in a major magazine Foreign Affairs Gal Luft  a senior advisor to the United States Energy Security Council urged Washington to get aboard or lose out on the chance to benefit from the greatest infrastructure project in the history of civilization many times the size of the Marshall Plan and already the destination of 1 trillion in Chinese exports this year with dramatic growth likely for the foreseeable future But instead were likely to continue to use our dollars in ways that bear ever less connection to real wealth Bear in mind that any effort to hold inflation down will crumble in the face of Western economies even weaker than ours The result is that real interest rates will remain negative an unalloyed positive for gold At the same time the currency used along the Silk Road will be some combination of gold the SDR and the yuan As we have said before Chinas edge in critical information technologies ensures its domination in virtual currencies such as the bitcoin which will have multiple advantages in tomorrows goldbased world How High Will Gold  Silver Trade How high will gold go Much depends on how much trade the Silk Road generates Which means that if think gold could go to five digits you dont need a shrink  youre sane as can be And lets not overlook golds poor cousin which in the end could make you even richer silver The energies of our future will be anchored to solar nuclear and wind The solar anchor will mean that already peaking silver will become some of the scarcest wealth around If youre dreaming of 100 silver your dreams will be coming true before long To me its an ironic footnote to the Nixon years Yes history will record that Americas decline began when the muchmaligned Nixon delinked the dollar from gold and let us conflate money and wealth Meanwhile though you can make a fortune on the coming bull market in gold that will be the direct result of that decision   The Coming Super Depression   Cyberwars 10000 Gold  1000 Silver CLICK
