House Republican leaders have unveiled a tentative twoyear budget agreement with the Obama White House aimed at preventing a partial government shutdown and forestalling a debt crisisThe text of the deal was posted to the House Rules Committees website late Monday setting up a final debate and vote on the plan Wednesday Sources told Fox News the House GOP leadership will likely require the support of almost all House Democrats and between 90 and 100 Republicans to see the agreement throughThe measure was to be discussed further at a GOP meeting Tuesday morningThe budget pact coupled with a mustpass increase in the federal borrowing limit would solve the thorniest issues awaiting Rep Paul Ryan RWis who is set to be elected Speaker of the House on Thursday However sources told Fox that conservatives opposed to Ryan as speaker may use the proposed budget as a reason to vote against the House Ways and Means committee chair Not enough members were expected to defect to imperil Ryans ultimate electionThe deal would also take budget showdowns and government shutdown fights off the table until after the 2016 presidential election a potential boon to Republican candidates who might otherwise face uncomfortable questions about messes in the GOPled CongressCongress must raise the federal borrowing limit by Nov 3 or risk a firstever default while money to pay for government operations runs out Dec 11 unless Congress acts The emerging framework would give both the Pentagon and domestic agencies two years of budget relief of 80 billion in exchange for cuts elsewhere in the budgetOutlined for rankandfile Republicans in a closeddoor session Monday night the budget relief would total 50 billion in the first year and 30 billion in the second yearLets declare success House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy RCalif told Republicans according to Rep David Jolly RFla as the leadership sought to rally support for the emerging dealA chief selling point for GOP leaders is that the alternative is chaos and a standalone debt limit increase that might be forced on Republicans But conservatives in the conference who drove Boehner to resign were not ready to fall in lineThis is again just the umpteenth time that you have this big big huge deal thatll last for two years and we were told nothing about it and in fact even today were not given the details said Rep John Fleming RLa And were probably going to have to vote on it in less than 48 hoursIm not excited about it at all said Rep Matt Salmon RAriz A twoyear budget deal that raises the debt ceiling for basically the entire term of this presidencyThe agreement was panned by two prominent conservative groups Heritage Action and the Club for Growth The two organizations issued a joint statement saying the deal was brokered by a lameduck speaker and a lame duck president and represents the very worst of Washington  a last minute deal that increases spending and debt under the auspices of fiscal responsibilityThe measure under discussion would suspend the current 181 trillion debt limit through March 2017 The budget portion would increase the current caps on total agency spending by 50 billion in 2016 and 30 billion in 2017 offset by savings elsewhere in the budget And it would permit about 16 billion to be added on top of that in 2016 classified as war funding with a comparable boost in 2017Among the proposed spending cuts are curbs on Medicare payments for outpatient services provided by hospitals that have taken over doctors practices and an extension of a 2 percentagepoint cut in Medicare payments to doctors through the end of a 10year budgetThe budget side of the deal is aimed at undoing automatic spending cuts which are a byproduct of a 2011 budget and debt deal and the failure of Washington to subsequently tackle the governments fiscal woes GOP defense hawks are a driving force intent on reversing the automatic cuts and getting more money for the militaryThe focus is on setting a new overall spending limit for agencies whose operating budgets are set by Congress each year It will be up to the House and Senate Appropriations committees to produce a detailed omnibus spending bill by the Dec 11 deadlineTheres also a drawdown from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reforms to crop insurance and savings reaped from a Justice Department funds for crime victims and involving assets seized from criminalsThe legislation also would clean up expected problems in Social Security and Medicare by fixing a shortfall looming next year in Social Security payments to the disabled as well as a large increase in Medicare premiums and deductibles for doctors visits and other outpatient careThe deal which would apply to the 201617 budget years resembles a pact that Ryan himself put together two years ago in concert with Sen Patty Murray DWash that eased automatic spending cuts for the 201415 budget years A lot of conservatives disliked that measureIt is past time that we do away with the harmful Draconian sequester cuts said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid DNev We must also ensure that there are equal defense and nondefense increasesThe deal would make good on a promise Boehner made in the days after announcing his surprise resignation from Congress last month He said at the time I dont want to leave my successor a dirty barn I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets thereSome of the more moderate Republican members welcomed the emerging deal and applauded BoehnerThe outline that was presented seems like a path forward said Rep Charlie Dent RPa He said he was going to try to clean the barn and this is a good startFox News Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report
