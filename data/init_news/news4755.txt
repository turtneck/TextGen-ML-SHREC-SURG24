Another GOPdebate another steaming pile of halftruths lies and pseudofacts The Republican Party seems to be almost entirely posttruth at this point and if you call them out youre the liberal media Its a brilliant racket and one that led us to the current state of affairs where facts arent just dispensable but a political liability Without further ado here are the top lies and distortions from tonights debateA popular refrain in the wake of the Paris and San Bernadino attacks is that the US government or more specifically President Obama cannot properly vet Syrian refugees This has been repeatedly debunked as hysterical posturing yet remains a popular trope among the far right In addition to a ratherthorough takedownby John Oliver two weeks ago PoliticoFact rated this claim Mostly False in itsdetailed analysisthis eveningThis is an old canard and one that even nominally lefty outlets like Vox like to push but it has little to do with reality In an effort to shore up his neocon credentials Rubio has doubled down on regime change in Syria while other GOP candidates like Paul and Cruz  as well as Bernie Sanders  have run away from this position To do this Rubio has pushed the conspiracy theory that the reason ISIS grew in Syria is because the US didnt back the rebels opposed to Assad when in fact the CIA according to documents revealed by Edward Snowden spent1 billion a yeararming funding and assisting the oppositionA popular trope among the nativist wing of the Republican Party aka the Republican Party the bogus stat that 25 of Muslins support violence is thrown around quite often But it originates from noted Islamophobicthink tank Center for Security Policy As theNew York TimesnotesMr Trump vouched for the group at a rally on Monday night But the poll  conducted by thePolling Company a Republican firm  is in no way truly representative of all Muslim Americans because of its methodology The poll was not based on a random sample but included only people who chose to participate and therefore is not representative of the population being studied In addition some of the questions were leading and biased4 Chris Christie insists he was appointed US Attorney on Sept102001Why does Christie keep repeating this lie Its been debunked several times and its a matter of public record Its a great soundbite to be sure and if true would put Christie in the heart of the most significant foreign policy crisis of the past 20 years But the reality is that George W Bush nominated Christie on Dec 7 2001 as one can clearly see from a White Housepress releaseGeroge W Bushdeported 18 million people Obama deported 2 million Its unclear where Cruz is getting this number from 6 Donald Trump keeps saying he selffunds but we know thats demonstrably false This is another assertion thats completely disproven and easily searchable online which raises the question of why CNN hasnt bothered doing this Trump has received according to the last available FEC filingsupward of 39 millionfrom individual donors compared to using only 101000 of his own money How does this fit with his selffunded narrative Its unclear but perhaps a more urgent question is why would any sane persondonatemoney to someone who claims to have over 10 billion 7 Moderator lie CNNs Wolf Blitzer claimed terrorism fears are higher than theyve been since 911 Thats not true A recent Gallup poll shows terrorism fears have spiked recently but arethe sameas in 2005 and nowhere near as high as after 911 8 Lie by omission Why was the attack on Planned Parenthood not mentioned in a debate about terrorism As Sean McElwee of Demosnoted in a debate that was nominally about terrorism nonMuslim terrorism was completely absent The recent Planned Parenthood terrorist attack carried out by a man whoclaimsto be a warrior for babies wasnt discussed in the broader context of terrorism Why this is so remains unclear 9 Lie by cliche What the hell is Fiorina talking about Fiorina keeps referencingbuilding up the sixth fleet because presumably it sounds like some important walkandtalk dialogue in the West Wing but itactually makes no senseSeveral expertshave chimed in on this strange refrain and pointed out that its basically nonsense As military magazineStars and Stripesnoted Her meaning wasnt immediately clear  the US 6th Fleet is less a collection of ships than a command structure for operating American warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Moreover the fleet is one of the few growing military commands in Europe It is building landbased missile interceptor sites in Romania and Poland and in the coming days it will welcome the last of four guidedmissile destroyers to arrive for permanent stationing in Rota Spain As theLA Times notes its not giving 150 billion to Iran its relieving sanctions that will ultimately unfreeze more than 150 billion in assets to Iran but the funds were already Irans to begin with No one is giving Iran anything
