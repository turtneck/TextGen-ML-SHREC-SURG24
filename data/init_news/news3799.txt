With gas prices dipping to their lowest level in years lawmakers in state capitals throughout the USA are increasingly open to the idea of raising fuel taxes to help rebuild crumbling roadways and bridgesThe movement at the state level comes as House Speaker John Boehner ROhio said last week that hes doubtful that there will be enough backing for a bipartisan push to raise the federal gas tax which has stood at 184 cents per gallon since 1993The Obama administration has also declined to endorse raising the federal gas tax to finance road funding but says it will take a look at anything Congress comes up withState legislators and governors however arent waiting for WashingtonRepublican leaders who typically find talk of raising taxes a nonstarter are making the issue a priority in 2015 even though polling consistently has shown broad opposition among Americans to fuel tax hikesThe states have shown that they are more likely to act on the gas tax than the federal government is said Carl Davis a senior policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a research group in Washington The states have to balance their budgets If they see their roads are in bad shape or their bridges are literally falling downin some casesthey need to come up with a way to pay to improve that And theres a limited number of things you can do at the state levelThe increased chatter in state capitals about raising fuel taxes comes after eight states Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia and Wyoming have done just that over the last two yearsSouth Dakota Gov Dennis Daugaard noted in his State of State speech on Tuesday that when South Dakota last raised its fuel tax 16 years ago the price of gasoline hovered around 1 per gallon and about 22 of that went toward state fuel tax The average price for regular unleaded gas in South Dakota is 199 per gallon and the national average is 208Meanwhile the price of road construction has ballooned In 2003 the state could get buy about 78 miles of asphalt overlay for 1 million In 2013 that same amount of money could pay for 45 miles of asphalt overlayOur state highway system is the states most valuable physical asset and if we want to maintain it we must act now said Daugaard a Republican who proposed raising the fuel tax by 2 cents per gallon in 2015 and an additional 2 cents each year going forwardIn Iowa Republican Gov Terry Branstad and Iowa lawmakers have tossed around raising the 22 cents per gallon fuel taxwhich has remain unchanged since 1989or potentially allowing voters in each county to vote for a 1 sales tax The increased revenue would stay in the counties that levy such taxes to be used on road improvementsI think Iowans like the idea of having some say on this Branstad told reporters last weekRepublican leaders in Utahs legislature have also signaled they will take a look at the states gas tax which hasnt been raised since 1998 as they try to grapple with a transportation funding shortfall thereIn Louisiana the states Transportation Funding Task Force has forwarded a number of ideas to lawmakers Louisiana has a backlog of 12 billion in road repairs Among the ideas are to replace the state gas tax with a sales tax on all fuels direct more money in the construction budget to road work and steer dollars to highways that would end up in the states rainy day fundThe intense debate on the gas tax in New Jersey could have ramifications for Gov Chris Christies potential 2016 White House bid A Garden State trust fund that pays for road and bridge repair is on the verge of bankruptcy and some lawmakers in Trenton are pushing for an increase in the states gas tax to replenish itGoing along with that idea is a tricky proposition for Christie who could find himself trying to show his conservative bonafides with Republican donors and primary voters many who see any increase in taxes as toxicThe idea of raising the state gas tax is also unpopular with New Jersey motorists who enjoy one the lowest gas taxes in the country Fiftysix percent of residents said they oppose a raise in the states gas tax compared to 41 who support it according to a RutgersEagleton poll published in DecemberOne proposal thats been floated by Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski would increase the state gas tax by 25 cents per gallon costing the average New Jersey motorist about 292 more per yearChristie did not address the gas tax or transportation funding issues in his muchanticipated State of the State address on TuesdayIn Georgia lawmakers are taking a hard look at the states 4 sales tax and the 75 cents per gallon excise tax as traffic congestion has become a bigger problem for the stateA study committee recently found that the state needs to raise at least 1 billion more a year to repair bridges and roads in the Peach StateMichigan is taking a different tact The GOPcontrolled legislature there approved a plan last month for a ballot initiative to boost the sales tax to help pay for road repairsMichigan Gov Rick Snyder signed legislation on Monday to spend 13 billion a year more to fix roads and other transportation infrastructure but its contingent on Michigan voters increasing the state sales tax from 6 to 7 in the May 5 ballot initiativeMeanwhile in Tennessee Republican Gov Bill Haslam has warned that the state has to do something soon to deal with its crumbling infrastructure The gas tax hasnt been raised there in nearly 26 yearsAt some point and time soonI think there will be a bill about gas tax Haslam recently told The Tennessean editorial board  Its incumbent upon us as the administration to show heres what we would do with that money if you increased the fuel tax and then its also I think important for all of us not to just increase it so that  three years from now were back in the same position
