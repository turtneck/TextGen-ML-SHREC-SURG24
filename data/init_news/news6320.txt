Posted on November 4 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith The overwhelming consensus of the punditry across the political spectrum is that Nothing Good Can Come of This Electionand thats a very good thing The handwringing goes like this The country is deeply divided by schisms that cannot be bridged every institution from the two parties to the mainstream media to the Department of Justice has been tarnished by coverups collusion or worse whomever wins the election will enter the presidency without a mandate and so on Why is nothing good can come of this good Because ridding the nation of its political corruption will require hitting bottom Just as an alcoholic or drug addict is incapable of making any truly positive changes until heshe hits absolute bottom so it is with our tolerance of a corrupt political system that is poisoning the nation one injection of corrupt cash collusion and paytoplay at a time If our rottentothecore politics as usual is indeed flying off the cliff to complete destruction that is an unalloyed good Just as alcoholics continue down their selfdestructive path with the aid of enablers so too has the corrupt political order expanded with the aid of the Mainstream Media insiders in the Department of Justice K Street lobbyists and a veritable army of wellpaid lackeys pundits academics apparatchiks and assorted toadies in the organs of governance and in the bigmoney private sector and philanthrocapitalist dynasties of paytoplay foundations The only way anything will truly change in the political order is if every Establishment insider politico loses every election from the presidency to dogcatcher Nothing will change until the mere existence of a private foundation like the Clinton Foundation triggers a landslide loss for the politico with ties to such corruption Nothing will change until the collusion of the mainstream media supplying the insider candidate with debate questions etc alone causes the colluding candidate to lose by a landslide Nothing will change until candidates who refuse to accept any donation larger than 100 from anyone or any entity beat the Goldman SachsSaudi princefunded insider candidates by a landslide Nothing will change until candidates who fund costly negative TV advertising campaigns with millions in paytoplay contributions from Goldman Sachs et al lose by a landslide You get the point we the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption We have to stop being bamboozled by insiders with promises of hope and change and the usual negative TV blitzes funded by corrupt big money Its easy to blame lax campaign laws or the corrupted candidates and their insider toadies but ultimately were responsible for enabling corruption collusion payforplay and a political and financial Elite thats above the law From the point of view of the corrupted colluding insiders MSM flunkies Department of Justice lackeys and wellpaid parrotpundits nothing good can come from this election because half the voters may actually cast off the shackles of the nations corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites This mass rejection of the politics as usual of corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites is the highest possible good a public good that eludes the handwringing corrupt insiders pundits and toadies who have sucked up fortunes from the trough of putrid systemic corruption
