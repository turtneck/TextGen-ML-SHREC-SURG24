The first time the Affordable Care Act came before the Supreme Court its constitutional foundation under attack John G Roberts Jr was its unlikely savior In a spectacular display of spotwelding the chief justice joined fellow conservatives on some points and brought liberals on board for others Roberts was the only member of the court to endorse the entire jerryrigged thing and even he made sure to distance himself from the substance of the law It is he wrote not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices Still his efforts rescued President Obamas signature achievement on grounds that many had dismissed as an afterthoughtAs long as Justice Anthony M Kennedy is on the court he will most often be the decider when the justices split along their familiar ideological fault lines But slowly and quietly Roberts is the one trying to build its legacy He sees it as somehow exempt from the partisan fugue that long ago enveloped Washington Justice Stephen G Breyer has worried that the public might see him and his colleagues as nine juniorvarsity politicians public approval of the Supreme Court is falling But while all of the justices bristle at the notion of a political court the eponymous head of the Roberts court has the most to lose After all its decisions cannot be respected if the court is not respected It is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them Roberts said at his 2005 confirmation hearingsRoberts 60 jokes about the odd historical quirk that gives the chief justice only one vote But he has learned to use the tools that come with the job He shapes the discussion at conference he writes the courts opinion or assigns it strategically when he is in the majority hes happy to settle for nonthreatening incremental changes that may bloom later into something more And last term what Roberts has described as the chief justices particular obligation to try to achieve consensus paid off The share of unanimous decisions soared to 66 percent a level not seen since the 1940s The share of 5to4 decisions high during Robertss tenure compared with those of other chief justices fell to 14 percent the lowest since he joined the courtAnd then here comes Obamacare II In King v Burwell  to be argued Wednesday plaintiffs say the text of the law must be interpreted in a way that would neuter it canceling health insurance subsidies for about 75million Americans in at least 34 states Can Robertss portrayal of the Supreme Court as above politics survive another round with the most partisan issue of the decadeRoberts of course has not ceased to be a conservative Before Obamacare  or since  its hard to think of a case in which he has not voted the way conservative activists had hoped when they recommended him to President George W Bush The Roberts court has been described as the most probusiness in history Its liberals complain that consumers are on a losing streak and that the court has imposed new roadblocks for those trying to prove discriminationAnd when the issue is important to the chief justice or when there seems to be no chance for compromise he has been decisive In a suite of cases for instance the court has systematically dismantled campaign finance restrictions calling them hostile to free speech rights  Citizens United v Federal Election Commission being the most famous of several 5to4 votes Roberts wrote the majority opinion in the most recent which featured the Republican National Committee as a plaintiffHe has also forcefully opposed the governments use of racial classifications and he wrote to strike down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act Roberts unlike Kennedy or even Justice Antonin Scalia had never been the lone conservative to join the courts liberals to make a majority in a major case  until the Affordable Care ActYet chief justices tend not to see the court as a vehicle for advancing their unadulterated ideas A transformation came over Robertss predecessor and mentor William H Rehnquist after becoming chief As an associate justice Rehnquist wrote so many solo dissents that his clerks awarded him a Lone Ranger doll But like chief justices before him in his new role he felt a responsibility to guard the courts precedents and image The most famous example is his metamorphosis on the Miranda rule requiring police officers to read suspects their rights For years Rehnquist had denounced the rule as constitutionally unsound But after his ascent he voted to uphold it saying the warnings have become part of our national cultureRoberts came to the court as chief so there is no similar evolution to judge But those who know him say his vision of the responsibilities of the chief is paramount Associate Justice Roberts would be much closer to Scalia than Chief Justice Roberts is in terms of their approach to cases says one lawyer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he argues Supreme Court cases Anticipating this approach Roberts pledged himself to the principle of stare decisis at his confirmation hearings and preached a gospel of judicial modesty saying he came with no agendaWhile he cant change Washingtons partisan warfare Roberts does what he can to avoid becoming a weapon in it those who know him say Unlike his colleagues he does not give interviews He avoids partisan gatherings such as the Federalist Societys annual gala where Scalia and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr take turns providing the afterdinner remarks or the American Constitution Society where Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor have been honored Even the bipartisan Gridiron Dinner where the nations political elite gather for gentle roasts may have proved too much for Roberts Theres always a seat at the head table for the chief justice of the United States but this one hasnt attended since 2009His protection of the courts image extends to his colleagues In the first Affordable Care Act case conservative activists and pols demanded that Justice Elena Kagan recuse herself because of her work as Obamas solicitor general while liberal groups called for Thomas to step aside because his wife is a prominent conservative activist Roberts without specifically mentioning either tried to shut down those complaints in his annual state of the judiciary report that year I have complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted he wrote They are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a rigorous appointment and confirmation processBut the consensus compulsion is clearest when the court issues narrow opinions With Obamacare for instance Roberts bobbed and weaved agreeing with conservatives that Congress had exceeded its power to regulate interstate commerce but also siding with liberals to save the individual mandate by calling it a tax In the last term narrow rulings made it possible for the court to unite at least on the bottom line in striking down abortionclinic buffer zones in Massachusetts and rejecting efforts to restrict classaction suits alleging security fraudHis efforts are not universally revered John Roberts Thy Name Is Traitor one conservative news site blared after the Obamacare decision Glenn Beck offered Tshirts with Robertss smiling face and the word COWARD underneath John Yoo a former Justice Department official in the George W Bush administration wrote that this coming weeks challenge gives Roberts a chance to atone Scalia a frequent Roberts ally once mocked Robertss faux judicial modesty And in last terms case on the buffer zones he dismissed the chiefs majority opinion as Something for EveryoneRoberts insists that the nations poisonous political climate rather than anything the justices have done is to blame for damage to the courts reputation But he lives in a universe with a gridlocked Congress a combative president who calls out the court at his State of the Union address and colleagues identified as often by party affiliation as by their judicial philosophies Todays partisan split while unprecedented is likely enduring says a study of the court by professors Neal Devins of William  Mary and Lawrence Baum of Ohio State A fivemember Democratic Court will reach sets of decisions that are quite different from those of a fivemember Republican CourtPerhaps then political tensions are simply inescapable But paradoxically the court is hard to characterize precisely because of its close balance The Roberts court has found rights for Guantanamo detainees ruled that the Second Amendment secures an individual right to keep guns handed gay rights activists some of their most important victories drastically cut back on the ability of legislatures to restrict campaign contributions and narrowed the options for punishing juvenile defendants Alternating liberal and conservative victories on this terms two most important cases  gay marriage and health care  offer similar chances for balance when the justices complete their work this JuneThe courts conflicting messages usually depend on Kennedy siding either with the conservative justices or the liberal ones But about twothirds of the time the Reagan appointee finds his natural home on the right And while such snapshots can be misleading in the last term Roberts agreed with Kennedy more than any other justice did Kennedy was on the winning side in more opinions than any of his colleagues Roberts was right behindThis hardly means that either side sees the court as a neutral arbiter Most liberal analysts praised Robertss first Obamacare decision but some forecast that his reasoning would be used to secure conservative victories in the future Others speculated that it gave Roberts cover to move on to issues about which he felt more strongly They felt vindicated a year later when he sided with his conservative colleagues and wrote the 5to4 opinion striking down a crucial component of the Voting Rights ActRoberts appears to know this At an appearance at the University of Nebraska law school last fall he talked about how gridlock between Obama and congressional Republicans means collateral damage for the nine justices too I dont want it to spill over and affect us he said We are not Democrats and Republicans in how we go about it and in nine years Ive never seen any political issue like that arise between us He worried that the nearpartyline confirmation of somebody as eminently qualified as our newest member Kagan could suggest that people perceive the court too as a political bodyIt is a perception that despite Robertss zealous labors the court could soon reinforce at least on the left A 5to4 decision invalidating the premium tax credits in King v Burwell would seriously call into question the legitimacy of the court Tim Jost a Washington and Lee University law professor and healthcare expert said in a video distributed by the liberal Center for American Progress I think its going to be decided pretty transparently for political reasonsFollow our updates on Facebook and
