A documentary about campus rape contains the damning stories of many victims But what about the alleged perpetratorsOf course the next four years will see considerably more crying over peer pressure soured romances lessthanexcellent grades and horrible cafeteria food But the dangers sketched in this documentary facing young women on campus are far graver than the ordinary stuff of growing painsthey revolve around sexual assaultThe stories in the documentary are brutally evocative Two of us were sexually assaulted before classes had even started says Annie Clark a former student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill You just stay there and you hope you dont die says Andrea Pino another former UNC student of being raped during her sophomore year at a fraternity party Clark and Pino both filed federal complaints against UNC and have become leading activists in the fight to end campus rapeHighprofile alleged campus rapes have led the news agenda in the last year Emma Sulkowicz a senior at Columbia University has become the face of the movement with her Carry That Weight performance art activisma pledge to haul her mattress around campus as long as her alleged assailant Paul Nungesser remains at the schoolWhile there is little dispute that sexual assault is being poorly handled by universities not everyone agrees on how schools are attempting to remedy the situation Many are concerned that the refurbished systems to adjudicate campus sexual assault are kangaroo courts where the accused is presumed guilty until proven innocenteven when theres no evidence beyond hesaidshesaid reportsThe Hunting Ground presents one side of this fraught debate and a very powerful and disturbing one at that It features interviews with dozens of young women and a few men who recount horrifying details of their sexual assaults and subsequent lack of concern from school and law enforcement authoritiesIt does not feature testimony or representation from the victims alleged attackers or any voice dissenting from the narrative focus that campus rape has become something of an epidemic which is either being overlooked or appallingly dealt with by authoritiesIn the film Kinsman says she had a drink at an offcampus bar one night and is fairly certain there was something in that drink because she woke later to Winston raping her She claims both the school and Tallahassee police failed herThe filmmakers dont mention that two toxicology reports following the alleged rape found no drugs and little alcohol in her system Nor do they note that at a hearing in December Kinsman didnt say she had been drugged or unconscious This isnt to say the attack didnt happen but merely the documentary might have made clear the full array of evidenceThe movie has succeeded on this frontNew Yorkmagazine film critic David Edelstein who is planning college visits with his daughter a junior in high school wrote in his review that he found myself jottingrape schoolnext to several of the candidatesThese documentaries are never unbiased If they were they wouldnt be as emotionally compelling In Blackfish a heartbreaking documentary about the mistreatment of killer whales at Sea World and other water theme parks Sea World is the cruel moneygrubbing man in the suit Surely some who have worked with killer whales there would disagree but their testimonies dont fit the documentary narrativeAs compelling as The Hunting Ground is it perpetuates a panic about the campus rape crisis that distracts from a rational assessment of the issue It would have done better to expose its villains in front of the cameraand let them hang or convincingly defend themselves
