Donald Trump is running a relatively lean campaign machine and despite pledges to selffund so far has been able to rely more on outside donations than his own deep pocketsCampaign finance filings this week offered a glimpse into how the billionaire businessman is running his breakingthemold campaignThe third quarter report showed that Trump raised 39 million over the period between June 30 through Sept 30 Of that 28 million came from individual donations of 200 or less In addition hes put up about 19 million of his own money in loans and contributions since officially launching his bid in midJuneThe totals show hes raised 58 million and spent 54 million to date  which means hes spent more contributor money than his own moneyTrump though repeatedly has said his campaign does not want to be beholden to bigmoney donors So whether he will eventually have to dig deep into his personal fortune remains to be seenThere is a general perception that he has all the money he needs however hes spending less  he hasnt had to open his wallet  because of all the attention hes received said Anthony Corrado professor and campaign finance expert at Colby College in Maine His standing in the polls has allowed him to essentially ride this wave of supportWhile Trump is not doing highdollar fundraising events like other candidates his website solicits donations all the way up to the individual limit of 2700 Much of his financial support is coming in this way and appears to be going a long way as Trump spends and raises far less than his competitorsThe money mostly has been spent on travel lodging telemarketers event staging and campaign consultants in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa New Hampshire and South CarolinaThe Trump Campaign will continue to accept small dollar donations as people across the country proudly invest in Mr Trumps vision to Make America Great Again the campaign said in a statement following the public filing of the FEC numbers ThursdayCorrado noted that this was reminiscent of Ross Perot who selffinanced but asked people to send in five dollars just to have skin in the gameTexas billionaire Perot spent 635 million of his own money to wage a formidable thirdparty race for president in 1992Trump told Fox News this week that he only spent a couple of million on his campaign so far and zero on advertising due to all the free air time he has received Ive spent the least money and Ive got the best poll numbers This is a tribute to business he saidTrump has been the poll frontrunner in the GOP pack for weeks despite spending less than his competitorsRepublican candidate Sen Ted Cruz took in 123 million in the third quarter but also has spent nearly 18 million to date On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton took in 29 million and spent 257 million in the third quarter aloneAs the campaign draws closer to the early 2016 primary contests however Trump will need to spend more money Corrado said We will start to see this change in the fourth quarter he said pointing to Trumps announcement that he plans to spend upwards of 20 million in the next phase of his campaign on advertisingSo far his expenditures are revolving around his travel spending the money to put on viable campaign events gathering intelligence in the early primary states and promoting his brand said Corrado It reflects a grassroots approach to campaigning  Therefore he has been able to conserve his resources to spend more as they get closer to the actual votingTrump will either have to raise more or keep dipping into his personal reserves as according to the FEC report his campaign only had 255000 cash on hand as of Sept 30He acknowledged as much when he told Fox News he would not be averse to taking outside money should he get the nomination I dont mind spending the money Once we get through that primary thats when the party kicks in and then billions of dollars come in everyone wants to support it and thats a great thing
