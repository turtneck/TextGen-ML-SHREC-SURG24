8 Things Congress Actually Did This YearWhen Republicans took over both chambers of Congress in January party leaders vowed they would prove to the country that Republicans could govern They promised to stop with the selfmade crises such as government shutdowns and rack up legislative accomplishments So in the first year of a GOPcontrolled Congress in nearly a decade how well did Republicans prove they can governFirst there were no government shutdowns or defaults on the national debt Immediately after the midterm election in 2014 both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner promised there wouldnt be any shutdowns or defaults on their watch Turns out they made good on that promise this yearBut Democrats arent exactly congratulating them for it Thats like saying You know they didnt blow the top off the Capitol so clearly Republican leadership is in touch with America No it takes more than that said Democratic Sen Dick Durbin of IllinoisNonetheless it is fair to say that the widely held assumption Congress gets nothing done doesnt exactly fit this year There was an uptick in bipartisan activity in this Republicancontrolled Congress in 2015 but if you ask Democrats why that was theyll say its because they were a more cooperative minority than Republicans were when Democrats controlled the Senate  and that they cooperated on legislation that bolstered Democratic goalsWhether or not keeping the government open counts as an accomplishment here are eight legislative matters Congress did address in 2015  and some issues that remain unresolvedTrillionDollar Government Funding Bill Right before they split for the holidays lawmakers passed a trilliondollar spending bill that will keep the government open until the end of next September The measure also beefed up cybersecurity and renewed a health care program for Sept 11 first responders It also made changes to the visa waiver program so people who have traveled to Iraq Iran Syria and Sudan in the past five years will face greater scrutiny if they wish to enter the USTax Extenders Paired with the government spending bill was a measure containing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks Year after year Congress has had to extend dozens of tax breaks that expire In this measure lawmakers made permanent the most popular tax breaks such as the 1000 child tax credit the earned income tax credit for low and moderateincome workers and the research and development tax creditTwoYear Budget Agreement Right before Boehner left office he managed to reach a twoyear budget deal with the White House and other congressional leaders The agreement suspends the debt ceiling through March 2017 and increases spending by 80 billion over the next two years  an increase thats split evenly between defense and domestic programsNo Child Left Behind Rewrite Congress easily passed legislation to rewrite the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act Federally mandated math and reading tests will continue but the new law cedes greater authority to states rather than the federal government to figure out how to use the test results in evaluating schoolsFiveYear Transportation Bill Congress passed its first longterm bill in a decade to fund roads bridges and mass transit systems The measure does not raise the gas tax currently at 184 cents per gallon but found other sources of funding  such as changing customs fees and dipping into funds from the Federal ReserveEnded The NSAs Bulk Surveillance Program Lawmakers passed the USA Freedom Act which ended the governments bulk collection of phone records Passage of the measure came after Republican senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a twoday shutdown of the bulk collection programTrade Promotion Authority Congress approved a measure to give the president expedited authority to enter a trade deal with 11 other Pacific Rim countries Attention now turns to the TransPacific Partnership agreement which Congress is expected to consider next year  possibly after the election is overMedicare Reform Known as the Doc Fix bill this measure permanently ended automatic Medicare payment cuts to physicians Under a law from the late 1990s Medicare payments to doctors would be cut to keep the programs budget in check Since then Congress had failed every year to figure out a longterm solution to the problemStill so many issues remain unresolved  not because lawmakers think theyre unimportant but because partisan divisions on these ideological issues are so deep they cant find common ground Congress seems happy to take these issues to the voters in 2016Guns After a spate of gunrelated tragedies in 2015 Democrats vowed to push for gun control legislation such as measures to expand background checks and prohibit individuals whose names are on terrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms Both measures failed in the Senate in 2015 as in past yearsImmigration The Senate managed to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul package in 2013 but attempts to move the legislation through the House failed Efforts to resurrect immigration legislation have since languishedTax Reform After the midterm election corporate tax reform was seen as a possible area Republicans and Democrats could work together on But at his yearend news conference McConnell expressed pessimism about getting any tax reform accomplished with a Democrat in the White House saying that any tax changes need to be revenueneutral and he doubted the president would go for that
