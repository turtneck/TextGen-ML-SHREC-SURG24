Embarrassing and infuriating the NBC anchors misstatements reveal much about Americas media environmentBy now it may be time to paraphrase a famous remark by Rep Mo Udall at an endless political dinner and conclude that Everything that can be said about Brian Williams has been said its just that not everyone has said it yetConsider what follows as a few footnotes to the Big StuffWhy did he do it How bad were his misdeeds Are there others Can he survive In the reactions to the story of the Flak Attack That Wasnt lie some telling realities about todays media worldThere Is No Wall of Silence My Twitter feed wasand still isfiled with assertions that the mainstream media will circle the wagons to protect one of their own This is precisely what has not happened The New York Times has published accounts that cast serious doubt not only on Williamss later storytelling but also on the original NBC story 12 years ago Maureen Dowds Sunday column is brutal reporting concerns within NBC News of Williamss tendency to aggrandize himself In The New Yorker satirist Andy Borowitz wrote an acidic diary painting the NBC anchor as the embodiment of upperclass privilege The Washington Post CNN Slate and The Daily Beastmedia outlets that would never be confused with rightwing zealotryhave been highly critical of Williams Only a few familiar facesDan Rather and TIMEs Joe Kleinhave spoken up in Williamss defenseYou can argue that these outlets been forced into this because the digital world makes it impossible to ignore the depredations of traditional media Or you can note that the media themselves have come to accept that they need to be subject to the same critical gaze as other institutions Thus the birth of ombudsmen and public accountabilityfrom The New York Times and Jayson Blairs tall tales to the Washington Posts Janet Cooke and her eightyearold addict to CBS and the George W Bush National Guard story to CNNs Tailwind scandal and beyond Whatever the reason the notion that the mainstream media has rushed to protect Brian Williams is laughableWilliams Made Himself A Perfect Target Theres no more attractive story than one suggesting that an important or powerful figure is a hypocrite Its the war hawk urging the dispatch of young men and women into harms way but whose draft deferments or sketchy medical condition exempted him from the draft Its the liberal voting to bus children to school while sending her kids to private academies Its the tribune of moral virtue paying for abortions for the staff assistant he knocked up Its the environmentalists flying to a climate change rally in a private jetBrian Williams is in this sense a perfect fit His inaccurate or misleading or deeply dishonest account of what happened in Iraq seems to put the lie to a career that has featured him in the midst of one danger or another To be clear on this point Williams in fact has been in many places where natural disasters or violence have indeed involved risk I write as someone who in more than 30 years of network TV reporting found himself in physical danger exactly once in South Africa for a period of perhaps 15 minutesBut by steadily exaggerating the perils of his helicopter journey hes permitted critics to suggest that it was all an act that he is not who he wanted us to think he is Hes also opened the door to those who scoff at the danger journalists face On Thursday Rush Limbaugh scornfully referred to journalists who put on a trench coat and stand in a street in Beirut This is a slanderous smear on the critically wounded Bob Woodruff and Kimberly Dozier on Mike Kelly and David Bloom who died in Iraq on James Foley and other journalists beheaded by ISIS on the 61 journalists killed in 2014 It is however a slander that will resonate and it will resonate because Williams was apparently unwilling to let his record unvarnished speak for itselfHave You Looked In the Mirror Lately Brian Williams is one of many in the mainstream or traditional or legacy media who have warned about the difficulty of judging the credibility of new media When a story is coming from somewhere out there in the digital universe with no imprimatur wheres the institutional backup where are the researchers the editors the factcheckers the accountabilityWell in this case it was the toolbox of the new media that exposed the holes or lack of them in the helicopter story Facebook gave a member of the US military the forum on which to challenge Williams Sorry dude I dont remember you being on my aircraft Moreover there are a lot of questions still to be answered about why the NBC staffers who were with Williams never raised their voices to say Um Brian about that storyAs for what happens next I dont know what NBCor outside investigatorsare going to find I dont know if it makes sense assuming no other transgressions for Williams to sit down with a smart tough but fair inquisitorMegyn Kelly Jon Stewart The scheduled appearance on Letterman Thursdayand answer whatever questions are thrown his way It probably makes sense for Williams to shelve his considerable comedic gifts and stay away from Jimmy Fallon and Saturday Night LiveI do know that theres one idea that struck me as eminently on point It comes from Matt Dowd the recovering political operative and ABC News analyst who tweeted Maybe the news media can learn from this episode and start being a little more compassionate when others mess up
