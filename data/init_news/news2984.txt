Not guilty The power of nullification to counteract government tyranny By John W Whitehead Posted on November 2 2016 by John W Whitehead The people have the power all we have to do is awaken that power in the people The people are unaware Theyre not educated to realize that they have power The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything We are the government John Lennon How do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being Tasered teargassed peppersprayed hit with batons shot with rubber bullets and real bullets blasted with sound cannons detained in cages and kennels  sicced by police dogs arrested and jailed for challenging the governments excesses abuses and powergrabs Politics wont fix a system that is broken beyond repair No matter who sits in the White House the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes Relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile Indeed with every ruling handed down it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice with government courts largely lacking in vision and scope rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law This is true at all levels of the judiciary but especially so in the highest court of the land the US Supreme Court which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution Even s It doesnt matter who the activists are environmentalists peaceniks Native Americans Black Lives Matter Occupy or the Bundys and their followers or what the source of the discontent is endless wars abroad police shootings contaminated drinking water government landgrabs the governments modus operandi Just recently in fact an Oregon jury rejected the governments attempts to prosecute seven activists In finding the defendants not guiltyof conspiracy to impede federal officers of possession of firearms in a federal facility a The Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility their lawyers argued the guns were as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks thereby preventing workers from performing their duties as the Washington Post points out this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist leftwingers and Earth First protesters As law professor Ilya Somin explains jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive  According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler the doctrine of jury nullification is premised on the idea that ordinary citizens not government officials should have the final say In a world of  rampant overcriminalization  where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day jury nullification acts as  a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization Indeed Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises If you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case I recommend that you vote not guiltyeven if you think the defendant actually smoked pot or sold it to another consenting adult As a juror you have this power under the Bill of Rights Not only should the punishment fit the crime but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profitdriven priorities of Corporate America This is wh Various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to  claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded For the rest of us who are dependent on the fairness of the system there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day Police misconduct Prosecutorial misconduct Judicial bias Inadequate defense Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice Judges who care more about what is legal than wha The real and manufactured events of recent yearsthe invasive surveillance the extremism reports the civil unrest the protests t Those protests in Ferguson  Baltimore and Baton Rouge to protest police brutality The militarized police  clad in Kevlar vests helmets and camouflage armed with pistols shotguns automatic rifles and tear gas  turning towns into war zones The kenneling Employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience And then as I explain in more detail in my book Battlefield America The War on the American People llify the laws Nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate egregious or blatantly unconstitutional Constitutional attorney and author John W Whitehead is founder and president of The Rutherford Institute His
