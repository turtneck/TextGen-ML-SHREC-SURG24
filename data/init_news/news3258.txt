Catherine R Squires is a professor of communication studies at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities She is also the director of the Race Indigeneity Gender and Sexuality Studies InitiativeFacebook is a forprofit company that makes money packaging its users information to sell to advertisers and other entities The companys goal is not to produce a balanced information diet for its users People who are shocked that Facebook might be skewing their newsfeed probably shouldnt have trusted them with their news diet in the first place given its history Remember those confusing and everchanging privacy settings and that experiment to see whether users moods could be manipulated by changing the newsfeed This is not the company Id trust to tell me whats important in the worldBut the uproar over the role of human editors at Facebook  or at least in the Trending Topics section  does revive an important question In an information age when people can customize their news diet how should Facebook editors decide what issues opinions or events deserve prominenceGiven their newfound reliance on social media companies like Facebook traditional media editors have been grappling with the same question Any news publication with a website makes ad revenue off of popular articles but that can be a dangerous incentive Though important news can also be popular all of the major publications are guilty of publishing dumbed down clickbait to attract wider audiencesSo then perhaps the question is whether Facebook or even the news media is narrowing the field of news so that we as citizens are unable to engage in effective political and social discussionsA Facebook newsfeed that was completely dictated by algorithms without human interference wouldnt be any better Algorithms reflect the imperfect biases of the humans that build them Algorithms rely on data sets which are structured by the decisions of data gatherers guided by particular goals For example as most of the people who work in computing are male its not surprising that scholars found a gender bias in the Googles Image search In searches for CEO 11 percent of the people depicted were women compared with 27 percent of US CEOs who are actually womenData and news can be skewed on many levels on the Internet but competent editors could explain how they and their algorithms work Then at least the public would know how and why news sites elevate certain storiesBut bias in the media is not new These basic questions have to be worked out by each generation confronted by each new development in media technology They are ethical and practical questions that require a human touch
