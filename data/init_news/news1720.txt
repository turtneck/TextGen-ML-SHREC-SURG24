Pinterest CE Dyer writes that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace On Monday the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year according to the Associated Press  The AP reported Before taxpayerprovided subsidies premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services Some states will see much bigger jumps others less Moreover about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles In some states the premium increases are striking In Arizona unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27yearold buying a benchmark secondlowest cost silver plan will jump by 116 percent from 196 to 422 according to the administration report But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income making 25000 a year the subsidies would cover 280 of the new premium and the consumer would pay 142 Caveat if the consumer is making 30000 or 40000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower Larry Levitt who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said of the increases Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period Donald Trumps campaign spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement on Monday This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced Miller added While Hillary Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare Mr Trump knows the only way to fix our nations failing health care system is complete and total reform Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time however HHSs confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov 1  one week before the election  is likely to cause major headaches for many people This debacle is not unexpected either  its exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen Obamacare was never the end goal Rather it was a stepping stone toward singlepayer governmentrun healthcare That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president  his legacy is at stake Obamas legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected If Clinton becomes president theres no doubt that her next step will be to move to singlepayer healthcare Obamacare is bad theres no doubt about it but singlepayer government healthcare would be even worse
