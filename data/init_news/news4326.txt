You could shout yourself hoarse arguing what the justbegun 2016 general election is about The insider versus the outsider No feminism versus machismo No Stronger together versus I alone can fix itOne thing that 2016 really isnt about is newness Neither candidate is anybodys idea of a fresh face Hillary Clinton will be 69 on Inauguration Day Donald Trump 70 Each entered this race a celebrity minted in a distant epoch from which neither candidate can fully escapeWhats the 2016 election really about The Eighties are running against the NinetiesThe 1980s and 1990s remain who Trump and Clinton respectively areor at least how they seem most of the time The 1980s was the decade when Trump emerged as a local symbol of New York Citys brash new wealth and parlayed that into national fame His taste for Italian marble and goldplated fixtures perfectly matched a period that extolled conspicuous displays of personal wealth For Clinton the 1990s a decade dominated by technologydriven prosperity affirmed her conviction that brainpower and idealism could overcome bitter political divisions She entered the White House as a full partner in a duo bent on seizing a political center evaporating faster than liquid helium Two for the price of one husband Bill promisedEven in a tumultuous and normdefying campaign Clinton and Trump have held fast to the identities they crafted in their formative decades Clinton is identified permanently with her husbands third way triangulation of the 1990s even as shes drifted leftward on issues like trade and the minimum wage It was simply what she had to do to defeat her democratic socialist primary opponent Bernie Sanders and to keep up with her partys new focus on income inequality Trump is regarded permanently as the real estate titan he was in the 1980s even though his business model later shifted toward licensing the Trump name always in gold always in caps to properties he didnt own Few realize that even Trumps renovation of Washingtons Old Post Officecurrently his highestprofile building projectis a leasing deal the title is held by the federal government Even the dire tone of Trumps nomination speech in which he declared that we live in an era more dangerous than frankly I have ever seen was a far better description of the soaring crime he lived through in the late 80s in New York than of today Trump himself was channeling Richard Nixon in 1968 but the 80s were all about slamming shut the Pandoras box that was the 60sTruthfully the two candidates dont work very hard to update their images because the decades that hatched them represent golden ages to which they promise America will returnTrumps very slogan Make America Great Again is borrowed from Ronald Reagans presidential campaign of 1980 Lets Make America Great Again Its a straightforward appeal to GOP nostalgia for a decade of conservative ascendancy economic prosperity and a president whom Republicans idealize Asked in January what Make America Great Again meant Trump said I think during the Ronald Reagan years we were very good  We felt good about our countryClintons New Jerusalem meanwhile looks very much like the 1990s Hillarys new ChangeMaker slogan is an echo of Bills rallying cry at the 1992 convention Its time to change America In May Hillary said she would put Bill in charge of revitalizing the economy a role that would make him the most powerful first relative since Robert F Kennedy The politics are a bit tricky Hillary knows that Democrats feel ambivalent about resurrecting a public figure whom opponents once branded Slick Willie But she also knows that nobody is ambivalent about the eightyear economic expansion that Bill Clinton presided over during his presidency You know at the end of the 90s Hillary said in March we had 23 million new jobs Incomes went up for everybody Elect me Hillary was saying and well make it happen againIn theory one party call them the Ins always stands for continuity while the other the Outs always stands for changeAs a Republican Trump is obliged to disparage Obama Trump sees the Obama presidency as a total disaster to quote a phrase hes used to describe the Affordable Care Act and Obamas foreign policy But Trumps disparagement doesnt stop there He uses the same phrase to describe fellow Republican George W Bushs conduct of the Iraq war and Bill Clintons signing of NAFTA That takes the 21st century off the table and also the final decade of the 20th To avoid total disaster Trumps followers must travel in time back to  you guessed it the 1980sClinton speaks favorably of Obama as she must hes her partys incumbent and she spent four years as his secretary of state But she tends to describe Obamas administration as a mere continuation of her husbands interrupted by a George W Bush presidency that wrecked the economy The Affordable Care Act for instance was called Hillarycare Hillary said in January before it was called Obamacare Thats a stretchObamacare resembles Hillarycare only in the very broad sense that both were ambitious health reform plans proposed by Democrats But in Clintons telling the biggest policy accomplishment of the Obama administrationreally the biggest policy accomplishment of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnsonwas rooted in the glorious 1990sMuch as they might focus on uptodate topics like ISIL and cyberwar Trump and Clinton are vying for control of the political Wayback Machine and the only difference is where they want to set the dial Want to know what theyre likely to do in office Just take a look at the signature themeswar economy and good old family valuesthat define the eras that they epitomizeBroadly speaking the 1980s was a decade of peace and the 1990s a decade of warThat confounds political stereotypes because Ronald Reagan was a bit of a saber rattler Ive signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever Reagan famously quipped in 1984 not knowing the microphone in front of him was hot We begin bombing in five minutes Reagan presided over a vast arms buildup including a wildly ambitious antinuke umbrella in outer space that critics dubbed Star Wars Some historians credit this arms buildup with winning the Cold War simply because the Soviets couldnt keep up Reagan also aided proxy wars in Nicaragua Afghanistan and elsewhereBut where American soldiers were concerned Reagan was extremely riskaverse withdrawing them for instance from a multinational peacekeeping mission in Beirut in 1983 after the bombing of US Marine barracks by the Iranianbacked terrorist group Hezbollah killed 241 Americans Reagan later sent thousands of TOW missiles secretly to Iran in exchange for the release of what turned out to be five of the seven hostages held by that same Hezbollah As president Reagan sent US troops into battle only once for a grand total of three days in 1983 to wrest the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada from a Marxist coup The liberal commentator Michael Kinsley called it a testtube warThe real wars happened in the 1990s The largest deployment was 1991s Persian Gulf War wherein US forces chased Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait but not out of Iraq The Gulf War was a 1990s event but not a Clinton administration event it was waged by George HW Bush and it rekindled however briefly Americans faith in fullscale military intervention after their Vietnam debacle Good night Vietnam reporter David Shribman quipped in the Wall Street Journal Bush also committed troops to support relief efforts in Somalia where civil war was raging Clinton escalated that deployment and then withdrew the troops as the country descended into anarchy Later in the 90s Clinton ordered airstrikes to quell ethnic strife in Bosnia and Kosovo and also twice in Iraq to counter assorted misbehavior by SaddamExcept for Somalia all these military operations were on balance successful and all of them including Somalia were short term In both respects they were vastly different from US deployments over the following two decades in Iraq and AfghanistanTrump is much fonder of Russia than Reagan was to put it mildly but otherwise his foreign policy stance is an exaggerated version of Reagans Talk tough Im gonna build a military thats gonna be much stronger than it is right now Trump has said and go out of your way to avoid military interventions Did Reagan provoke the Soviet Union by calling it however accurately an evil empire Trump sees and raises by endorsing torture We have to beat the savages Although at the time Trump favored the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2011 US intervention in Libya just as Clinton did he now says he opposed them Clinton meanwhile is more measured in her rhetoric but favors a more hawkish foreign policy thats closer to the 1990s policies of George HW Bush and her husband As secretary of state for instance she favored US training for Syrian rebels only to be overruled by ObamaThe 1980s was a decade in which the budget deficit spun out of control The 1990s was a decade in which the deficit however briefly disappearedHere again we see Republicans and Democrats playing against type For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit Reagan said in his 1981 inaugural address mortgaging our future and our childrens future for the temporary convenience of the present When he spoke these words the budget deficit was 74 billion By the time Reagan left office it was 155 billion Currently the deficit is 401 billion a higher absolute figure but a smaller percentage of gross domestic product than in Reagans final year Much of the blame lies with tax cuts that failed to deliver the revenue boost predicted by the supplyside economic priesthood But federal spending increased during Reagans presidency too by about 80 percent much of it the aforementioned military buildupThe deficit continued to climb during George HW Bushs presidency but under Bill Clinton it fell from 290 billion to zero to a surplus of 236 billion in Clintons final year Tax increases passed by Clinton and by Bush in violation of the latters no new taxes pledge helped bring deficits under control but Clinton also slowed spending growth During Clintons presidency federal spending increased by 29 percentless than half the rate of increase under Reagan and slightly slower than Obamas estimated 32 percentIf your preferred measure of governmental bloat is the number of people who work for the federal government that grew under Reagan by about 7 percent and shrank under Bill Clinton by about 16 percent continuing once again a trend that began under George HW Bush Much of that had to do with the end of the Cold War but under Clinton even the number of civilian workers shrank by about 13 percent compared to growth of about 4 percent under Reagan the very same president who famously declared his nine most terrifying words were Im from the government and Im here to help Both civilian and military federal employment shrank under Obama through 2014 the most recent year for which data are availableMost government expansion over the past few decades it should be noted has occurred through contractors Nobody alas seems to know how many contract employees that entailed but its a good bet their ranks grew through both the 1980s and the 1990s According to the Congressional Budget Office federal contract spending today is somewhere in excess of 500 billion Most of that spending is by the Defense Department which today remarkably hands most of its annual budget over to the private sectorAs with matters of war and peace Trumps stance resembles Reagans with the difference that Trump makes less effort than Reagan did to disguise his hedonistic impulse toward deficit spending You have tremendous waste fraud and abuse Trump told the Wall Street Journal in February invoking a trinity frequently mentioned by Reagan in the 1980s But the specific example Trump gavephantom Social Security payments to nonexistent people aged 106 years and oldergarbled an inspector general report that actually said very few such payments were made In general Trump distinguished himself from his primary opponents by pledging not to cut entitlement spending even as he proposed tax cuts that the bipartisan Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget estimated would expand the national debt by 12 trillionHillarys orientation is very much like Bills was in the 1990sshe does not espouse entitlement cuts Democrats seldom do but would likely accept them as part of a bipartisan budget deal that also raised taxes though shes never said so Clinton has proposed new government spending that might add up to as much as 1 trillion but her proposed tax increases would raise about the same amount according to the leftleaning Tax Policy Center On paper then Trump would expand the deficit as Reagan did in the 1980s while Clinton would neither expand nor shrink it falling short of what Bill achieved in the 1990sThe 1980s celebrated family values The 1990s fretted about themRonald Reagan was the first and still the only divorced person ever to be elected president But even his bitterest enemies didnt question Reagans devotion to his wife Nancy Some did think though this devotion verged on dependence He called her mommy and once in 1984 she got caught on tape feeding him a response to a reporters question Were doing everything we can The Reagans daughter Patti Davis thought her parents devotion to each other meant that they were complete without their children If a band of gypsies came and took me and Ron Reagan Jr away Patti said earlier this year on NBCs Today they would miss us but theyd be fine After Reagans first grandchild was born it was noted widely that the sitting president took two years to see himReagan avoided the subject of gay rights even though as a former actor he had many gay friends prompting the liberal commentator Hendrik Hertzberg to dub him a closet tolerant Reagan didnt mention AIDS publicly until 1985 and when the topic came up at news briefings it prompted snickers The topic of gay marriage lay far enough in the future as to be a nonissue as late as 1989 mainstream culture judged it an entirely novel idea when the conservative writer Andrew Sullivan published his first essay on the topic On abortion Reagan was a sharp critic even going so far as to write an electionyear book in 1984 titled Abortion And The Conscience of A Nation Through the 1980s teenage birth rates teenage pregnancy rates and teenage abortion rates stayed about levelIn the 1990s Bill Clinton showed himself to be a more doting father than Reaganwe learned last week he bingewatched all six Police Academy movies with Chelseabut a less doting husband Evidence of the latter trickled in during the 1992 primaries prompting a Clinton campaign aide to coin the phrase bimbo eruptions and turned into a flood in 1998 when an independent counsel hired to investigate a fishylooking real estate deal decided instead to pursue Bills commitment to and veracity under oath concerning his marriage vowsThe 1990s were the decade when the phrase culture wars came into vogue thanks largely to the 1991 book Culture Wars The Struggle To Define America by University of Virginia sociologist James Davison Hunter On gay rights Bill immediately pledged to end a ban on gays serving in the military That prompted a political furor that ended with the implementation of an unworkable policy called Dont Ask Dont Tell that limped along until 2011 Bill was much more cautious on gay marriage favoring civil unions but signing into law a nationwide ban on gay marriage that the Supreme Court eventually struck down by then with Bills approval in 2013 On abortion the Clinton administrations policy was that it be safe legal and rare a verbal construction that captures the somewhat anguished tenor of the times In spite of that anguish many of the social trends that inspired the greatest anxiety were in retreat Throughout the 1990s once again starting under George HW Bush and continuing under Clinton birth rates pregnancy rates and abortion rates among teenagers declined Indeed trajectories for hotbutton social issues grew so favorable that by decades end William Bennett a former Education secretary under George HW Bush had to stop publishing an annual jeremiad he called the Index of Leading Cultural IndicatorsTrump like Reagan is in his personal life a somewhatlesscloseted tolerant a twicedivorced man who during his first marriage began an affair with the woman who would become his second wife Unlike Reagan though Trump lacks gallantry he once boasted in writing that If I told the real stories of my experiences with women often seemingly very happily married and important women this book would be a guaranteed bestseller On social issues Trump hews closer to Hillary Clinton than to his fellow Republicans opposing for instance North Carolinas ban on transgender bathrooms But Trumps attitudes on gay and transgender rights have been somewhat conflicted over the decades He shunned his longtime mentor and lawyer Roy Cohn in 1985 when he discovered Cohn had AIDS which he would die of in 1986 On the one hand in Trumps nomination speech he diverged from his text to congratulate the crowd for cheering his pledge to protect LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology On the other hand Trump draws the line at gay marriage and abortion both of which he now opposes Hillary Clinton favors gay marriage and is prochoiceOne could go on Violent crime rose in the 1980s and fell in the 1990s for reasons that experts still argue about Income inequality grew during both decades though only during the 1990s did economic expansion increase median income in any significant way Important caveat The muchdespised 1 percent expanded its share of the nations collective income faster under Clinton than under Reagan The stock market crashed in 1987 and sortof crashed in 1998 in neither instance prompting a recession Personal computers became a consumer item in the 1980s but were able to do much more in the 1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web Brood X the only cicada cycle worth worrying about blanketed the sidewalks with crunchy carcasses in 1987 but didnt reappear until 2004 bypassing the 90s entirelyShould the 1980s get your vote or the 1990s Thats a personal choicemore personal perhaps and certainly more nuanced than the choice between two actual human beings who are running for president Both candidates want to build a bridge back to the 20th century The question voters must decide is which part
