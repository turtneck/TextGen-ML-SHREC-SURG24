ProPalestinian Propaganda Lowering Standards of Truth in America Manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere October 28 2016 Reprinted from IsraelNationalNewscom  Commendably organized American Jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction Israel However focusing primarily on Israel and not also on America and Europe is shortsighted The BDS campaign has not devastated Israel economically Israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed Israels good name and has rendered her and Jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks It has also lowered the standards for truth among Americans This is a very important point An Islamicstyle of Jew hatred has merged with Western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for Palestinians Fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world It has infected Americans and Europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity This is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight The BDS campaign is rooted in the Arab League PLO and Soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mid1960s In the mid1970s the UN proposed its infamous ZionismRacism resolution In 1967 the day after Israel won yet another war of selfdefense Israelnot the Arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier By the late 1970s Edward Saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with Western academics and with Westernstyle academics in Israel European governments and international organizations I only realized how successful his campaign was in 1980 when Israel was demonized at a UN conference on Women in Copenhagen The Soviets the Iranians the Arab League the PLO roamed the hallways chanting Death to Israel European feminists called upon Palestinian refugees but refused to hear JewishIsraeli refugees from Arab and Muslim countries By 2001 the UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban was an even more outofcontrol Hate Fest and riot against Israel As we approach 2017 UN Resolutions against Israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque UNESCOs recent decision to DeJudaize Jerusalem the Western Wall and the First and Second Temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend At the same time proIsrael professors and students in America are increasingly being harassed even fired Such Lies have infiltrated my private social world For example At a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink A likeminded gathering yes Not exactly One man a genial wellheeled welleducated JewishAmerican suddenly began hectoring us about the Palestinians What if they did not hate the Jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize Jews and Israelis What if they were peaceful Wouldnt we have to admit that Palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own You cant deny that the Palestinian people have always lived there can you Oh my Where to start The company included two authorscholars who between them have published 15 books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of Islam tribal gender and religious apartheid Israel and antiSemitism etc Among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the IDF I held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table This man was punching way above his pay grade and I could not understand why The two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics I pulled down book after book from my shelves We got nowhere Look he said I have some really good Muslim friends theyre Americans totally Westernized they are Palestinians They strongly feel that this is their identity Why deny them the identity of their choice And then I understood that the proPalestinianantiZionist propaganda behind the relentless BDS campaign is successful precisely because so many Americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care Fair is fair he said In other words Whats good for the Jews has to be good for everyone else If not the Jews dont deserve whatever it is either Heres a man whos not an antiSemite or an antiZionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonJewish Palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than 1948 the year that another stateless peoplethe Jewschose a national sovereign identity He would not listen to reason It was quite astounding How is this possible His mindset is part of our ruling American zeitgeist If Rachel Dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the NAACP if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do I am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to False Ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult Facts alone will not work We must consider all known techniques for deprogramming This is one of our greatest challenges
