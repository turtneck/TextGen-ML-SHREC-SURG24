Hollywood Florida CNN Donald Trumps new delegate guru told Republican Party insiders at a posh resort here on Thursday that the billionaire frontrunner is recalibrating the part that hes been playing and is ready to work with the GOP to evolve as a candidate past the divisive primaryMeanwhile 1100 miles away in Harrisburg Pennsylvania Trump told his supporters the Republican system is rigged and crookedThis is the dilemma facing the Republican National Committee and its members meeting here this week Can they cope with Trump an unpredictable personality who has come this close to winning the presidential nomination with a campaign leaning heavily on direct anger at GOP officials and institutionsPaul Manafort Trumps senior adviser and a longtime Republican operative said that Trump understands the changing nature of the campaign and is prepared to evolveHe recognizes that things arent static That what is right to start the campaign isnt necessarily the way you finish the campaign Manafort told CNN Thursday night after he met with RNC officials hereBut Manafort did not want to call anything a dtente between Trump and the GOP establishment Theres no reason to have a detente I mean theres not a fight he saidI mean the Trump campaign and the RNC are working together on a bunch of different things  but the focus has been on getting the nomination he said Now that were approaching the nomination the focus is on blending the party and the campaign so that we can run as a united team and thats what we started to do here this weekendThe Trump campaign is approaching things here as if it already won the nomination There was no focus in the closeddoor meeting with Trumps people and the RNC on the effort to secure the 1237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination a source inside the room saidInstead Manafort contrasted Trump with Hillary Clinton  Trump has personality negatives that can be fixed by campaign consultants like him but Clinton has deep character negatives dealing with issues of trust he told the room according to audio obtained by CNN from someone who attended Manaforts presentationThe part that hes been playing is now evolving into the part that youve been expecting The negatives will come down the image is going to change but Crooked Hillary is still going to be Crooked Hillary Manafort told the packed room which attendees described as too small and jammed with what appeared to be more Trump supporters than RNC members  the intended audienceTrump Manafort said has been playing two roles in the campaign  one in public onstage with voters and one in private that is more subdued and will start appearing moreTrump is an outsider and thats why many of you dont know him but when hes sitting in a room hes talking business hes talking politics in a private room its a different persona Manafort told the crowd When hes out on the stage when hes talking about the kind of things when hes out on the stump hes projecting an image thats for that purpose and the two youll start to see coming together in the course of the next several monthsShortly into a slide presentation that focused on Trumps ability to win a general election contest Manafort asked his assistant to end the slideshow and said Actually I know what Im gonna say Manafort said to some laughs according to an attendee and meeting audioAfter the meeting Manafort said the message was received wellI mean we had a very good meeting Manafort told CNN I think people were hungry to find out with the campaigns intentions were what Donald Trumps intentions were We answered all the questions I think they left there they have a better understanding of the integration of the campaign with the party as we move towards the general electionTrump recently brought in Manafort and Rick Wiley Scott Walkers former campaign manager after it was clear Ted Cruz was winning delegates with an intense ground game Manafort said the new hires also should calm nerves among jittery Republicans hereThey know Rick Wiley they know me so were bridging that relationship while he goes about finishing the job for the nominee Manafort told CNN earlier ThursdayCruz speaking on the Mark Levin Show Thursday night said Trump is trying to snow over Republican voters Donald is a New York liberal who is pretending to be a conservative to try to fool Republican primary voters Cruz saidHes telling us hes lying to us Cruz added What his campaign manager says  you look at what his campaign manager is telling us this is just an act this is just a show building a wall when he talks about anything its all an act and a showTrump was the only candidate of the remaining three not to show up here in person John Kasich and Cruz both spoke to party leaders at private receptions Wednesday night and hosted smaller groups for private meetings outside of the resortAnd Trump himself is showing no signs of letting up He is the only candidate who can reasonably get to 1237 delegates before Cleveland and has Cruz and other Republicans out to stop him on subsequent ballotsIn Harrisburg Trump compared the primary system to Crooked Hillary Clinton getting two attacks against his enemies in oneThe system is rigged the voting is rigged the whole deal is crooked 100 almost as crooked as Crooked Hillary Its a crooked deal Trump said And thats why you have a case where I go in and win with the vote and these guys go in they buy delegates they buy them dinners they send them to hotelsThe continuing blasts against the party from Trump  and pressure from Cruz and Kasich  led RNC leaders earlier Thursday to back off proposed rules changes for the convention amid very vocal fears they would be perceived favoring one of the threeThe party is like the lawyer in a divorce court said Holland Redfield the RNC committeeman from the Virgin IslandsSurely theres a lot of whining going on Redfield said Here you have candidates that have also said to each other they are not supporting whoever gets out of this process I mean come on So they put the party in the middleKasich senior adviser John Weaver said that RNC members were pushing for the Ohio governor to stay in the race  even with only one state victory Ohio and fewer delegates than Marco Rubio who dropped out last monthWeve run into a lot of people here who are encouraging us to go the distance because the people at this meeting particularly have a charge of putting together a winning ticket Weaver saidKen Cuccinelli Cruzs chief delegate hunter said the death threats made against Colorado Republican Party Chairman Steve House came up repeatedly in meetings between Cruz and RNC members WednesdayThey are definitely on the minds of lots of people here especially when they saw Steve House one of their colleagues getting death threats That comment was made repeatedly with various observations about it and those tactics in these meetings Cuccinelli said And this was the members making the comments not us bringing them upCruz kept his Wednesday presentation focused on his plan for winning the White House  the partys ultimate goal  and detailing his strategy in upcoming states like Pennsylvania according to RNC members who attended his speech And he added how he could help their own party efforts with his promised coattailsHe touched on that a little bit with the downballot effect we come out of that election hopefully with some big wins said Oregon Republican Party Chairman Bill Currier who attended the Cruz speechDo leaders take Trump seriouslyBut with their options dwindling some party leaders here said they could make the distinction between Trumps sharp attacks on the party and his political strategyI think thats just part of his persona I never take that stuff seriously or personally said Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Rob Gleason He cannot be elected without the Republican Party Thats the long and short of it He needs us We need a candidate and he needs us so we all need to work togetherHenry Barbour a party national committeeman from Mississippi who has said in the past it would be very hard for him to vote for Trump agreedI think thats Donald Trump being Donald Trump Hes an insurgent candidate trying to appeal on a populist level I dont take it that he really means it said BarbourThe populist furor sparked by Trump along with his campaign message that he is being cheated out of the nomination  with the publics voice being ignored  has exposed a deeper rift in the Republican Party which may have to be worked out after November no matter who is their nominee and no matter which party wins the White HouseIf somehow or another it comes to pass that the results of the primary choose our nominee ahead of the convention as far as Im concerned its the end of the national Republican Party said RNC Committeeman Curly Haugland of North DakotaHaugland and some other party veterans have argued that the public  and some incredibly angry Trump supporters  are simply learning what has been true of every previous nominating contest The party picks its candidate for the White HouseIt cant be rigged if the rules have been public and transparent for nearly a year and weve done it this way since 1856 Barbour saidBut in 2016 it wont be Barbour deciding whats rigged and what not
