Stamptastic  Shutterstockcom Oh good The world reaches a crossroads or probably a road off a cliff just when I want to relax and watch gratuitous violence on the tube To judge by the rapid drift of events aboard our planetary asylum the talons of Washington and New York on the worlds throat are fast being pried aloose The Global American Imperium is dying Or so it sure looks anyway I say talons of New York and Washington because Americas foreign policy forged in those two cities belongs entirely to them Americans have no influence on it Further none of what the Empire does abroad is of any benefit to Americans Do you care at all what happens in Afghanistan Iraq Yemen or the South China Sea Do you want to pay for it America has been hijacked And the Empire prospereth not It prospereth very not Consider the recent record of the worlds hyperpower Washington does not have control of Afghanistan and obviously is not going to Washington does not have control of Iraq and appears unlikely to Washington did not back Iran down and isnt going to Washington did not back Russia down in Ukraine and Crimea and isnt going to Washington did not back China down in the South China Sea and while this is perhaps not over the Empire seems to be losing Washington has not backed North Korea down and is not going to In the Philippines President Duterte has told Obama to go to hell as being the son of a whore which may be taken to indicate latent hostility He is vigorously seeking rapprochement with China While Washington may have him murdered it seems to be losing control of the Little Vassals of ASEAN Turkey seems to be cuddling up to Russiathat is looking East like Duterte Maybe Washington can turn this around temporarily but theres a whole lot of wavering going on Meanwhile Washington thrashes around impotently as per usual in Syria and though the jury remains out on this one looks to have poor prospects If WashingtonAKA New Yorkloses here after doing so in Iraq Libya Somalia and Afghanistan the Empire will beyond redemption be on the downward slope The United States is not in danger The Empire is This is not good Empires the Soviet Union notwithstanding seldom go quietly Either Washington gambles on war of some sort against Russia or Russia and China in the desperate hope of reversing things or the Empire gets slowly eaten Or not so slowly Once one country pries itself loose many may rush for the door New York may go for calculated war against Russiasay cyberwar expected not to turn into shooting war shooting war in Syria not expected to turn into global shooting war global shooting war not expected to turn into nuclear war This will be a crapshoot Note that America has badly misguessed the outcomes of every war since Korea This is why the American election actually matters unusual in Presidential contests It is Blowhard against Corruption a swell choice but Trump is firmly against war with Russia and Hillary for Her military understanding is that of a fried egg The woman is both a fool and a knave but it seems Trump has talked trash and therefore she will likely be President Weirdly the future of the world depends on how an excited electorate of political middleschoolers responds to one candidates dirty talk From a curmudgeons point of view it is pretty funny It is funnier if one lives outside of the radiation footprint But back to business The seaboard Axis of Evil needs a war because almost every tide runs against it Proximately the Axis has pushed China Russia and Iran together against the Empire First rule of empire Do not let the dissidents unite Many signs suggest that the world or much of it is beginning to see China as its future The BRICS the SCO the NDB the AAIBall exclude the US China becomes the major trading partner of country after country The twilight deepens Not all goes wrong for the Empirenot yet but things are getting spooky On the European Peninsula of Asia countries remain docile especially England and much more importantly Germany Yet even among Washingtons European harem there seem to be faint stirrings of a forgotten independence As I understand it Germanys businessmen would very much like to end Washingtons sanctions on Russia and improve trade with China which would be greatly to the benefit of the Peninsula Washington wont let them It cant If the Europeans did what would be good for themselves and looked to Eurasia then the fat lady already warming up would burst into full bellow Which methinks raises the likelihood that Washington will in desperation do something phenomenally stupid At this writing Hillarys camp seems to be prepping the public for war with Russia The telescreen tells us day after day that Putin is Hitler that Russia is expanding that the Russkies are hacking the election that they cause indigestion and falling hair Is this just Hillary waggling her codpiece in the expectation that Moscow will demurely back down as God intended Or will she again send other peoples children to fight for her in somebody elses country The larger picture assuredly obvious to New York is truly grimfor New York not for Americans China has a huge population of a billion Han Chinese versus two hundred million Caucasian Americansthese being the scientific technological and entrepreneurial brains of the Empire One must not notice this but you can bet that New York and Beijing do Economically China is growing hugely advancing technologically at a high rate building rail lines that now extend from the Chinese Pacific coast to Madrid It will increasingly dwarf the Empire no matter what happensshort of a world war The curtain falls in ways unnoticed China recently launched a communications satellite the worlds first employing quantum cryptographic links which cannot be intercepted The intention of this as well of the QC link from Beijing to Shanghai is to keep the NSA off Chinas back A small thing perhaps Yet if successful and adopted en masse by other countries weary of Washingtons meddling the result will be a loosening of the Empires grip on everybodys communications For the Empire it is as Elvis sang now or never Lenin
