CNN The thing about women Donald J Trump once wrote is that they have one of the great acts of all timeThe smart ones act very feminine and needy but inside they are real killers he continued The person who came up with the expression the weaker sex was either very nave or had to be kidding I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye  or perhaps another body partThe provocative passage along with several others is contained in a chapter devoted to women in Trumps 1997 book The Art of the ComebackHis words on women have newfound relevance in 2016 as Trumps enigmatic relationship with the opposite sex is front and center in his campaign for PresidentThe comments play on potential vulnerabilities for his likely general election opponent  but they also highlight Trumps own significant hurdles with female voters as he tries to win their votes in NovemberHe went on to connect Clinton with her husbands marital indiscretionsIn a testy exchange he told Cuomo he raised the issue as retribution for Clinton playing the womans card to the hilt in the campaignTrump raised that notion last week during his victory speech in New York suggesting her appeal to female voters based solely on gender was her only assetShes got nothing else going on he saidThe intense scrutiny of the campaign has also renewed interest in Trumps crude banter about his sexual conquests and desires on Howard Sterns radio showHis controversial remarks then and during the 2016 campaign have taken a toll on his image among female votersThe women standing by himBut for all the women who have voiced their collective disapproval in polling numbers those closest to the billionaire businessman insist hes a model husband and father  supportive nurturing and empoweringSome women who have worked for Trump offer a similar assessment Despite his controversial public comments he is a giving and inspirational boss they say and treats female employees no differently than their male counterpartsStill it is difficult to paint a full portrait of Trumps dealings with women because many who have worked with him over the years have no interest in talking publicly about a candidate who has shown no hesitation in striking back at his criticsA number of Trumps former female colleagues contacted by CNN did not return calls Some refused to talk on the record One prominent former Trump colleague hung up abruptly on a reporter explaining that she had no interest in being hounded by the pressHence the lingering question Whats the deal with Donald Trump and womenThe perception that Trump has a problem with females stems in part from highprofile clashes over the years in which hes called them names and ridiculed their appearanceTrump has said he loves women finds them beautiful and is not a sexistTwice divorced by the time the book was published Trumps views on women were shaped by what he saw as the aggressive behavior of females around himHe wrote of a married socialite who propositioned him on a ballroom dance floor as her husband looked on and about a bridetobe jumping on top of me wanting to get screwed in his limousine a week before she was due to be marriedThe level of aggression was unbelievable he wrote of the dance floor incident This is not infrequent it happens all the timeTheir sex drive makes us look like babies he wrote of women at another point in the same bookLiving up to his motherTrump opened the chapter on women by writing that part of the problem he has with them is having to compare them to my incredible mother Mary TrumpHe recalled his mom as smart as hell and as a really great homemaker and wife to my fatherHe came to see his mothers supporting role as a model not just for his own situation but for any man who wants to succeedFor a man to be successful he needs support at home just like my father had from my mother not someone who is always griping and bitching he wrote When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cordThe passage did not explore the possibility of a woman as the familys primary wageearnerTrump wrote that his big mistake with his first wife Ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City then the Plaza hotelShe did an excellent job at both he wrote but once she took on those roles work was all she wanted to talk aboutI will never again give a wife responsibility within my business Trump wrote Ivana worked very hard and I appreciate the effort but I soon began to realize that I was married to a business person rather than a wifeOn the campaign trail in 2016 Trump has said his wife Melania would make a great first ladyMelania Trump a former model who has designed her own jewelry line for QVC has emerged as an important advocate for her husband driving the argument that he treats everyone equallyShe has spoken about the importance of her career but described herself in an interview with Parenting Magazine as a fulltime mom to her son Barron That is my first jobMelania has tried to explain the paradox of Trump and women by saying that when her husband is attacked He will attack back no matter who you areHe encourages everybody if youre a man or a woman she said during an April 12 Trump family CNN town hallHis daughter Ivanka a successful businesswoman in her own right said during the CNN town hall that he taught her that there wasnt anything that I couldnt do if I set my mind to it She also praised him for hiring incredible female role models in the highest executive positions at the Trump organizationBut Trump has repeatedly stumbled into controversy with his asides about women over the past year and his approval numbers among women have spiraled downwardThe Republican Party was already facing a deficit among women voters In 2012 Barack Obama led Mitt Romney among female voters by about 11 points  with a particularly steep deficit among single women Romney beat Obama by 7 points among married women who have generally viewed the GOP more favorablyIn a March Quinnipiac University poll 60 of women said they would not vote for Trump in a general election  a reflection of his poor approval ratings among women in a wide variety of national pollsHis campaign manager Corey Lewandowski predicted Trumps image among women would improve as the campaign progressed His aides have pointed out that he trounced his rivals among Republican women in recent GOP primaries including Pennsylvania Maryland and Connecticut though that is hardly a good measure of how he would fare in a general electionDonald Trumps numbers are going to be strong with women because they want the same thing that everybody else wants Lewandowski said in a telephone interviewThey dont vote based on gender They vote on competency  and that competency includes making sure that the nation is secure which Donald Trump has pledged he will do making sure we dont have illegal immigrants pouring across the border and making sure individuals have opportunities for jobsThose are the things that cut across socioeconomic status they cut across gender they cut across raceBeyond focusing on those broad themes however Trump has done little to try to shore up his weaknesses among women votersHis various stumbles havent helped He angered both abortionrights supporters and opponents for example when he said during an MSNBC town hall that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawedand then quickly reversed himselfHis personal critiques of womens looks on the campaign trail have been pointedWhen an antiTrump super PAC cut an ad that used a revealing photo of Melania from her days as a super model Trump blamed Cruz Be Careful Lyin Ted or I will spill the beans on your wife he tweetedHe offended some female voters when he retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz a Goldman Sachs executive next to Melania A picture is worth a thousand words the caption saidAngered by the tweets Cruz warned his thenadversary to leave Heidi the hell alone and told reporters Strong women scare DonaldTrump insisted the press stirred up the controversy The media is so after me on women the real estate magnate tweeted on March 26 Wow this is a tough business Nobody has more respect for women than Donald TrumpBut female voters seem increasingly skeptical as Trump prepares to take on Hillary Clinton who is running to be the first female presidentSome women who have worked for Trump say they find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements and written opinions with the way he treated themJill Cremer worked as a vice president overseeing real estate development at the Trump Organization for a decade beginning in 1998She said it was a hard decision to leave and she only learned after working elsewhere just how good shed had itHe was a fantastic employer said Cremer still a realestate executive in Manhattan I dont have one bad thing to say about himShe said Trump ran the office as a meritocracy and was refreshingly unconcerned about educational pedigreesThough she went to work for Trump at the relatively young age of 30 she said he put her on projects that challenged her and forced her to growHed say I believe in you Im gonna give you this  now go run with it Cremer recalledAnd I did it she saidCremer said Trump has made some cringeworthy public comments involving women over the years but she said he never talked that way to her or in her presenceI dont know how to explain it she said But when youre on the inside its differentLili Amini who manages Trumps golf club in Palos Verdes offered a similar description of her billionaire bossAmini who was identified by a Trump campaign aide as a female employee who could talk about his management style said she met Trump in 2005 when she accompanied her father to work at the sprawling resort overlooking the Pacific Ocean Her parents owned a flower business and maintained the plants and flowers at the Trump facilityShe was 27 at the time and studying to be a buyer in the fashion worldShe said Trump walked up and asked her father Whos thisHe introduced his daughter and the two struck up a conversation By the end of it Amini recalled Trump told her I want you to work hereShe said she didnt know anything about running a food and beverage operation at the time and didnt even know what job she was being offered But after discussing the offer with her parents she decided it was too good to pass upShe started out as the small events coordinator and with Trumps mentoring and support has worked her way to general managerShe said Trump would periodically show up at the resort and each time he did would encourage her to learn everything she could about some new aspect of the businessHe was always encouraging she said and always professional He taught her she said to never doubt herself Hes been a great motivator she said Impossible is never a word that I use in my vocabularyAmini said Trump never made her feel like she got the job because she was a woman or that she was being secondguessed based on her gender after she rose through the ranksIts just about the work she said Its always about the workTrump received more mixed reviews from Barbara Res who worked for Trump from 1978 to 1996 and helped oversee the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth AvenueRes said she had good working relationship with Trump and that it was an unusual move for him to hire her in 1978 because there were so few women working in the construction industryBut Res who wrote about her experiences in her book All Alone on the 68th Floor How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction said Trump became less approachable and accessible over timeIn an essay for the New York Daily News Res wrote that Trump was nasty to the people who work for him that he could be very abusive and curt and had an incredible temper  he lashes out at everyoneOf all the people I know who worked for or with Trump including contractors lawyers architects employees only a very few actually like him Res wrote in the New York Daily News Some respect him some dont Many hate his gutsBut she said he had a good eye for talent and had several strong women working for him in her heyday He told her she was a killer and that wanting to be liked by her subordinates was a weaknessLater he would hire and promote many people with questionable qualifications Res wrote in her New York Daily News essay I could see over time his growing need to be coddled and agreed with she wrote adding that by the 1980s he had taken to decorating his office with beautiful womenHe changed Res said in a telephone interview I think it was fame and fortune absolutelyIn his book Trump wrote I dont know why but I seem to bring out either the best or worst in womenHe reiterated that theyre really a lot different than portrayed and far worse than men far more aggressiveHe praised their intelligence and said they should be saluted for their tremendous power which most men are afraid to admit they have
