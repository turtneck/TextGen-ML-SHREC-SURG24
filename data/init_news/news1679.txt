FBI Investigates Saudi WifeAbusing Clinton Foundation Donor in Straw Donor Scheme November 2 2016 Daniel Greenfield Its midnight in America And the Clintons and the Democratic Party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory Im sure the line on this will be that the FBI is acting inappropriately by investigating this Investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected The FBI is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy Saudi family that supports Democratic Florida Senate candidate Patrick Murphy Murphy who has covered himself in glory so often already is denying everything And I mean absolutely everything The Murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the FBI probe Whats your name I decline to answer that question Murphy 33 is running against Rubio the incumbent Republican in a race that could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017 Rubio currently leads Murphy by an average of 56 percentage points according to RealClearPolitics The FBI investigation however relates to Murphys first run for the House in the 2012 campaign cycle The allegation  originally submitted by a Republican super PAC run by a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy  is that Murphys high school friend and major political donor Ibrahim AlRashid coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost Murphy Murphy knows nothing Murphys campaign declined to say whether Murphys attorneys had discussed the FBI investigation with AlRashids attorney Uhhuh AlRashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected Saudi billionaire Hes been a major financial benefactor of Murphys giving almost 400000 to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the Florida congressman Heres how some of these donations worked One example within the alleged scheme A woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a Texasbased company Limestone Property Management gave Murphys campaign 300 But she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the Texasbased company In fact she doesnt work there She lived in Miami at the time and was Ibrahim AlRashids cleaning lady according to a MiamiDade Police Department report filed in 2012 over a home burglary at AlRashids property Texas property manager vs Saudis cleaning lady Thats quite a difference Murphy has been forced to return AlRashids donations before for purely Islamophobic reasons AlRashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps contributing large sums to top Democrats including Rep Patrick Murphy D Fla whose Senate race could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017 Murphy has already returned a portion of alRashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident Ibrahim alRashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes Pennsylvania home where alRashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground according to a copy of the police report viewed by the Free Beacon Following the 2014 incident alRashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating I am not sorry this time I hope you die in hell according to the police report Murphy a longtime friend of alRashid was recently forced to donate around 16000 in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign Murphy also returned all of the donations made by alRashid during the last three political cycles Is the Clinton Foundation involved in this Do the Clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets Nasser alRashid one of Saudi Arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family has donated somewhere between 1 million to 5 million to the Clinton Foundation putting him in an elite category of prominent donors The Clintons If theres dirt anywhere youll find it on them
