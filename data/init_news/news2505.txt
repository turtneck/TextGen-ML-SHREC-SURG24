There was an unfamiliar buzz on the debate stage here Thursday night the sound of Republican presidential candidates engaging in a sober discussion of policy rather than savaging each otherTheir 12th debate took a markedly different tone as Donald Trumps remaining three rivals prepare for a crucial round of primaries next week that could represent their last chance of stopping him on his march to the GOP nominationWhile there were sharp exchanges they were over Social Security visa programs for foreign workers how to fix the veterans healthcare system policy toward Cuba and the merits of free trade deals No one mentioned Little Marco Lyin Ted or the size of anyones handsWere all in this together Trump said Were going to come up with solutions Were going to find the answers to thingsAnd so far I cannot believe how civil its been up here the celebrity billionaire marveledThat was because each of them has something to prove and little time to do itTrump sought to project a command of issues and a temperament that is suited to the Oval Office rather than a reality showSen Marco Rubio of Florida was attempting to repair the damage that he has done to his reputation and his presidential prospects by baiting Trump with schoolyard tauntsSen Ted Cruz of Texas portrayed himself as an outsider like Trump  but one with greater intellectual depthAnd Gov John Kasich of Ohio emphasized his bluecollar roots and his governing experience  the latter commodity being one that thus far has not found a market in this years discontented electorateTrumps opponents drew pointed yet substantive contrasts with the frontrunner over his view that many Muslims around the world hate the United States Cruz Rubio and Kasich argued that Trumps rhetoric unnecessarily and dangerously alienates many peaceful followers of Islam the worlds secondlargest religionI know that a lot of people find appealing the things that Donald says because he says what people wish they could say Rubio said The problem is presidents cant just say whatever they want They have consequences here and around the worldTrump countered that Rubio and other politicians espouse a political correctness and diplomatic tone that endangers AmericansMarco talks about consequences Trump said Well weve had a lot of consequences including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center the Pentagon and could have been the White House  You can be politically correct if you want I dont want to be politically correct I want to solve problems And we have a problem of hateRubio shot back Im not interested in being politically correct Im interested in being correctKasich said radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United StatesThey want to destroy everything were about Kasich said But he also noted that cultivating alliances of shared trust with such Muslim countries as Saudi Arabia and Jordan is critical to the US mission of defeating Islamic State terroristsCruz agreed The answer is not simply to yell China bad Muslims bad Youve got to understand the nature of the threats were facing and how you deal with themA clear difference emerged on Social Security with Trump vowing not to tinker with the popular federal retirement program and other candidates arguing that the system requires a sweeping overhaul including pushing back the retirement age to avert a future debt crisisI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security  to leave it the way it is to make this country rich again to bring back our jobs to get rid of deficits to get rid of waste fraud and abuse which is rampant in this country Trump saidRubio said Trumps promise is unrealistic The numbers dont add up the senator said a line he repeated again and againThe bottom line is we cant just continue to tiptoe around this and throw out things like Im going to get at fraud and abuse Rubio said You still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that youre going to have to make up And heres the thing If we do not do it we will have a debt crisisCruz sounded a similar call Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency and its irresponsible And any politician that doesnt step forward and address it is not being a real leaderTrump was challenged on the fact that even as he has railed against the effects of international trade and immigration he has profited from hiring foreign workers and manufacturing clothing in China and MexicoIm a businessman These are laws These are regulations These are rules Were allowed to do it Trump said So I will take advantage of it theyre the laws But Im the one that knows how to change it Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do believe meCruz and Rubio meanwhile stressed the importance of distinguishing between trade deals that help the economy and US workers and those that do notWere getting killed in international trade right now Cruz said And were getting killed because we have an administration that doesnt look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas Were driving jobs overseasTrump so far has won GOP contests in 15 states He has accumulated about 458 Republican delegates which is 99 more than his closest rival Cruz To win the nomination a candidate needs 1237 delegatesSome GOP leaders including 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney are vowing never to vote for the man who appears increasingly likely to be their partys standardbearer in November There is also more talk of a contested party convention in July in which GOP leaders might engineer a way of awarding the nomination to someone elseThe billionaire mogul used his opening statement to send a message to those who would stand in his way Join the movementOne of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party Trump said Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and theyre voting Theyre voting out of enthusiasm Theyre voting out of love  Frankly the Republican establishment or whatever you want to call it should embrace whats happeningTrump also took a more statesmanlike tone when he was asked about violence at his rallies which has included protesters being roughed upI certainly do not condone that at all he saidThere is some anger Trump said of the supporters who show up to cheer him Theres also great love for the country Its a beautiful thingKasich however suggested that the tone of Trumps rallies speaks to a larger problem I worry about the violence at a rally period the Ohio governor said The unity of this country really mattersThe race will reach what could be an inflection point next week with primaries in five states including closely watched Florida and OhioThey are mustwin for homestate candidates Rubio and Kasich And for the first time delegates will be awarded on a winnertakeall basis which means that if his rivals cannot curb Trumps momentum he will accelerate on his path to the nominationThursdays debate at the University of Miami sponsored by CNN The Washington Times and Salem Radio Network was the last time they would all be on the same stage before the next round of primariesA field that numbered nearly 20 candidates in their first faceoff in August  so many that the debate had to be split into a main event and an undercard  has shrunk to fourTrump has led nearly without interruption since then and he has set the pace and tone to the dismay of an increasingly impotent Republican establishmentRubio tried to put the brakes on Trump and to get under his skin by adopting the billionaires own tactics Starting at a debate in Houston on Feb 25 he unleashed a barrage of personal insults At one point he made a joke about the size of Trumps hands that also suggested his genitalia are smallBut it backfired as Rubio lost 18 of the next 20 contestsAt the end of the day its not something Im entirely proud of Rubio acknowledged Wednesday My kids were embarrassed by it and if I had to do it again I wouldntOn Thursday night the adults took a lesson from the kidsDavid A Fahrenthold in Washington contributed to this report
