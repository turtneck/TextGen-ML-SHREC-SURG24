As of this month the unemployment rate is now lower than it was at any point during Ronald Reagans administrationThat said the labor force participation rate has fallen since Reagans day Thats mostly about population aging  there are a lot more retired people now than there used to be  and a little bit about more people being in college but that doesnt fully explain it The labor force participation rate of primeaged men between the ages of 25 and 55 has been steadily declining for decades and in the past 10 years the participation rate for primeaged women has fallen slightly as well
