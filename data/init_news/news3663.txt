As the Supreme Court prepares to take up samesex marriage next week conservative scholars have produced a lastditch argument to keep the scourge of homosexual unions from spreading across the land Gay marriage killsTheyre saying that legalizing samesex marriage will cause 900000 abortionsThe logic is about as obvious as if they had alleged that raising the minimum wage would increase the frequency of hurricanes If anything youd think that more samesex marriages would mean more adoptionsBut comes now Gene Schaerr unsuccessful lawyer for Utah in that states case against samesex marriages to file an amicus brief with the Supreme Court on behalf of 100 scholars of marriageOn the surface abortion and samesex marriage may seem unrelated Schaerr acknowledged in a post on the Heritage Foundation Web site in advance of a presentation he made to the conservative think tank Monday But the two are closely linked in a short and simple causal chainTo wit Legalizing samesex marriage devalues marriage and causes fewer heterosexual couples to marry which leads to a larger number of unmarried women who have abortions at higher rates than married women As a result Schaerr wrote nearly 900000 more children of the next generation would be aborted as a result of their mothers never marrying This is equal to the entire population of the cities of Sacramento and Atlanta combinedCase closed Or at least it would be if Schaerrs causal chain were real He freely acknowledged that he had no causeandeffect proof when I asked him about it at Heritage on MondayIt is still too new to do a rigorous causation analysis using statistical methods he admitted saying that he had found only a decline in marriage rates in states that had legalized samesex marriage in fact marriage rates have declined overall The brief doesnt even attempt to say conclusively that this reduction in marriage rates has been the result of adopting samesex marriage Schaerr said though there are theoretical reasons such causation might occurOr perhaps theological reasons When Schaerr quit his law firm last year to take the Utah case he wrote to colleagues that he was going to fulfill what I have come to see as a religious and family duty A colleague leaked his resignation letter to the Human Rights Campaign a gay rights groupUtah argued that legalizing samesex marriage would lead to lower birth rates pointing out that some of the states with the lowest birth rates such as Massachusetts Vermont and Connecticut had samesex marriage and some of the highest birthrate states such as Texas and Utah did notBut the national birth rate has been declining for years from 142 per 1000 people in 2006 to 124 in 2013 Texas and Utah actually had larger drops than Massachusetts Vermont and ConnecticutUtah lost its case but Schaerr  a former clerk to Antonin Scalia  is now making a similar argument claiming to show drops in marriage rates in the years after states adopted samesex marriageHeritages Ryan Anderson appearing with Schaerr on Monday afternoon went even further than Schaerrs conclusions in alleging that every nation and every state that have redefined marriage have seen their marriage rates decline by at least 5 percent after that redefinition even as the marriage rates in the rest of the states remain stableThe national marriage rate declined to 68 per 1000 in 2012 from 80 in 2002 before Massachusetts became the first state to legalize gay marriage The Massachusetts rate dropped from 59 in 2002 to 55 in 2011 while Connecticut went from 57 to 55 and Vermont went from 86 to 83 But Texas and Utah free of samesex marriage dropped from 84 to 71 and from 104 to 86 respectivelyFred Sainz vice president of the Human Rights Campaign accused Schaerr of cherrypicking his statistics But though the numbers are dubious Schaerrs argument has the useful purpose of switching the debate away from samesex marriage  on which public opinion is shifting decidedly against conservatives  and toward abortion where positions are hardenedSchaerr had other arguments too He asserted that Abraham Lincoln would find it preposterous that the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection would be used to justify samesex marriageWhat Lincoln would think in 2015 is unknowable  but such considerations did not deter Schaerr He also speculated that an unemployed man who got his girlfriend pregnant in a state that had legalized samesex marriage would be more likely to conclude that Im not going to assume these obligations to this woman and this childFrom that idle speculation all it takes is a slippery slope and an active imagination to get to 900000 abortionsRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
