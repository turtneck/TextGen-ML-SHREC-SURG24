Coincidentally the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades It doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate In 2012 workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney This year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top 01 percent The rest of us will be their servants The people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society Look to Mexico for your future  or any Third World country Or to Univisions Jorge Ramos The ruling class in Mexico is composed of Europeanlooking white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their Spanish names in return British settlers in America brought women with them Explaining Latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim The victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family One American detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing When it comes to multiculturalism you cant say We love the empanadas  but we dont want 40yearold men raping their nieces  This isnt an a la carte menu We get ALL the attributes of the cultures were importing As described in excruciating detail in Adios America The Lefts Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants Thus for example where I would have chosen the headline Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest Child Rape the Chattanooga Tenn Times Free Press went with the less catchy Man guilty in case of human smuggling And where I would have used the headline Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14yearold Girl at Job Site the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus Mississippi went with the more subtle Columbus resident charged with molestation Immigrant women arrive in America thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled In 1989 Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood The female head of the AsianAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund Margaret Fung applauded the ruling Somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing In 2013 a 13yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack When the news first broke Shaneequa Jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for Austin men Or Two Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  Two held in attack on child  Austin AmericanStatesman Texas July 19 2013  Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  Daily Mail Online July 24 2013 Needless to say the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegalalien gang rape at all The ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order Ann Coulters book In Trump We Trust E Pluribus Awesome By contrast the Times and every major American news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place The second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11 But she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex Those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press The defendants were AfricanAmerican The victim was Mexican That time there were articles in the Huffington Post GQ Slate Salon and Mother Jones It even made the New York Times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team Similarly within a few months of one another in 2013 two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur Alabama for assaults on 9yearold girls One suspect was AfricanAmerican the other was a Hispanic immigrant Only one made the newspaper Guess which one When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square another one of Hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men Conclusion The real problem was the female reporters American bosses and colleagues Definitely not Islam Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logans rape  Why We Need Women in War Zones I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  This attack also had nothing to do with Islam  Reporting While Female Women reporters face another set of challenges We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  In my experience Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment Perhaps American men could do better but as American women may soon discover They never had it so good Manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America They are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher Our country will be Zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the Democrats plan  theyll get to be Mugabe Thats Hillarys dream If she wins Joe Sobrans parody of the typical New York Times headline about anything will come true Women and Minorities Hit Hardest Receive Ann Coulters weekly commentaries in your email BONUS By
