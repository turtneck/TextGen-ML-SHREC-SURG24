Two weeks ago as Nick Gillespie reported in this space Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson said that it was game over if he was not included in the first 2016 presidential debate on Sept 26 Given that the DemocraticRepublicancontrolled nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates CPD will choose the debate roster in midSeptember based on a fiveagency polling average that currently sits at 88 percent well short of the required 15 percent for Johnson the irresistible force of the LPs debatecentric focus has been on a collision course with the immovable object of the CPDs unreasonably high threshold Until it seems this afternoonNo matter how much independentbent political celebrities such as Mitt Romney Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mitch Daniels support the LP ticket being included in the debates and no matter how much that motion is seconded by solid majorities of the American voting public rules are rules and when said rules are written by the Republican and Democratic parties Libertarians are screwed Unless vice presidential nominee William Weld told me this afternoon the mounting outrage at the rigged system is married to the sight of the two candidates outside every debate venue making a mockery of the proceedings inside by answering every question simultaneously only betterSo Im no longer so sure that its game over if were not in the debates Weld told me I think theres going to be kind of a national uproar if were not in the debates and we will join in that uproar and be standing together on the street corner outside every debate venue answering the same questions as in the debate in real time you know putting it out on Facebook LiveWeld made the same promise during his address at a midtown Manhattan rally this afternoon which was attended by 500plus enthusiastic supportersWeve seen that the little videos that we record in 90 seconds are seen by 15 18 million people in a matter of less than two weeks he told me so that kind of free media attention might continue all the way from now until November 8th as a result of our exclusion That would be a substitute at least in part for being in the debates and it would give us the high ground Its ground that I think we could occupy with some happiness
