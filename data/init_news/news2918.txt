Sure Bevin is better on the campaign trail than he was during his failed attempt to oust Sen Mitch McConnell in 2014 But as a recent piece about the race in the Atlantic made clear he still isnt good And while the voters of Kentucky are undoubtedly conservative a lookover of Bevins political history reveals a man on the wrong side of the line separating hyperconservative from radical fringeBut he won anyway And despite what preelection polls suggested the outcome wasnt even closeThis raises myriad questions for the Democratic Party both in Kentucky and the nation as a whole Most of those questions will center on the partys getoutthevote apparatus which increasingly seems to be useless for any election in which Barack Obama isnt a candidate In general I chalk that up to the decline of organized labor But Kentucky was never exactly Michigan In fact the state is something of an outlier recently when it comes to the nations larger deunionization trendRegardless of unions strength though Democrats had hoped that policy successes would inspire their constituents to come out and vote Specifically they hoped that Bevins vow to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky as much as he can that is would inspire the hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians whove benefited to vote for its protection By almost any metric after all Kynect  what they call the ACA in Kentucky  has been an inspirational successDemocrats hoped voters would reward the party for successfully implementing such a major policy But from todays vantage its painfully obvious that they didnt And thats not just a problem in the Bluegrass State  its a problem for all Democrats Because one of the foundational assumptions behind Kynect the ACA and much of the entire Democratic Party agenda is that good policy makes for good politics In Kentucky at least it didntWhat does good policy  good politics mean It basically means that an effective program can survive even if its unpopular at the outset Those who benefit the theory goes will eventually become a constituency if they arent already and will organize to preserve it Think of Social Security or Medicare They werent necessarily superpopular when they were first implemented but once people started relying on them they became the socalled third rail of American politics But as leftwing critics of the Democratic consensus have long argued theres a problem with analogizing the ACA and Social Security One of the programs is universal  everyone puts in everyone takes out  and the other isnt And this isnt incidental Its the reason why so many Tea Party types will rail against handouts but cherish their Medicare Its because they believe theyre simply receiving what theyre owed they arent and that the benefits go to them instead of goodfornothing moochers There are plenty of people in Kentucky right now who are better off because of the ACA But many of them are beneficiaries of the laws Medicaid expansion which Bevin has promised to change if not revoke and thus lack political influence And the rest As far as many of them know its not the ACA or Obamacare that they now rely on Its Kynect And Bevin didnt campaign against Kynect He campaigned against Obamacare Kentucky Democrats got the policy right in other words but it never paid political dividends In fairness its too early to say the debate is over If Bevin tries to make good on his promises and is greeted with a backlash he may trim his sails or abandon the initiative Still its not like Democrats didnt spend much of the campaign warning about Bevins plans for health care in Kentucky They did  a lot It didnt make a difference
