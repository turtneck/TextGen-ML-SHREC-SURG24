Elections 2016 Top democrats have repeatedly waved off substantial questions arising from their hacked emails by falsely implying that some of them are forgeries created by Russian hackers The problem with that is that no one has found a single case of anything forged among the information released from hacks of either Clinton campaign or Democratic Party officials Clinton strategist Joel Benenson asked about an email in which Clinton campaign staffers decide to accept foreign lobbyist money used that line on MSNBC on Sunday These emails we have no idea whether theyre authentic or not he said Or whether theyve been tampered with I know Ive seen things that arent authentic that we know arent authentic and its not surprising Jennifer Granholm a senior adviser to the proClinton Super PAC Correct the Record was asked by CNNs Jake Tapper whether the Clinton campaign should be responding to revelations revealed by Wikileaks There are reports that these have been doctored she told Tapper on October 19 And Newsweek had found that in fact that was happening In an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer on October 18 Rep Adam Schiff DCalif a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee was asked if the Russian government would impact the election by hacking voting systems What worries me the most  is between now and the election the Russians dump information that is fabricated Schiff warned To get a last minute dump of emails that contain fabricated emails that are widely reported in the press and there isnt enough time to fact check and demonstrate the forgery that is what really concerns me CNN host Wolf Blitzer pushed back But have you confirmed that any of these emails released over the past two weeks if you will by Wikileaks are fabricated or doctored You know Im not in a position to be able to do that Schiff demurred Everything considered the conclusion has to be that Wikileaks emails are probably authentic and if they werent they would have been disproven a long long time ago The question is if are you willing to vote for a person that we saw in the emails is capable of doing very bad dirty stuff And if the answer is yes then this country has a BIG BIG PROBLEM If Clinton Campaign Believes WikiLeaks Emails Are Forged Why Dont They Prove It Share this
