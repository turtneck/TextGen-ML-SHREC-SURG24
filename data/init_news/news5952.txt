Republicans face a lot of difficult decisions this year but for the party to come back strong after Donald Trumps divisive candidacy  for it to keep its brand as the freemarket democracyloving opportunityfocused alternative to the Democrats  the leastworst option is a major loss in the presidential raceBy selecting a nominee that does not reflect the usual fiscal policies a victory for Trump will mean a shift in the partys focus Even if the rest of the GOP holds fast to the platform or to traditional conservative values the presidents policies always reshape the partyIf you have ever promoted a local candidate to voters you know this is true  the public looks at the top of the ticket first and judges the party by that persons views Many Trump supporters will see his win as a referendum on their policies and will work to make the party reflect that Fellow Republicans will either need to accept that or leave We have no idea what a Trump presidency will look like but based on his campaign it will be filled with outrageous gaffes inarticulate interviews on policy and offensive media blitzes focused on nonissues Trump will most likely lose minorities and women creating a wider divide that the GOP must bridge in the future Many young voters will continue to associate Trump with the party long after he leaves office This would only further damage Republicans and set us up for heavy losses in 2018Not to mention the party will continue to hemorrhage its best and brightest Candidates staff and volunteers have already walked away from Trump and theres no question it will keep happening If Trump gains a greater control of the party these people might even be forced outBut lets say Trump doesnt win and Hillary Clinton claims the White House If Trump only trails her by a few points you can bet he will blame the Republicans who voted their conscience Or hell kick up dirt over the rigged system as he has already alluded to Trump supporters in the party will go on a witch hunt looking for anyone who acted disloyally to the Republican nominee That infighting could destroy the party
