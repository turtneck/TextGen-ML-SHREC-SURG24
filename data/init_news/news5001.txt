Washington CNN White House hopefuls on both sides of the political aisle on Saturday hailed the prisoner swap between the US and Iran though Republicans said the exchange took too long and served as a reminder that the longtime US foe isnt trustworthyWashington Post reporter Jason Rezaian former Marine Amir Hekmati pastor Saeed Abedini and Nosratollah KhosraviRoodsari were released from Iranian custody in exchange for seven Iranians who were not convicted of violent crimes but of violating the sanctions ban against Iran senior administration officials told CNN A fifth American Matthew Trevithick is also being released by Iran US officials said but they said his release was not part of the negotiated prisoner swapGOP frontrunner Donald Trump speaking at a campaign event in Portsmouth New Hampshire criticized the Iranian nuclear deal which he claimed will send 150 billion to IranNow I have to see what the deal is for the four people because someone said they were getting seven back So essentially they get 150 billion plus seven and we get four Doesnt sound too good Doesnt sound too good he said I am happy they are coming back but it is a disgrace they have been there this long a total disgraceSpeaking at the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention in Myrtle Beach South Carolina later Saturday Trump said he had something to do with the prisoners releaseI have been hitting the Obama administration very hard And I think I might have had something to do with it You want to know the truth  its part of my staple thing  I go crazy when I hear about this he saidTrumps top rival Texas Sen Ted Cruz said hes glad the prisoners were released but is worried about the details of the exchangeWe dont know the details of the deal that is bringing them home and it may well be there are some very problematic aspects to this deal Cruz told reporters in Fort Mill South Carolina But at least this morning I am giving thanks that Pastor Saeed is coming home It is far later than it should have been but we will be glad to welcome him home with open armsFlorida Sen Marco Rubio  who last spring joined 20 other senators in penning a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry saying that the Obama administration should push for the prisoners release as part of the Iran nuclear deals negotiations  said at a town hall in Johnston Iowa that situation tells us all we need to know about the Iranian regimeIf these reports are true of course we are happy for them and their families but they should never have been there he said adding that Iran takes people hostage in order to take concessions And the fact that they can get away with it in this administration is one of the reasons  has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the worldIn an interview with CNN Kentucky Sen Rand Paul called Abedini an incredibly brave manFor years we have advocated for the release of Saeed Abedini Ive sent repeated letters to the administration encouraging them to advocate for his release hoping wed pressure Iran for his release he said Were excited hes coming home I think hes an incredibly brave man to advocate for Christianity and to risk his life in the processFormer Florida Gov Jeb Bush said in Amherst New Hampshire that if he were president he would have threatened Iran with military action over the prisonersI would say  if you do not release them that theres going to be military action that thats an act of provocation an act of war What I would do in January is recognize that Iran is not an ally Thats how the Obama administration views this Bush saidRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he was overjoyed for the prisoners families but said the fact remains that President Obamas nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people our ally Israel and other peaceful nations in the Middle East and around the worldFormer Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum said the deal should give each of us pauseFirst we are returning criminals back to Iran in return for freeing innocent Americans Under no rational analysis is that a fair deal Santorum said in a statement Second this exchange proves that Iran is no friend and continues to get the upper hand in negotiations with the Obama Administration As I said in Thursdays debate Barack Obamas deal with Iran must be shredded and I intend to do that on day one of my presidencyAnd former Arkansas Gov Mike Huckabee while praising the release of Abedini asked why it took the Obama administration so long to negotiate his releaseHe never should have been jailed and its embarrassing that John Kerry and Obama negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans remained lockedup in prison Huckabee said in a statement President Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country thats been lying cheating murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a 150 billion check to Adolf Hitler hoping hell play nice and behave This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mindBut Democrats including Hillary Clinton lauded the announcement with the frontrunner saying she is greatly relieved that Iran released the American prisonersTheir families and our country have waited and prayed for this day to come she said in a statement But we shouldnt thank Iran for the prisoners or for following through on its obligations These prisoners were held unjustly by a regime that continues to threaten the peace and security of the Middle EastVermont Sen Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley meanwhile said the exchange represented progress in relations between Washington and TehranThis good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world Sanders said
