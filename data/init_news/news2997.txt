Think like the enemy Lets suppose I am an Islamic State terrorist I dont do bombs or bullets I leave the dirty work to the crazies in the basement My job is what happens next It is to turn carnage into consequences body parts into politics I am a consultant terrorist I wear a suit not explosives A bloodstained concourse is a means to an end The end is powerThis week I had another success I converted a squalid psychopathological act into a warriorevoking populationterrifying policychanging event I sent a continent into shock Famous politicians dropped everything to shower me with cliches Crowned heads deluged me with glorious odiumI measure my success in column inches and television hours in ballooning security budgets butchered liberties amended laws and  my ultimate goal  Muslims persecuted and recruited to our cause I deal not in actions but in reactions I am a manipulator of politics I work through the idiocies of my supposed enemiesTextbooks on terrorism define its effects in four stages first the horror then the publicity then the political grandstanding and finally the climactic shift in policy The initial act is banal The atrocities in Brussels happen almost daily on the streets of Baghdad Aleppo and Damascus Western missiles and Isis bombs kill more innocents in a week than die in Europe in a year The difference is the media response A dead Muslim is an unlucky mutt in the wrong place at the wrong time A dead European is frontpage newsSo on Tuesday the TV news channels behaved like Isis recruiting sergeants Their blanket hyperbole showed not the slightest restraint nor for that matter did that of most newspapers The BBC flew Huw Edwards to Brussels It flashed horror across the airwaves continually for 24 hours incanting the words panic threat menace and terror Vox pops wallowed in blood and guts One reporter rode a London tube escalator to show possible future targets to scare the wits out of commuters It was a terrorists wildest dreamWith the ground thus prepared the politicians entered on cue Frances President Hollande declared all of Europe has been hit megaphoning Isiss crime His approval rating immediately jumpedDavid Cameron dived into his Cobra bunker and announced the UK faces a very real terror threat An attack is now highly likely according to the security services Flags fly at halfmast The Eiffel Tower is decked in Belgian colours President Obama interrupts his Cuba visit to stand in solidarity with Belgium Donald Trump declares that Belgium and France are literally disintegrating It is hard to imagine what could more effectively promote the Isis causeOsama bin Laden set out on 911 to depict western nations as feckless and paranoid their liberalism a surface charade easily punctured A few explosions and their pretensions would wither and they would turn as repressive as any Muslim stateBy Tuesday evening such a feeding frenzy was in full flood as the security lobby piled in Camerons snoopers charter or investigatory powers bill was lauded as vital to national security This is despite continued opposition both in parliament and from intelligence experts This month in the Times former NSA technical director Bill Binney ridiculed the bills incredibly intrusive powers of untargeted interception Each citizens browsing history will soon be in the possession of the government vulnerable to hacking by every marketer and blackmailer in the landUnder the governments Prevent strategy universities and schools must develop programmes to counter nonviolent extremism which can create an atmosphere conducive to terrorism The bureaucracy will be awesome Primary schools are reportedly asking children to spy on one another to check suspicious behaviour So must passengers on Virgin trains as requested after each station England is becoming old East GermanyThe Brexit camp in the person of Ukips Nigel Farage claims that Brussels proves the need to leave Europe The home secretary Theresa May says the opposite Terrorists would roam free she says since it would take 143 days to process terrorist DNA samples as against 15 minutes in the EUReacting to terrorist incidents otherwise in ways that do not play into terrorisms hands may seem hard A free media feels a duty to report events as politicians feel a duty to show they can protect the public That its hard to show restraint is no excuse for actively promoting terror Everyone involved in this weeks reaction from journalists to politicians to security lobbyists has an interest in terrorism There is money big money to be made  the more terrifying it is presented the more moneyWe can respond to events in Brussels with a quiet and dignified sympathy with candles and silences To downplay something is not to ignore it The terrorists have specific aims deploying their atrocities for a political cause There is no sensible defence in a free society against atrocity But there is a defence against its purpose It is to avoid hysteria to show caution and a measure of courage not Camerons lapse into public fear It is not to alter laws not to infringe liberties not to persecute MuslimsDuring the more dangerous and consistent IRA bombing campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s Labour and Conservative governments insisted on treating terrorism as criminal not political They relied on the police and security services to guard against a threat that could never be eliminated only diminished On the whole it worked and without undue harm to civil libertiesThose who live under freedom know it demands a price which is a degree of risk We pay the state to protect us  but calmly without constant boasting or fearmongering We know that in reality life in Britain has never been safer That it suits some people to pretend otherwise does not alter the factIn his admirable manual Terrorism How to Respond the Belfast academic Richard English defines the threat to democracy as not the limited danger of death and destruction It is the danger of provoking illjudged extravagant and counterproductive state responsesThe menace of Brussels lies not in the terror but in the reaction to the terror It is the reaction we should fear But liberty never emerges from a Cobra bunker
