Some people believe that Kentuckyor even all of Americashould be subject to biblical law rather than constitutional law They believe public servants like celebrity clerk Kim Davis owe their highest allegiance to the Bible which means they shouldnt be forced to give out unbiblical marriage licenseslike to gay couplesThe issue is contested by a host of liberals secularists Satanists and moderate ChristiansBut assuming that Bible believers and religious freedom advocates carry the day public servants will need to know their Good Book The following 15item quiz can be used to screen applicants

earth pass away not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplishedWhoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever keeps and teaches them he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven Matthew 5 1719 Stand firm If the Bible is the perfect Word of the living God your detractors are up against the Almighty himself And as thespiritual warfare hymnreminds us the hordes of liberal gay atheist feminist darkness cannot quench your light
