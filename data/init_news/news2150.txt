Close to the end of the March 25 testimony in the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev trial for his role in the April 25 2013 Boston Marathon bombing the government submitted a series of exhibits with chatsfrom the defendant Onedescribedwanting President Obama towin the Presidential election as the lesser of two evils but asserting killing Muslims is the only promise Obama or Mitt Romney will fulfill Onejokedabout sex even while discussing studying the Quran Another described transferring from UMass Dartmouth in reality Dzhokhar was already failing out joking about transferringto an Ivy League school but ending by saying I wanna bring justice for my people These were chatswith no context simply read by an FBI agent without even any guidance about withwhom Dzhokhar was chattingAbout the only one that made sense was one from December 25 2012 thatreadDoing something with Tamerlan Dzhokhars older brother who would go on to be killed in a police shoot out after the attack Ill hit you up in a bit broBut when the defense tried to introduce related chats noting how religiousTamerlan had become and explaining that the older brother had influenced Dzhokhar so much he had been sober for a month the witness said he wasnt sure it was about Dzhokhars older brotherIt was just an example of the degree to which the prosecution in the marathon trial are cherry picking narrowly fromthe complex cultural world of Dzhokhar aChechen immigrant who grew up steeped in American culture in Cambridge MATwice the prosecution got caught inefforts to cherry pick too narrowlyOn Tuesday terrorism consultant Matthew Levitt took the stand to decode the boat on which Dzhokhar hadtried to shed some light onhis and his brothers actions showing confidently how everything Dzhokhar wrote on the boat must have derived from propaganda he had read written by Anwar alAwlaki the YemeniAmerican cleric whose work has continued to exercise influence years after the US killed him in a drone strike But the defense got Levitt to admit that  along with not speaking Arabic  Levitt had only reviewed the Awlaki related materials from Dzhokhars computer considering neither the Quran nor Chechen culture in his analysis Levitt also admitted to being paid 450 an hour for analysis that consisted of connecting dots that came preselected for him from the prosecutionEvidence submitted by the defense onMarch 31revealedthat Dzhokhar had spent more time at Pornhub Craigslist Manga sites and free TV downloads than anything extremist though that doesnt account for what he was doing on Facebook or the Russian equivalent VKontakte the two sites where he spent most of his time The defense also submitted evidence that suggests someonemovedthe Al Qaeda magazine Inspire to Dzhokhars computer the morning he left for Russia on January 21 2012 which may have been an effort to clear it from Tamerlanscomputer before any border crossings where his computer might be searchedOn March 10 a different FBI Agent Stephen Kimball read and interpretedDzhokhars tweets I shall die young said oneSeptember 10thbaby you know whattomorrowis Party at my house After he had presented Dzhokhars online life as if everything presaged jihad defense attorney Miriam Conradexposedhow little he understood A Russian rap song a Comedy Central skit a soccer team all presented as something else Kimball hadnt even clicked through Dzhokhars links on some of the tweets which would have made the source clear Nor did he check pictures before hedeclareda picture of a mosque to be Mecca according to the defense it was actually Grozny Chechnyas capital He had until being called on it by the defense simply been parroting a narrative written by the prosecution And its not just Dzhokhars online life that has been reduced to one flat interpretation The defense briefly pointed out that a hard drive belonging to Tamerlan included Russian bombing materials in addition to Awlaki materials That was excluded from the testimony None of this has an impact on guilt or innocence It was him Dzhokhars lawyer Judy Clarke started her opening argument admitting her client had laid a bomb at the race that maimed and killed horribly Dzhokhar will surely spend the rest of his life in prison if hes not executed And yet the government has gone to great lengths to tell a simplistic story of two brothers who read someonline magazines by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula made somebombs in thekitchen once used by their mother and then killed threeand injured hundreds at the marathon this in spite of the fact that the prosecution has presented ambiguousevidence about how the most lethal bombs used at the marathon were made Dzhokhar  and in those moments whenhegets mentioned anymore Tamerlan  arepresented as foreign terrorists responding to Arabic propaganda not even Chechen ones because that doesnt fit the easy narrative the public is being presented All those parts of Dzhokhars raplistening dopesmoking life that make him a quintessential American have been left unmentioned Yet that American side to Dzhokhar committed this crime as surely as the propaganda written in Yemen did Again none of this will change the guilty verdict What it will do however is sustain a fiction the FBI and the prosecution seem to want to preserve badly that discovering terrorists even retroactively is a matter of simply decoding preselected dotsrather than complex understanding Discovering terrorists in this flattened narrative is about rooting out the foreign rather than discovering the terrorism that mightbevery much part of America
