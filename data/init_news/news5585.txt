WASHINGTON  Scientists are balking at major cuts to NASAs budget that the House Committee on Science Space and Technology approved last week cuts that critics say will imperil climate change research in the USThe committeeapproved 2016 and 2017 NASA budgets would cut the agencys earth science funding by at least 323 million Climate is a major part of the agencys earth science work and NASA plays an important role among government agencies in helping to develop our scientific understanding of how the planet worksThe budget contains two different funding possibilities aspirational and constrained Under both scenarios the budget would be cut significantly to figures lower than the 1947 billion that the Obama administration had requested for fiscal year 2016NASAs earth science program is funded at 1773 billion in FY2015 The request for FY2016 is 1947 billion Under the bills aspirational scenario it would receive 1450 billion in FY2016 Under the constrained scenario it would receive 1199 billion Using current funding and the aspirational scenario for FY2016 it would be an approximately 18 percent cut Compared to the Presidents request it would be a roughly 26 percent cut If the BCA caps are not removed and the constrained scenario plays out for FY2016 it would be about a 32 percent cut compared to current funding or a 38 percent cut compared to the Presidents requestThe supposed rationale for the committees cuts is that the members believe NASA should be focusing on space not on earth science Committee Chair Lamar Smith RTexas argued that the budget will restore balance and ensure the US continues to lead in space for the next 50 years The budget does allocate more funding to other areas of researchBut its also no secret that Smith is not into climate change Smith has referred to environmentalists and others who worry about climate change as global warming alarmists and criticized the media for not airing enough dissenting opinions on the subject He recently penned an oped for The Wall Street Journal that decried the climatechange religionInstead of letting political ideology or climate religion guide government policy we should focus on good science Smith wrote The facts alone should determine what climate policy options the US considersBut in practice funding decisions such as the one regarding NASAs earth science budget actually help ensure that government scientists are unable to discern new facts about the planet Thats what scores of earth scientists have been reiterating since the cuts were proposedNASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement that the budget guts our Earth science program and threatens to set back generations worth of progress in better understanding our changing climate and our ability to prepare for and respond to earthquakes droughts and storm eventsNASA leads the world in the exploration of and study of planets and none is more important than the one on which we live Bolden saidThe research performed and supported by the division helps us understand the world we live in and provide a basis for knowledge and understanding of natural hazards weather forecasting air quality and water availability among other concerns wrote Christine W McEntee executive director of the American Geophysical Union which represents space and earth scientists in a letter to the committee The applicability of these missions cannot be overstated given their impact on your constituentsDemocrats on the committee have also criticized the cut Its hard to believe that in order to serve an ideological agenda the majority is willing to slash the science that helps us have a better understanding of our home planet wrote committee member Rep Eddie Bernice Johnson DTexas in a column for The Hill last weekNor has Smith seemed particularly interested in learning more on the subject In his first year as chairman of the committee he held more hearings on aliens than on climate scienceAnd last fall when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  the preeminent international scientific body assessing climate science  released its latest report Smith dismissed it in an interview despite only having read the summaryWe dont know enough yet to make decisions that are going to hurt our economy or hurt the American people he argued adding Lets continue to gather the facts make sure the science is correct
