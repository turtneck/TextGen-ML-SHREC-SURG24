President Obama wants to accelerate by two years plans to acquire a new icebreaker and will ask Congress for money to build additional ones for the Coast Guard in an effort to keep up with ship traffic that is increasing as the Arctic waters off Alaska grow warmerThe president also said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and the Coast Guard will map and chart waters of the Bering Chukchi and Beaufort seas for which existing maps and charts are nonexistent or outdatedThe moves are nods toward Alaskan leaders  including Republican Sens Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan  who have been urging the administration to bolster the paltry ability of the Coast Guard to monitor the largest states 6640mile coastlineThe announcement late Monday night was an acknowledgment that the United States has fallen behind other nations especially Russia which possesses 40 icebreakers and has plans to add at least 11 moreThe White House said that after World War II the United States had seven icebreakers in its fleet  four under the Navy and three under the Coast Guard Today the United States has only two fully functional icebreakers and just one is a heavyduty icebreakerThe acquisition of a new icebreaker would happen in 2020 instead of 2022The announcements Monday night  after the presidents speech to senior ministers from Arctic nations  were also an acknowledgment that climate change is prompting a scramble for the rights to develop the Arctics largely untapped reserves of oil natural gas and minerals In 2014 the first unescorted commercial vessel to transit the Northwest Passage delivered to China a cargo of nickel ore mined in the Arctic off northern QuebecEven if the United States does not permit largescale mining or exploration in Alaska the states shores could be threatened by spills leaks or other accidents from the activities of other nationsThe growth of human activity in the Arctic region will require highly engaged stewardship to maintain the open seas necessary for global commerce and scientific research allow for search and rescue activities and provide for regional peace and stability the White House said in a statement Accordingly meeting these challenges requires the United States to develop and maintain capacity for yearround access to greater expanses within polar regionsAlaskas leaders said Obamas announcement will have to be judged by the amount of funding the president can line up Murkowski said the 4million in last years federal budget doesnt even buy you a porthole The current budget includes 8million she saidDo we need icebreakers Yes Did we need them yesterday Yes Murkowski saidThe state of Alaska has a long wish list for the Obama administration Sullivan a freshman senator said he has been pressing the Pentagon not to go ahead with a proposal to cut one of two 5000member Arctic combat brigadesSullivan also wants federal agencies to speed up permit approvals for a muchdiscussed pipeline for natural gas which can be liquefied and shipped to China or JapanSome Alaskan lawmakers are seeking broadband access in small villages across the state And Gov Bill Walker a longtime Republican who won election as an independent has told Obama that four communities need to escape coastal hardships intensified by climate changeObama can rename Mount McKinley Denali  but he cant stop its loss of iceOn Tuesday Obama visited the Exit Glacier which has receded 125 miles since 1815  187 feet last year alone This is as good of a signpost of what were dealing with it comes to climate change as just about anything the president saidStanding in front of a gravelly creek bed he said that when glaciers melt the water runs to the ocean and raises sea levels altering the surrounding flora and faunaIt is spectacular though he said We want to make sure that our grandkids can see thisHe said his hike beats being in the officeObamas announcement about the icebreakers Monday night came after he finished an impassioned appeal to top officials from Arctic nations to do more about climate changeIn his speech he talked about a cycle of warming temperatures melting permafrost and wildfires as a negative feedback loop and he tried to infuse the audience with a sense of urgencyThe point is that climate change is no longer some faroff problem It is happening here It is happening now he saidOur understanding of climate change advances each day he added The science is stark It is sharpening It proves that this oncedistant threat is now very much in the presentObama did not however put forward any major new plans on the climate front whether for Alaska or for world leaders That disappointed MurkowskiWhat do we do and how do we do so in a way that would make a difference for the people of Alaska she asked after the speech What specifics do you have We didnt hear that We just heard a call to actionBut it was a rousing call to action Obama took aim at those who doubt that humans are spurring climate change saying that they are on their own shrinking islandHe also said people overestimate the damage that mitigation measures would do to their economiesThe notion is somehow this will curb our economic growth And at a time when people are anxious about the economy thats an argument oftentimes for inaction he said The irony of course  is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change Few things can have as negative an impact on our economy as climate changeHe painted the future as grim if nations fail to moderate the climate trends Among the results he said Submerged countries Abandoned cities Fields no longer growing  Desperate refugees seeking the sanctuary of nations not their ownThe president warned We will condemn our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair
