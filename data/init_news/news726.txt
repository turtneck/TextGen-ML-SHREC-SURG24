President Donald Trump has given very hard thought into who will be in his Cabinet He has several names in mind names that will literally change America and CNN doesnt like this at all Well too bad VIA Conservative 101 According to Politico  some of those names include Gingrich for Secretary of State Mnuchin a 17 year veteran of Goldman Sachs for Treasure Secretary and Mayor Giuliani for Attorney General And of course Sheriff David Clarke as the Homeland Security Secretary He has been an incredible patriotic American and leader in Blue Lives Matter CNN was terrified by this I think the one major flag I have is that someone like Sheriff Clarke would be considered as his Homeland Security secretary Someone who I very much see as if hes not a terrorist inciting terrorism said CNN commentator Angela Rye If people are afraid of Sheriff Clarke afraid of the policies which he represents I think thats terrorism she said This of course makes no sense You cant just call people who disagree with you terrorists Check out the video below and see for yourself Now this makes me wonder what gives Angela the right to call an honest person like Sheriff Clarke a terrorist Is it jealousy You cant call someone a terrorist just because you dont agree with them Its absurd What are your thoughts on this Do you think that Anglea Rye is a disgrace to journalism Share us your thoughts in the comments section below Thank you for reading If you havent checked out and liked our Facebook page please go here and do so Leave a comment
