1 comment James Comey went from being the darling of the left to their arch nemesis in an instant When the four devices including a laptop were seized in the Anthony Weiner sexting case over 10000 of Huma Abedins State Department emails were discovered First off Comey had a duty to disclose those emails Second as far as redemptive opportunities go this one is golden Comey gets a chance to do the right thing and remove some of that tarnish from his name and from the FBI Now Congress is considering holding an emergency hearing this next Friday just four days before the general election Its unprecedented and you can bet the Democrats will try to stall Comey will star at the hearing and the fact that the Department of Justice is either stalling or just refusing to issue a warrant for those emails is telling That wont hold up forever eventually a federal judge will step in if the DOJ insists on flaunting more corruption But timing is everything here Almost assuredly those laptops that the FBI supposedly destroyed but didnt will come up as well From Western Journalism  Both parties in Congress jockeyed for position Saturday in the wake of the dramatic bombshell delivered by the FBI on Friday regarding new evidence that has led the FBI to breathe new life into its investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state Republicans sought to move the issue to the front burner in the week before Election Day while Democrats castigated the FBI for announcing its probe One report claimed House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz RUtah was considering holding a hearing Friday to grill Comey about the most current evidence and investigation Congress is currently on its usual preelection recess The possibility of a preelection hearing or briefing was also raised by Sen Ron Johnson  RWis chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee If the hearing happens and I pray it does there will be fireworks all the way into election day and beyond Theres a really good chance now that Trump may win because of all this If Clinton wins this scandal will follow her into the White House as will impeachment proceedings and an indictment We could wind up with her resigning almost immediately and Tim Kaine becoming president Shudder I doubt that House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz is going to let this slide Hell be a bull dog on it and hell get his hearing this next Friday probably Both Clinton and Abedin are going to go down over this I dont think Congress has ever faced an emergency quite like this one in our lifetime Related Items Terresa MonroeHamilton Terresa MonroeHamilton owns and blogs at NoisyRoomnet  She is a Constitutional Conservative and NoisyRoom focuses on political and national issues of interest to the American public Terresa is the editor at Trevor Loudons site New Zeal  trevorloudoncom  She also does research at KeyWikiorg  You can  NoisyRoom can be found on Facebook and on Twitter
