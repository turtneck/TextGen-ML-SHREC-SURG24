resignation the Republican party national chairman addedTrump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the doorDebbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNCs email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign he said in a statement Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultzs lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroadI think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard he said And other people frankly in the party Hillary Clinton supporters who felt this was the last straw that she had to go and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November  united to deal with the problem of Donald TrumpWasserman Schultzs stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly 20000 emailsOne email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreementBefore the announcement Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position hes held for months Wasserman Schultz needs to goI dont think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people and I dont think her leadership style is doing that Sanders told Tapper on State of the Union on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in PhiladelphiaI am not an atheist he said But aside from all of that it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign It goes without saying The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates  to be fair and evenmindedHe added But again we discussed this many many months ago on this show so what is revealed now is not a shock to me
