Something interesting happened for Hillary Clinton in the third quarter of fundraising Her fundraising centers softenedDuring the second quarter Clinton outraised Bernie Sanders handily thanks to a lot of bigdollar donors In the third quarter the two were about tied But look at how Clintons donors were arrayed during the third quarter versus the secondIn the second quarter Clinton received donations from about 5300 ZIP codes In the third quarter that increased to 6300That second quarter when Clinton wrung a lot of money out of a lot of people she pulled in a lot of money from Manhattans wealthiest ZIP codes In those ZIPs roughly 10021 through 10028 Clinton raised 2 million from individuals in the second quarter In the third quarter she raised 725000  a 13 million drop The densest area of circles below is Manhattan you can also see the outline of Long Island to New York Citys eastNotice how centralized her donations were in the second quarter compared to Sanderss He got a lot more contributions from outlying ZIP codesThis is what youd expect to see from a candidate whogot a lot of donors to max out early Those areas subsequently have fewer donors to hit upBut you mightalso have noticed how much better Sanders is doing in the lucrative New York market Across the country Sanders dramatically expanded the number of places from which he generated contributions more than doubling the number of ZIP codesfrom which he got money from 3400 to 8400Sanders also saw an increase in how much he raised versus the decrease Clinton experienced We return to this chart that we published earlierthis monthSanders has a lot more people now to whom he can go back for more money
