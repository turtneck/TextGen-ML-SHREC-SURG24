BROOKLYN  New York is supposed to be a magical city that extracts authenticity out of its presidential candidates  you know the rubes who tote wallets in back pockets cant quite swipe a MetroCard or stand there like flaphatted Vermont tourists fishing around for subway tokens left over from their last trip to the Big City in 1960The 2016 primary here  for all its hype  provided few new insights into the character of the candidates  but it did clarify both the Republican and Democratic races delivering the expected victories to the expected hometown frontrunners Donald Trump and especially Hillary ClintonThe 10day New York campaign was dumber more scripted and meaner at least on the Democratic side than a great state deserved Each candidate embraced the most selfserving Empire State clich they could glom  Bernie Sanders trumpeted his Spaldeenstoopball 1950s Brooklyn upbringing while eliding the endemic segregation in his fiercely divided neighborhood Hillary touted her 2000 upstate listening tour downplaying her coziness with Wall Street while actual Americans Ted Cruz and John Kasich seemed mesmerized by the wild exoticism of halfsour pickles and matzasOnly Donald Trump  a Bonfire of the Vanities character who has busted out of his tabloid 1980s cage to devour 2016 basiccable America  seemed to really get what New Yorkers wanted Which was to be momentarily amused then left the hell alone By necessity no riots please and instinct he has Jeteresque name recognition already the Donald lay lower than in any previous contest and triumphed resoundinglyIt was semifun while it lasted Here are five takeaways from the New York primary1 Momentum is for losers Bernie Sanders cruised into New York riding a wave of victories He won eight out of the past nine nominating contests Which all added up to not very much  he cut Clintons lead in pledged delegates from about 240 to under 200 The Sanders campaign  taking a page from Clintons own effort in 2008  has been pushing the idea that the Vermont senator was surging past the mathematical impediments to his nominationClinton nearly erased that run with one big win in New York a victory that her staff expected to net her about 20 to 25 pledged delegates It also robbed Sanders of a core if flawed rationale for his candidacy That Clinton couldnt win consistently in big Northern states  she can add New York to a column of wins that includes Florida Texas Virginia and OhioAnd late in the day came news that electrified Clintons alreadyjazzed staff that Sanders had unexpectedly flown back to Vermont to recharge his political batteries2 Trump The mouth that didnt roar Turns out that shutting up lying low and reorganizing your amateurish campaign aint such a bad idea Trump who kicked off his candidacy at Trump Tower on Fifth took the Fifth during his homestate primary  steering clear of perilously liberal Manhattan to hold rallies in Patchogue on Long Island and Rochester upstateIt may be too late to showcase restraint but Trump who attempted rapprochement with Megyn Kelly during the primary sprint used his deadcertain win here as cover to reset his campaign  layering over barbouncer campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with seasoned GOP pro Paul Manafort and flack Hope Hicks with former Scott Walker aide Rick Wiley3 Bernie and Hillary officially hate each others guts Here was a hometown contest destined to sow bitterness Sanders like so many other Brooklynites professes to be proud of the moxie and street toughness instilled by the borough of his birth but his firstever vote was with his feet  and he got out first to Chicago then to the brayingGuernsey environs of Burlington Still he feels pride of ownership and bragged in Wyoming that he would make New York transplant Clinton quake Clinton who parked her carpetbag in Chappaqua 15 years ago wanted to crush his upstart challenge in her Chappaqua backyard  and she didClinton won by a wide margin and there was much effyou highfiving in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York But Sanders defeat accompanied as always by the big crowds and even bigger torrent of online donations was the bitterest one yet and deepened the already yawning fault lines between the Bernie stalwarts and a Clinton team increasingly itchy to see him gone Not going to happen anytime soon apparently The tweet being incredulously digested at a Clinton victory party was an MSNBC report quoting Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver defiantly claiming his candidate would take the fight to the convention floor  even if Clinton secured an overwhelming lead among pledged delegates and supersWe kicked his ass tonight a senior Clinton aide told me Tuesday night I hope this convinces Bernie to tone it down If not f him4 Why is John Kasich still running Sure Donald Trump built or branded himself on over half of Manhattan But Ohio Gov John Kasich the closest thing to a moderate remaining in the Republican field should have appealed to voters here  and he couldnt make the sale in critical areas like Nassau County or suburban Buffalo At 11 pm he was clocking in at a modest 25 percent  less than half of Trumps commanding 60 percent level of victoryKasich stands no chance of catching either Trump or Ted Cruz in the delegate hunt so his core rationale is that he fares far better than either man in a general election matchup against Hillary Clinton Losing so badly in her home state however does little to bolster that case  and the trickle of cash coming to his campaign is likely to dry up as he heads into the homestretch5 Whiteout Clinton managed to fight Sanders to a virtual draw among white voters statewide and won 60to40 among whites in the five boroughs  but the big story for the umpteenth time in 2016 was Sanders inability to make significant inroads with black voters Spike Lee made a nice ad for the Vermont senator  but it couldnt compensate for the candidates repeated and inexplicable dismissal of Clintons huge wins in the Deep South  which blacks interpreted as a slight
