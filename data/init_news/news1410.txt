Email After 12 hours of effort to hash out an agreement to cut oil production that can be presented formally to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries flag shown in November 14 oil ministers meeting in Vienna over the weekend gave birth to  a goose egg Without an agreement the November 30 gathering is likely to be irrelevant just as the cartel itself is becoming Every cartel eventually blows up due to members unwilling to abide by agreements cheating creating side agreements and in general seeking their own self interests So it is with OPEC At the Vienna meeting Iran complained that it is really producing more than reported while Iraq wanted a dispensation similar to Irans which has allowed the country to expand its production back to presanction levels claiming that it has a war to fight and needs the revenues Venezuela the UAE United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are each facing their own special problems  Venezuela in particular President Nicols Maduro made a personal trip to Vienna some said in order to get away from the increasing unrest back home to press the point He needs more money to cover the increasing deficits his socialist policies are costing his government At the end of the day several things were clear First there was no agreement nor is one likely If OPEC countries cant agree how could any nonOPEC oil producers such as Russia be persuaded to go along with any agreement to cut production to raise prices Second any production cut if there is one would likely be borne primarily by OPECs largest producer Saudi Arabia which just completed its first and perhaps last global bond offering for 18 billion initiated to slow the liquidation of its foreign reserves Last year it liquidated nearly 100 billion of those reserves while playing the increasingly unsuccessful and costly game of chicken with US producers In addition US energy producers are already announcing new capital expenditures while bringing on rigs that were temporarily idled during the downturn Nick Cunningham writing for OilPricecom noted another problem facing OPEC In January there were 5576 DUCs  drilled but uncompleted wells  just waiting for the right conditions for them to be completed Since then more than 500 of them have been brought online profitably with most of the rest according to observers likely to be completed by the second quarter of 2017  barely five months from now What OPEC ultimately is facing is the vast and increasing disparity between what it costs them to bring a barrel of oil to the surface and what it costs for American producers to complete a DUC Since most of the upfront costs have already been expended the marginal cost to bring a DUC well online is way below the current price of 50 a barrel The math is persuasive and US oil producers are reacting accordingly In other words OPEC is engaged in a game that it initiated and which it is now discovering that it cannot win and cannot quit In the process OPEC is becoming increasingly irrelevant while US producers are pushing ahead continuing to turn America into a country that is not only selfsufficient for its own energy needs but is also increasingly supplying the world The OPEC bickering is likely to intensify as the reality sinks in that the cartel has painted itself into a corner Venezuela is facing existential questions while most of the others are on an unsustainable path of decreasing revenues to fund socialist welfare programs that were never affordable and are now strangling the governments Its likely that those revenues will continue to fall despite what OPEC may do or more likely not do in November Investors and producers are expecting oil prices to fall sharply as measured by their short positions in the futures markets According to the Energy Information Administration EIA there were more than 540000 short positions taken by those expecting oil prices to fall as of October 11  the most in nearly 10 years Image OPEC flag An Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRightcom primarily on economics and politics He can be reached at This email address is being protected from spambots You need JavaScript enabled to view it
