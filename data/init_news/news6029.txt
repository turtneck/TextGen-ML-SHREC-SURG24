The last time Carly Fiorina was here theformer HewlettPackard chief executive sketched out her foreign policy blueprint One thousand people heard her condemn the slow training of antiIslamic State forces the ambitions of China and the wonky tooth to tail ratio of military power to military bureaucracyIt was sober It was serious It was basically ignored Like much of this summers political news Fiorinas July speech was subsumed by Donald Trump it inspired only a fraction of the news searches that Rolling Stone attracted last week when it quoted Trump seemingly making fun of her looks according to Google Trends dataThe rise of Trump and of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson two firsttime candidates who prefer broad strokes to policy debates has left the Republican establishment looking confused and helpless Originally expecting a clash of ideas among a diverse talented field the establishments national security Brahmins paired up with candidates and got to work  only to be blown out of the conversation by TrumpThat has left some Republicans hoping that Wednesdays debate will break the fever  and change the tenor of the race from flashy to substantive Hugh Hewitt the syndicated Orange County radio host who will comoderate the event has promised to grill candidates about geopolitics and world leaders If that happens the debate will become a crucial test for Trump and Carson  and for the staying power of their campaignsTrump in Texas We are a dumping ground for the rest of the worldIf this isnt the moment to finally get serious when the hell will it be asked Sen Lindsey O Graham SC another Republican presidential contender Is the next time we get serious about foreign policy going to be when we get attacked Everybody criticizes Barack Obamas foreign policy everybody knows he has no strategy in Iraq and Syria but we need something specific to replace that If we dont hear that from the candidates this week will have been a waste of timeGraham is an unwilling mascot for how foreign policy has fallen out of the primary debate Just months ago he was engaged in a neardaily debate with fellow GOP candidate Rand Paul the libertarianleaning senator from Kentucky over issues including Iran and the Islamic State Im running Graham said because the world is falling apartOn Wednesday afternoon Graham will join former senator Rick Santorum Pa another longtime Washington hawk at the fourman secondtier debate Santorum is at least invited to a policyfocused forum later this week in Greenville SC hosted by Heritage Action for America Graham who lives near the venue is notThat will leave the task of vetting Carson and Trump on Wednesday to nine other candidates and the moderators Neither frontrunner has laid out a specific plan for attacking the Islamic State Trump consistently has told audiences that he has a secret plan that he cannot share lest the enemy find out Both candidates have been light on strategies for other crisesSen John McCain RAriz chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the 2008 Republican presidential nominee lamented how little attention has been paid to foreign policyThere certainly hasnt been very serious discussion of it because of the nature of the campaign McCain said Just rhetoricMcCain added about Trump Hes not been asked tough questions Hes said he wants to deport 11million people How do you do that He hasnt answered that question He said in the Middle East he would go and quote take their oil Id like to know how you do that I think the American people deserve an explanationNot all of them want one  at least not yet Trump and Carson both bombed interviews with Hewitt  to no appreciable effect In March Carson appeared not to realize that the Baltic states were NATO members Asked about the fumble he explained that a president would have access to a lot of experts in a lot of areas and that he would not be stymied by gotcha questions You dont want to devote all your attention to learning facts on a fact sheet he said His standing has grown dramatically since thenTrump under more scrutiny fared even worse Hed previously told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that his foreign policy advice came from watching Sunday talk shows and talking to national security hawks Faced with Hewitts questions Trump seemed to confuse Irans Quds forces for the decidedly nonIranian Kurds and he couldnt describe the difference between Hezbollah and HamasIt was a disaster compounded by Fiorinas largely adroit answers to the same questions Yet like every disaster of Trumps summer it did not halt his momentum in poll after poll he has held his position as frontrunner of the Republican field since early JulyHewitt meanwhile returned to his debate prep with some new thinking about how to really draw out the candidateI dont think those questions quiz questions about knowledge tell you anything about understanding Hewitt said Knowing names is dumb Thats not necessary I wish I had phrased my question to Trump as General Soleimani who leads the Quds forces is about to get 100billion What will the impact of that be Thats what I wanted to ask and it went off the railsIts true that Trumps and Carsons actual positions have been largely unexamined  and have remained roomshaking applause lines at his rallies Trump offers audiences a vision of an America thats always winning that learned from the Iraq war which he came out against 16 months after the invasion that is ready to take the oil from conquered Islamic State territoryWere going to have so many victories he told more than 10000 people in Dallas on Monday at some point its going to be coming out of your earsHe offered no more detail Tuesday in Los Angeles when he delivered what was billed as a national security speech Were going to make our military so big and so strong and so great  its going to be so powerful that no one is going to want to mess with us he saidCarson has offered a lowerdecibel version of the same idea minus the oil seizures At a rally last week in Anaheim Calif Carson said that some generals had told him that the Islamic State could be defeated easily if the militarys hands arent tied In Anaheim and at a later rally in a Houston suburb Carson said he would obligeI would use every resource including financial resources offensive and defense resources covert and overt activities he said in Texas I would use everything possible not to contain them but to destroy themFor the people who study foreign policy and try to shape the national conversation the simple answers from Carson and Trump are frustrating  yet totally understandable The rise of the Islamic State has stoked panic among some conservative voters but it has not defined their conversations In the most recent Gallup poll conducted in August only 19percent of voters listed a foreign policy issue as the most important problem facing this country today Only 3percent said specifically that the biggest problem was the Islamic StateThe GOPs hawks have tried with little success to sober up the base Former vice president Richard B Cheney and his daughter Liz reemerged last week with a book Exceptional and an argument about how the party must rediscover its inner hawk They sold 14000 copies according to Nielsens BookScan serviceYet they were stymied by a problem bedeviling former Florida governor Jeb Bushs White House bid lingering ill will toward the administration of his brother George W Bush Both Trump and Carson tell voters they are right to be skeptical of military adventures in the wake of the Iraq war The debate about what a serious foreign policy may look like has been paused and every other candidate wants to change thatWe havent even begun the substance part of the campaign said Paul who has fallen in most polls but will take part in the main debate Its really been about celebrity and really sophomoric insults I think the beginning of the decline of Trump is at hand might have begun with Perry dropping out The media and the voters may be starting to ask Oh my goodness we are promoting something bad for the country Do we want someone this unserious in charge of our nuclear arsenalMike
