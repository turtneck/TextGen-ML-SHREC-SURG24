TheWhite House Correspondents Dinner has become a strange event It is ostensibly an evening when the president and the press can come together to share a few lighthearted laughs But its evolved into a recital of brutal truths  albeit one neither side ever really admits happenedThe joke of President Obamas performance on Saturday was that he wasnt joking Everyone just had to pretend he was Take this section from the official White House transcriptThe tipoff there is Its the right thing to do Thats not a joke Thats Obamas actual justification for the aggressive executive actions of his second term  fuck it its the right thing to do But the norms of politics are such that he typically has to frame his actions as routine dull even necessary He has to search for precedent and downplay the consequencesIts only on the evening of the White House Correspondents Dinner when he can say what everyone already knows his actions are huge they are controversial they push the norms of American politics but fuck it at a moment when American politics seems increasingly broken Obama has decided to just go ahead and do what he thinks is rightThen there was this lineIts funny sure But hes not kidding Its just the thing Obama cant usually say The humor is in the shock of him actually saying itBut the place where Obama stopped being polite and started getting real was when he brought out Luther his personal anger translator This was itself a way of giving up the game The Luther joke comes from the Comedy Central sketch show Key and Peele and the point of it is that Obama as the first black president is not allowed to express his anger as America is terrified of angry black men And so hes got Luther  the angry black man who can say what he cantOn Key and Peele though it really is a joke Key plays Luther Peele plays Obama Its two comedians commenting on race and politics But at the White House Correspondents Dinner the whole point was that the joke isnt a joke at all It was Key playing Luther but it was Obama playing Obama Obamas anger translator was actually translating for Obama working off a script that had to be approved by Obama And so when Luther spoke now he really was speaking for ObamaTHE PRESIDENT In our fastchanging world traditions like the White House Correspondents Dinner are important LUTHER I mean really what is this dinner Laughter And why am I required to come to it Laughter Jeb Bush do you really want to do this Laughter THE PRESIDENT Because despite our differences we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day LUTHER And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense Laughter Sharia law is coming to Cleveland Run for the damn hills Laughter Yall its ridiculous Laughter THE PRESIDENT We wont always see eye to eye LUTHER Oh and CNN thank you so much for the walltowall Ebola coverage For two whole weeks we were one step away from the Walking Dead Laughter And then you all got up and just moved on to the next day That was awesome Oh and by the way just if you havent noticed you dont have Ebola Laughter THE PRESIDENT But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do LUTHER Yall remember when I had that big old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it Remember that Which Obamas Katrina was that one Was that 19 Or was it 20 Because I cant remember LaughterThere are no jokes there Theres just Obama saying what he has to say and Luther saying what Obama actually believesAnd what Obama believes is that the press is often sensational trivial and fearmongering He thinks they hype negative stories for weeks on end and then refuse to admit their mistake when the horror fizzles He thinks he gets the blame for catastrophes but little credit for solutions He thinks the media has a deep bias toward negative stories which of course we doBut if Obama is annoyed at the press he is appalled at Republicans who deny climate change  and are trying to block him from taking action to stop climate change Obama believes global warming a generational threat and so when he sees James Inhofe the chair of the Senates Committee on Environment and Public Worksthrowing snowballs on the chambers floor well his thoughts on that would likely be seen as unpresidential if he gave them voiceExcept on the night of the White House Correspondents DinnerTHE PRESIDENT The science is clear Nine of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade LUTHER Now Im not a scientist but I do know how to count to 10 Laughter LUTHER Weve got mosquitos Sweaty people on the train stinking it up Its just nasty Laughter THE PRESIDENT I mean look at whats happening right now Every serious scientist says we need to act The Pentagon says its a national security risk Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it weve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate LUTHER Okay Mr President Okay I think theyve got it bro THE PRESIDENT It is crazy What about our kids What kind of stupid shortsighted irresponsible bull  Laughter and applause LUTHER All due respect sir You dont need an anger translator Laughter You need counselingSo the joke here was that Obama is so angry about the Republican Partys climate denialism that he even managed to scare his anger translator This isnt a joke Its just Obamas opinion delivered with a fury thats rarely allowed in American politicsRead these sentences again Every serious scientist says we need to act The Pentagon says its a national security risk Miami floods on a sunny day and instead of doing anything about it weve got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate Is there a single one of them that you think Obama doesnt believeHe gets right up to the first syllable of calling it bullshit But since he said it at the White House Correspondents Dinner he can just say hes kidding even though everyone knows hes not kidding in the leastTo paraphrase Bruce Banner Obamas secret is hes always angry at least about this stuff  but the White House Correspondents Dinner is the only weekend of the year in which hes allowed to show it because the press has promised for that one day of the year to pretend they didnt notice
