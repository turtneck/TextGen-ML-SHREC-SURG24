ROME US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders met privately with Pope Francis on Saturdaythe capstone to an unusual detour from the American electionSanders said the meeting was for personal reasons and does not constitute an endorsement from the Holy SeeI am an enormous fan of the pope because I think he has played a transformative role in the world in talking about issues that very rarely get the kind of discussion they deserve Sanders said in an interview aboard his chartered planeWhether it is income and wealth inequality whether it is what he calls the dispossessed the young people the old people the unemployed people who are on the sidelines of society whether it is the ideology of greed whether it is need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to save the planet he has been a transformative leaderAnd he is a very beautiful man Sanders continuedWhen you meet him you see something very very special in his face He is a man of peace and you see thatSome of Sanderssadvisers including his wife Jane also were at the meeting Hesaid that there was no discussion of hisunderdog candidacy or the electionThere was no photograph of the brief meeting at the papal residence complex in keeping with Vatican protocol and also Sanders said to make clear that there is no endorsement hereFrancis on Saturday made it clear that his meeting with Sanders was not political sayingthat those who thought it was should look for a psychiatrist according to ReutersThe pontiff met Sanders at the Vatican guest house where the pope lives When I came down I greeted him I shook his hand and nothing more This is called good manners and it is not getting involved in politics Reuters says the pope told reporters during an answer to a question aboard the plane returning from the Greek island of Lesbos where he visited a refugee campPope calls for compassion for refugees takes three families back to ItalyIf anyone thinks that greeting someone is getting involved in politics I recommend that he look for a psychiatrist he reportedly said while laughingSanders was atthe Vatican participating in a seminar on income inequality and economic justice at the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences where hewas invited to attend as well asspeak He and other conference invitees spent the night at the Vatican after the conferenceThetrip suggests that Sandersis looking ahead to how he would continue and expand the focus on very liberal social justice issues that has defined his candidacy In a matter of months he moved from gadfly to serious challenger to the longtime Democratic favorite largely on the strength of a set of ideas more common to liberal university campuses than the political debate stageIf elected president I certainly would look forward to working with the pope in trying to create a moral economy which was the theme of this conference an economy which challenges the idea that greed has got to be the dominant force in the worlds economy Sanders saidAnd if he losesWell the ideas and the efforts remain the same Im a United States senator from Vermont And Ill continue to fight the fights that Ive always fought with a larger platform to do so Sanders saidThe Vatican invitation is symbolic of that platform he agreed But Sanders and the pontiff share many goals for social justice and economic restructuring and Sanders suggested that and not his candidacy was the reason for the audience with FrancisThe speech that I gave yesterday would have been the speech 10 years ago long before I ever dreamed of running for president he said in an interview with TheWashington PostSanders said the trip was absolutely a worthwhile diversion from campaigning in New York where he trails frontrunner Hillary Clinton by double digits in most pollsLook we have campaigned extraordinarily hard in New York Sanders said He claimed he has addressed 96000 people across the state at rallies and other meetingsWe have worked very hard and when we go back were gonna work hard This was an invitation that I would never have forgiven myself if I had refusedSanders needs a solid showing in New York which offers more than 200 delegates to maintain a plausible argument that he can catch up to Clinton His path to the nomination has grown narrower even as he has defeated Clinton in a string of contests over the past monthUh we got a shot Sanders said when asked about his prospects for Tuesdays primary vote Its gonna be tough for us not just because Clinton has won two elections there but because of the nature of the voting rulesNew York which Clinton represented as a senator for eight years allows only registered Democrats to vote in the Democratic primary meaning independents are cut out Sanders has been regularly defeating Clinton among independents The state also does not allow sameday registration Sanders said he disagrees with both rulesThose are the rules They dont work for us Sanders said But nonetheless if there is a large voter turnout we got a shot to win thisSanders flew to Rome on a large chartered airliner largely paid with campaign funds spokesman Michael Briggs saidHe said he didnot know the exact cost of the trip News organizations flying with Sanders pay for their passage and the Secret Service also pays a shareSanders has taken some criticism earlier in his campaign for using chartered aircraft  a luxury for the privileged class as well as an addition to carbon emissions  while railing against the excesses of the wealthiest top 1 percent of AmericansSeveral of Sanderss advisers along with his wife their four children and four of their grandchildren accompanied him for the overnight visit to Rome While Jane Sanders attended the conference with her husband and joined him in meeting the pope the rest of the family spent time sightseeing The trip also included a stay at a posh hotelSanders was back on the plane Saturday as he plansto campaign in Brooklyn in theeveningStefano Pitrelli in
