Weve got an opening on the court I think Sandra Day OConnor made a very practical point Lets fill the vacancy so the court can fully function and get on with it he told CNNs Chris Cuomo on New DayI dont agree with Republicans said OConnor We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with itKing an independent who caucuses with Democrats said he is surprised that some Republicans have decided to reject a nominee before even having a candidate to evaluateIm surprised people can make that judgment before they even know who the nominee is he said It may be that he picks a nominee thats so eminently qualified that it would be very hard to explain a vote against him other than politics King acknowledged that the Senate doesnt have to support the nominee but thinks there should be a vote Of course we have these debates And of course politics are involved King said The politics are important And Im not saying a Republican senator has to vote for whoever Obama nominates I would never say that But a refusal to hold a process could leave the vacancy for more than a year and that would be pretty troublesome King said The senator who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee also expressed concern about a judges order that Apple help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino California shooters Theyre asking Apple to create a key that does not currently exist And Ive got a problem with that This is a very complicated issue he said Forcing Apple to do this could set a serious precedent that could lead to other citizens having their privacy invaded he said Once that key is made it can end up in the hands of hackers King said Theres no end to complications of this I think we need to slow down and really consider the policy he added
