Q If Trump wins can it be considered a repudiation of the national news mediocrity A I certainly hope so The performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold Its been the worst most shallow undertaking I can remember And I remember the treatment Goldwater got I wrote here on Lews blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to Trumps unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance They acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie Pat Buchanan explains the medias panic The establishment is terrified that it has lost the country he says The country no longer believes in its leadership About time Now with the Comey development it wont be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system Another moment of equal media idiocracy When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders Trump said Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 emails that are missing The line wasnt welldelivered But it was still funny Even so the joke was lost on the usual suspects I watched CNNs Jake Tappers visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election The whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with lets say Joe and Moe Joe Im offended by the medias alarmist reaction to Trumps email joke Moe Are you offended as a Trump supporter Joe No Im offended as a person with a sense of humor 1109 am on October 29 2016
