On Monday Cotton drafted a letter  signed by 46 other senators  addressed toleaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran warning that any deal reached on the countrys nuclear program could be killed by the next administration with the stroke of a pen The letter generated fierce criticism not only from the Obama administration and congressional Democrats but also from conservative quarters including the Wall Street Journals editorial board which Kelly noted called Cottons correspondence a distractionWell on the contrary Megyn I think that this debate were having is incredibly important and helpful to raising just what a bad deal President Obama is about to make with Iran Cotton responded The last two days weve focused on the terms of the deal which is One President Obama will accept a 10year sunset clause and two he has conceded a vast uranium enrichment capability to Iran that paves the way for Iran to get the bomb as Prime Minister Netanyahu said last week he added referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus inflammatory March 3 address before CongressKelly pressed But whats the point in writing to the Iranian mullahsWhat are you gonna do She noted that many in the Iranian leadership have dismissed Cottons letter while he has irked the Obama administration and even alienated congressional Democrats skeptical of the nuclear talks Megyn if you talk to most Iran experts theyll tell you that Irans leaders dont understand our constitutional system Cotton answered So we need to be crystal clear with the leaders of Iran Any deal thats not approved by Congress wont be accepted by Congress he later said Kelly continued to emphasize that if Cotton is so keen on congressional review offending Democrats in Congress may not be the optimal way to go about the matter For his part Cotton asserted that he wants Democrats to join his effort effectively torpedoing diplomacy and reprimanding their president Good luck with that
