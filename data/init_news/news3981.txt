Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Tuesday winning the Indiana primary as Ted Cruz dropped out It punctuates the power of the populist rebellion against the GOP eliteAs yet another general joins Trumps team what does the pick revealRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at The Palladium at the Center for Performing Arts in Carmel IndFor weeks NeverTrump Republicans saw the Indiana primary as one of the final firewalls standing between an outright win for the Manhattan billionaire and a contested convention in July where another candidate could possibly emerge victoriousThe Hoosier state after all seemed ripe for Sen Ted Cruz of Texas  strongly evangelical and with a pronounced teaparty tiltNow it stands as a microcosm of this Republican primary season showing the depth of the Republican revolt in the most decisive terms yetIndiana Republicans chose Donald Trump Tuesday giving him more than 50 percent of the vote with twothirds of the vote counted Senator Cruz responded by suspending his presidential campaign Mr Trumps pathway to the Republican presidential nomination now appears clearAs a result Indiana has underlined deep and unsettling questions for the Republican PartyMr Trumps appeal to working class whites through economic populism and antiimmigrant nationalism beat Senator Cruzs focus on establishment orthodoxy and culturewar worriesOn one hand thats nothing new In sweeping the South Trump again and again won Republican bulwarks with a message that stripped to its essence doesnt really look very Republican  at least not as the party has defined itself since Ronald Reagan Save Social Security Rein in free trade Support Planned ParenthoodThe difference is Indiana was NeverTrumps last stand Practically speaking it has no more deeply red and electorally significant states in which to fight And now it has lost Cruz tooRepublican voters have decided and the forces seeking to push the Trump rebellion to the margins have lostWhat happens in the embers of this primary season and the general election ahead will shape what the Republican Party takes from 2016 But Indiana punctuates a nowinescapable conclusion The party is not what it thought it was just nine months agoThe Republican Party has been loath to reach this conclusionIn rallying behind Cruz in a lastditch effort to stop Trump many insiders chose a candidate who was at least reliably Republican even if his politics and personality gratedNow the party must ask itself if it is merely Trumps personality that has galvanized Republican primary voters or if he is the vessel for a deeper shift away from the low tax small government free trade orthodoxies that have dominated the party for more than 30 yearsThat remains an open question To some Trump is a singular phenomenon  a political outlier whose success comes from his inimitable style Cruzs inability to compete even on such apparently friendly turf speaks to his lack of charismaIt appears that Cruz is having a hard time galvanizing voters because he is not winning the hearts of voters the way successful candidates need to do says Amy Black a political scientist at Wheaton College in Illinois He isnt perceived as likeable and that is a tough hurdle for voters For many voters it isnt enough for a candidate to line up with them on issues personality and charisma matter a lot in American politicsMoreover Indiana held unique advantages for Trump too It has more manufacturing jobs as part of its total employment than any other state in the nation Since the early days of the campaign Trump has railed against Indianapolisbased Carrier Corp moving production of its air conditioners to MexicoFrom steel mills on the shores of Lake Michigan to the medical device hub of Warsaw to Elkhart the RV capital of the world Indianas bluecollar workforce  and its bluecollar retirees  are machinemade for Trump wrote David Wasserman at FiveThirtyEight on MondayStill Trumps repeated success in some of the reddest and most evangelical states  such as Indiana  has thrown doubt on the traditional Republican message As the white working class continues to struggle after the Great Recession classic Republican talkingpoints dont appear to be resonating as they once didA Cruz advertisement in Indiana likened Trump to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton Both support the Obamacare individual mandate Both support taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood Both support letting transgender men go in little girls bathrooms the ad saysAnd again on Tuesday Cruzs angst boiled over as he made a desperate plea to the Republican spirit he knows best accusing Trump of being utterly amoral and a serial philandererNone of it workedAt the very least this does suggest that Republicans longstanding strategy of building majorities for their antitax platform by appealing to workingclass voters Christian morals has lost a lot of its power wrote Eduardo Porter in The New York Times last month And it took Mr Trump to identify the real Achilles heel in the Reagan coalition an economic policy built around tax cuts for the wealthy that has failed to deliver the goods to the Republican base for far too longThis in a state where in 2012 exit polls more than 1 in 3 voters identified as white bornagain Christians Where GOP primary voters ousted Sen Richard Lugar a 36year moderate incumbent in favor of tea party purist Richard Mourdock Mr Mourdock lost the general election after making controversial comments about rape and abortionNine GOP primaries remain before June 7 and the two biggest  New Jersey and California  are hardly deep redAs working class concerns dominate this years election in both parties the relative strength of Evangelicals has begun to wane  as well as their traditional support for RepublicansRepublicans delivered nothing but defeat after defeat in the culture wars wrote Stephen Prothero professor of religion at Boston University in Politico Magazine in March Cultural conservatives failed to pass constitutional amendments on school prayer or abortion They lost on Bill Clintons impeachment They lost on pop culture where movies and television shows today make the sort of entertainment decried by the Moral Majority look like Its a Wonderful Life And samesex marriage is now the law of the landCruz announced his candidacy at evangelical Liberty University last year to signal his strategy of courting the GOPs most reliable constituency over the years He sent his father Rafael
