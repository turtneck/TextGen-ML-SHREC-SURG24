posted by Eddie Astronomers have recorded mysterious signals from 234 stars that they believe could indicate the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence  a notion thats sure to excite alien truthers and beyond Astronomers Ermanno Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Canada analyzed 25 million stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey  SDSS  project In their resulting study published in Solar and Stellar Astrophysics journal the pair conclude that the peculiar signals they recorded could be from aliens trying to make contact with Earth The researchers came to this potential explanation based on a previous study by Borra which predicted the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence ETI signal The 234 signals identified match this shape exactly The fact that only a small fraction  234 out of 25 million  of the stars in our suns spectrum emitted this signal also matches the previous ETI hypothesis However the theory that these signals are the result of aliens is only one of a number of possibilities according to the study and they could in fact derive from any one of several possibilities such as  rotational transitions in molecules or rapid pulsations So is this the discovery weve been waiting for to finally confirm were not alone in the universe Not quite The authors admit that further work is needed to confirm this theory and are also considering the unlikely scenario that the signals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars Breakthrough Listen Initiative  a scientific and technological exploration program that includes Stephen Hawking and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on its board  has announced plans to research the findings further but says a breadth of independently verified proof is required to substantiate the claims Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence the group points out in a statement  It is too early to unequivocally attribute these purported signals to the activities of extraterrestrial civilizations Internationally agreedupon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth SETI require candidates to be confirmed by independent groups using their own telescopes and for all natural explanations to be exhausted before invoking extraterrestrial agents as an explanation they added From Around the Web Founder of WorldTruthTv and WomansVibecom Eddie  8968 Posts  Eddie L is the founder and owner of wwwWorldTruthTV and wwwWomansvibecom Both website are dedicated to educating and informing people with articles on powerful and concealed information from around the world I have spent the last 36 years researching Bible History Alternative Health Secret Societies Symbolism and many other topics that are not reported by mainstream media
