Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned supporters at a rally here Sunday that he and his Likud party may not win Tuesdays election a potentially dramatic fall for a consummate political survivor whose nine years in office transformed him into the public face of contemporary IsraelA loss by Netanyahu  or a razorthin win and the prospect that he would be forced to enter into an unwieldy government of national unity with his rivals  would mark a sobering reversal for Israels security hawks in a country where the electorate has been moving steadily rightward for the past 15 yearsThe final round of opinion polls Friday showed Netanyahu and his rightwing Likud party facing a surprisingly strong challenge by Isaac Herzog leader of the centerleft Labor Party and his running mate former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni who hold a small but steady lead Their campaign has emphasized economic issues and the soaring cost of livingRead A guide to the political parties battling for Israels futureNetanyahu charged in a radio interview Sunday that hostile Israeli journalists and shadowy foreign powers were behind an antiNetanyahu campaign that could be his undoingLivni his longtime rival and the former justice minister countered that Netanyahu was panicking and looking for scapegoatsThe citizens of Israel will replace Netanyahu not because of what is written in the newspapers she said Sunday but because they dont have enough money to buy a newspaper or buy apartments for their childrenThe Netanyahu campaign assumed the prime minister would get a bump in support after his speech before a joint meeting of Congress two weeks ago when hedirectly challenged President Obama and warned that the United States was about to sign a disastrous pact that would not halt Irans nuclear ambitionsRead Why Israels top rightwinger wants his people to stop apologizingHis supporters boasted of his Churchillian skills as a master orator Their high hopes were raised as a rapturous Congress gave him repeated standing ovations Yet the speech did little to move the electorate  even as it angered the White House and congressional Democrats and undermined bipartisan relations between Israel and its closest allyIts clear that Netanyahu thought what he did in Washington would help him but it didnt do him any good at home said Yehuda Ben Meir a director at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel AvivRead Could Isaac Herzog become Israels next prime ministerTwo highly critical reports released in the past month have also taken a toll on the prime minister and the Likud campaignNetanyahu was personally hurt by embarrassing revelations about profligate spending of state money at his official residence in Jerusalem and his private beachside villa north of Tel Aviv Israelis were mildly shocked to see how much the premier and his wife Sara spend on hairdressers and maid service  in addition to an eyepopping 24000 a year on takeout foodNetanyahu and his party were also dinged by a scathing report last month that concluded they had failed to do much to address the soaring cost and availability of housing for financially strapped Israelis who are frustrated by the high cost of living hereNetanyahus ally on the hardline right Naftali Bennett the economy minister said he was surprised that threats at Israels borders were not as important in this campaignIts the first time that I can recall that the voters are zeroing in on the economy Bennett said in an interview Some thought there might be other issues like Iran but there hasnt beenBennett is leader of the Jewish Home party which draws electoral support from religious nationalists and the prosettler camp According to opinion polls backing for his party has not grown since the 2013 electionBennett was the darling who got a lot of attention at the expense of everyone around him but he made some serious mistakes said Reuven Hazan who chairs the department of political science at the Hebrew University of JerusalemBennett tried to bring a retired Israeli soccer star onto his list of candidates for parliament but core party members revolted complaining that Eli Ohana was a celebrity who played games on the Jewish Sabbath and supported Israels unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 anathema to the prosettler wing of the partyBoth Netanyahu and Bennett a tech millionaire and former commando are viewed as strong on security and both talk tough about the PalestiniansBennett is out front saying he would never give away occupied land in the West Bank to create an independent Palestinian state During the campaign Netanyahu also distanced himself from peace talks He vowed there would be no concessions or withdrawals from the West Bank and suggested that the twostate solution was no longer relevantBoth may be sailing into contrary winds The last polls for Israel Army Radio found that more than half of Israelis surveyed plan to vote based on social and economic issues and that fewer than 1 in 3 put security at the top of their concerns Nine of 10 respondents said the cost of living would influence their choiceAfter shunning debates public appearances and media interviews for most of the campaign Netanyahu in the past few days has popped up on radio and television and on Sunday at a large rally in Tel AvivAt the event attended by thousands Netanyahu warned If we dont close the gap there is a real danger that a leftwing government will rise to powerOn Israeli Channel 2s Meet the Press show Saturday night the host pressed Netanyahu on why he is trailing in opinion surveysI am liked he protested The public prefers me to continue to lead by many percentage points over my rival He referred to polls that ask voters who they would like as prime minister which is different from which party they will vote forThe prime minister complained that the world was against him and wanted to weaken Israel Foreign consultants are here in droves he said in an interview with the Jerusalem Post and the money is flowing here All of it is intended to make the Likud loseBennett blamed outsiders too All the media and all the NGOs are out to overthrow the right he told students at BarIlan University outside Tel Aviv Ive never seen such a concentrated effort with money from abroadNeither Bennett nor Netanyahu has alleged which foreign governments are seeking influence but both have pointed the finger at an Israeli grassroots organizing group calling itself V15 which is dedicated to ousting Netanyahu Its social media networks helped bring 35000 people out to a rally last week in a Tel Aviv park under the banner Anyone but Bibi Netanyahus nicknameOne of V15s top advisers is a former Obama campaign director named Jeremy Bird an expert on grassroots politicking and voter mobilizationA shift from right to center in Israel would likely please the Obama White House It would help Obama if the administration reaches an imperfect deal with the Iranians It might also reinvigorate moribund peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and give Secretary of State John F Kerry another chance to help solve one of the worlds longestrunning conflictsIt is possible that Netanyahu and Likud could either win or come in a close second and then emerge as the ultimate victors because their challengers could not put together a governing coalition from the small parties whose leaders can emerge as kingmakersMany Likudniks blame Moshe Kahlon a former Likud minister who started a new party called Kulanu for siphoning off moderate voters The candidate is popular in Israel because he broke up the cellphone monopolies and slashed mobile perminute rates He gets high marks for focusing on socioeconomic issues but is also tough on security seemingly an ideal candidate for todays voter moodKahlon is expected to win more than enough seats to help form a coalition government for either Netanyahu or Herzog He has not said which candidate he would join in the next governmentA guide to the political parties battling for Israels futureWhy Israels top rightwinger wants his people to stop apologizingCould Isaac
