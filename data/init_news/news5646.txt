Bernardino California Obama will also seek to reassure Americans once again about their safety Senior administration officials said Obama plans to devote part of the speech to his vow to protect the American home front and put the nation on a path to destroying ISIS a mission aides concede likely wont be accomplished on his watchThe war on ISIS will be the overarching focus of everything we do this year deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters earlier this yearStill Obama will dedicate much of the speech to his late secondterm agenda In the coming weeks the President is

what will be an emotional high point in the speech the President will also defend his executive actions aimed at tightening the nations background check system for gun buyers Obama will then point to the first ladys box at the address where an empty seat will represent the victims of gun violenceStill a nod to the pastGiven that this is Obamas final State of the Union aides believe the President
