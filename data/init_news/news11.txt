Donald Trumps organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flatout embarrassing Heres Politico with the playbyplay from this weekends Colorado GOP convention the latest scene of Trumps delegatesecuring failureUnlike in most other states Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summers national convention in Cleveland Instead the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the states seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of themor put another way not the Trump campaignAt the first two districtlevel contests the billionaires team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees leaving supporters unsure of whom to back And then at last Thursdays contest two of the three delegates on the Trump campaigns list werent actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration feesThis past weekends mixup though was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trumpsanctioned list lined up with a Cruzsupporting delegate according to NBC News Even without that mixup though Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his welloiled delegateselecting machine The Trump camp though appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the partys website and the printed materials distributed at the event Well do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC suggesting the campaign may challenge the results Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and ballotingTrump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name but hes far from assured of the majority of delegates hed need to win the nomination on the first ballot Given that reality the GOP frontrunner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the undertheradar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention If those efforts dont start paying dividends soon though Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegatesand leave without the nomination
