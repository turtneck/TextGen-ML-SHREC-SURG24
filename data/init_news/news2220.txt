  The election was set up to be stolen from Trump That was the purpose of the polls rigged by overweighting Hillary supporters in the samples After weeks of hearing poll results that Hillary was in the lead the public would discount a theft claim Electronic voting makes elections easy to steal and I have posted explanations by election fraud experts of how it is done Clearly the Oligarchy does not want Donald Trump in the White House as they are unsure that they could control him and Hillary is their agent With the reopening of the FBI investigation of Hillary and related scandals exploding all around her election theft is not only more risky but also less likely to serve the Oligarchys own interests Image as well as money is part of Oligarchic power The image of America takes a big hit if the American people elect a president who is currently under felony investigation Moreover a President Hillary would be under investigation for years With so much spotlight on her she would not be able to serve the Oligarchys interests She would be worthless to them and indeed investigations that unearthed various connections between Hillary and oligarchs could damage the oligarchs In other words for the Oligarchy Hillary has moved from an asset to a liability A Hillary presidency could put our country into chaos I doubt the oligarchs are sufficiently stupid to think that once she is sworn in Hillary can fire FBI Director Comey and shut down the investigation The last president that tried that was Richard Nixon and look where that got him Moreover the Republicans in the House and Senate would not stand for it House Committee on oversight and Government Reform chairman Jason Chaffetz has already declared Hillary to be a targetrich environment Even before we get to day one weve got two years worth of material already lined up House Speaker Paul Ryan said investigation will follow the evidence If you were an oligarch would you want your agent under this kind of scrutiny If you were Hillary would you want to be under this kind of pressure What happens if the FBI recommends the indictment of the president Even insouciant Americans would see the coverup if the attorney general refused to prosecute the case Americans would lose all confidence in the government Chaos would rule Chaos can be revolutionary and that is not good for oligarchs Moreover if reports can be believed salacious scandals appear to be waiting their time on stage For example last May Fox News reported Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the Lolita Express  even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by FoxNewscom Clintons presence aboard Jeffrey Epsteins Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including Tatiana The trickedout jet earned its Nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls Fox News reports that Epstein served time in prison for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on Orgy Island an estate on Epsteins 72acre island called Little St James in the US Virgin Islands httpwwwfoxnewscomus20160513flightlogsshowbillclintonflewonsexoffendersjetmuchmorethanpreviouslyknownhtml Some Internet sites the credibility of which is unknown to me have linked Hillary to these flights httptruepunditcombreakingbombshellnypdblowswhistleonnewhillaryemailsmoneylaunderingsexcrimeswithchildrenchildexploitationpaytoplayperjury This kind of behavior seems reckless even for Bill and Hillary who are accustomed to getting away with everything Nevertheless if you are an oligarch already worried about the reopened Hillary email case and additional FBI investigations such as the one into the Clinton Foundation and concerned about what else might emerge from the 650000 emails on former US Rep Weiners computer and the NYPD pedophile investigation putting Hillary in the Oval Office doesnt look like a good decision At this point I would think that the Oligarchy would prefer to steal the election for Trump instead of from him rather than allow insouciant Americans to destroy Americas reputation by choosing a person under felony investigations for president of the United States Being the exceptional nation takes on new meaning when there is a criminal at the helm Reprinted from PaulCraigRobertsorg by permission of author or representative
