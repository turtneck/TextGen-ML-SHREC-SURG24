Iran took a hard stance on two of the biggest demands of world powers in a final nuclear deal Thursday rejecting any extraordinary inspection rules and warning that if the US and other countries reimpose sanctions after the deal is done it will ramp up enrichment of bombmaking materialsA senior Iranian negotiator told reporters outside Vienna the UN nuclear agencys standard rules governing access to government information sites of interests and scientists should be sufficient to ensure that Irans program is solely for peaceful purposes Anything beyond that would be unfair he saidHowever the US and some other countries want Iran to take the extra stepWe should be realistic said the Iranian official who briefed members of the news media on condition he not be quoted by name The man also questioned the legitimacy of countries that dont accept the International Atomic Energy Agencys jurisdiction demanding that Iran be subject to tougher requirements than any other nation RIANovosti reported that Russia also backed Irans position that additional inspection guidelines for Iran werent necessaryThe official was making a clear reference to Israel a state widely presumed to maintain an undeclared nuclear arsenalThe marker is expected to be a cause for concern for the Obama administration and other world powers who are hoping to come to an agreement that would curb Irans atomic program for a decade in exchange for relief from crippling sanctionsThe hard stance from Iran comes as the head of the IAEA visited Tehran Thursday to deal with issues surrounding the deal and to seek clarification of possible military dimensions of programs The Wall Street Journal reportedI believe that both sides have a better understanding on some ways forward though more work will be needed DirectorGeneral Yukiya Amano said in a statementAmanos trip described by both western and Iranian officials as potentially important in unlocking a deal also covered the sensitive issue of access to military sites by IAEA inspectors The Journal reportedIran has committed to implementing the IAEAs additional protocol for inspections and monitoring as part of an accord The protocol gives the IAEA expanded access to declared and undeclared nuclear sites and to the sensitive information of more than 120 governments that accept its provisionsHowever the rules dont guarantee monitors dont guarantee monitors can enter any site they want to and offer no specific guidelines about sensitive military sites  an issue with Iran given the longstanding allegations of secret nuclear weapons work at its Parchin base near TehranInstead the agencys regulations allow governments to challenge such requests and offer alternative proposals for resolving concerns such as providing additional documents or access to nearby locationsFor that reason US officials maintain that rules for inspection must go beyond those laid out by the IAEA for all sides to come to an agreementEven as Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has defiantly rejected such access US officials have sought to differentiate between what Iranian officials were saying is for domestic consumption and what they were promising in the negotiating roomTehran says its program is solely for peaceful energy medical and research purposes but wants a deal to level the mountain sanctions that have crippled its economyPresident Obama has said the US would maintain its ability to snap sanctions back into place if Iran cheats as some officials dont trust Iran to hold up its end of the bargain Iran has said that ability goes two waysIf Iran is facing the reimposition of penalties and the US and its partners dont uphold their commitments to provide economic relief he said Iran has the right to go back to its program as it wishesThe official didnt spell out what that meant but Iran would have several options such as installing new centrifuges enriching uranium at levels closer to weaponsgrade or restarting activity with material that can be used in warheads where it has pledged to do no such thingHowever the official said the Islamic Republic would have no need to revert back to its previous capacities if the deal is favorableRussias deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said his government also opposes any automatic reimposition of international sanctions Russia and the United States are negotiating alongside Britain France Germany and ChinaThere were few public signs of progress as the highlevel negotiations entered a sixth day Thursday after diplomats blew through a June 30 deadline and extended an interim accord by a week Work was progressing albeit slowly officials saidNot at breakthrough moment yet British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond tweetedHammond had a morning
