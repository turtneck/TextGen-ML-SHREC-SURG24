Among these let me nominate one more listening to Hillary partisans explain to those of us who support Bernie Sanders just how naive we are Only Hillary we are told has a real shot atwinning in November Shes the only one with a realistic grasp of how Washington works whose moderate and modest policy aims might realistically be enacted It often sounds as if Clintons central pitch to voters isnt that she has a moral vision for the country but that she owns the franchise on realismBernie meanwhile is just a sweetshouting rube whose quartercentury as a congressman and senator has somehow failed to instill in him an appreciation for the twin plagues of grift and gridlockFor us benighted hippies the standard counterargument at this point is that our man understands all too well the magnitude of Washingtons dysfunction which is why hes calling for a political revolution to obliterate the most heinous aspects of the status quo starting with corporatesponsored electionsI happen to agree with this But theres a sadder and more pointed response to Hillarys reality brigade Namely that they need to face the reality of what the 2016 election is going to be like with Hillary at the top of the ticketBefore I outline that particular shitstorm let me issue a few suretobeignored and therefore pointless caveats First I myself was a Hillary supporter until Sanders entered the race More precisely until I read his policy positionsSecond I will enthusiastically support Hillary when and if she is nominated Years ago I interviewed the secretary and I say now what I said then She is a brilliant and compassionate public servant If presidential elections in this country were based on policy positions and moral intention on how each candidate hopes to solve common crises of state Clinton would win going awayAlas the reality is that Hillary is among the most hated politicians in America There is to begin with her dismal favorability rating which stands at 53 percent with a net negative of 12percent Sanders has a net positive of 12percentBut even more important isthe intensity of the animus against her and the sad mountain of baggage she carries with her as a candidateNo matter who the GOP nominee is the battle plan against Hillary will be the same a tawdry and unrelenting relitigation of all the phony scandals cooked up by the vast rightwing conspiracy that she identified nearly two decades agoCue up the Pearl Jam folks because were going all the way back to the 90s Whitewater Travelgate Troopergate Lewinskygate with a little Vince Foster Murdergate for a dash of blood But waitthose are just the golden oldies Youll also be hearing about the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Pardons Of course what respectable slander campaign would be complete without the new material Benghazi the private email server the Wall Street speechesThe dark corporate money and talented propagandists aligned against Hillary will make the Swift Boat Veterans look like toy soldiersAnd because our Fourth Estate is driven at this point almost entirely by the desperate promotion of scandal narratives and conflict every one of these paid attacks will be amplified by socalled free media or what us starryeyed hippies used to call journalismIm not blaming Hillary for this sad state of affairs Im just trying to bewhats the word Im looking for Ah yes here it isrealistic about how its going to go down Republicans tend to lose when they have to talk in specific terms about policies priorities and solutions They win when elections are reduced to brawls andor personality contests See ReaganCarter BushKerry et al But if Donald Trump is the nominee as seems most likely right now he will also enjoy two genuine lines of attack against Hillary The first is the same one Bernie just used to upset her in Michigan the fact that free trade pacts are wildly unpopular with many Americans Trump has been fullthroated and as usual somewhat full of shit in his condemnation of free trade and it has been one of his most successful pitches You can bet your bottom yen that hell hammer Hillary on this as if she personally whipped votes for NAFTA Hell excoriate various forms of crony capitalism deals cut with big pharma bogus military contracts etc that Democrats such as Hillary either endorsed or enabled through timidity And hell blast her for backing our trilliondollar boondoggle in Iraq too These accusations will be framed in terms of a larger narrative that Hillary represents business as usual in Washington that shes just another career pol beholden to the donor class and to the Wall Street swells who paid her millions to deliver her secret speeches Trump may be a sexually insecure adolescent with a penchant for inciting racial violence but the one undeniable aspect of his appeal is that he recognizes the toxic nature of the status quo and will by sheer force of personality bring it down This promise is about as flimsy as a Trump University diploma But its resonating with voters who feel Washingtons carnival of corruption is beyond redemption All of which brings us back to that credulous waif from Brooklyn by way of Ben and Jerrys Donald Trump can holler all he wants about how Crazy Bernie is a socialist But he and the super Pacs wont be able to distract voters by digging up scandals in his past Nor will Trump be able to portray him as a corporate stooge In fact the shocking success of the Sanders campaign is predicated on many of the same essential frustrations Trump is exploiting corporate influence wage stagnation trade This is why polls consistently show Sanders beating Trump more convincingly than Clinton does The right wing knows how to go after Hillary because theyve been doing so for 30years Within the media and a significant portion of the electorate the neural pathways have already been carved out Hillary is defensive programmed ethically suspect They are going to have a more difficult time smearing a candidate whose biggest liabilities are his extreme policy positions most of which sound more like a common sense corrective to the excesses of capitalism Higher taxes on corporations and the superwealthy Healthcare as a right A higher minimum wage Increased funding for education and infrastructure Good luck demonizing those positions Big Donald None of this is to suggest that Hillary wont beat Trump if they wind up as the nominees Nor that she wont be a great president But if Hillary supporters want to claim the mantle of realism they should start by accepting very real liabilities of their candidate
