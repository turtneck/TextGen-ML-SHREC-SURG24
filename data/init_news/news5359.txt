SE Cupp is the author of Losing Our Religion The Liberal Medias Attack on Christianity coauthor of Why Youre Wrong About the Right and a columnist at the New York Daily News The opinions expressed in this commentary are hersCNN This week I went to a meeting at Facebooks headquarters in Menlo Park California And then I became a bimbo a cancer and a scumbag Behold TwitterAnimal1984Farm secupp CNN facebook NeverTrump cucks are a cancer Some people love to be used and abusedIthePrattler secupp she is the EPITOME of everything thats wrong with the CORRUPT GOP edifice These scumbags help to keep in power the corrupt CNNTo be clear I am a conservative and these tweets are from other selfdescribed conservatives or at the very least Donald Trump supportersAs has become boringly predictable these days conservatives are mad at other conservatives for being fake conservativesIn case you have a life and havent cared to invest in the soapoperatic teenage dramas between certain factions of the conservative movement in which case Im envious let me give you the basic synopsisTrump is the only true conservative and everyone who opposes him is the establishmentQuestioning the Trump orthodoxy which incidentally is rarely intelligible if ever at all conservative is the thing that now makes a conservative a cuckservative a pejorative term to describe a weak emasculated sell out to the establishment wing of the party This now includes conservatives like me with previously pristine records of rightwing fanaticism at least as classified by the mainstream press and ranging from Glenn Beck to the National Review Ted Cruz to Paul RyanWhats this got to do with Facebook A lot it would seemIn this kind of climate where a lifelong Democrat and former Hillary Clinton donor is now the standardbearer of authentic conservatism and everyone else a loser and a traitor creating tribal lines of division is nothing short of a fetish and one that has spilled over into the Facebook debateAfter allegations surfaced that former Facebook contractors suppressed conservative trending topics the company launched an investigation promised transparency and then reached out to several conservative thought leaders and personalities including myself to sit down and address these and other concerns with founder Mark Zuckerberg and top members of his executive teamPresumably there would be two kinds of responses to this invitationI accept This is a disturbing issue and I want to be part of solving the problemOr I regretfully decline Thats the day of my grandmothers funeralIll get back to the importance of attending this meeting in a minute But firstI was surprised to learn there is apparently another option which was to refuse to go complain that no Trump representatives were invited they were one attended slam Facebooks overture as a pat conservatives on the head session blast the people who do attend as cucks and sit in the corner and sulkWhich is what a number of invitees decided disappointinglyBreitbart long in the tank for Trump said it had no interest in participating in a Facebook photo op One headline blared Cucked by Zuck Establishment Conservatives Rock Up for Pointless Meeting with Facebook already deciding the outcomeThe American Conservative Union which oversees the popular CPAC convention every year issued a statement saying it would not attend and then listed all of its grievances with Facebooks alleged anticonservative bias which included rejecting ACUs overtures for Facebook to play a meaningful role at CPACOther outlets jumped on the people who did decide to attend calling them conservatives in quotesIs the important story that Facebook is meeting with conservatives Or that its meeting with conservativesThis is not to suggest all of this is just about Trump The distrust of Facebook and Silicon Valley among conservatives is real and hardly new Most of the faces of the tech companies are outspoken liberals Facebook has in the past had to defend against allegations that conservatives and conservative stories dont get as much reach as liberal stories or as they do on other social platforms I understand skepticism Skepticism is my jobIm also not naive Of course this was part of a PR strategy for Facebook You dont publicly invite a group of aggrieved people with large platforms to come to your fabled sprawling campus and meet with the head honcho if you dont hope they will then go back to their large platforms and spread the good wordBut isnt the fact that Facebook considers this a PR problem as well as an actual problem I believe proof that it does not want to be perceived as a liberal organization If it really didnt care about attracting and retaining conservative users why would it need damage controlAnd if you have genuine concerns about bias and bad actors dont you take an opportunity to help correct a problemThe bottom line is staying home solves zero problems And in fact it creates oneMy reason for attending the meeting was twofold One I am deeply concerned about the effect of bias  whether intentional or subconscious  in alienating any group of people based on their beliefs in this case mineZuckerberg and his team assured us they were investigating that issue take it very seriously and do not have any evidence it is systemic The mission of Facebook is to provide as big a platform to as many people as possible Subverting voices is anathema to that mission as well as its business model more to the pointThis is a problem I hope it is addressed But I am frankly more concerned about conservatives longterm relationship with Silicon ValleyThe perception that Silicon Valley is liberal exists for a reason It largely is but only to the extent that anyone in tech ever gives politics a thought The tech worlds most vocal political voices lean left on social issues but your average programmer and developer are probably more libertarian than liberal And when pressed even your average executive would align more closely with the right on issues that are crucial to their own industryOn issues like security privacy regulation and free markets Silicon Valley has allies in conservative policies not liberal ones When I mentioned this in our meeting there was broad agreement from the Facebook side that liberals have at times been more than just a pain on these issues theyve been a threat to their best interestsSilicon Valley and in particular the share economy leaders need conservatives on the Hill on K Street and in the media to keep their markets free and their products innovative Tech leaders ignored this simple fact for years but are finally realizing Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton may share their attitudes on gay marriage but not regulation Which matters more to their bottom lineBut the questions the Facebookobjectors seem to be asking is Does conservatism need Facebook and Silicon Valley Well only if wants to surviveForgetting the fact that Facebook has 17 billion users and no one reads books or newspapers on paper anymore conservatives have been combating the image that they are stuck in the past for well as long as theres been a past to be stuck in Conservatives should be leading the way on innovation instead of constantly ceding that ground to the hipster progressives with their gadgets and watchphonesWhy we need FacebookInstead of insisting conservatism and Silicon Valley are East and West Berlin ideologically exclusive and wholly uninterested in one another both need to acknowledge each others necessity I went to this meeting because I want lifelong partnerships in Silicon Valley to connect conservative values and policies with as many people as possible to make the world work more efficiently to innovate around government bureaucracy and to empower the private sectorAnd I was pleasantly surprised to hear that Facebook wants partnerships with conservatives as well For that they will need our trust And to earn our trust we will need their respectThis is all a work in progress and it will take time open lines of communication and transparency But progress is impossible when parties decide to stay homeI was glad Facebook reached out to us and would have been just as happy had I not been included This meeting was a necessary step in the right direction  toward an alliance between two communities whose shared obsession with free markets could do a lot of good for a lot of people
