Washington CNN Donald Trumps vice presidential pick  Mike Pence has held wildly different views on trade Russia Iraq and Muslims than the billionaire businessmanThroughout his 16year political career the 57yearold Indiana governor has adhered to traditionally muscular Republican policies on foreign affairsTrump however has taken a more isolationist approach and placed less emphasis on foreign issues The issues that he has put at the center of his campaign are largely the ones he and his running mate disagree onTrump made his opposition to the Iraq intervention a major theme criticizing Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her 2002 vote backing the war when she was in the SenatePence near the beginning of his 12year tenure in the US House voted for the resolution authorizing the 2003 Iraq invasion as wellPence who chaired the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East was also a prominent backer of the 2007 surge strategy sending more US troops to the faltering effort in Iraq telling CNNs Wolf Blitzer at the time that the surge is working while also defending the original decision to invade despite the absence of weapons of mass destructionPence has also struck a harder line on Russia than Trump whose authoritarian president Vladimir Putin the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has praisedTrump asked an audience at a California rally in May Wouldnt it be nice if we could get along with Russia Wouldnt that be nicePence has opted for stronger rhetoric telling the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2015 that A new Iron Curtain is descending down the spine of Europe as modern Russia seeks to redraw the map of Europe by forceHe added Putins Russia ignores talk of sanctions claims land and supports rebels in Ukraine with impunityAnd Pence has previously taken issue with some of Trumps national security proposals calling his proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the US offensive and unconstitutional in a December tweetTrump has since refined the proposal saying it would only apply to citizens from countries with connections to terrorismPerhaps more than any other international issue Trump has made global trade a defining aspect of his campaign  yet Pence has taken a diametrically opposed positionThe real estate mogul has frequently called NAFTA which regulates trade between US Canada and Mexico a disaster During a Republican primary debate in February he declared We are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workersPence in contrast praised the role of global trade and slammed protectionism in a 2010 speech to the Detroit Economic ClubProtectionism and closing our doors to other countries does not help us or people in the rest of the world he said We must support expanded free trade to renew American exceptionalism and create jobsPence also backed free trade deals with Panama Colombia and South Korea while in CongressPotentially most problematic for Trump Pence has been a strong proponent of the TransPacific Partnership a regional trade deal involving 12 countries pushed by the Obama administrationThe TransPacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country  just a continuing rape of our country Its a harsh word but its true Trump said in a speech last month in OhioBut in a September 2014 tweet Pence gave the deal a ringing endorsement and called for its swift adoptionHowever the Indiana governor has found common ground with Trump on some national security issues  especially when it comes to criticizing President Barack ObamaLike Trump Pence has slammed Obama for reductions in the size of the American militaryShared stances on the size of the militaryThis administration has reduced our Army now its smallest size since 1940 The Navy has fewer ships than at any time since 1916 and our Air Force has its smallest tactical fighter force in history Pence said at the Conservative Political Action ConferenceOur activeduty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 13 million today The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time The Air Force is about onethird smaller than 1991 Trump saidThe Indiana governor has also echoed Trumps critique of the Presidents preferred terminology for terrorist groupsLecturing the American people about the crusades while refusing to call Islamic extremism by name is an abdication of leadership Pence told CPACThey also largely agree on Israel  nowadaysPence is an avid backer of the Middle Eastern ally telling the CPAC audience Israels cause is our cause and voicing approval of the decision by thenHouse Speaker John Boehner to invite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress to lobby against the Iran nuclear deal the White House was then negotiating with TehranTrump has also blasted the deal and has recently staked out an aggressively proIsrael stanceIsrael is a very very important ally of the United States and we are going to protect them 100 he said last week rebuffing an audience members criticism of the countryBut last winter Trump was castigated by many Republicans for declining to promise to keep Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel He also said peace would depend on whether Israel is willing to make sacrifices and that he would remain neutral in negotiations
